1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,980
Two one

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,270
fight companion 2016 returns ladies
and gentlemen wide from Salt Lake City.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,580
Yeah,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,390
year Rodriguez vs Alex Caceres.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,800
All real slobber.

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,850
Knocker a slobber knocker with me here.

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,320
If you've never heard the
fight companion before,

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:19,560
you're like,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,140
oh great.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,410
A pot.

11
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:20,590
What,

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,810
what was a fight companion?

13
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,210
It's sort of a podcast.

14
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,690
Um,

15
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:24,900
it's,

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,010
it is definitely a podcast,

17
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,520
but we're sort of watching the
fights and calling the fights,

18
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,620
but probably most likely not that much,

19
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,430
but it's fun and the
nonsense meter hits red hot.

20
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,350
It gets his highs.

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,950
It ever get ever in the history of us age.

22
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,930
Uberize here you did Eddie Bravo.

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:43,741
Hello.

24
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,820
Fresh out of recovery.

25
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,800
His fucking back is beautiful.

26
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,440
Amazing gentleman is some
fucking new technology going on.

27
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:53,790
A Bravo has displaced and we were going
to get to that Brian Calendars here.

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,840
Lean Shaven,

29
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,130
clean shaven,

30
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,020
all Kopi shit out.

31
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Look beautiful.

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,500
Thanks buddy.

33
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,680
Brendan motherfucking
job isn't the biggest,

34
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:12,420
strongest guy in the room and
handsome and young shit low.

35
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,273
That's right.

36
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,610
I got to show you guys something because
yesterday changed my fucking world.

37
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,570
Okay.

38
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,620
I did Duncan [inaudible] Duncan
Duncan trussell's podcast,

39
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,640
and he introduced me to the
world of virtual reality goggles.

40
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,010
Ho Lee Shit.

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,300
I'm going to show you something,

42
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,350
going to show you this game.

43
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,510
This is a boxing game.

44
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,070
Look up in the upper left hand corner.

45
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,120
All right.

46
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,110
This is a boxing game.

47
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,230
So I have these gloves on and
it's kind of wacky because a,

48
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,920
the gloves aren't the way you punch your,

49
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,430
you're holding onto these handles and I'm,

50
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm fighting this,

51
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,410
this Russian boxing coach.

52
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:49,890
Dude,

53
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,910
you're punching looks good.

54
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,630
It's okay.

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,310
But here's what's goofy about it.

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,980
In order for your fist to B level,

57
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,150
like parallel with the ground,

58
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,470
you have to hold them like this.

59
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,300
Like a joy stick.

60
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,491
Yeah.

61
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,600
So you're looking at your,

62
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,081
like,

63
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,550
if you're holding your hands like this,

64
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,650
I sold in your hands with your,

65
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,340
uh,

66
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,270
like your,

67
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:06,780
your,

68
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,180
the,

69
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,440
the heel of your hand facing the
ground and your songs up in the air.

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,920
Right?

71
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,820
Like your skiing's.

72
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,740
That's if you're holding
your hands like that,

73
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,560
your punches are parallel with the floor.

74
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,160
Okay.

75
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,210
So it's,

76
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,103
it's twisted.

77
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,180
Oh yeah.

78
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,300
They should make it so that you could
hold your hand like an actual punch.

79
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,511
Right.

80
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,160
So like wherever your hands are,

81
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,150
that's where your gloves are.

82
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,880
So I'm holding it like this
and I'm punching like this.

83
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,040
It's real weird cause you're not,

84
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
it looks like really good exercise though.

85
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,310
Is that a prototype shop by the,

86
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,600
by that there's a bunch of
games for these things now.

87
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,500
But here's my point.

88
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,350
I was moving around this guy like,

89
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,790
like he's throwing punches at me.

90
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,391
I'm moving around.

91
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,710
I kept hitting him in
the back of the head.

92
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,320
I would sneak around behind him and beat
him in the back of her head and upper

93
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,330
cut them and I'm,

94
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:50,941
I'm doing this.

95
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,300
And I'm like,

96
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,961
oh my foot words.

97
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:52,531
All awkward.

98
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,490
I didn't know what I was doing.

99
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,590
I felt weird like I'm
in this virtual world.

100
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,150
But after I did it a few times,

101
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:58,170
I started to get the feeling of it.

102
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:58,650
I'm like,

103
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,230
this is an amazing shadow boxing programs.

104
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,950
But he's sick.

105
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,620
That's amazing.

106
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,480
I think you can do more tie with it too.

107
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,730
I think you could have it so
that you could throw kicks,

108
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,170
because it was getting me,

109
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,680
it was getting all my movement from these
two cameras that Dunkin has set up in

110
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,281
the room there,

111
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,390
motion detectors,

112
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,350
so the cameras,

113
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,880
they scan you when you're standing there
and then they build a perimeter around

114
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,800
you and there's a blue line on the ground.

115
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,870
You look down and you're
in this three d world,

116
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,340
but you see this blue line on the ground.

117
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:27,250
You can't go pass that Blue Line because
that's the amount of free space that

118
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,001
you have in your area.

119
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,770
Wow.

120
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,440
Wow.

121
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,273
Can you imagine?

122
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,280
You could download the opponent you're
going to fight and they can come shadow

123
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,901
box against.

124
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:34,660
Exactly.

125
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,530
That's exactly

126
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,883
what he was saying.

127
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,910
If you could make a a
training simulation of a god,

128
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,330
you could fight him a hundred times
before you ever actually fight him.

129
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,780
That when I was seeing
him in front of you,

130
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,321
and I'm telling you,

131
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:50,770
man,

132
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,440
what I was looking at
was kind of cartoonish.

133
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,570
Like this Russian boxing guys [inaudible]
he's got a wife beater on and headgear

134
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,851
and shit.

135
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,601
It's kind of cartoonish,

136
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,790
but it doesn't have to be,

137
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,040
right.

138
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,530
It's only cartoonish now.

139
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,400
Like you could get to a point within a
few years where you know you're going to

140
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,360
be boxing and it looks exactly like
Joe Schilling and has his tendencies,

141
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:10,600
you know,

142
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,380
big of a deal.

143
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,981
That would be,

144
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,680
you can do that can be
a big of an advantage.

145
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,523
That's insane.

146
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,340
Certainly be a great
training tool often Stein,

147
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,170
but we got a ways to go look at it.

148
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:20,561
This is,

149
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,490
this is what it looks like.

150
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,761
See,

151
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,211
so your,

152
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:22,480
your,

153
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,260
your gloves.

154
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,030
It's weird like you have to kind of
turn your gloves fucky so that they look

155
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,230
normal on the screen.

156
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,920
Right.

157
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880
But other than that,

158
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,020
it's Kinda dope.

159
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,130
It's fun to do.

160
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,910
And I'll tell you what,

161
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,180
this isn't nearly as fun
as the archery program.

162
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,560
There was an archery one.

163
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:43,561
When you're in a castle and you all
a roof and you hear and he's fucking

164
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,250
warriors come storming at you and they
have helmets on and they have shields and

165
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,810
you're shooting arrows at them.

166
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,740
Sounds send you.

167
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,790
And you have,

168
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,520
it's the same handles though,

169
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:54,820
right?

170
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,140
Or do you have the same goofy hand?

171
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,590
Yeah,

172
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,861
but,

173
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,630
but there's haptic feedback.

174
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,280
So this is the archery
one that I was playing.

175
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,890
Those graphics are fucking tough too.

176
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,270
It's like an a tall,

177
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,510
it's like Nintendo 64 but I'm telling you,

178
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,610
it's because you're dealing with massive
amounts of rendering in real time,

179
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,870
360 degrees,

180
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,763
up and down.

181
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,240
And these are all new things,

182
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,380
but you get to use them.

183
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,750
But I was jacking these motherfuckers up.

184
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,913
Oh Hey,

185
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,320
I was giving some angle on horseback.

186
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,760
I am so,

187
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,211
it's weird.

188
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:26,530
So when you pull the bow back,

189
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,700
there's no resistance,

190
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,620
but there's this vibration,

191
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,630
it's like shaking as you pull it back.

192
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,870
So it really feels like you're pulling
it back and then it gets to the point

193
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,531
where it's locked out.

194
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,830
You feel it like click
as a fucking cool dude.

195
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,664
It's dope.

196
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,360
I shot,

197
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,260
I shot this stupid fucking game
until my arms were so sore.

198
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,130
They were shaking.

199
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,990
I was gonna say homes now video.

200
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,960
Now gamers are probably going
to look like MMA fighters,

201
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,701
or at least runners.

202
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,391
They're gonna be in shape.

203
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:52,931
But I think,

204
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,201
man,

205
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,180
if you remember last
dance dance revolution,

206
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:55,550
kids,

207
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,540
hell that we're losing like
30 pounds on dance dance.

208
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,030
Okay.

209
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,110
First fight is on.

210
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,460
It's between two ladies.

211
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,211
Uh,

212
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,470
we do not have the names yet.

213
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:03,740
Jay.

214
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,880
Jay Mckee pull up the card.

215
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,600
So we'll uh,

216
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,350
let people know.

217
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,810
So I've seen this tall woman fight in a,

218
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,990
I think tough round one of three.

219
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:13,850
It's at four 43,

220
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,720
two one zero harmful rash guy.

221
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,771
Yeah.

222
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:19,011
You know,

223
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,420
they've just passed new rules today.

224
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,540
They're going to make women
wear a tight fitting clothing.

225
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,090
They're not going to allow a
loose fitting clothing worn loose.

226
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,910
This girl's got shorts.

227
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:29,511
I mean,

228
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,350
how tied of those,

229
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,780
I think they should all wear spend X.

230
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,200
I think mentioned too,

231
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,730
I've seen guys grab shorts.

232
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,420
You have to,

233
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,320
if you go back to the chill
son and Anderson Silva
fight is a famous picture of

234
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,530
Anderson Silva straps on
short round check Congo.

235
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,191
I feel,

236
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,800
I feel like last year alone,

237
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,220
I feel like women have
gotten exponentially better.

238
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,830
Oh yeah,

239
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,660
that's true.

240
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:50,931
Well,

241
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,420
there's some fucking
jacked in that picture.

242
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,751
Okay.

243
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,210
So we got married.

244
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,190
Mary now Ma Marina,

245
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,590
marina morrows.

246
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,690
Is it marina marina and
marina and Danielle Taylor
and Ukraine or lady is a lot

247
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,750
of women from the Ukraine.

248
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:08,961
Man.

249
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,480
A lot of us say some hard
ass Soviet bloc women.

250
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,500
It will come from those fucking
boxing programs to Valentina shift.

251
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,410
Chanko the woman who just beat Holly Holm,

252
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,570
she,

253
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,400
she's so solid,

254
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:19,850
man.

255
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,070
Man,

256
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,150
she's so solid.

257
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,340
You can be trouble for lunch.

258
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,300
She's got it in her DNA where she's
throwing them spinning back fist calendar.

259
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,660
She's got that down better than anybody,

260
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,390
right?

261
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,550
Yes.

262
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,700
She does everything man.

263
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,960
She does that real good.

264
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,870
She's got that sweet
counter right hook pull.

265
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,280
She saw that girl's a multiple
time Moy Thai champion.

266
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,970
So like the girls are going to give her
problems are not the girls like Holly

267
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,211
girls like Holly,

268
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:49,160
like Holly's gonna like stand there and
strike with there and Valentina has so

269
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,480
much fucking striking experience.

270
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,390
The girls were going to give shift Chanko
problems with the girls were going to

271
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,560
be looking to tanker down.

272
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,394
She's a good password,

273
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,850
Kate.

274
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,151
Yeah,

275
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,580
well girls not going to
just stand in front of her.

276
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,730
The girl's going to present a bunch
of options like Misha Tate is,

277
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,500
you know Misha Tate.

278
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,780
The striking would be an issue is she?

279
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,310
Yeah,

280
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,080
she,

281
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,350
the child scramble.

282
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,800
Her assets can shift Chanko ship
tango can wrestle really well.

283
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:13,800
Fucking strong as shit.

284
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:14,331
She's strong.

285
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,280
She's not like Ameesha is
loves far as grappling.

286
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,410
But when she fought Sarah
Kaufman and her first fight,

287
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,370
she out grappled her.

288
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
It was almost like I did.

289
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,010
She's a Pfizer with the date.

290
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,330
She did surprise and I think she and she
took that photo 500 super short notice

291
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,730
if I remember what she's a beast man.

292
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,770
I feel like Holly's hesitant lately.

293
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,143
Hey Man,

294
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,690
no joke dude.

295
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:33,890
Fuck.

296
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,110
She called crap with
that counter right hook.

297
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,760
That lead counter hook.

298
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,310
She kept taking her head
off the sound line and just

299
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,250
was Holly though?

300
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,660
Yeah.

301
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,090
Yeah,

302
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,750
she has.

303
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,750
But don't you think that Holly is in more
of a boxing world but she's a 19 time

304
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,200
boxing champion?

305
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,700
Like Holly's boxing,

306
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,270
like as far as her footwork or speed or
movement especially are counters like

307
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,510
when someone should count
it after she's brilliant.

308
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,433
Counter striker.

309
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,090
I feel like Holly is the fastest,

310
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,840
probably the fastest Stryker as far as
just being able to get her shots off,

311
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,770
like if you were at a time.

312
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,600
She said when she throws
to somebodies face,

313
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,740
she's certainly fast,

314
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:14,620
but I mean in her weight class
maybe she's the fastest is going,

315
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,490
huh?

316
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,040
You don't want to shut your fucking mouth.

317
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,810
You ever seen you want to do those videos
on Twitter where her trainers holding

318
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,550
pads and she's ripping into him?

319
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:23,681
Yeah,

320
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,080
it's fake dude.

321
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,640
She's insane.

322
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,110
She's the best striker in there.

323
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,120
Jamie.

324
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,440
Jamie,

325
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,530
if you could pull some of those up,

326
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,430
if you could try this
even even among guys,

327
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,140
that's a huge thing to say.

328
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,031
Well,

329
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,190
I would say Wonderboy
would argue with that.

330
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:41,970
You know,

331
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,460
would say that there's a few other
fighters that are just strikers over and

332
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,150
being k one Grand Prix champion.

333
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,290
But you know what man?

334
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,760
You want it just like what
the real problem is like
saying she's the best or at

335
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:54,800
one person's the best.

336
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:55,920
Like it's so subjective,

337
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,480
especially if they'd never
gonna fight each other.

338
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,740
Right?

339
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
We all love to do it.

340
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,740
It all depends.

341
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,040
A caliber of person you're
fighting to watch this live this,

342
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,580
she's doing these sprawls and then
she's getting up fire combinations.

343
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,440
You look at pure technique though,

344
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:07,651
man.

345
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,420
She's a fucking nightmare.

346
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,290
Oh Dude.

347
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,420
She's so sharp in the fight too.

348
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,230
Yeah,

349
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,480
she's super don't see over
in with that same technique.

350
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:15,841
Granted,

351
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,070
he's a k one world champion.

352
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,671
Well,

353
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,420
it's different too,

354
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,550
but he wanted to compare 115 pound girl,

355
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,430
202 Gilliam pound man and kind of tough.

356
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,820
He smoked junior dos Santos with
one shot to Kilian bound that.

357
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,391
I don't know why.

358
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,224
That's funny to me.

359
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,650
He smoked junior dos Santos one left hook.

360
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,080
I mean Alistair Overeem is a beast.

361
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,400
Yes,

362
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,810
he's a beast of the beast.

363
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,350
It's a hard,

364
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,130
it's hard to look at him the same way
you look at anybody else because first of

365
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,341
all,

366
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,830
he's in a division where anyone connects,

367
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,880
everybody goes night night,

368
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,450
right?

369
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,080
Correct.

370
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,700
It's like it's such finding different,

371
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:51,530
such a totally different kind of see
his technique because at one of his jabs

372
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,500
we'll knock him the fuck out.

373
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,050
So you don't see five rounds of
over him like you do with y'all.

374
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,850
Like y'all will go the distance and her
technique will be flawless from minute

375
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,460
one in the first round to
minute one in the neck.

376
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,911
You know what I'm saying?

377
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:07,260
But she can also tend to be somebody at
that size can afford to be and take more

378
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:09,810
chances and actually
standing in the pocket and,

379
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,441
and throw out.

380
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,030
Whereas you guys at your weight,

381
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,870
you gotta be so careful because
one mistake the market is,

382
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,350
I got other,

383
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,630
I'm saying heavyweights one,

384
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,473
the margin for error.

385
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,070
It seems like it's so much smaller.

386
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
Hundred percent you're totally right.

387
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,823
100% Brian.

388
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,750
I think that these guys,

389
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,240
you know,

390
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,420
you're looking at like Ben Rothwell,

391
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,590
like Ben Rothwell knocked out over him
and the first round and now Overeem was

392
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,670
going to be fighting.

393
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,020
So the title against steeping,

394
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,200
but Ben Rothwell just got like a full
five round beating by junior dos.

395
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,320
Santos dealt with Juno
sentos boxes face off.

396
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:43,950
It was crazy.

397
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,150
It was like the best junior has looked
in you and kicked him front kick and then

398
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,520
you gotta think that
Alister knocked down junior.

399
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,600
Mm.

400
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,051
MMM.

401
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,220
Math and the heavyweight
division is bananas.

402
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,880
Yup.

403
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,600
There's silly,

404
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,321
super silly.

405
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:56,620
Yeah.

406
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,060
Everyone is so powerful.

407
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,260
Everyone is so big like Steve Bay
knocking out for doom like that.

408
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,650
Jesus Christ.

409
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,360
Nothing,

410
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,790
nothing crazy ass division
in the craziest sport.

411
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,010
And it's also an older division.

412
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,770
That's what's amazing to me to
meet any young heavyweight tour,

413
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,890
2122 like that age,

414
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,980
even in the mix,

415
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,470
tell you who everybody should be.

416
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,970
Despain taking their,

417
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,510
uh,

418
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,500
putting their attention on it.

419
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,190
And I guess,

420
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,023
yeah,

421
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,870
go ahead,

422
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,530
Derek Lewis.

423
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,640
Frances can know.

424
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,451
Oh,

425
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:25,701
he talking,

426
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,460
you talking about the camera ruined dude.

427
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,930
Who's a to plaintiff's d dude whimsy him.

428
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,640
Drabble did.

429
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,851
Did,

430
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,061
did,

431
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:33,261
did,

432
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:34,210
did Cameroon.

433
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,721
Dude,

434
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,270
he's a fucking powerful man.

435
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,800
He looks like straight Predator.

436
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,640
I am telling you when that dude moves
in on guys and he throws bombs on them,

437
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm just,

438
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,330
I'm waiting for a really solid opponent
for him because like we have not seen

439
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,281
him test.

440
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,380
He's fought all scrubs.

441
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,120
We have and starched.

442
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:52,361
Yeah.

443
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,740
We have not seen him tested,

444
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,680
but I'll type out,

445
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,500
I'm telling you.

446
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,750
And he's got very sharp technique.

447
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,673
How old is he?

448
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,370
He's young.

449
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,120
He's 28 28 how old is he?

450
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,380
28 young.

451
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,030
It's in the heavyweight division.

452
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,883
Shawn,

453
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,040
I think in the heavyweight division.

454
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,060
Guys just need more time.

455
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,260
No,

456
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,440
29 29 damnit.

457
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,140
Third.

458
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,471
Yeah,

459
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,550
he'll be 30 in September.

460
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,384
Actually.

461
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,070
He's a monster though.

462
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,760
He's,

463
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,593
I think you know,

464
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,680
he's in his prime for sure.

465
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,221
Like as a,

466
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:21,820
as an athlete.

467
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,850
We don't know what him first.

468
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:26,980
Derrick Lewis with the BBC that Derrick
Lewis looks so good in that Roy Nelson

469
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:27,340
fight.

470
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,031
God Damn,

471
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:28,631
he looks tough.

472
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:29,381
Fight to man.

473
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:30,250
You look good man.

474
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,930
It's combinations were fast.

475
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,531
He was,

476
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,450
he looked like really improved.

477
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:34,541
Like,

478
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:34,820
you know,

479
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,370
you see a guy fight and you go,

480
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:36,731
Whoa,

481
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,260
this guy hit another level.

482
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,600
Like that's how it was he the guy
who got knocked out by Mitzrian?

483
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,380
Yes.

484
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,621
Yeah,

485
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,061
we were in the,

486
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,330
he just wasn't ready for that.

487
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,410
But that Roy Nelson is a huge step
and to go three rounds with Roy,

488
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,190
there couldn't be a better thing for
his career because he's just starching

489
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:51,491
guys,

490
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,450
you don't learn shit.

491
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:52,841
Trust me,

492
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:53,680
you don't learn shit.

493
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,330
And then you go three rounds with a vet.

494
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,020
Like Roy.

495
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,640
I was just so impressed with his
combinations is most impressive.

496
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,281
So like wow.

497
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,590
The way he's putting it
together and his endurance too.

498
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,190
Cause I thought it was just a meathead
like throwing bombs but down for a lot

499
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
with you look at his
previous sites kind of like,

500
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:07,860
all right.

501
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,460
He's just a big powerful guy.

502
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:09,651
Yeah.

503
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:10,271
You went through at hand.

504
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,140
The guy's going to sleep,

505
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,360
but you look at Roy like shitty
splitting combos together,

506
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:13,541
man.

507
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:13,720
Yeah,

508
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,553
he was carted.

509
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,360
Oh He,

510
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,530
uh,

511
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,110
he put real good combination
so you can see him for sure.

512
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:20,944
Boy,

513
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,210
the Predator,

514
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,510
the,

515
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,040
that would be a very interesting fight.

516
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,670
Uh,

517
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,950
he's had much more experience against,

518
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,340
uh,

519
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,380
like higher level guys,

520
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,101
I guess you'd say.

521
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:30,460
Right.

522
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,360
Mitre own.

523
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,800
And now Roy Nelson,

524
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,490
but Mitchell and stuff can
you got starched so didn't
get a lot of experience.

525
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,960
He didn't really learn as true.

526
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,810
But how many fights is
Derek had now in the UFC?

527
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,730
I to say four.

528
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,760
Five fibers.

529
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,703
Right.

530
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,430
The thing is with both those guys,

531
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,450
if you give them,

532
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,261
you know,

533
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,250
cause we can get the top,

534
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,210
not every guy's going to
sit there and bang with you.

535
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,601
Right.

536
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,470
You can get a wrestler.

537
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,710
See,

538
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,511
but the thing about good,

539
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,730
no is his Moy Tai.

540
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,101
What,

541
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:59,690
what makes me super interested in him,

542
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,411
not just his,

543
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,244
his speed,

544
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,300
his size,

545
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,130
his ability to put guys away.

546
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:04,970
Like what we're seeing.

547
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,260
I mean he puts guys away,

548
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,780
but it's also the way
you're watching a movie.

549
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,990
Very like fluid athlete.

550
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,400
Like when he's doing things,

551
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,440
everything's f shoes and he throws
blooded hard fucking kicks man.

552
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,660
The only x factor with
him as the grappling.

553
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,021
Yeah.

554
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,800
So he's had,

555
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,630
so Derek's had four more wins.

556
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,850
He beat Gavriel Gunza Gabriel Gonzaga.

557
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,230
He beat a Grabowski and he'd beat
up Victor Becka before he fought.

558
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,450
Nelson looks good man.

559
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,500
He looks real good dude.

560
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,000
Real good for or fight win streak
and getting wins over Gonzaga Nelson.

561
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:38,540
Too Bad.

562
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,580
Remember that fight was Shawn Jordan too,

563
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,340
but I think Shawn Jordan
Hook kicked him in the head.

564
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,390
Yeah did.

565
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,310
That was crazy.

566
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,510
It's crazy that a short
time anybody has ever,

567
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,860
and he's a huge guy,

568
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,530
but the first time anybody ever like
hey owed somebody with a hook kick.

569
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,364
I don't think so.

570
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,490
Did he change your like you did maybe.

571
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,300
Wow.

572
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,470
Great guy though.

573
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:57,981
Really Nice.

574
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:58,820
Calm like and he was,

575
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,490
he's short for heavyweight man.

576
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,340
A large man.

577
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,270
He's a tank though.

578
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,850
What does he play?

579
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,261
Football.

580
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,070
Lsu Full back on the
national championship.

581
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,021
By the way.

582
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,160
You can do back flips.

583
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,090
Why he's to 60 does a bad fucking sticks.

584
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:12,330
It stupid.

585
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,920
He's nice as fuck.

586
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,380
It was anti Greg.

587
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,070
What's up?

588
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,230
What is it easier to become?

589
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,260
UNTAKE downable as a heavyweight or
as a lightweight or a welterweight?

590
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,180
Probably depending on who you're asking.

591
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
Guys at heavyweight,

592
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,650
there's more technical.

593
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,610
There's a lot of us.

594
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,490
There's a lot less,

595
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,140
uh,

596
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,890
explosive.

597
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,191
Guys,

598
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,530
I'm gonna take you down with explorer,

599
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,530
so it promo,

600
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,090
it's harder to disagree with that.

601
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,700
There's some explosive fucking guys,

602
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,060
that heavyweight man stuff taking shots.

603
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,590
There's this Russian dude who's going
to join the ranks of MMA after the

604
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,424
Olympics.

605
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,563
You know what I'm talking about?

606
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,310
You're talking to
Russian heavyweight dude,

607
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,260
not Carella and just put,

608
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,110
pull this book on motherfucker up style.

609
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,140
Everybody.

610
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,030
Everybody's fine.

611
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,830
Everybody's Russian scientific
experiments and live in Siberia.

612
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,420
Dude is so good.

613
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,650
He's so technical and so
fucking stupid strong.

614
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,520
He's freestyle.

615
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,000
Freestyle is fucking
take downs are ruthless.

616
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,440
He runs through guys.

617
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,491
He just keeps it there.

618
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:13,630
George,

619
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,490
to keep running backwards
just keeps running for you.

620
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,461
Just trip.

621
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,520
But I'm hitting one take
down after the neck.

622
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,350
Various Cain Velasquez pull up video
homeboy and gave me his full name.

623
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:27,140
He didn't want to butcher his name
here and a peep out of any wrestler.

624
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,220
He comes up against k.

625
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,510
Well MMAs dude,

626
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,800
friend Billy bill.

627
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,710
Ya'll McAvoy.

628
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,051
Hey Brian.

629
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:36,690
How do you say that?

630
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,730
I would say I would.

631
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,670
I would say Billy Al
Macoff bill got disability.

632
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:43,460
I'll go [inaudible].

633
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,010
So why watch this motherfucker wrestle?

634
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,950
He's so fucking fast and so big.

635
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,581
He's too nice.

636
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,414
So strong.

637
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,350
And when he gets to MMA,

638
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,550
when he gets to MMA,

639
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,820
he's running through mother fuckers.

640
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,670
You are not,

641
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,120
you are not stopping.

642
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,011
Take down.

643
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,830
This is not happening for sure.

644
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,010
He's going to I yes,

645
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:05,100
100% a hundred percent it.

646
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:05,341
Dude.

647
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:06,030
I'm telling you,

648
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,890
he's just going to be
throwing dudes around.

649
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:11,640
They're not going to know what the fuck
to do you know how it is Joe it MMA

650
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,320
wrestling is different than
what he's doing though.

651
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,221
Oh yeah,

652
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:14,551
for sure.

653
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,900
It looked he's going to have more trouble.

654
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,300
There's going to be guys who
figured out how to push them off.

655
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,500
They're going to be more defensive.

656
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,210
These guys are forced to engage with them.

657
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:21,750
Right.

658
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,850
There's gonna be guys that are
not gonna wanna engage at all.

659
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,330
So they're going to
have much more distance.

660
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:26,700
They're doing are going
to be easy to take down.

661
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,151
That's right.

662
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,800
And even when even when you do
take them down and joy that yeah,

663
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,830
cause a lot of problems.

664
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,600
He's got problems.

665
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
He's not going to fight.

666
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,050
We're doing right off the bat obviously.

667
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,470
No,

668
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,560
he's getting on that Derrick
Lewis and the Francisca no track.

669
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,460
And by the way,

670
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,990
who's to say this guy can't punch off
fucking hole through your universe?

671
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,780
I'm not saying he can't
look at the way he's built.

672
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,860
I bet that guy took it throw
fucking hammers and know
who's to say he's not been

673
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,810
boxing anyway since he was eight.

674
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,171
Listen,

675
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,090
if he's rushing hearing for the UFC,

676
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,190
is this him right here?

677
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,530
Yup.

678
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,311
Oh don't show me.

679
00:18:59,311 --> 00:18:59,990
This is terrible.

680
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,823
Goddammit

681
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,000
elbows in Sir.

682
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,700
He's just shadowboxing.

683
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,960
I want to see him hit something stiff
is fucked you guys' hands or his wrists.

684
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,830
It's like he's trying to grab people
as he's punching him for the record.

685
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:14,790
I'm not the one laughing.

686
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,370
How's going to say I'm this much

687
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,620
waste throwing some punches.

688
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,454
Great.

689
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,211
Yeah.

690
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,250
See he such a big fucking gorilla though.

691
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,450
He could just haymaker on you.

692
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,284
It's true.

693
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,600
He could be on that Brock Lesnar say fuck.

694
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,100
Strike and check this double leg.

695
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,520
He's definitely got to
work on his kicks too,

696
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,480
but hey man,

697
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,530
he's a super athlete.

698
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:34,681
Yeah,

699
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,490
that's doable.

700
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,323
Dammit.

701
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,770
Timing's off so bad.

702
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,800
Who knows how long ago
this is and by the way,

703
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,840
he probably could get better in a month.

704
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,400
Like bring him to Duane Ludwig.

705
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,581
Yeah,

706
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,170
his learning curve is probably,

707
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,831
oh yeah,

708
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:47,101
man.

709
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:49,860
I know he's such a c should
fly right to AK right now.

710
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:50,221
I'm just like,

711
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:50,830
what's up?

712
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,031
You know,

713
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,440
he's a fucking super athlete,

714
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:52,651
man.

715
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:53,490
Look at the size of this.

716
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,393
Fuck.

717
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,960
I might like seven,

718
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:58,491
eight j.

719
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,180
We help big as this fucking gorilla.

720
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,460
Oh my God.

721
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,860
In six five two 96 it's
a huge fucking Christ.

722
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,560
How?

723
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,560
How's it going to get
to to 65 and it's all,

724
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,300
you saw the test better than the Olympics.

725
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,590
You saw us going to be sniffing his ass.

726
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,570
[inaudible] muscle,

727
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,280
probably on some straight
fucking Russian manipulation.

728
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,880
He's out of a moon rock from teenage
bean ninjas so far ahead of the curve.

729
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,450
They don't even need steroids.

730
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,140
They just put this dude in like one
of them easy big microwave ovens.

731
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,270
He's like,

732
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,780
Bang Ben,

733
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,830
good luck with that.

734
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,950
Fucking dude is a big guy.

735
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,350
Just wrestling in the problem is like,

736
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:43,621
okay,

737
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,650
say he does get down to two 65 and then
he starts fighting and MMA and if he's

738
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:51,630
to 90 I don't know if he competes it to
90 well he's a heavyweight alpha he has

739
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,240
to lose anyway.

740
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,840
Right.

741
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,220
So maybe if he just watches his diet
and incorporates more striking and it's

742
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,330
running and shit like that,

743
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,870
he might get down to two
70 anyway and just use,

744
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,140
so the slide under.

745
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:02,770
Yeah,

746
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,430
there's a skin though.

747
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,400
The steam room was a couple of 10 pounds.

748
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,270
He's going to be that hard.

749
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,740
I got that guy takes 10 pounds,

750
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:09,670
shits he a,

751
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,100
he has a long road ahead of them.

752
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:12,611
Either way.

753
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:13,090
Yeah.

754
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,923
Well he does,

755
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,520
but she know what man,

756
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,580
guys that become like that level world
champion at anything that's combat sport

757
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:21,820
related.

758
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,690
They figure it out,

759
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:22,961
man.

760
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,320
I look at DC DC's a perfect example.

761
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,920
The case,

762
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,790
a monster,

763
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,810
perfect example.

764
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,010
Yeah.

765
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,890
I kind of work ethic.

766
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,980
I wouldn't DC's not physically.

767
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,660
You know this bill posey though.

768
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:34,870
Yeah.

769
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,280
And posing and I'll look at what this,

770
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,630
I don't want this guy hitting me.

771
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,490
You don't want this guy
hitting you with this.

772
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,320
You might be stiff,

773
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:41,950
dude.

774
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,560
This is a big motherfucker.

775
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,070
You do not want this guy hitting you.

776
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,170
I'm telling you man.

777
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,441
I mean,

778
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,960
he's not even doing it like perfectly yet.

779
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,880
He's off his feet when he's punching.

780
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,260
He's not sitting down enough.

781
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,910
He's not torquing his hips enough.

782
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:57,070
But good luck.

783
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,050
If you take one of those on the chin,

784
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,880
that's a big fucking dude,

785
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,320
man.

786
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,520
Yeah,

787
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,890
he's getting a lot of people prompts.

788
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,190
I mean like if you look at the
way he's striking like fluidity,

789
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,410
you want to look at like a big fluid guy.

790
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
Look at Rico Verhoeven,

791
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,051
Rico,

792
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:11,884
Vera,

793
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,090
Laurie heavyweight champion.

794
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,421
Yeah,

795
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,380
he's doing both,

796
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,040
right?

797
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
He's gonna Fight 'em Badr Hari though.

798
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,843
But Rico,

799
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,940
see if you get a clip
of that guy fighting,

800
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,840
he's,

801
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,411
he's like,

802
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,860
what you want to see when you look
at like a heavyweight striker.

803
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:34,450
So if this gentleman's Russia gentlemen
just figures out out a sit down more on

804
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,050
his stuff,

805
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,520
he's so athletic.

806
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,570
Rico's not hindering up.

807
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,820
He better of that rush and polar bear.

808
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,230
Not a fucking,

809
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,083
well,

810
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,860
you don't think that guy
could take Rico down dog?

811
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,201
No,

812
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,220
he's that Ak.

813
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:48,971
Just training.

814
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:49,840
Take down defense.

815
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,330
Fucking needs to end your world.

816
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,850
I wish I had so much faith.

817
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,993
I don't know man.

818
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,670
Rico and the Ricoh is more of a beast,

819
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:58,120
I think.

820
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,181
Oh,

821
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:00,160
he's a bad motherfucker
when it comes to kickboxing.

822
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,570
God,

823
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,650
What's interesting about him is his pace
because he puts a pace on heavyweights.

824
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,580
It just can't fuck with,

825
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:07,930
and he's not a little heavyweight.

826
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,201
No,

827
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,034
he's massive.

828
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Biggest fucking legs
are awe does left Beth.

829
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,280
Hi Cook and people in the face when
his front leg as a heavyweight.

830
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,403
It's a big dude.

831
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,250
What what he's doing is more impressive
to me as a big guy to be that athletic

832
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,730
and smooth and just worldclass
kickboxer and some nuts.

833
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,300
Well,

834
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,721
yeah.

835
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,021
I mean,

836
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,291
look,

837
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,490
it's super impressive,

838
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:34,660
but you the both deny how impressive it
is that the Russian gentleman is just

839
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:35,494
dominating.

840
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,910
They're both impressive.

841
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,460
I'm saying if I had to invest in one,

842
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,020
let's say they're both 21 years old.

843
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,840
Here's where it goes back to
kick your fucking face off.

844
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,100
The guy's gonna taking scrap motherfucker.

845
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,551
Well,

846
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,271
that guy might not,

847
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:47,450
I don't know.

848
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,910
He might take you down your neck
and you might pull your face off.

849
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,133
Face off

850
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,160
will sass.

851
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,090
I was telling us about that.

852
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,481
Who Was it?

853
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,510
Samoan rustler.

854
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,290
Uh,

855
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,740
he was at WWE and he was so big.

856
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,530
He got in a fight in a bar and
he reached new and Dude's mouth.

857
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,340
The guy's gonna.

858
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,820
He reached with him up with his giant
Samoan fingers anywhere and granted the

859
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,690
bottom of his teeth and just kind of hit
and broke his teeth out of his mouth.

860
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,320
He's talking to her.

861
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,120
Good day.

862
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,521
Hey Pat.

863
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,420
Oh my God.

864
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,220
This bottom teeth out broke them off.

865
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,410
Some big guys.

866
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,131
Hey,

867
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,330
you know at this party needs,

868
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,561
oh,

869
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:26,560
you use the right one.

870
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,940
This one sending out the Brian Signal.

871
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,150
I just forgot what the fuck I
was going to ask you guys about.

872
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,780
We're talking about Rico
in the Russian doorbell.

873
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,870
I wanted to talk about the Russian doping
program because they almost pulled the

874
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:42,740
entire Russian team out of the Olympic
because the government was in on it.

875
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,570
But I got,

876
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,200
I got a great Russian doping story.

877
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,800
All right,

878
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,633
we'll wait on it.

879
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,740
There's a whole fight going on.

880
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:49,670
We're not even pay attention.

881
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,630
I didn't see any campaign is not,

882
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,200
I've been balls deep in this Russian.

883
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,910
I haven't seen one fucking ounce of
this bite back to this fight real quick,

884
00:24:58,911 --> 00:24:59,990
unless you guys got more shit.

885
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:02,360
But you were talking about a
new rule change about tight,

886
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,410
tighter clothes and like,

887
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,771
yeah,

888
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:04,230
there was a,

889
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,070
one of the things that I,

890
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,230
I might have read it wrong.

891
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,580
I want to make sure I get it right,

892
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:12,380
but I believe that one of the new rule
changes is no loose clothing for female

893
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:12,980
fighters.

894
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,813
It's been a problem.

895
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,553
I don't know.

896
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,000
You would think that,

897
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,360
you know,

898
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,070
we gotta stop them.

899
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,650
How do they like doing changes to six
elbows might've happened once or twice.

900
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,610
I do not know.

901
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,440
They know they change all these rules,

902
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:24,651
right?

903
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,180
Eddie,

904
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,350
the sanctioning body changed
a bunch of rules like,

905
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,980
uh,

906
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,390
what wins around 10,

907
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:29,841
eight round,

908
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:30,674
stuff like that.

909
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,161
And I'm like,

910
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:31,551
sweet.

911
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,061
I bet they do.

912
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,110
12 to six elbows.

913
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,501
Yeah,

914
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,311
they should have done that.

915
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:35,031
But what they did do,

916
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,070
that's even more interesting honestly,

917
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,150
is um,

918
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,030
this new rule about putting
your hands down the mat.

919
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,090
You have to have both your
hands flat on the Mat,

920
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,660
both hands to constitute being in a
position where you can't get kicked her

921
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:48,494
need.

922
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,383
That's better.

923
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,330
Oh,

924
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,770
that's way better because it makes
it less of a fucking gay man.

925
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,041
Real Shit.

926
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:55,850
I agree.

927
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,670
I think that's the beginning of
just crushing that altogether.

928
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:58,881
Yeah.

929
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:02,810
It needs to be crushed because we have
to be honest about what the sport is.

930
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,680
Okay.

931
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,330
And there's a sport of fighting and if
you take away some really super effective

932
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,164
maneuvers,

933
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,900
but you leave in a bunch of
other super effective maneuvers,

934
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,360
like we got to be consistent
and we're not consistent.

935
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,040
And there's a position where you can be
kind of safe when you have your hand on

936
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,330
the mat and you can't be needing the face.

937
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,320
He can't be kicked in the face,

938
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,710
but that causes like safety
first kind of behavior,

939
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,650
but also guys are taking advantage of it.

940
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,070
So higher game,

941
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,280
it's super unrealistic.

942
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,290
Gone from this point on.

943
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,030
It's fuck,

944
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,350
it's super unrealistic,

945
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,800
right?

946
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,100
Yup.

947
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,250
And then there are also a,

948
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,650
they're putting more emphasis on 10,

949
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:37,101
eight rounds.

950
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:38,360
You're gonna see more frequently,

951
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:38,571
10,

952
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:39,260
eight rounds now,

953
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,471
you know,

954
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:39,681
I was like,

955
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:39,971
what if,

956
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:42,330
what if they decided
to not fucking finally,

957
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,620
that's way better.

958
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,160
Way Better.

959
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,180
12 to six elbows.

960
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:45,391
Those,

961
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:47,070
that's the one thing I
went through the list.

962
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm like,

963
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,170
how the fuck do they
know how to address that?

964
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:49,800
Yeah.

965
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,660
But they did allow this new rule,

966
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,160
the hands on the mat rule.

967
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,870
I think soon to be more,

968
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:55,290
uh,

969
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,530
it's going to be more of a factor
than even the 12 to six elbow.

970
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,760
I think it's very smart that they did
it because I think you can still protect

971
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,080
yourself in those positions.

972
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,591
You know,

973
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:04,771
you're,

974
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,590
you're talking about someone who's
trying to make their way back up to their

975
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:10,620
feet and ideally to strike
or to grapple again,

976
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,240
it's a transitionary period.

977
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,811
So to say,

978
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,810
this guy can't kick you in a
transitionary moving period.

979
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:16,351
It's stupid.

980
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:16,981
It's very stupid.

981
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:17,400
Yeah.

982
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,610
No,

983
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,650
they also changed a open hand policy.

984
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,590
You Know Jon Jones and trash brown.

985
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,070
You have,

986
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,470
you open it,

987
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,970
they're going to warn you
and then I take a point.

988
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,470
If you're fighting with open hands,

989
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,810
you're going to have
some issues that smart.

990
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,830
I think they should change.

991
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,650
The gloves are really do I
think should be bad and pride.

992
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,330
I think they can go back to pride gloves.

993
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,040
I don't think it's going to be a,

994
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,810
I think if you look at the amount of,

995
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,990
I pokes in pride versus the
amount of Ipos in the UFC.

996
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,190
I don't think you can.

997
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,760
That's because those
guys are so juiced up.

998
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,800
If you hit their eyes,

999
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,634
they didn't give a fuck.

1000
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,811
You know,

1001
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:46,880
it was like sharps.

1002
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,700
It's like I don't care what the rule.

1003
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:51,870
I would like change as well,

1004
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,190
and this sounds brutal,

1005
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:54,870
but when you have someone's back,

1006
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:56,850
you should be able to elbow him
in the back of the fucking head.

1007
00:27:56,851 --> 00:28:01,070
Why can't can you can front
of the head that's so intense.

1008
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:01,904
In the front,

1009
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,330
the back of the heads to no,

1010
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,500
no,

1011
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:03,561
no,

1012
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:03,720
no.

1013
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,580
It's to tap quick.

1014
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:05,880
You know,

1015
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,410
back in the day when that shit was legal,

1016
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,420
you didn't even have to have
a good rear naked choke.

1017
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,040
You put your own,

1018
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,890
you get on their back,

1019
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,640
you throw a couple of these
and we're tapping quick,

1020
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:15,211
different game.

1021
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:15,910
Now my man,

1022
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,600
you can't have that back to the lab.

1023
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,900
You could had kicked
someone with your Shin,

1024
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,913
but here's the,

1025
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,440
I kick them in the eyes,

1026
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,910
but not just no,

1027
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,470
but you can't kick him
in the back of the head.

1028
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,000
That's where it's weird transition.

1029
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,650
When you're fighting,

1030
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,580
you're standing up.

1031
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,190
If you throw a head kick and you hit a
guy in the back of the head and he goes

1032
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:35,940
to sleep,

1033
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,170
you don't get penalized at all.

1034
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,060
You won by knockout every single time.

1035
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,080
Guys,

1036
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,770
brutal sport.

1037
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,560
Almost always when they throw high kicks,

1038
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:44,394
you'll see,

1039
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,030
especially if like it goes like
over the left shoulder safety,

1040
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,310
both sand an orthodox and you throw a
right high kick and it goes over the left

1041
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,090
shoulder,

1042
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,210
the first place it's hitting as the back
of your head a lot with it wraps around

1043
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:59,211
to imagine what everyone's records
would look like in the history of MMA.

1044
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,810
If that was never taken
out and you'd been,

1045
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,550
there would have been a lot of
wins and losses switched up.

1046
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,503
Oh yeah.

1047
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,300
People forget that in the
beginning when you'd get the back,

1048
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,820
he's getting naked.

1049
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,773
Do you remember?

1050
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,750
You just ride the duty,

1051
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,040
you fuck them up and they tap.

1052
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,560
I'd rather see knees to a down opponent.

1053
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,620
Is it was the guy saying,

1054
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,331
what's the big deal?

1055
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,480
Is it Ben Spiker versus Henzel Gracie?

1056
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,740
Is that who it was?

1057
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,980
And it was a judo guy and I remember
John Lewis did it to somebody and the

1058
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,480
tickets.

1059
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,313
John Lewis,

1060
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,521
the guy tapped him,

1061
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:31,380
was fucking over.

1062
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,870
That was done back of the head.

1063
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,301
It's tough.

1064
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:34,290
Eddy with the elbows,

1065
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:34,560
man.

1066
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,393
I don't know,

1067
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,550
but isn't it really effective?

1068
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,410
Explain how you people are getting
kicked in the back of that and no one's

1069
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,580
complaining about excuse.

1070
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,490
You can control it.

1071
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,030
If you kick,

1072
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,940
you can control that.

1073
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,690
If you throw a head kick and
she goes over the shoulder,

1074
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,710
lands with the instep,

1075
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,560
it's almost always
hitting the back of that.

1076
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,901
I agree.

1077
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:50,490
But same thing,

1078
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,790
if you're throwing a huge right hand,

1079
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,420
the guy goes to slip back of the head,

1080
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,340
but there's a difference.

1081
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,420
You can't control that.

1082
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,860
You can't control for game.

1083
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,000
It doesn't matter if it's on
purpose or an [inaudible].

1084
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,070
We just saw a guy get hit happens it guy,

1085
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:04,750
it was just exactly
what we were looking at.

1086
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,480
Someone did a cartwheel kick and
kick the back of someone's head.

1087
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,441
Oh yeah,

1088
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,260
he did a cartwheel kick
and it's not intentional,

1089
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,580
but that back of the head gets hit all
the time with kicks gets hit with wheel

1090
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,414
kicks to

1091
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,920
what if you add,

1092
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,740
uh,

1093
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,440
what do you think?

1094
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,260
Hit it with a hard impact.

1095
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,320
One of those kicks that you're talking
about or when you're riding on someone's

1096
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,490
back and you're throwing an elbow,

1097
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,070
those aren't nearly as hard
as the head kicks there.

1098
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,840
Not nearly as hard as her way on her
stationary and you're really stuck dudes.

1099
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,610
But really they should come
gel up and they should.

1100
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,950
You got to realize they can't just sit
in that position and defend the choke.

1101
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,373
No guys,

1102
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,960
guys are punching away anyways.

1103
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,720
Like you look at,

1104
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,670
you look at a cane,

1105
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,460
Travis Browne,

1106
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,320
Cain just punches.

1107
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,130
They're going to stop the
fight when they get back there.

1108
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,180
Guys really aren't going for the
choke and let's sort of Jujitsu based.

1109
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,700
Yeah,

1110
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,533
they're really just rain down.

1111
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,620
There's a big fucking difference between
punching someone in the back of the

1112
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,750
head on the band and then Jack is Elvin,

1113
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,790
you're going to have
so much fun last smash.

1114
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,160
We're just going to tap unless you're
rumble Johnson Rumble Johnson to brutal

1115
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,300
leap when he had his
back in that same way.

1116
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,021
You know,

1117
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:16,210
I mean that guy hits so God damn hard,

1118
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,940
but I'm sort of shame Carlin
Eddie in a lot of ways.

1119
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,860
I agree with you.

1120
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,580
I mean we should really consider it
like it is a very effective technique.

1121
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,310
The real question is
like how dangerous is it?

1122
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,930
Why is it more dangerous?

1123
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,100
I guess it's cause the brainstem is there.

1124
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,510
There's not as much for and
pulling back the brainstem.

1125
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,913
But uh,

1126
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,420
well it seems that that is
an area that's vulnerable.

1127
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:42,370
Much like your eyeballs,

1128
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,770
much like your temple.

1129
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,470
It's like these are vulnerable
areas and it's weird,

1130
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:52,090
real weird to me that we take like
even if it's the most vulnerable one,

1131
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,560
why are we taking that spot and not
really taking it out of the game either.

1132
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,750
Like you can still hit guys there
with head kicks and you did.

1133
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,380
Why not just get guys in the dental thing?

1134
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,440
If you want to end the fight,

1135
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,310
just forget the cup.

1136
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:04,630
Let's just start kicking the Dick.

1137
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,740
Let's make it a real fuck.

1138
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,603
You know what I'm saying?

1139
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,560
You stop right there.

1140
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,390
You stop at the Watson Man.

1141
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,470
That's a real good question.

1142
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,760
It is a good question.

1143
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,711
Listen,

1144
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,450
it's a good question because honestly,

1145
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,100
if you look at the early UFC,

1146
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,240
there was a lot of Dick fucking kick in.

1147
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:27,810
Do you remember Keith Hackney and Joe
Sawn Buck Yas Hackney's inside control

1148
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:30,490
drop him bombs on Joe Sons',

1149
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,343
Dick

1150
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
and

1151
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,413
Dick.

1152
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,560
A big difference.

1153
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,100
You can't fuck someone
with the back of your head.

1154
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,500
I'll go you the most fucked up one ever.

1155
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,740
Big Dairy Goodrich and the Pedro.

1156
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,880
Do you know this one?

1157
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,631
I do.

1158
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:52,100
Pig Daddy Goodridge reach into that dude's
shorts and crushed his deck and brush

1159
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,480
the paint.

1160
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,120
Are we talking about on
the podcast with phone

1161
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:56,770
playdough?

1162
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,290
Yeah,

1163
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,390
that fat Dick like,

1164
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,063
uh,

1165
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,163
he uh,

1166
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,130
he turned us nuts second
that peanut butter.

1167
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,083
That's what he said.

1168
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,400
That's unacceptable.

1169
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,234
The back of the head.

1170
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,420
So how,

1171
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,130
how,

1172
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,930
how do you not understand the difference
between your Johnson and the back of

1173
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:15,320
your head?

1174
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,771
How do you feel?

1175
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:19,490
I'll probably get kicked in the fucking
Johnson in the back of my brain.

1176
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,061
Oh,

1177
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:20,760
I dunno about,

1178
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,593
wow.

1179
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,580
A full blown kick from,

1180
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,000
uh,

1181
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,220
Mark Hunt or somehow
bring the giant smile.

1182
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,590
I let them kick my head.

1183
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,150
Oh my God.

1184
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,710
No,

1185
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,560
pick your poison.

1186
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,543
Both aren't,

1187
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,320
yeah.

1188
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
If he kicks you in the head,

1189
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:43,220
your Dick might never work for him
or you won't remember fucking again.

1190
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,830
He would choose the Dick
over the back of the head.

1191
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,610
Hundred percent.

1192
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,443
Wow.

1193
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,260
Wow.

1194
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,093
Ooh,

1195
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,920
that's the back of the head.

1196
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,621
The head.

1197
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:56,480
You're not gonna remember doing shit.

1198
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,100
She could uh,

1199
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,270
potentially can die.

1200
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,280
Die from being kicked in the Dick.

1201
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,380
It depends on like where is
he kicking you in the Dick.

1202
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,680
What if he kicks you like across the,

1203
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,920
the like if your Dick is like kicks
you like the Shin across the top.

1204
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:13,340
Bring it.

1205
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,210
I say bring it.

1206
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,320
You know you might be
able to deal with that.

1207
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:18,560
It's just going to smash your Dick
down a little bit and then let it go.

1208
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:19,910
The trunk.

1209
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,750
You hit the trunk.

1210
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,613
I'm all good though.

1211
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,453
Right?

1212
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,323
But

1213
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,130
yeah,

1214
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,963
I guess

1215
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,640
I never wore a cup in football.

1216
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:30,410
I get fucking clean it all the time.

1217
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,260
I think it looks like the front
of a great white shark nose.

1218
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,330
Just battle.

1219
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,690
Just

1220
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,250
sheer.

1221
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,180
Jamie's got it up there.

1222
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,901
I'll play it again.

1223
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:48,380
I'm sorry.

1224
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,310
That's what I want.

1225
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:50,630
Cause this is Keith Hackney.

1226
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,130
Me Mile.

1227
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,570
He could have gone for the von flue choke.

1228
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:54,260
Eddie Bravo.

1229
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,471
Right?

1230
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:54,951
He just said,

1231
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,090
fuck the von flue choke.

1232
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,630
Check out this von flu flu is there.

1233
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,470
He'll give a fuck about the von flue
when you're punching the man's Dick off.

1234
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,070
I know.

1235
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,560
It's amazing how many guys still
hold on to the headlock when they,

1236
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:07,460
when they get taken down.

1237
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,294
Unbelievable.

1238
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,610
They still there inside controlling.

1239
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:12,560
They're still clamped down there and
bring them a choice in which you want to

1240
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:12,711
see.

1241
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,270
That drives me fucking nuts.

1242
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Last time I saw it and get used though
was a OSP against Cotita come off.

1243
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,273
He did it against,

1244
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,270
uh,

1245
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,070
they,

1246
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,660
I think,

1247
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:23,931
oh no,

1248
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,800
he took Cody down.

1249
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:25,401
He's looking for it.

1250
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:25,521
Yeah,

1251
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,020
he did do it against nut Nikita.

1252
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,291
Yeah,

1253
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:27,591
I did.

1254
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:28,380
It's an Akita.

1255
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,990
A lot of power to fuck.

1256
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:30,824
Yeah.

1257
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,930
That fucking Krill off.

1258
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,764
Holy Shit.

1259
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,570
Did you see him against Ed Herman?

1260
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:36,240
That head kick?

1261
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,960
God,

1262
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,030
not just the head kid who's

1263
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,820
everything.

1264
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,050
He kept kicking his body,

1265
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:42,350
me and his body and just march,

1266
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,880
remember he was a heavyweight
start off at heavyweight.

1267
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,291
Oh Dude,

1268
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,340
that guy's 23.

1269
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,820
God Damn.

1270
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,481
He's like 23,

1271
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,800
24 might be 24.

1272
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:50,370
He's trouble.

1273
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,790
He's super young and heavyweight
and heats him real talented.

1274
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,770
Middleweight he's middle weight.

1275
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,671
He's middle way.

1276
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,780
What do you mean by that?

1277
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,614
Middle Week?

1278
00:35:59,310 --> 00:35:59,461
Yeah.

1279
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,060
He's lied to everybody.

1280
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,600
He's a big boy.

1281
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,710
When did that Herman go to light?

1282
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:01,951
Heavy.

1283
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,784
We went to [inaudible].

1284
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,571
This is his second fight.

1285
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:03,700
It,

1286
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,011
it is.

1287
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:05,520
It really is.

1288
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,270
Middle Way.

1289
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,910
He won by knockout has no ed Herman's
definitely light every way now.

1290
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,580
He won by knockout and um,

1291
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,580
his last fight before this,

1292
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:14,970
uh,

1293
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,150
Kurloff fight krill off just man,

1294
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:18,984
he saw something.

1295
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,710
He saw he's hit his stride for Scott.

1296
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,090
Damn.

1297
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,710
Karate is so good.

1298
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,800
He's got that like kill
Kachin karate style.

1299
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,610
Who,

1300
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,440
who did it knocked out?

1301
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:29,011
Tim Boetsch.

1302
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,371
That's right.

1303
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:29,911
That's right.

1304
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:30,810
That was at light heavyweight.

1305
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,550
Yeah.

1306
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,310
Um,

1307
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,170
this krill off guy man.

1308
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,303
He something.

1309
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,061
Yeah,

1310
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,851
it's really cool to see that.

1311
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,640
And they need that young blood there too.

1312
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:39,474
Yep.

1313
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,703
That's great man.

1314
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,620
How about fucking Woodley too?

1315
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,860
You won't talk about a smart business
decision not fighting signal for that

1316
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:47,611
title shot.

1317
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:48,570
And it paid off.

1318
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:49,791
Hey,

1319
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,400
can you do,

1320
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,080
can you explain to me,

1321
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,430
uh,

1322
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,110
still update,

1323
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,360
feel that the selling of
the UFC and how that works?

1324
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,430
I know Dana's still on board,

1325
00:36:59,431 --> 00:36:59,611
right?

1326
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:00,870
He's still part owners still.

1327
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,770
He's still minority,

1328
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,491
honestly,

1329
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,610
have not even asked a single
person with the dealers.

1330
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:05,761
Oh,

1331
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,440
really?

1332
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:06,811
Yeah.

1333
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:07,710
Is it a public though?

1334
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,610
Yes.

1335
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:08,941
I,

1336
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:09,360
uh,

1337
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,790
I,

1338
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:09,930
I,

1339
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,500
you know,

1340
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,980
selling it or this is what I know
they're selling it and Dana stays on.

1341
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,431
Correct.

1342
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:15,720
But I don't know what kind of deal.

1343
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,510
Yaz or it's sold.

1344
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:18,930
He's already,

1345
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,770
he's still the president and the Fertittas
are no longer involved in it at all.

1346
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,850
There's different guys and all,

1347
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:25,170
if there's a bunch of people involved now,

1348
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,670
but nothing changes really.

1349
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,480
You know what I'm saying?

1350
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:27,691
Like,

1351
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,830
Dana's still still,

1352
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,940
he's still on board as the president.

1353
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,380
Yes.

1354
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,100
He's somehow to make all the decisions,

1355
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,943
like,

1356
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,010
I don't know as much power.

1357
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,740
I don't know.

1358
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,030
I don't know that those details.

1359
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,750
I don't,

1360
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,081
you know,

1361
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,100
I don't know how they did it,

1362
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:40,430
but for one franker out done.

1363
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,280
Wow.

1364
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,200
They went such give us,

1365
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,210
give us our billions.

1366
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,850
We were fucking bought it.

1367
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,653
That uh,

1368
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,570
that agency only me and some other part,

1369
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:55,860
I don't know how that works,

1370
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:56,700
what they call it.

1371
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,340
If it's a new organization
that's bought the UFC,

1372
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:02,730
I don't know how it works if they
just came together and formed the new

1373
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,003
underground.

1374
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,780
So there's no more three and the
beginning no more Zuph no more phone.

1375
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,890
Just you up saying the same company.

1376
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,990
But the road is too and you know what man,

1377
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,140
we as fans that are sitting here
watching the fights right now,

1378
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,050
we owe the Fertittas everything.

1379
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,710
Fuck yeah.

1380
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,440
If they didn't have the
balls and the money and the,

1381
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:23,940
the,

1382
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,860
the risk taking an acumen.

1383
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,090
They didn't know when to stay in and
when to bail and how they could turn this

1384
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:30,924
thing around.

1385
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,793
They're brilliant.

1386
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,790
They deserve,

1387
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,760
if they are with Eddie and I used to
always dream of every Eddie and I when we

1388
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:39,670
were fans back in the
old days when nobody,

1389
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,780
you couldn't give dark,

1390
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,620
didn't get it.

1391
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,750
You couldn't even get it on
cable was banned from cable.

1392
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,100
You had to get direct TV.

1393
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,220
I had direct TV specifically
so I can get the UFC.

1394
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,110
You need a two scrooge McDuck to go.

1395
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,441
Yeah,

1396
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,790
we'll see what we can do with this thing.

1397
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,301
Dude.

1398
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,140
Those guys,

1399
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,710
they,

1400
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,510
they came in at the perfect time.

1401
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,540
It was dead in the water and through
all their risk taking and all.

1402
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,460
They're just smart business decisions,

1403
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,710
smart promotional decisions,

1404
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,080
and then they're brilliant man,

1405
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,520
and then putting together
the ultimate fighter.

1406
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:09,931
It's amazing.

1407
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:10,690
That guy just need a minute.

1408
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,710
You know what they're going to do.

1409
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,390
You know what I think they're
going to do and their,

1410
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:13,691
their,

1411
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:15,010
their passion is football.

1412
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,520
Yup.

1413
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,260
They're going to bring
the Raiders to Vegas.

1414
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,830
They might,

1415
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,580
that's what I think too.

1416
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,181
They might just,

1417
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,530
they're trying to do you hurt.

1418
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:23,050
You must've heard that you
can't just make that shit up.

1419
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,070
Might be,

1420
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,010
they might build a gold space
ship and just fly over Vegas

1421
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,650
or they might be able to go

1422
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,630
like those fucking star
Trek just fucking circle.

1423
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Just like a big giant hovercrafts fucking
swim naked on the roof of it and just

1424
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,640
fucking teleport mad.

1425
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,450
Bitches and lives don't,

1426
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,420
I mean if nothing changes,

1427
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,690
they're still going to get killed.

1428
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,880
Seats at the UFC.

1429
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,030
They don't give a fuck about seats.

1430
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,430
They can sit right next to me.

1431
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,780
Is Really gonna change when their line,

1432
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,400
no,

1433
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,650
they can go backstage anytime.

1434
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,050
They can just walk and just
be like all of us in here.

1435
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:06,730
So for rogue and they
could buy all of them.

1436
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,120
Skies are beautiful.

1437
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:08,661
We all,

1438
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:09,291
we owe them,

1439
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,620
we owe frank and we all the sessions.

1440
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,890
Football go them big time.

1441
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,820
Especially Lorenzo.

1442
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:14,654
So that's what I love.

1443
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,950
So and their sons and their sons
a fucking stud at Notre Dame.

1444
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,660
He's passionate about and me too.

1445
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,720
But he knows that MMA,

1446
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,210
it's like their work is done as
far as like getting it mainstream.

1447
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,080
It's on Fox.

1448
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,521
I mean it's,

1449
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,060
it's on television all the time.

1450
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:29,211
It's,

1451
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:29,541
it is.

1452
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,770
Main street's a mainstream,

1453
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,941
crazy,

1454
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:33,140
super popular sport.

1455
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,630
So cash out.

1456
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,870
You don't get to their level without yeah.

1457
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,141
They're like,

1458
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:39,351
look,

1459
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:40,010
we got this.

1460
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:40,730
We're good.

1461
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,180
We're good.

1462
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,930
We're good.

1463
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,670
I'm giving you guys a
fucking killer business.

1464
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,540
Give me the cash.

1465
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm just going to watch
it from the outset.

1466
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,530
Fucking with the exact same seat.

1467
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,393
Nothing changes.

1468
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,390
He can enjoy it with Dana.

1469
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:51,831
Dana,

1470
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:52,490
you good?

1471
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,271
You stay here.

1472
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:54,200
We're the fuck out.

1473
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:54,830
You good.

1474
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,650
See Ya.

1475
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,550
He was our billions.

1476
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,930
Probably enjoy it more,

1477
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,800
you know,

1478
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
cause he can just relax and clear.

1479
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,220
The tightest stayed.

1480
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,073
That's great.

1481
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,980
I mean it's made a big difference.

1482
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,910
Look at this position.

1483
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,930
It's great that you stayed too.

1484
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,741
You know,

1485
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:09,800
Amanda came real close to not real close.

1486
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,470
Did you really?

1487
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,020
Oh,

1488
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,510
you're telling me that
I'd never bought it.

1489
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:13,680
I was real close.

1490
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,090
Really?

1491
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,510
Yeah.

1492
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,180
I had to make sure that I was
thinking about it correctly.

1493
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:18,931
You know?

1494
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:22,190
I really had to spend time
thinking about what I was doing.

1495
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,660
I definitely knew that I had a
reduced the schedule that was a,

1496
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,290
there was no way I was going to go back
to doing as many times as I was doing it

1497
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:28,621
before.

1498
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:29,454
It's just,

1499
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,110
I don't think it's good for you,

1500
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:31,410
man.

1501
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,350
I don't think flying that
much is good for you.

1502
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:33,950
Ah,

1503
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,430
no.

1504
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,540
It's not nothing.

1505
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:35,811
No,

1506
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:36,680
we're not made to be in there.

1507
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:40,520
And anything that recycled air
and shit flying every week.

1508
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,210
You're like,

1509
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,040
road guys like comics too.

1510
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,630
They have this look about them.

1511
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:45,464
They look like shit.

1512
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,310
They look weary.

1513
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,880
Yeah.

1514
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,550
I just don't think it's
good for you and by the way,

1515
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,270
man,

1516
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,190
I wrote about radiation and space.

1517
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,150
Pretty sure.

1518
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,630
I'm pretty sure I'm an expert.

1519
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,030
I guess it is radiation though,

1520
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:56,241
right?

1521
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:57,200
When you go up in space,

1522
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,700
I think it's probably worse,

1523
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,563
I think.

1524
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,740
I think I read that it's more radiation
than you get when you get an x ray every

1525
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:04,481
time you get to plan.

1526
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,180
Really?

1527
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,520
Yeah.

1528
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,201
Let's see if that's true.

1529
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,090
It might've made that up and then
you're on the plane for what,

1530
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,330
12 hours?

1531
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,470
14 hours on time.

1532
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,241
I just went to Italy.

1533
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:11,600
That was,

1534
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,370
that was at least keep that shit.

1535
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,140
I don't fly along the five hours,

1536
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,063
five hours,

1537
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,450
but it's in Italy.

1538
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,021
He's amazing.

1539
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:19,550
It's worth getting a little radiated.

1540
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,443
Nah,

1541
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,100
you don't think so?

1542
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,251
No,

1543
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,960
I won't do it real now.

1544
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,000
What did you go through?

1545
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,070
Do we have great Italian
food and security line?

1546
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,904
Do you opt out,

1547
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,040
but do you opt out in the security line?

1548
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,571
I got to,

1549
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:32,960
I got the fastpass son.

1550
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,190
Well he was never as
opting out of the scanner.

1551
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,540
Hell no man.

1552
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,340
Fucking u s of a,

1553
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,810
they don't let you opt out.

1554
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,500
Wait a minute.

1555
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,651
Yeah,

1556
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,484
you can opt out,

1557
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,260
but then they pat you down and shit
and go through your luggage Dick.

1558
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:48,591
Dude.

1559
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:51,410
It's the craziest thing how
they're allowed to touch your Dick.

1560
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:53,210
As long as it's with the back
of the hand they tell you.

1561
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,511
Yeah,

1562
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,100
cause we're going to
have to check on my hand.

1563
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:57,260
That's where I'm going to
hit your sensitive areas.

1564
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,094
Is that cool?

1565
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,870
I don't mind.

1566
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,260
As long as it's the back of the hands.

1567
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,350
Fuck yeah,

1568
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,323
go ahead.

1569
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,600
There's less nerves on
the back of your hand.

1570
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:06,300
Does it feel good?

1571
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,133
It's not

1572
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,361
exactly,

1573
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,260
it's the back of my head.

1574
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:12,951
If I did this,

1575
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:14,460
that now it's up now.

1576
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,603
Well there you go.

1577
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,710
Risk on a flight as small
as cosmic rays sound scary,

1578
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:21,080
but radiation risk on a flight as small.

1579
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,530
See if that was right about you get
as much as you get when you get x Ray.

1580
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,460
See if that's correct.

1581
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,360
That might be total bullshit.

1582
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,590
What the fuck is pilots and the flight
attendants or get twice the incidence of

1583
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,510
melanoma compared to general population,

1584
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:37,430
which could be part of
where that comes from.

1585
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,190
Oh yeah,

1586
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,250
no shit.

1587
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,500
Fuck all that shit to you Epstein.

1588
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,330
The Hanson pilot.

1589
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,710
They'll look up till one o'clock yeah,

1590
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:47,960
that's what you saw sky.

1591
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,651
Hell No.

1592
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:49,341
All the time.

1593
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:49,701
Breathing,

1594
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:53,450
recycled air and other people's farts and
just fucking hanging with the guy next

1595
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:54,380
to you for hours.

1596
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,200
Dammit.

1597
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,550
Dammit.

1598
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,383
Fuck that job.

1599
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,660
We haven't said a word about this fight.

1600
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,700
I've fucking

1601
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,080
fighting each other recently
and we get together.

1602
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:09,914
We have so much to talk.

1603
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,210
It's good fight so far.

1604
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,170
Those guys got us back.

1605
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,441
Now,

1606
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,970
Eddie Bravo p case in point,

1607
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,043
elbows dropping,

1608
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:15,380
right?

1609
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,370
You get that back mount.

1610
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:17,360
You immediately go right there,

1611
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,360
right?

1612
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,140
You have that shit on Fox son,

1613
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,491
boom,

1614
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:20,871
boom,

1615
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,170
boom.

1616
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,250
Saved the back of the head.

1617
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,370
But wouldn't it be a position where
you would have to protect that?

1618
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,743
Okay,

1619
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,231
no cup.

1620
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,030
How about you just fucking,

1621
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:30,050
he'll kick him in the nuts.

1622
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,740
How seriously,

1623
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,730
how come it's okay to,

1624
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:35,320
he'll kick a guy in the
temple because you didn't say,

1625
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:36,240
well the elbow guy,

1626
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,530
the guy could have his head sideways and
you could smash down the point of your

1627
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:43,710
elbow into his temple and that's
illegal strike because I think with the

1628
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,440
brainstem and you don't have
as much protection back here.

1629
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,343
You know what I'm saying?

1630
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,941
Right.

1631
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:49,550
Well sits like the connections,

1632
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,330
the critical connection to the brain.

1633
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,110
Yes.

1634
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:52,943
The fight would be over.

1635
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,670
Yeah.

1636
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,920
I wonder like what,

1637
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,650
I mean obviously it's dangerous
to get hit anywhere in the head,

1638
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,390
but I wonder like how much more
dangerous it is a bit to you.

1639
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,243
It's

1640
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,280
fine.

1641
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,770
It's already happening all the time.

1642
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
What's your on promoting it?

1643
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,531
No one's,

1644
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:11,460
no one's promoting it,

1645
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:12,210
but we're not,

1646
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,010
we're not changing the result of a fight.

1647
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,250
If somebody wheel kicks a guy
and clips the back of his head,

1648
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,470
if he says shit happens all the time.

1649
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,310
Yeah,

1650
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,280
it's almost that serious.

1651
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,950
They should like Dq,

1652
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,340
the guy for those head kicks and they,

1653
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,860
if they do the replay,

1654
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:26,710
the instant replay that goes,

1655
00:45:26,711 --> 00:45:27,544
you know what you lost.

1656
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,870
Did you ever see a Ernesto hoost
versus a Maury Smith God forever ago.

1657
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,320
Check this.

1658
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,860
Oh Jamie,

1659
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,580
pull that up.

1660
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,413
This is um,

1661
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,410
this is like a classic example
of a behind the head head kick.

1662
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:42,860
Me Too.

1663
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,050
And,

1664
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,430
and Maurice as well.

1665
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,090
I love more from Denver son.

1666
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:46,240
Boy.

1667
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,061
He's a bad mother.

1668
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:49,650
Rutgers kicking in the fucking face.

1669
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,900
Maurice's seriously skillful.

1670
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,610
Kickboxer to hell.

1671
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:54,510
And I look at this,

1672
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,410
watch this go boom.

1673
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,670
Well that's right on the back of them.

1674
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,190
Yeah,

1675
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,990
I mean absolutely perfectly.

1676
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,810
This is exchange,

1677
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:04,830
but look how good who's two is,

1678
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,840
check this exchange out in the middle
of it blocks the knee and Kinda hip

1679
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:11,491
dexterity.

1680
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:11,701
I mean,

1681
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,440
he's always done a full split.

1682
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,940
Well look how he comes back down.

1683
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:15,271
Yeah,

1684
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,104
look at this.

1685
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:16,801
But look,

1686
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:17,090
watch,

1687
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,270
look at this distance though.

1688
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,370
Me and check.

1689
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,263
Check this.

1690
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,870
Uhmm I mean that is just artwork or
was it over the top of the shoulder?

1691
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,740
That's the correct reaction.

1692
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,890
Your opponent throws a knee.

1693
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:30,990
You know that you got time,

1694
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,700
there's no way he's going
to get that neat back.

1695
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,170
He just timing the movement
and like a guy like Anderson,

1696
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:38,970
like he would time like when,

1697
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,301
how,

1698
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:41,040
when you would put your
feet down when you would,

1699
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:41,820
when you would mill.

1700
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,010
So he knows that if you're doing this,

1701
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,890
you're going here and then
maybe you have a pattern.

1702
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:48,240
Maybe you have something to do afterwards.

1703
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:49,770
Maybe you stay in the pocket and grab,

1704
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:50,670
maybe you back up.

1705
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,710
But he just timed it perfect.

1706
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:55,620
As soon as that knee came down he had
a feeling more east would be there.

1707
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,160
That's why I was just on
that kick 10,000 times too.

1708
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:58,580
Yeah.

1709
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,910
And the way brought it around behind
his shoulder but from that so hard crazy

1710
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,610
thing there is from that
distance is fucking nuts.

1711
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,001
They'll do,

1712
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:06,660
they were like,

1713
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,440
like uppercut.

1714
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,990
Yes.

1715
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,700
That's nuts.

1716
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,450
And he can't catch it head and is the,

1717
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,010
the flexibility of the hips as
what you really have to have.

1718
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:17,220
Cause you've got to have that
ability to drop down over God.

1719
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:17,521
Damn,

1720
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:18,031
that was beautiful.

1721
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:18,864
That was amazing.

1722
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,920
Fucking clip.

1723
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,210
And he's such a beast.

1724
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,111
Ernesto,

1725
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,690
who's was so I sat him.

1726
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:25,524
Bob Sapp.

1727
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,461
Fuck yeah,

1728
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,560
that I can't Bob Sapp beat him twice.

1729
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:29,270
I can't believe it.

1730
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,381
Well,

1731
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:30,010
cause he fucked up

1732
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,060
his shoulder on one than Bob.

1733
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:32,050
Just kept kicking at it.

1734
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:32,641
Oh Man.

1735
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,480
That they fucked up shoulder bad.

1736
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,070
And Bob realizing and kept kicking it.

1737
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:36,963
Oh

1738
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,120
look at this.

1739
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,430
I'm still waiting for the first
Japanese necktie and look at that,

1740
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:42,701
right?

1741
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:43,840
That boom right there,

1742
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:44,081
right.

1743
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,914
Dropped down to that level.

1744
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,030
It would be over right there.

1745
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:46,541
It's done.

1746
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,140
Put Your Lego.

1747
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,690
But he might even go forward
and you don't think he knows it,

1748
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,170
but you know what he still has?

1749
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,163
He sees,

1750
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,113
Oh damn,

1751
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,110
that's pretty good doors.

1752
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,580
He short arm in it,

1753
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:59,380
so it's the guy.

1754
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,200
Stay good.

1755
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,210
Stay in flat.

1756
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,283
Explain that today.

1757
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,220
Oh bill,

1758
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,630
he didn't really have a full,

1759
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,990
it wasn't sunk in.

1760
00:48:05,991 --> 00:48:06,710
It was like this.

1761
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,070
That's why on short arm and neck,

1762
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,990
the guy get defense to saint flat.

1763
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,620
See the handout,

1764
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,410
deep hand is if you're like
the fingers are right here,

1765
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:16,750
you can just tell that and keeping off.

1766
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,130
You'd know who I still want to fucking
seat in the UFC before all this bullshit

1767
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,540
is out.

1768
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,660
Let me tell you.

1769
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,410
Yes.

1770
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,243
Hold on.

1771
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:24,750
He,

1772
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,770
he hasn't fought in the UFC APP wrestler.

1773
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,600
He's a wrestler.

1774
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,720
Latin American electric low.

1775
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,953
Jesus Christ.

1776
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,401
You know it is.

1777
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:33,520
Yeah,

1778
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,250
I know who it is,

1779
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,600
homeboy.

1780
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,310
I forget.

1781
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,520
[inaudible] been around.

1782
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,350
They might do it.

1783
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:38,740
Well,

1784
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,573
they might do it now

1785
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,290
and us fucking smile with his arms.

1786
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,370
Jesus crashed.

1787
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,120
Sinewy steel courted,

1788
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,230
courted flesh.

1789
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,150
Hardened the heart man.

1790
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:52,990
Um,

1791
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,660
do we have a bottle opener and glasses?

1792
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:55,810
It's about to get loose now.

1793
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,880
New Shit.

1794
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,380
You thought Dick talk was too much.

1795
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:00,071
What about Jelly?

1796
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:01,690
D is getting his fucking blue belt right?

1797
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:02,351
Isn't that amazing?

1798
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:03,184
Cool man.

1799
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,073
It's so beautiful.

1800
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,560
So come on man,

1801
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:06,394
that's amazing.

1802
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,400
So beautiful soul into Jujitsu.

1803
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:09,971
Loves it.

1804
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:10,570
Really did.

1805
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,770
Like it is saving his life.

1806
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,610
He's so into it.

1807
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,370
He talks about you to get to every time
we talk on the phone and talks about how

1808
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,010
we did it,

1809
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,910
he's training all the Goddamn time.

1810
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,490
He goes in on Sundays and,

1811
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:20,711
and,

1812
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,230
and does Jujitsu show into it.

1813
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,430
And he's incredibly humble about it.

1814
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,290
Like he never eats always.

1815
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,780
Every time we talked about Jujitsu,

1816
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,091
he says,

1817
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:31,361
listen,

1818
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:32,194
Eddie Bravo,

1819
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,100
I'm terrible,

1820
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,150
I'm terrible.

1821
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,021
But you know,

1822
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:36,950
every day I'm getting a little bit better,

1823
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,463
a little bit better,

1824
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,693
but I'm terrible.

1825
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,533
I suck.

1826
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,040
But he's tapping people out.

1827
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,090
He's getting taps.

1828
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,770
Of course he is passing the guard.

1829
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:45,120
He's getting,

1830
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,340
he,

1831
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,750
he loves twist her side control.

1832
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,830
He gets the Camorra from twitch.

1833
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,450
Just I control it was Eddie Bravo,

1834
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:50,620
that torture side control.

1835
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,440
He said that to me once.

1836
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:55,900
I wasn't even sure he's being
serious about Joe Rogan.

1837
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:58,480
Now I know why you liked that
twist is side control dog.

1838
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,323
That's your spot.

1839
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,110
I could see you camping out there.

1840
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,053
Joe Rogan

1841
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,590
turn it towards your feet.

1842
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,750
He is so,

1843
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,243
I love it.

1844
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,341
I love it.

1845
00:50:20,341 --> 00:50:20,770
It's,

1846
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,820
it's really um,

1847
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,290
it's given him a like something to work
towards and like it's given them an

1848
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,040
awesome way to do like

1849
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,270
real rigorous exercise.

1850
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:29,410
Yeah.

1851
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,370
And get healthy man.

1852
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:30,981
That's what you want.

1853
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:32,810
If you want to be healthy.

1854
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,171
Yeah.

1855
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:33,351
Well,

1856
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:34,310
you also,

1857
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,500
you can't ever give Joey advice,

1858
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:36,960
you know,

1859
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,410
to Joey's a strong man and he's a,

1860
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,480
he's a proud man and you know,

1861
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:42,320
he's beautiful.

1862
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:43,154
This is just,

1863
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,900
he's the rarest of rare birds.

1864
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:46,130
What makes him who he is though?

1865
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:47,270
There's certain guys like that,

1866
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:47,421
man,

1867
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:48,310
you don't want to change that for,

1868
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:48,890
you can't,

1869
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,161
you know,

1870
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:49,761
I've known,

1871
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:50,001
I mean,

1872
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,190
I've known Joey for a long time.

1873
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,630
You got to just let Joey be joy.

1874
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:54,301
But what he is,

1875
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,010
is awesome,

1876
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,540
you know?

1877
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:55,830
Yeah.

1878
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,860
And I just loved the fact that he's a,

1879
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,680
he's gotten like really
into being healthy,

1880
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:01,760
really into Jujitsu,

1881
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:03,080
really into comedy man,

1882
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:03,661
his comedy,

1883
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:04,400
he's killing it.

1884
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,430
He's traveled all over the
country now doing gigs every way,

1885
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,780
selling out everywhere.

1886
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,740
Joey's sound out like five shows
before he even gets into town.

1887
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,590
It was destroying.

1888
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,340
Destroying this podcast
is bigger than ever.

1889
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,031
Yeah.

1890
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:17,864
He's just,

1891
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,460
I'm so happy for that guy.

1892
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,510
I'm just so happy.

1893
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,344
I know him.

1894
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,140
His jujitsu story of how
he got into it is very,

1895
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,680
the most inspirational
digit two story ever.

1896
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:28,130
Man.

1897
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:28,510
There's a,

1898
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,660
that needs to be a documentary is uh,

1899
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,780
uh,

1900
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,080
um,

1901
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,640
how he got turned on to Jujitsu and,

1902
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,320
and following,

1903
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,153
following him around,

1904
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:36,930
train,

1905
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,280
you know,

1906
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,780
videotaping his training and all that.

1907
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,520
That's so inspirational.

1908
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:41,120
His story.

1909
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,780
Yeah.

1910
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,613
You know,

1911
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,740
if you listen to that story and
you don't want to do Jujitsu,

1912
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,010
you need a psychiatric evaluation.

1913
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,480
This is a good fight,

1914
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:50,840
man.

1915
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,950
We're missing a good fight.

1916
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,191
Yeah,

1917
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:55,030
I agree man.

1918
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,390
Um,

1919
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,223
but you know,

1920
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,320
kind of Jujitsu has that effect on people,

1921
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:01,420
so it's a really exciting,

1922
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:02,830
fun thing to do.

1923
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,390
What are you showing me?

1924
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:05,900
Their buddy?

1925
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,920
Is that Japanese necktie?

1926
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,563
Um,

1927
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,613
I can't see.

1928
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:10,950
Yeah,

1929
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,380
it looks a like a Doris.

1930
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:12,910
Let me see it again.

1931
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:13,743
It looked like a,

1932
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,890
like a guilt.

1933
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,310
You gotta take it from the top,

1934
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,761
go back,

1935
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:17,180
go back,

1936
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,900
go back.

1937
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,950
It's kind of like it.

1938
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,641
No,

1939
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:20,474
not as is,

1940
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,480
it's like a guillotine type doors,

1941
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,403
right?

1942
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,940
The body.

1943
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:29,840
Is it,

1944
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,680
what he's doing with his body is he's
placing it in the exact same place as you

1945
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:35,080
would with the Japanese necktie.

1946
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,230
Just his grip is different.

1947
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,580
Right.

1948
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,730
So it's like a Japanese necktie
with a different grip but similar.

1949
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,600
It's like a guillotine.

1950
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,331
Japanese men.

1951
00:52:42,331 --> 00:52:42,650
Yeah.

1952
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,590
It's in between and Jamie for all
the people that are listening,

1953
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:48,050
what was that fight that we were just
watching them and just talking about some

1954
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,860
retarded and I couldn't tell
by that name or something.

1955
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,900
Maybe it was a Japanese necktie.

1956
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,890
Say it one more time,

1957
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:55,500
Jamie.

1958
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,810
I was pulled out and you
can look and read them.

1959
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,070
We'll say it one more time anyway.

1960
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,320
It looks like a Japanese name.

1961
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,110
Talk to me.

1962
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,510
I mean if you look at his
placement of his left elbow.

1963
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,050
Yeah,

1964
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:03,771
his left shoulder.

1965
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:04,670
Those way down.

1966
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,890
See how far down his left shoulder,

1967
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:07,690
his and his,

1968
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:08,950
his perfect dickheads.

1969
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,070
Perfectly locked in.

1970
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,210
Go back.

1971
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:11,780
Go back.

1972
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,501
Here it is again.

1973
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:12,950
Here.

1974
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:13,440
You're saying this,

1975
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,390
the Japanese necktie.

1976
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,940
It is.

1977
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,710
Wait a minute.

1978
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,490
No,

1979
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:16,850
no.

1980
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:17,660
It's close.

1981
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,690
It's like in between and between a
guillotine and the Japanese actor.

1982
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,370
He might have his own version of his work.

1983
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:23,763
No,

1984
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,770
it's not quite the same,

1985
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:27,930
but it's still the fact that you
could see his hands in the front.

1986
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,500
It has got to stay in the
back of the form of guilt.

1987
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,290
Yeah,

1988
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,210
but isn't it interesting though that
there's like a lot of different ways to

1989
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,040
grip the guillotine?

1990
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,340
Right.

1991
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,820
There's a lot of different
ways to hold your hand,

1992
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,883
but they're all,

1993
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,530
they're all considered
gay teens but this choke,

1994
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,270
which is like pretty similar,

1995
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,410
like the head is trapped.

1996
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,490
It's twisted,

1997
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:45,840
left shoulders down,

1998
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,160
hands are coming up like this.

1999
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,810
The neck is getting wrench and crank.

2000
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,030
It's getting wrench and
cranked in both positions.

2001
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,670
Right.

2002
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,520
Manpower for that.

2003
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,850
It's getting cranked and [inaudible]
has arm evolved because the guy got that

2004
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,684
under hook on you.

2005
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,510
He's got like say if I'm getting it
and he's got his under hook on the left

2006
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:00,830
side.

2007
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:01,140
Yeah.

2008
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,530
My,

2009
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,280
my arm is a over hooking his arm and
then that's going behind his head and

2010
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:06,450
that's why I'm clamping down.

2011
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,820
I clamped down with like a scissors grip,

2012
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,730
but that guy looked like he
had like something like this.

2013
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,910
It was like almost like a
gable grip right out on.

2014
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,960
I could be wrong,

2015
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,120
but that didn't look
like a Japanese Necktie,

2016
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:18,870
but I couldn't.

2017
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:19,703
It was hard to tell what the,

2018
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,350
I dunno what it runs like
an arm and guillotine,

2019
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,611
but whatever it was.

2020
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,530
That guy's neck was getting cranked too.

2021
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,840
It wasn't just a the choke.

2022
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,861
It was a,

2023
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:29,700
it was a neck crank.

2024
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:30,600
Real bad trap.

2025
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,433
Where the chest?

2026
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,250
One more time.

2027
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,210
Let me see it one more time.

2028
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,860
It's super similar.

2029
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,330
Look at his right elbow.

2030
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,250
If he's doing a Japanese Necktie,

2031
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,380
his right elbow should be t rex here,

2032
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,750
but he looked like he was like that.

2033
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,111
Yeah.

2034
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:45,900
Maybe he just has a wide
open way of doing it.

2035
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,950
Can we see it again Jamie?

2036
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,440
Maybe it's just not the best way to do it.

2037
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,311
Mother Fucker,

2038
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:51,170
her Amy do.

2039
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,750
You don't want to show it to him
and y'all talk to him on the show.

2040
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:55,320
Bro.

2041
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,020
Don't do this like he gets
passionate about his work.

2042
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,100
This is important as Kim is calen stomping
on the grapes or some shells coming.

2043
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,700
I know it's coming in my sink.

2044
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,270
A teenage girl,

2045
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,710
he went in there and got
blueberries and cheese.

2046
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,760
You I'm wrong.

2047
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,610
Are So strange.

2048
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,040
We're going to start
with a light by bad ESCO.

2049
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,080
I'm wrong about that though.

2050
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:21,630
The right elbow wouldn't be t
rex in it because he couldn't be,

2051
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:22,570
because you have the overlook.

2052
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,280
There's a way it can be can be t
rex cause it's got the overhead.

2053
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,490
So it is a Japanese necktie.

2054
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:26,941
Fuck.

2055
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:27,774
It's so hard to tell.

2056
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,400
But he got the left shoulder down.

2057
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:29,641
Right,

2058
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:30,381
which is where you,

2059
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:32,730
you wouldn't be necessarily
there in a Doris,

2060
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,200
you would want the right shoulder down.

2061
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:34,441
Right?

2062
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:35,274
Correct.

2063
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,220
So the way he's doing it is
totally a Japanese necktie.

2064
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,300
Yeah it did because the head's
trap the exact same way.

2065
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,153
Trap the head.

2066
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,710
The neck is cranked in the exact same
direction and also he's got the leg tied

2067
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:46,831
up,

2068
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:47,341
which I like.

2069
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:50,700
I liked how he did it to how
he tied up the near side leg.

2070
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,370
It's for sure not a dark because his hips,

2071
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,670
his shoulder always wondered gentlemen,

2072
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,180
gentlemen to fight companions.

2073
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,000
Companions.

2074
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,430
That actually answered
a question that I had.

2075
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,350
I'm looking at it right
now and I was always like,

2076
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,880
what's the best leg to tie up?

2077
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:08,060
Cause I would always tie
up whatever legacy matter.

2078
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,121
I always said that.

2079
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:10,290
But if you look at that,

2080
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:11,610
if he ties up the left leg,

2081
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,110
he doesn't have that.

2082
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:15,540
He can't move with that right leg.

2083
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,580
Or excuse me if he ties up the right leg,

2084
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:18,011
the way he's got it,

2085
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:18,630
like there,

2086
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,141
he can't,

2087
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:20,520
that other legs aren't
helping them as much.

2088
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:20,821
Correct.

2089
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:22,110
If he ties up the other leg,

2090
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,990
then he can get that right leg under
him and he can use it to manipulate.

2091
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,770
Is Russia more pressures
is he wasn't using.

2092
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,120
He immediately,

2093
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,310
Shit stomped on dudes.

2094
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,950
Right thigh with his left foot
and that's how you escape you.

2095
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,340
You'd get your leg out and spin.

2096
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,900
You got to get,

2097
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,380
if you can get that leg free,

2098
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,070
you're fucked.

2099
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:42,341
I know.

2100
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:42,670
Like look,

2101
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:42,870
look,

2102
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,780
look how he has his legs.

2103
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,820
He's got to kick his leg free.

2104
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,200
He's got to kick it free or you're done.

2105
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,000
That's the first thing you gotta do this.

2106
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,140
You would kick it.

2107
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,370
He would kick out the right leg.

2108
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,750
Yeah.

2109
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,583
Push it away.

2110
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,620
The leg that's caught.

2111
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,560
Use your free leg.

2112
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:55,331
It's just like a leg lock.

2113
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:56,340
Someone's attacking that leg.

2114
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,040
Kick it free.

2115
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,940
But here's a question.

2116
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:58,990
Here's a real good question.

2117
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,630
If you were in a position like
that or somewhere similar,

2118
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:04,090
and will you have access to kick the knee?

2119
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:08,800
Can you kick someone's knee on the
ground when you're grappling with it?

2120
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,213
Yeah.

2121
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,350
How come no one's ever done that?

2122
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,780
No one's like attack the knee.

2123
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,520
Like no one's ever been in a position.

2124
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,280
Like maybe they have site control or
something like that and they'd drop acts

2125
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,570
kicks down on someone's knee,

2126
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,940
just attack their knee from there.

2127
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,773
I'd have to see it,

2128
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,840
but it feels like you should be able
to definitely attack the thighs.

2129
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:26,200
You're saying,

2130
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,850
you're saying in a
grappling tournament like,

2131
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:28,031
no,

2132
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:28,151
no,

2133
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:28,481
no,

2134
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:28,691
no,

2135
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:28,991
no,

2136
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:29,111
no.

2137
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:29,950
In a grappling position,

2138
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,520
someone who has someone in but does it,

2139
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,363
you ever see it?

2140
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,423
No.

2141
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,190
Maybe that'll fuck up your balance,

2142
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,020
but,

2143
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,731
but in that guy,

2144
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:44,230
in that situation where
that guy is getting choked,

2145
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,790
if he could have kicked,

2146
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,250
if he kicked at the knee itself,

2147
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,151
like that would be,

2148
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:50,470
this isn't a good position for it.

2149
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:50,970
No.

2150
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:51,300
He's like,

2151
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,133
can do his job.

2152
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,640
He's got his shit that like free.

2153
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,580
He's got to kick that leg.

2154
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:55,414
Freeing and it's,

2155
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,021
this is not,

2156
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:56,890
I guess not going to exam.

2157
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:57,820
You have flat on your back.

2158
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:02,380
Is there ever a time where you can kick
someone's legs when you're holding them

2159
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:03,214
down

2160
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,403
and pride.

2161
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,730
A good combo would be if you get them out,

2162
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:10,640
pop off,

2163
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,650
stand up stones.

2164
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:12,973
Yeah.

2165
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:13,750
Walk away.

2166
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,980
He did that to Dan Henderson.

2167
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,080
Pop up on the mountain and you stand up.

2168
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:17,501
Boom.

2169
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:18,790
Like that's something you'd have to Pratt.

2170
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:19,091
That's a,

2171
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,540
that's a combo as a combo
and it's so effective.

2172
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:22,961
Move.

2173
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:23,794
It's weird.

2174
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,030
It's weird.

2175
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:27,400
Like what effective moves
are legal and what are not.

2176
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,620
One of the most under utilized kicks,

2177
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,310
um,

2178
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,800
in my opinion are those,

2179
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:32,020
uh,

2180
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,970
Hixon those that a trail leg curl kicks
while you have someone's back that's

2181
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,331
legal.

2182
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,260
Now it's legal.

2183
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:39,123
It wasn't,

2184
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,210
no,

2185
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,460
it wasn't a tax to the kidney.

2186
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,990
They were considered a tax to the kidney.

2187
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,090
It's one of the new revisions in this.

2188
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,281
No,

2189
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:46,370
no,

2190
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,650
I'm not talking about from full guard.

2191
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,371
I'm not talking about,

2192
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:49,510
you're talking about from back mouth.

2193
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,410
You have the guys back.

2194
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,030
Remember what Hickson was doing to Zulu.

2195
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:52,461
Oh yeah,

2196
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,020
yeah.

2197
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,880
Those kicks to the abdomen.

2198
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:55,743
So the abdomen,

2199
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,070
why aren't they doing it?

2200
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,040
Why aren't people doing that?

2201
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,800
Who was the last guy
that did write a book?

2202
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,300
I feel like Cole Miller did.

2203
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:02,470
That should be normal shit.

2204
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:02,591
Yeah.

2205
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:02,830
Cole,

2206
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,830
Cole Miller do that in front of you and
then the guy's defendant and then he

2207
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:08,780
comes up and chokes exactly
how you set up the jokes.

2208
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,073
It's true.

2209
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:11,963
Well

2210
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,290
budgeted Penn was now at least guys
can attack when they're on their back.

2211
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:20,030
They can kidney kick and
it makes someone to bark.

2212
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,501
Oh beautiful.

2213
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:24,290
I'm happy they're making
preps are very good.

2214
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,011
Barry shot.

2215
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:25,151
So,

2216
00:59:25,151 --> 00:59:25,560
so when you,

2217
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,330
when you're,

2218
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,710
when somebody is in your card,

2219
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:28,544
you can do kidney,

2220
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,910
kidney kicked them rice.

2221
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,380
Wow.

2222
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:30,770
Yeah.

2223
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,730
That's huge.

2224
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,060
It's got to protect the kid.

2225
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,390
Well you get not going to
be able to just lay there.

2226
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:35,990
There'll be,

2227
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,120
it's another offensive
option for the grappler.

2228
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,300
So if you're in a full guard
position and someone has good kicks,

2229
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,210
like say if you get some Anderson
silver type character was good kicks,

2230
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,400
he can fuck your backup man.

2231
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:46,701
God.

2232
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:47,840
And when you do get free,

2233
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:48,411
you break free.

2234
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:52,250
You could be all bunched up and tightened
up just from eating those heel kicks,

2235
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,820
danger there that you can actually create.

2236
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:57,020
You can cause internal bleeding.

2237
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,330
That'll,

2238
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,790
that'll mess with them later on.

2239
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,181
Yeah.

2240
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,680
This is going to be a
lot of internal bleeding,

2241
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:01,250
son.

2242
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:01,820
Really?

2243
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,960
You're in a cage fight,

2244
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,053
man.

2245
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,650
We gotta stop the kidney injury.

2246
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:07,071
Listen man,

2247
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:10,940
how can you say you could stop kidney
injuries but you won't stop a spinning

2248
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,300
back kick to the ribs.

2249
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:12,501
Yeah,

2250
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:13,370
but that's one kick.

2251
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:13,970
I feel like it was.

2252
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,510
It's a constitution as goes,

2253
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:15,890
you know.

2254
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,431
Listen man,

2255
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:18,950
if someone like some elite guy like a,

2256
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:21,720
a Wonderboy spinning back
kicks you in the ribs.

2257
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:21,990
Yeah.

2258
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,651
You're going to be,

2259
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:24,750
he's crying over him kitchen.

2260
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,230
The real,

2261
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:25,790
yeah.

2262
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,360
Oh yeah.

2263
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,310
Ask Brock how that dude over him that
that left round kick to the ribs that he

2264
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:32,990
landed on Brock before he put them away.

2265
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,380
Ah,

2266
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,213
fuck off.

2267
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,141
Oh my God.

2268
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:37,700
Giant thighs and that normous ass.

2269
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,563
I'd rather get kicked.

2270
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,000
He was an ovary and po and ovary.

2271
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:41,843
When he fought,

2272
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,570
when he fought Brock was Uber him too.

2273
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:44,901
There was,

2274
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:45,830
when he was at his biggest,

2275
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:48,080
did you notice when Pilo gay
take body shots like that?

2276
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:49,040
There's a pause.

2277
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,830
There's that like they're like
they go and then they fall.

2278
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,611
They say,

2279
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,230
I'm not sure,

2280
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:56,990
but they say that's because your liver
gets lifted up and when it falls back

2281
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:57,231
down.

2282
01:00:57,231 --> 01:00:58,820
Somebody told me that that's
why there's that pause.

2283
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,580
So you watch guys who get
hit so of you guys got watch.

2284
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:02,271
If you watch it,

2285
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:03,110
there's anybody that takes,

2286
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,880
there's a pause,

2287
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,650
you know he used to train,

2288
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,120
fall,

2289
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,560
hit like that and fallen down.

2290
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,493
Leo Machida,

2291
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,510
he used to train as if he got hit in the
body and practice falling down to his

2292
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:11,990
back.

2293
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,823
Whoa.

2294
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,240
First Guy I've ever seen do it.

2295
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,010
One of his buddies,

2296
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,300
I forget who it was,

2297
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,960
lost a fight by getting a body shot
and he'd just kind of crumbled,

2298
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:23,200
went to the ground and Leila,

2299
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:23,511
I was like,

2300
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:23,811
no,

2301
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:24,950
we do this all the time.

2302
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:29,300
And then showed him like that he kept
doing reps like in Hin balling up into

2303
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:30,140
into garden,

2304
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,690
bringing the guy down and
your card to give you time,

2305
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,890
um,

2306
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,990
is how is he suspended right now?

2307
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,220
Yeah,

2308
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:37,611
I'm not sure.

2309
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,300
I think so.

2310
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,370
I know he just opened
up a gym in California,

2311
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,180
but he,

2312
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,200
something happened.

2313
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,080
He tested,

2314
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,330
yes.

2315
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,320
Reverse with the same thing.

2316
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:44,931
Dan Henderson.

2317
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:45,081
Right.

2318
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:45,914
And He tests positive.

2319
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,903
What was it for?

2320
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,080
I Dunno Jamie.

2321
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,940
See if he could find that out.

2322
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,140
That fucking card though.

2323
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,280
There's your car to the year.

2324
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,680
As far as number of white paper,

2325
01:01:53,681 --> 01:01:54,514
the number was

2326
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,110
better.

2327
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,170
The cards get better now cause you'd
think you get new blood in there.

2328
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,250
I bet the new owners want to go.

2329
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,084
Let's fucking,

2330
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,560
none of that's new blood.

2331
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,643
The blood brother.

2332
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,500
That's how new blood,

2333
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,000
I mean the power of you mean,

2334
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,340
oh you only might sailing the suits.

2335
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:10,971
They might say,

2336
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:11,211
Hey,

2337
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:12,044
let's fucking make,

2338
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,130
let's come in without fucking with
some fire and blow up these cards.

2339
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,800
Let's just get crazy with
it or keep it the same.

2340
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:19,620
Nothing.

2341
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,720
Just so much you can do.

2342
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:23,440
You need a guy who loves fighting
and knows fighting did it.

2343
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:24,510
Usually they'll suits,

2344
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:24,970
don't know.

2345
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,803
Yeah.

2346
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,860
Corporate big corporations
that get involved doesn't
necessarily mean that's why

2347
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,030
Dana stayed on board.

2348
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:30,151
He,

2349
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:30,421
you know,

2350
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:32,230
he's a fucking genius with fighting,

2351
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:32,971
so Joe silver,

2352
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:36,090
he can't get rid of those guys
and have suits who you can never,

2353
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,931
it would never work.

2354
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:38,820
You can never have a suit
run the company either.

2355
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,510
You need,

2356
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:44,220
Dana was a complex
design to a crazy place.

2357
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,503
They knows.

2358
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,130
You know.

2359
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,550
You don't have to be a genius
to come up with dream matchup.

2360
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,060
This is going to be an interesting fight.

2361
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:50,760
Average friend.

2362
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,421
This is your boy,

2363
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:51,780
right?

2364
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,290
Correct.

2365
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,190
Zak Cummings,

2366
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,320
he's fighting this upon Zenobia Yoga.

2367
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,250
Who is a beast.

2368
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,420
Tad Cummings is a welterweight.

2369
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,510
That is crazy.

2370
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:01,950
That is such a big dude.

2371
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:02,760
Is He really?

2372
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,840
Oh yeah man.

2373
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,580
Like he's happy.

2374
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,260
He's a big fellow.

2375
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:11,820
I mean he's got to walk
around well over 200 pounds.

2376
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,320
I think he's an underdog in this fight.

2377
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,370
Ponds and Nobel's.

2378
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:14,881
No joke,

2379
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:15,061
man.

2380
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:15,894
I no joke.

2381
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:16,921
This fucking,

2382
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:18,390
she's telling you I did yourself.

2383
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,051
I know it's,

2384
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:20,650
and this is a nice Barbaresco.

2385
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,230
This is 2008.

2386
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,640
It's like a meal gentlemen.

2387
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,290
Look at that.

2388
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:24,671
Oh yeah.

2389
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,060
Pounds of,

2390
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,220
nobody was a scary guy.

2391
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:30,510
Serious knockout striker beast of a guy

2392
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,510
who was [inaudible].

2393
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,400
He's this handsome guy,

2394
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:36,840
but just put in a headlock and him.

2395
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,650
Yeah.

2396
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,990
Everybody pretty buddy.

2397
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,340
It's such a crazy,

2398
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,110
crazy look even.

2399
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:43,391
Yeah,

2400
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:44,224
it's tough fight.

2401
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,360
Tough fight to call.

2402
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,010
Um,

2403
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,300
what w what do we need to talk about?

2404
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,860
We need to talk about
the Tyron Woodley fine.

2405
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:50,890
She spells a,

2406
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,601
I'll tell you what I do.

2407
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:52,434
If Woodley,

2408
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,780
if I'm scrooge McDuck if I'm Dana,

2409
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,100
this is what you do.

2410
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:56,790
You,

2411
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,510
so the,

2412
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,870
the,

2413
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,500
the,

2414
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,790
the loyal pure.

2415
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,560
So the sport can say Wonderboy is next,

2416
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:01,921
right?

2417
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,470
We can't do that cause cell that paper,

2418
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,500
you get 300 bucks.

2419
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,211
That ain't happen.

2420
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:06,150
And neither one's a big draw.

2421
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,381
It sucks to say,

2422
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,680
I love both those guys area.

2423
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,690
Let's just be real here.

2424
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,050
So you do the GSP fight
to make Woodlea star.

2425
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,700
So he can be a paper view headliner.

2426
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,840
Let's cause he's not a headline.

2427
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:17,130
Let's get more realistic.

2428
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:17,970
Um,

2429
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,040
if GSP actually wants to fight,

2430
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:20,903
which he does.

2431
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,840
Is that true?

2432
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,010
He asked for the fight.

2433
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:23,910
Um,

2434
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,470
if he actually wants to fight,

2435
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,680
I feel like GSP gets a free pass.

2436
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,560
He gets a free pass right to the front.

2437
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,403
Like Lesnar.

2438
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,181
No,

2439
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:32,361
no,

2440
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:33,190
no,

2441
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:33,450
no,

2442
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:33,750
no,

2443
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:33,961
no,

2444
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:34,141
no,

2445
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:34,780
no.

2446
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,510
I mean you got to let
him fight for the title.

2447
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:37,591
He's George.

2448
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:42,080
Goddamn Saint Peters stepped away
as the champion championing title.

2449
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:42,870
I,

2450
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,703
that's what I feel.

2451
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:47,340
So the question is does
he fight now and do they,

2452
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,060
do they fight?

2453
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,590
Does he fight Tyron or does he fight
the winner of Tyron versus Wonderboy or

2454
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,110
does Wonderboy get or does rather,

2455
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:55,440
um,

2456
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,050
does tire and get paid
and he fights Nick Diaz.

2457
01:04:58,740 --> 01:04:58,921
Well,

2458
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:00,860
he get paid more if he fights nick DSD.

2459
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,171
Listen,

2460
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:02,130
if I was Tyron Woodley,

2461
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,410
I'd be asking for the Nick Diaz fight.

2462
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,191
That's what he's doing,

2463
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:05,890
why he wants,

2464
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,790
he wants to GSP or nick,

2465
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:08,621
if he's a bigger guy,

2466
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:09,510
doesn't want wonderful.

2467
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:09,860
He goes,

2468
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,560
I want money.

2469
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,420
You know how much stoner
money is out there?

2470
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,310
Not Nick Diaz.

2471
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,580
If I don't think the UFC maybe
even realizes what they have.

2472
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,020
I think they do because
they put up Nick Diaz,

2473
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:21,760
hey,

2474
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,430
they should be putting up
with everything and more.

2475
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:24,970
Listen,

2476
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:25,803
he's the best.

2477
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,540
All this like flying him
to press conferences,

2478
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,950
give him a pass,

2479
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,570
give them a pass on that.

2480
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,280
Like what is he going to say this going
to be so you're just going to annoy you.

2481
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,650
Just let them try.

2482
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:36,590
Let them try.

2483
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,840
We all know what Nick
Diaz is capable of real,

2484
01:05:38,841 --> 01:05:39,041
you know,

2485
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:39,840
it's scary.

2486
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,560
It was how much press Nate Diaz is,

2487
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:42,394
but I love it.

2488
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,840
He's been doing a lot,

2489
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:44,810
a lot of progress.

2490
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:45,221
He's on that.

2491
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:46,290
Conor McGregor press tours

2492
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,550
bashes Wonderboy Thompson says he should
be able to pick his next opponent.

2493
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,630
Well as Dana White,

2494
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,510
if we want to entertainment
and you want numbers,

2495
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:59,650
you do GSP or or Nikki is 100% if
you're appears to have the sport,

2496
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:00,430
you do Wonderboy.

2497
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,000
I agree.

2498
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,650
I agree 100% but the bottom line is
Tyron Woodley is the fucking champion.

2499
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,401
And when you're they champion,

2500
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:10,360
you can say all the crazy shit you
want that you can't take your magic.

2501
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:11,194
My opponent.

2502
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:11,710
Nope.

2503
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,910
I want to get the money.

2504
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:18,030
That's fucking triangle Wonderboy and
fucking Fox sports one year on a Wednesday

2505
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,920
night and you're going to
shut your fucking mouth.

2506
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,311
No,

2507
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,491
no,

2508
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:22,324
you can't say that.

2509
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,250
That's exactly what they can do.

2510
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:28,870
The same car GSP versus Nick Diaz
and we'll do versus Wonderboy.

2511
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:29,500
Same car.

2512
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:29,711
Nah,

2513
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:30,131
fuck that.

2514
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:31,030
Cause you're him killing

2515
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,290
versus Nick Diaz cards,

2516
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,540
man call.

2517
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,980
No super cards.

2518
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,871
No listen,

2519
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:38,704
let it spread it out.

2520
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Do you know that John Danaher made
a post recently saying that GSP,

2521
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,040
he put it on Instagram saying that GSPS
camp for the Nick Diaz fight was one of

2522
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,930
the best camps he ever had came out of it.

2523
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,640
Injury-Free super healthy.

2524
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,300
And then the night before the fight
drank some watermelon juice that had been

2525
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:58,090
sitting out for too long
and got deathly ill,

2526
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,800
was throwing up all night.

2527
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,480
The watermelon juice drinking.

2528
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:01,990
I Dunno.

2529
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,160
Probably something crazy bet.

2530
01:07:03,161 --> 01:07:03,880
And so he was,

2531
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,810
he came to that fight,

2532
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:09,100
he came in a fight depleted and they
devise a strategy of conserving his energy

2533
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,360
and not engaging too much.

2534
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,140
Wow.

2535
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,650
And when to time is take down,

2536
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,533
she goes crazy.

2537
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,261
And then when the,

2538
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:15,610
when they came in to see the wraps,

2539
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:19,750
he was talking about they
wrapped GSPs hands and uh,

2540
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:20,703
the uh,

2541
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,290
Ds camp wanting to see
them wrap his hands.

2542
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,320
So they had to come in and then he said
that George had to like imitate this a

2543
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,650
sense of vitality,

2544
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:30,250
you know,

2545
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:30,940
like,

2546
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,320
cause he was like so depleted,

2547
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,620
right?

2548
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,870
He had to like pretend
he feels fucking great.

2549
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:35,920
I feel fucking great.

2550
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:36,851
How did it go?

2551
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:37,650
Kick some ass,

2552
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:37,940
you know?

2553
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:38,450
And he's like,

2554
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,040
wow,

2555
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,060
pump it up.

2556
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,230
And then when they left here was like,

2557
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:41,910
Oh God,

2558
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,370
God,

2559
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:42,580
God,

2560
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,320
I don't have time to do this shit myself,

2561
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,980
champ.

2562
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:48,070
But didn't make DSA that someone
drugged him in that fight.

2563
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,370
Could you imagine if
someone drug both of them,

2564
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:52,420
if that's what was going on?

2565
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,340
They didn't even know it was so many drug.

2566
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:55,174
Both guys,

2567
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,480
some asshole.

2568
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:58,420
It was like maybe two guys were gamblers.

2569
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,520
Drug is bro,

2570
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,450
fuck gamblers.

2571
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:01,840
Let me,

2572
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,860
let me tell you something man.

2573
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:07,720
If you are around some shady degenerate
gamblers and they put some money on you

2574
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:10,900
and they see Eddie Bravo out for the night
in the town and they know that you're

2575
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:15,500
supposed to be fighting someone the next
day and they can drug you and jack the

2576
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:16,010
fight.

2577
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,080
If you read the book about,

2578
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,210
there's a book written by
David Remnick about um,

2579
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,120
the fight between Muhammad
Ali and Sonny Liston.

2580
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:24,680
And in round,

2581
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:25,610
I think seven,

2582
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:30,290
they put something on Sonny Liston
gloves that blinded him and he said,

2583
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,071
I can't see,

2584
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:31,851
I can't see.

2585
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:32,581
And I think it was done.

2586
01:08:32,581 --> 01:08:33,750
Dee who said kept moving.

2587
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:34,110
Just moving.

2588
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:34,281
Yeah,

2589
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,720
just keep moving and keep boxing.

2590
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:36,830
And it was a huge turning point.

2591
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,060
I said they put something on the gloves.

2592
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:38,933
Yup.

2593
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,720
One but they did some shady shit.

2594
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,520
But Henry Cooper,

2595
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,770
that's a tinfoil hat.

2596
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,910
He wouldn't let anybody touch his water
bottle because they thought they were

2597
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:47,451
going to poison him.

2598
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:49,080
So he had his water bottle wrapped.

2599
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,870
I sounds like he rap tape around as well.

2600
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:51,704
I believe that

2601
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:54,890
if you watch the Sonny Liston fight,

2602
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:55,371
it's clear.

2603
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:56,570
You hear him say it in the corner.

2604
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:57,404
I've watched the fight.

2605
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:57,801
It's a,

2606
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,660
it's an interesting one too because I'm,

2607
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:00,500
uh,

2608
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,850
Mike Tyson's old manager was
the narrator for the fight.

2609
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:05,271
You know,

2610
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:06,590
Mike Tyson's old manager,

2611
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:06,951
he had that,

2612
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:07,400
uh,

2613
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,990
the Jewish guy that died,

2614
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,480
who was his confidant?

2615
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,613
It was,

2616
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,371
God damn it.

2617
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:17,810
There was a couple different guys that
handled Mike Tyson after something.

2618
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:18,620
Jacobs,

2619
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,500
the black Jewish guy.

2620
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:20,360
Now he's a white guy.

2621
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,283
It was something,

2622
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:22,570
God dammit,

2623
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:27,850
it was a Kevin Rooney something Jacobs
and that was like the whole crew that was

2624
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,700
leftover.

2625
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:28,971
Anyway,

2626
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:29,870
this guy was the,

2627
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:29,961
uh,

2628
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:33,290
the narrator for those old fights because
they didn't really have audio for them

2629
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,760
to like was correct.

2630
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:38,720
But more interesting example
is when Ali's camp cheated,

2631
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,880
when Henry Cooper caught
him with a left hook,

2632
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,210
Henry Cooper caught him with
a left hook and sat him down.

2633
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:48,350
Henry Cooper was his bad ass British
heavyweight boxer back in the day.

2634
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:53,590
And when Muhammad Ali was still Cassius
clay and recoup or correct him and he

2635
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,880
went down and when he
went back to the corner,

2636
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,400
he had no idea what the fuck was going on.

2637
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,460
He was out on his feet.

2638
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:01,670
So Angelo Dundee took a
razor blade to his gloves,

2639
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,470
cut his gloves open.

2640
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,880
So you got to change the gloves.

2641
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,880
The gloves are cut.

2642
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:07,120
It moves smart.

2643
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,420
That Dante's shit smart dude back then.

2644
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:13,700
So Ali has a chance to recover.

2645
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:14,750
Several minutes go by.

2646
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:15,590
They change the gloves,

2647
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,630
they retire him up there.

2648
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,000
Retape them several minutes
go by and then he fucks.

2649
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,580
Henry Cooper up gets get some
cut and winds up stopping.

2650
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:23,414
I'm on cuts.

2651
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:24,400
Did it work?

2652
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah,

2653
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,833
but don't want to see it.

2654
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:26,540
See,

2655
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,720
watch Henry Cooper drops
Muhammad Ali because I mean dude,

2656
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:34,721
he got Joe romped like that's very
similar to your role at UL in the corner.

2657
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,840
By the time you were just
that Tim Kennedy fight,

2658
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:43,070
Sam Kennedy should have gotten a wheel
gate kept Tim Kennedy should have gotten

2659
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:46,010
the wind because he was not willing
to get off his stool and fight.

2660
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:46,700
At the end of the round,

2661
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,570
he knew correct.

2662
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,560
It was the end of the,

2663
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:48,770
uh,

2664
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,603
the buzzer.

2665
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,421
But then again,

2666
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:50,681
when,

2667
01:10:50,681 --> 01:10:51,800
when are we going to see him fight?

2668
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,900
Tim Kennedy Police would fucked up.

2669
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,250
Tim Kennedy after that fight.

2670
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,700
Is that here?

2671
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,680
Those are the gloves,

2672
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,330
the actual glove that it was split.

2673
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,920
Wow.

2674
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,750
She got the fuck out of that
video of him cutting it.

2675
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,090
They like covered each other up.

2676
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:06,710
And if they weren't
doing videos back then,

2677
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:08,780
they had a film of the
fight and then you know,

2678
01:11:08,781 --> 01:11:12,680
there was probably one hand you're
saying there's no concrete evidence.

2679
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,370
Well that gloves,

2680
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,760
the gloves are caught up and
then they have the gloves.

2681
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:17,580
It happened naturally.

2682
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,390
It could be,

2683
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,223
it could be like,

2684
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,801
hey,

2685
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,750
you're losing brand.

2686
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,800
See the biggest transparency
theorist and he just

2687
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,871
watches left hook,

2688
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,471
check it out right here.

2689
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:29,980
Right here against real fam.

2690
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,170
Oh,

2691
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:32,190
shot tog.

2692
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,510
I've never seen him get dropped like that.

2693
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,440
That's what I'm talking about too.

2694
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,840
He got fucked up,

2695
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,520
look at him and that's
the end of the round.

2696
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,830
The very end of the round
he gets up and he sits down.

2697
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,131
So,

2698
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:41,371
I mean,

2699
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:44,610
there is like one second
before we get this check.

2700
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:45,444
This left hook.

2701
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:46,750
Ooh,

2702
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,270
that shit is perfect.

2703
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,273
British pounds.

2704
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,950
The corner of the whole minute.

2705
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:53,970
Can we see that?

2706
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:54,590
I don't know.

2707
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:55,410
It's a good question.

2708
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:55,651
Oh,

2709
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:58,590
you can see him in front of him
and they put smelling salts to,

2710
01:11:58,591 --> 01:12:00,010
that was the other thing they used to do.

2711
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,280
You smelling salts,

2712
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,263
you know,

2713
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:07,070
we're missing your boys that Cummins
and ponds and Obo throw in dignity.

2714
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,860
Dayday down my story with
the cocaine and all that.

2715
01:12:10,861 --> 01:12:11,820
It's supposed to be legit.

2716
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:12,600
Is that legit?

2717
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,490
It's supposed to be legit.

2718
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,580
I never heard of liquid
cocaine being drank like that.

2719
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,240
That which is,

2720
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,810
it could have been some other stimulant.

2721
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,240
She doesn't have to have been you,

2722
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:20,881
but everybody was like,

2723
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:23,880
it's cocaine is cocaine speed
could easily been speed.

2724
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:24,481
I think you're dead,

2725
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:25,314
right?

2726
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:25,711
He did.

2727
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,100
Yeah.

2728
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:26,461
Either way.

2729
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:26,970
Your party,

2730
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:31,970
that Guy Panama Lewis was busted for a
bunch of different things and one of them

2731
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:32,850
was,

2732
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:33,930
he had this fight,

2733
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,531
uh,

2734
01:12:34,531 --> 01:12:36,270
between a Billy Collins,

2735
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,250
I think it was Billy
Collins Jr was his name.

2736
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,930
And the other guy was
a Louie Resto and um,

2737
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:47,990
they took Louie Resto is padding out of
his gloves and when he fought this kid,

2738
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:50,161
Billy,

2739
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:52,590
I think it was Billy Collins
Jr I think that was his name.

2740
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,570
GMC,

2741
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,403
if that's correct.

2742
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,040
Louie Resto.

2743
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,590
It's a Louie Resto glove controversy.

2744
01:12:59,250 --> 01:12:59,821
So anyway,

2745
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:01,920
Panama Lewis was the guy who did that too.

2746
01:13:01,921 --> 01:13:03,360
He was involved in that.

2747
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:04,891
Like he,

2748
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:05,160
uh,

2749
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,020
he was banned from boxing after that.

2750
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,000
He wasn't going right.

2751
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:08,721
He was so,

2752
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:09,480
it was a cheater.

2753
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,380
He had went through that thing with Aaron
Pryor and then he'd went through this,

2754
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,070
this new one.

2755
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,200
But who knows what the
fuck was in that bottle.

2756
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,280
It could've been anything.

2757
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,540
It could've been a stimulant,

2758
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:22,260
but it could have been like some
sort of fucking sport drink.

2759
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,430
It could have been,

2760
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:23,761
you know,

2761
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:28,320
something with some sort of a nutritional
supplement in it that maybe is illegal

2762
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:28,620
now.

2763
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,371
It wasn't illegal then.

2764
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,031
Who the fuck knows?

2765
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:30,841
I don't know what he put in there.

2766
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:32,010
I think they might've used speed a lot.

2767
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:33,120
I know Andre Agassi in his,

2768
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:33,930
uh,

2769
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:38,930
in his autobiography he talks about how
his dad used to give him speed head and

2770
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:40,830
like in the middle,

2771
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:41,690
cause you're not just getting those,

2772
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:43,340
those matches last four,

2773
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:43,741
five,

2774
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:45,120
they're five matches until a long time,

2775
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:45,600
four hours,

2776
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,290
four hours or whenever it was.

2777
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:47,910
And he would,

2778
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,280
he would give his son and his brother's,

2779
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:50,791
he'd be like,

2780
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:51,011
Hey,

2781
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:51,960
you got to take this.

2782
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:52,891
And you know,

2783
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,440
pat may up those little
fuckers went nuts on it.

2784
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:56,274
Oh yeah.

2785
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,540
Well that was the,

2786
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,081
to that,

2787
01:13:58,081 --> 01:13:58,381
to Mike,

2788
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:01,350
his speed was a huge
thing in baseball as well.

2789
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,370
A lot of guys were taking
speed and even Adderall.

2790
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:09,090
It's always been that all
still big medical school.

2791
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,800
Medical school was always big.

2792
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,330
It was always big among
pipe fighter pilots.

2793
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,880
Louie Resto and who,

2794
01:14:14,881 --> 01:14:15,191
who was it?

2795
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:16,480
What was the other gentleman's name?

2796
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,440
Billy Collins.

2797
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,730
Was it Collins?

2798
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,700
Everybody see the name is a
documentary about it called counseling.

2799
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,730
Have you used Adderall?

2800
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,410
Billy Conn?

2801
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:23,561
No,

2802
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:24,220
I have not.

2803
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:24,980
You haven't used the,

2804
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,530
I don't know Billy Collins Jr.

2805
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:26,641
Yeah,

2806
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:27,200
so I was right.

2807
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,090
That's good stuff.

2808
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,660
I did it once in college
with for some final write.

2809
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:33,640
This paper I took it and dude,

2810
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:35,710
I was a chatty Kathy.

2811
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,180
I got nothing done.

2812
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,051
I sort of walked by like,

2813
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:38,141
Hey,

2814
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:38,974
where are you doing?

2815
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,560
Nothing fucking up for six hours.

2816
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:42,640
Just talking straight.

2817
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:44,680
You boy Zack comments just
landed a hard body kick.

2818
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,181
Dude.

2819
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,690
I didn't watch one round on these guys.

2820
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,940
These guys are welterweights.

2821
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,300
Yeah,

2822
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:49,930
that's crazy.

2823
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,890
There's giants.

2824
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,210
Cummings is a big boy.

2825
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,010
How?

2826
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:53,651
How big is he,

2827
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:53,980
Brendan?

2828
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,813
Six one.

2829
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,130
Whoa,

2830
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:56,431
that's cool.

2831
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:57,264
We okay?

2832
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:57,821
Definitely.

2833
01:14:57,821 --> 01:14:58,654
It looks like it.

2834
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,220
Oh,

2835
01:14:59,220 --> 01:14:59,420
okay.

2836
01:14:59,420 --> 01:14:59,741
Clip.

2837
01:14:59,741 --> 01:15:00,370
Here we go.

2838
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:00,521
Ooh.

2839
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:01,180
He likes it.

2840
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,013
Oh Shit.

2841
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,810
Just get down and they'll
be all right back up.

2842
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:05,141
Woo.

2843
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:06,550
Just missed with the hook of death.

2844
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,230
The breathless to that six foot.

2845
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:09,510
Yeah.

2846
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:09,720
Jodie,

2847
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,410
why one of these barriers
and knocked your socks off?

2848
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:11,651
No,

2849
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:12,484
I'm good.

2850
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,361
I mean they're,

2851
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:13,810
fuck.

2852
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,240
I've been balls deep in Paris
and she might be the best black,

2853
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,630
big kick to the body by coming
to the end of the round.

2854
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,680
This is,

2855
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,910
this is so silly,

2856
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,250
Jason.

2857
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,020
Stay them is reviving is
Charles Bronson character.

2858
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:31,870
That guy would fuck both of you up.

2859
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,860
Hey man,

2860
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:35,150
easy and Olympic athletes.

2861
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:37,630
He was an Olympic diver.

2862
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:38,560
That's a big deal actually.

2863
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,603
Sure.

2864
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,320
Jessica Alba back.

2865
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,490
Tommy Lee Jones,

2866
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,383
a bad guy.

2867
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:43,811
Oh,

2868
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:44,644
he looks very day.

2869
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,473
He loves

2870
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,140
resurrect the same glasses.

2871
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,180
If they made that movie good,

2872
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,014
you'd be upset.

2873
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:54,890
Yeah.

2874
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,720
That was a really good
movie with an awesome plot.

2875
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:57,554
It's kind of hilarious.

2876
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,080
They took the guy in tap than you had
to wait for character development.

2877
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,200
Where's the actions?

2878
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,750
If somebody's gonna
get shot with the fuck,

2879
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:07,070
I've been 20 minutes and
then it's Goddamn movie do.

2880
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:11,260
He took the guy that made x Mokena and
they made him direct the new mechanic.

2881
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:11,591
You'd be like,

2882
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:12,610
what the fuck is going on?

2883
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,470
Who wrote this movie?

2884
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,390
You were wrong about,

2885
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,370
but that fucking Cloverfield.

2886
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,750
How dare you didn't like that?

2887
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,720
No.

2888
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,531
The ending sucked,

2889
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:20,860
right?

2890
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,570
Yes.

2891
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,301
I thought it was crazy.

2892
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,940
I thought it was amazing until the ending.

2893
01:16:23,941 --> 01:16:24,090
Right?

2894
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:24,731
And then he's like,

2895
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:25,600
what the fuck?

2896
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,920
Meanwhile that all that check could.

2897
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,421
I'm,

2898
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:28,660
I'm,

2899
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,500
I'm man,

2900
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,250
I'm in.

2901
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,290
I'll take both ends.

2902
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:31,930
Damn it.

2903
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:32,500
I like it.

2904
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,850
I like the ending of the first one.

2905
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:38,020
I like the ending of the sound was so
psi [inaudible] stupid fucking Shit.

2906
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,130
I love bigfoot.

2907
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,600
I wrote this tweet the other day.

2908
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:41,650
It was not even I was,

2909
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,990
it was half joking but not even half.

2910
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,430
It was at least 2% of my thoughts every
day are secretly hoping that big foot's

2911
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:49,264
real.

2912
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,250
I'm retarded man.

2913
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,500
I'm a bit big foot.

2914
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,140
Have a loopy like we have thoughts like,

2915
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:58,180
like you'll have a loop that
you think about all the time.

2916
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:58,691
You know what I mean?

2917
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:00,340
Like you come back to the same thing.

2918
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,740
I'll have arguments in my head with
people that had never happened.

2919
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,120
I have a really weird thing
that I think about every day.

2920
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:07,721
Wait a minute.

2921
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:09,790
What you get arguments
with people that like you

2922
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,711
take RJ,

2923
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:15,350
you're out at argument and they never
think we talk about it all the time.

2924
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:17,030
Like with my agent to no,

2925
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,310
no,

2926
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:17,530
no.

2927
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,530
I talk to them.

2928
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,880
It's,

2929
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,730
it goes nothing.

2930
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:20,590
How I thought it was going to go

2931
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,780
cause we were talking about this,

2932
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,110
a betrayal like that,

2933
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,870
like a like with a buddy.

2934
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:31,350
Like I know he's going to say something.

2935
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,181
So in my head I'm like,

2936
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:32,271
yeah,

2937
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:32,871
he's gonna say this,

2938
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:33,560
I'm going to do this.

2939
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,970
And I think you can say this though.

2940
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:35,361
I see me.

2941
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:35,571
He goes,

2942
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:36,500
nothing like that.

2943
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,491
He's like,

2944
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:38,240
yeah,

2945
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,240
he's off talking about your planning an
argument and then it doesn't go the way

2946
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,530
you planned it.

2947
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:47,900
There was nothing like that
plan I arguments do you play?

2948
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:52,610
I've hypothetical conversations
with important people in
my life and then when I

2949
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:53,211
seen it goes,

2950
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:58,210
nothing like the hypothetical adversarial
conversations about important you.

2951
01:17:58,530 --> 01:17:59,960
You're ready for the conversation,

2952
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:01,460
you're ready for the
debate and you're like,

2953
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:01,761
fuck,

2954
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:02,211
he crushes,

2955
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,390
you know,

2956
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:05,510
becomes all friendly.

2957
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:06,251
He's like,

2958
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:07,084
what's up bro?

2959
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:08,090
How's it going?

2960
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:08,570
That's it.

2961
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:13,570
I do the exact same thing and what I
also do the fuck you talking about,

2962
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:16,221
he's crazy.

2963
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:16,461
He's what?

2964
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:16,880
He's stolen.

2965
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,660
What I use.

2966
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,270
If somebody like did
something that I was like,

2967
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:20,540
Whoa,

2968
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,320
that's kind of mean,

2969
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:21,850
or whatever,

2970
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:23,480
then I'll extrapolate and I'll be like,

2971
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:23,721
what did,

2972
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:24,980
he was that way all the time.

2973
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:28,970
And I wonder if he shoved me and then
I want to be called me a bitch and then

2974
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:31,640
I'll just keep calling before now
and I'm having the same exact thing.

2975
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:33,680
I'm having a verbal argument in my car.

2976
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,260
I have done that.

2977
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,040
I have done.

2978
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,161
Yeah,

2979
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:37,820
you're right.

2980
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:38,031
No,

2981
01:18:38,031 --> 01:18:40,640
I get you now understand
he explained that better.

2982
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,110
You're thinking,

2983
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:42,531
okay,

2984
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:45,470
this is going to come at me with this
and he's going to come at me with that.

2985
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:45,801
Well,

2986
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:47,630
I got this ready to them
and I got that right.

2987
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:48,110
Correct.

2988
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:50,910
And you're like practicing your,

2989
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:51,670
yeah,

2990
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,240
I do that.

2991
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,270
And I think everybody does that.

2992
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,000
I do something even I think I do
something even more ridiculous.

2993
01:18:56,450 --> 01:19:01,450
I daily have a fantasy that I live in
a part of the world where gangs are

2994
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:06,731
running everything and you are terrorizing
my village or my Los Angeles run.

2995
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,860
And what I do then is I secretly,

2996
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:12,200
I push a cart of food cart.

2997
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:13,490
I'm humble,

2998
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,720
but I have a small gun with a silencer
and I kill all the bad guys quietly and

2999
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:17,901
they're like,

3000
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:18,381
well fuck,

3001
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:19,250
it's killing us man.

3002
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:20,210
What the fuck is going on?

3003
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,960
And I'm like,

3004
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,060
would you like another
plot of the professional?

3005
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:23,691
Yeah.

3006
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:27,290
That's literally how I think
about how I protect myself.

3007
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,041
Totally Sane.

3008
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:28,874
All of you.

3009
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:29,743
I feel

3010
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,673
weird.

3011
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:35,390
I thought something similar.

3012
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:36,630
I thought,

3013
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,350
no,

3014
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:38,190
this isn't what I'm talking.

3015
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:38,451
What if?

3016
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:43,130
What if you could figure out how long it
takes to kill someone with a choke and

3017
01:19:43,131 --> 01:19:46,940
then how long it takes to put him
in a vegetative state permanently.

3018
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:47,271
Well,

3019
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:47,841
you can do that.

3020
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:48,674
You mastered that.

3021
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,600
So like anybody,

3022
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:54,230
like you're like a vigilante and
anybody who deserves to be a vegetable,

3023
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:54,981
you're not going to kill him.

3024
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:57,520
Child molesters and you
hope you have a timer,

3025
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,580
you got 45 seconds,

3026
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,080
you let them go in their vegetable.

3027
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:00,950
You didn't kill him.

3028
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:02,220
That's genius to kill him.

3029
01:20:02,221 --> 01:20:03,054
But they're like,

3030
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:03,741
hold on,

3031
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:04,720
I hold a timer high.

3032
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,573
Hold the time.

3033
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,861
One by one.

3034
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:07,694
You just turn

3035
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:09,810
vegetables.

3036
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:12,300
That's amazing little maker.

3037
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,210
But then there's a guy that you didn't
hold that choke long enough and it wasn't

3038
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,040
lined up right.

3039
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:16,640
Oh look.

3040
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,473
Oh,

3041
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,423
you're like fuck.

3042
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,260
You've got to put them in
another harm trying to,

3043
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:21,901
you're like,

3044
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:22,734
Oh shit,

3045
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:24,000
you change it.

3046
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,010
You change it to an arm
triangle and you fucking,

3047
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:26,161
oh,

3048
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:27,450
I need 15 more seconds.

3049
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:28,020
Fuck.

3050
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,410
The cops are showing up and then you let
them go and then so basically you guys

3051
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,940
want to be like fake superhero.

3052
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,660
He's a vigilante to play.

3053
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,580
You're going to be super,

3054
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,780
there's a sick play.

3055
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:40,200
There's a sick plant called the
Toyer that's called veggies.

3056
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,960
Like there's festivals
everywhere and they're like,

3057
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,580
detectives are just like,

3058
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,181
figure it out.

3059
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:49,140
They're all bad guys.

3060
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,670
They're all bad guys.

3061
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:51,301
Yeah,

3062
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:52,134
exactly.

3063
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:52,950
Festivals.

3064
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,680
Would I go to jail for holding the tires?

3065
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,430
It's like Jujitsu Dexter's jet.

3066
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,560
Do you remember that conversation?

3067
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:03,250
We had ones about guys getting hit so
hard that it turns some gay and can

3068
01:21:03,251 --> 01:21:08,251
imagine went off for at least we went
off for at least an hour like children

3069
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:14,010
about how incredible it be if like dude's
like how to get revenge because the

3070
01:21:14,011 --> 01:21:17,980
guy turned him gay and they showed up for
the next fight with a parasol and like

3071
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,930
pink pink clothes.

3072
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,490
I like holding a handbag.

3073
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,860
He hadn't been the same
age and they fucks him.

3074
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,083
He just,

3075
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:27,630
someone knocked him out so bad that
they turned gay and that it was a,

3076
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:29,130
there was a possibility like you can,

3077
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,390
you know he can get CTE.

3078
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,190
The idea is it's like you
like imagine if sitting,

3079
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:35,650
they were like,

3080
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:36,301
what if it was like,

3081
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:37,770
I think what it was the thing like,

3082
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:39,660
like there was a keep you from breeding.

3083
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,560
If you got your ass kicked,

3084
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:42,090
like in the wolves population,

3085
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:42,960
the Alphas and the Betas,

3086
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:43,501
Duke it out.

3087
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,360
The Beatty gets kicked out of the
crew if he gets his ass kicked.

3088
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:45,960
Right,

3089
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,560
right.

3090
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,750
Maybe it would be something
like that with two guys.

3091
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:49,200
Duke it out.

3092
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,130
One guy beat your ass.

3093
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:51,570
He turns you gay every time.

3094
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,810
How much movie over the stakes
be Nolan's file you love.

3095
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,410
No one's fighting anybody.

3096
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,850
We were talking about like how much
do you remember the conversation?

3097
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,833
I forgot.

3098
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,763
Here's so high.

3099
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,360
So we were like,

3100
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,560
how much more dangerous would fighting
B would if you lost you turn gay.

3101
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:07,721
Oh,

3102
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:09,310
you'd kill people that carry helmets.

3103
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,490
Someone Kod you if you became gay.

3104
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:11,710
Uh,

3105
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:12,181
over him.

3106
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:16,190
Just trying to everyone
because that's true.

3107
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,180
He's been knocked out more
than anyone know fighters ever.

3108
01:22:18,181 --> 01:22:19,110
It's like starting to slur.

3109
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:19,630
That worked it.

3110
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,120
You start seeing the signs
of like the fucking leg up,

3111
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,060
but they're going full.

3112
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,190
You'd see signs of it,

3113
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,770
but they're trying to hide it

3114
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,180
slowly with like wooden beads,

3115
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:32,550
exiting shirts.

3116
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,410
There's nowhere to trips
like the one I'm wearing.

3117
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:34,511
Right.

3118
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:35,070
You got to start.

3119
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:37,370
You got to sit them down and have
that Brendan shop talking to me.

3120
01:22:37,371 --> 01:22:38,204
You got to stop

3121
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:40,880
my dick now.

3122
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,390
Start Looking for alternative careers.

3123
01:22:45,391 --> 01:22:45,960
Ma'Am.

3124
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,040
You're looking at like Dick.

3125
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,000
Every time we hang out.

3126
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,363
It'd be more.

3127
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,720
It'd be more something you'd be like,

3128
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:54,120
I think over in this is
plucking his eyebrows.

3129
01:22:54,121 --> 01:22:56,730
Do you know it's like he's contouring

3130
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:00,020
ice baby shaves in them.

3131
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,990
Beautiful Vanilla ice slices.

3132
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:03,571
Did he get,

3133
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:04,381
did he get a facial?

3134
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:05,214
What's going on with,

3135
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,090
he's smiling at me.

3136
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,120
We'd all be fucked up over attorney.

3137
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,620
All the shots.

3138
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:13,271
It's clear,

3139
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:16,240
but maybe you have to get a wind
back to get your heterosexual back.

3140
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,770
This is the worst idea.

3141
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:20,470
Shoes you can see they're out.

3142
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:21,061
It's like,

3143
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:21,894
Oh

3144
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,613
hey ladies and gentlemen,

3145
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:27,970
two of us in this conversation are
almost 50 and how old are you now?

3146
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:29,823
29

3147
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:33,070
yeah,

3148
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:34,600
we should definitely be more grown up.

3149
01:23:34,601 --> 01:23:35,260
I know,

3150
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:35,891
I think so,

3151
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:37,520
but you know the crazy boy.

3152
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,540
I'm fucking 46 I'm an old motherfucker.

3153
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,800
50 is right there.

3154
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,581
I have a kid.

3155
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:47,170
I'm sitting there at the fucking breakfast
table with my son and my wife and I

3156
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:48,640
feel like I'm 19 I'm like,

3157
01:23:48,641 --> 01:23:48,970
man,

3158
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,400
I feel like I'm acting in this.

3159
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:53,410
Like I feel like a little kid,

3160
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:55,720
but I'm 46 I'm old as shit.

3161
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:56,620
I don't feel like you're growing.

3162
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,840
Growing up on,

3163
01:23:58,860 --> 01:23:59,440
on,

3164
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,070
on TV.

3165
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:04,450
You see that guy reading the newspaper
and he's got his kids and he's only 38

3166
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,160
like five.

3167
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,460
Well you could be nobody who gone and
I'm way older than that motherfucker

3168
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,161
that's in my head.

3169
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:10,210
How would you define,

3170
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,610
and I feel like a little
kid raising a kid.

3171
01:24:12,611 --> 01:24:14,080
I feel like a kid raising a kid.

3172
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:14,680
It's so weird.

3173
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,230
How would you define what an adult is?

3174
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:17,891
Right?

3175
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:18,970
So here he goes.

3176
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,451
No,

3177
01:24:19,451 --> 01:24:20,260
but I mean,

3178
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:20,591
well,

3179
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:21,650
I mean you would think like,

3180
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,503
hey,

3181
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,860
someone that does it lose
their wallet and 49 God Damn,

3182
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,370
I bet you're supposed to be like,

3183
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:27,690
well,

3184
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:28,870
how would he would define like,

3185
01:24:28,871 --> 01:24:29,770
well I'm now I'm an adult.

3186
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:29,951
Well,

3187
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:32,920
I guess that would mean what that
I have people I'm responsible for,

3188
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:33,910
um,

3189
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,130
that I make my own money.

3190
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,660
And you're not dependent on your parents.

3191
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,120
You have your own pillow
depend on other people,

3192
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:40,420
right?

3193
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,610
I mean you kind of really
in a way like just,

3194
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:44,063
oh,

3195
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:45,670
it's a boring conversation.

3196
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:46,151
All right,

3197
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:46,960
cheers boys.

3198
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,560
Dude.

3199
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:47,921
Cheers.

3200
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:48,840
Tonight can knock down.

3201
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,780
Take huge glass.

3202
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:50,740
You just poured yourself.

3203
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:51,603
You poured this?

3204
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,110
Am I going crazy day?

3205
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:53,970
No,

3206
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,280
it's these fucking voices.

3207
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,143
Hey,

3208
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:58,540
slow down child now.

3209
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,980
I was how his boss who's to
so far isn't it an amazing,

3210
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,000
it's the best man.

3211
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,110
Well it like the first
couple of months like,

3212
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:06,321
yeah,

3213
01:25:06,321 --> 01:25:07,031
he needs his mom.

3214
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:07,451
It's whatever.

3215
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:10,330
It doesn't recognize me now
he'd finally recognize them.

3216
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,173
You know what I'm saying?

3217
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:16,230
He loves the Shit and we look identical
yet so go and show him the picture

3218
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:16,811
better and better.

3219
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:18,580
I see a picture of him
and better and better.

3220
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,550
I've seen a few pictures.

3221
01:25:19,551 --> 01:25:20,384
It's awesome.

3222
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,101
It's not,

3223
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:21,934
there's nothing like it.

3224
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:23,830
Nothing daddy hold.

3225
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,753
I want to squat.

3226
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,280
I want like five and what?

3227
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:27,760
Five?

3228
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:27,971
Yeah.

3229
01:25:27,971 --> 01:25:32,210
I'm not the guy that tells people that
they needed in their life because a

3230
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,123
smoked it.

3231
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,451
All right guys,

3232
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:36,430
we're going down a weird rabbit hole.

3233
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:37,653
Hey listen,

3234
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:38,790
I'm not the guy to tell stucco.

3235
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,380
I say live single and and,

3236
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:45,040
and experience everything
and travel the world.

3237
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:45,941
And then when you,

3238
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:47,080
once you do all that shit,

3239
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:47,801
there's good shit.

3240
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:48,550
The kid stuff.

3241
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:49,383
It used to be when I'm,

3242
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,030
when I was growing up
getting a girl pregnant.

3243
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:53,010
What's like fucking hell,

3244
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,130
you're life is over.

3245
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,251
Everyone's like,

3246
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:56,650
your life is over nowadays.

3247
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,330
It seems like people were having kids and,

3248
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,193
and their,

3249
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:01,450
their life means more than ever.

3250
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,573
You know?

3251
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,100
It's also the people you hang out with,

3252
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,180
the people you're hanging out with.

3253
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:06,200
But you know what,

3254
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:06,620
man,

3255
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,130
I've come across a lot of different
people in this world and I think at a

3256
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:11,030
certain point in time,

3257
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:16,070
I personally think we've got to stop
like thinking everybody's got to live the

3258
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:19,260
same way.

3259
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:19,640
Yeah.

3260
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,031
You know?

3261
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:20,380
And if,

3262
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,500
if somebody gets pregnant
at 18 and they marry the,

3263
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:27,350
the their high school sweetheart
18 that shit sometimes worked.

3264
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:28,030
Hell yeah.

3265
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:29,170
It just like hell yeah.

3266
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,210
But we're immediately as men
will like that fucking dude.

3267
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,020
Damn,

3268
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,853
he

3269
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:36,710
is so pure.

3270
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:37,881
Well,

3271
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:38,541
you know what man,

3272
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,710
it's not just that,

3273
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,020
but it's also everybody's
fucking different.

3274
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,100
You know?

3275
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:47,570
That's like for some people they find
the right person like real early and they

3276
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:48,800
just grow together.

3277
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:53,270
They figure out a way to be like really
open and friendly really early and they

3278
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:53,900
grow together.

3279
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,100
There's also nothing worse.

3280
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:58,610
When I meet a 50 year old and we have
a friend like this who's not married,

3281
01:26:58,670 --> 01:26:59,620
has no girlfriend,

3282
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,850
still playing the field
and he's lonely as fuck.

3283
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,790
Like that's how this movie ends my mat.

3284
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,950
Not everyone's fucking
George Clooney Buddy.

3285
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:06,200
Right,

3286
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:06,560
right.

3287
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,310
It looks fun.

3288
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,270
But once they were lonely,

3289
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,350
men were,

3290
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,030
there were times in my life and,

3291
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,750
and me and Joe discussed this many
times before we had kids like,

3292
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:15,890
do we really want,

3293
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:16,580
kids are like,

3294
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,270
do you want,

3295
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:18,470
I think I don't want kids,

3296
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:18,951
but not now,

3297
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:19,930
but maybe.

3298
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:21,081
And then a lot of these like,

3299
01:27:21,081 --> 01:27:21,321
fuck,

3300
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:22,101
I don't want kids.

3301
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:22,790
Fuck that.

3302
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:23,470
And then you'd,

3303
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,750
you'd see fathers on planes
with their kids are like full.

3304
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:28,100
We're lucky we're not them.

3305
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,210
So there were times,

3306
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,073
or I,

3307
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,093
I thought like,

3308
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:31,611
man,

3309
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:32,720
I don't want any kids.

3310
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,900
I think I was afraid that I was going
to feel the same way about my kids is my

3311
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:41,150
real dad felt about me and that
would have been a nightmare.

3312
01:27:41,151 --> 01:27:45,830
So I'm like maybe I got that same shit
that my dad has that he don't give a fuck

3313
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:46,580
about us kids.

3314
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,091
So I'm like,

3315
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:52,091
I'm afraid to have kids cause I'm afraid
that my kid is going to feel about me

3316
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:55,220
like I feel about my dad and that would
make me want to fucking hang myself.

3317
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,790
So there was a lot of times,

3318
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,031
no kids,

3319
01:27:59,031 --> 01:27:59,510
no kids,

3320
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,740
but I'm like maybe kids,

3321
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:01,370
I don't know.

3322
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:02,091
Same thing Joe.

3323
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:02,390
Joe,

3324
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,630
there's no kids this,

3325
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:05,301
I will say this,

3326
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:06,134
let me finish real quick.

3327
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,730
Let me finish this really quick.

3328
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:08,990
If I was,

3329
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:09,500
if I was,

3330
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,440
if I find out I was going
to die in five minutes,

3331
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,270
one of my messages would be to all of
these kids growing up and everything than

3332
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:16,850
me.

3333
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:17,683
Like my,

3334
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,830
my version of the meaning of life really
after all this shit after no kids,

3335
01:28:21,831 --> 01:28:22,970
kids full Kevin kids,

3336
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:24,770
I want to be free and all that shit.

3337
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:26,210
I live single up to,

3338
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:31,430
I'm 40 I would say having
kids is the meaning of life.

3339
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,180
It's,

3340
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:32,991
that's what I would say.

3341
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:33,711
Maybe I'm wrong,

3342
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:35,060
but that's what I would say.

3343
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:36,100
So the reason why we're here,

3344
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:36,860
I would leave,

3345
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,130
I would leave my advice like you're
all confused and all that shit.

3346
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,870
At the end of the day when you,

3347
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,020
when you're getting old and everyone's
going to get old unless they die young,

3348
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,130
but when you get old,

3349
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,993
watch,

3350
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:50,360
your kids are everything there.

3351
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:51,470
You're fucked there.

3352
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,363
Everything.

3353
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,510
And then your grandkids.

3354
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,613
Ah,

3355
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,521
without kids.

3356
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:57,680
If you're going to grow
old and alone in my,

3357
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:58,511
if I was going to die,

3358
01:28:58,511 --> 01:28:59,850
I would say don't do,

3359
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,093
try to have,

3360
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,680
don't die old and alone.

3361
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,521
You only have one though.

3362
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:05,790
Yeah.

3363
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,170
Don't I want more?

3364
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:07,320
Yeah,

3365
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:07,651
for sure.

3366
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:09,450
Let's pop out more than yes.

3367
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,850
First is this huge speech.

3368
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:12,420
Know Right now,

3369
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:12,730
man,

3370
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:13,563
I'm,

3371
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:15,730
I'm super crazy.

3372
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,880
Ultra family man.

3373
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:18,090
Right?

3374
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,040
And that's an everything to everything.

3375
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:20,874
My life is,

3376
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,180
I every day remind me because sometimes
you get so busy and got all these

3377
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:26,190
decisions and there's
so much shit going on.

3378
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,280
Why don't you adopt like six after
you're with your kid and you're thinking

3379
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:33,030
about this is what the orphanage

3380
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:35,760
tend to play with the kids.

3381
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,760
There's 10 I'm going to stop with this.

3382
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:40,350
Sometimes you're with your
kids and you guys out there,

3383
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:40,610
you know,

3384
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:43,710
you might feel the same way if you're
with your kids and you feel sometimes

3385
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:46,410
you're with your kid and you're spending
these beautiful moments together,

3386
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:49,650
but you're thinking about
all this stressful shit and
all these decisions you've

3387
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:53,550
got to make in your life and fucking Ebi
aids coming up September 11 you you're

3388
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:53,671
like,

3389
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:54,030
fuck,

3390
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,440
but then I thought I just plug.

3391
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:56,190
Yeah,

3392
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:56,581
I saw it.

3393
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:59,370
I thought this was all that fight pass.

3394
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,240
This is stressful shit
and I'm thinking I'm here,

3395
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,290
I'm on the beats today.

3396
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:05,730
I'm at the beach with my son and I'm like,

3397
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,390
these are the moments I'm going to be
thinking about when I'm dying and I'm

3398
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:12,410
fucking thinking about
some bullshit right now.

3399
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,853
This is,

3400
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,550
this is a moment that I would want to
come back to if there was a time machine

3401
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:18,503
and I can get back,

3402
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:21,750
I would appreciate that and I wouldn't
be thinking about any of the bullshit.

3403
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:25,920
I would be thinking about every
millisecond I had with my son on the beach

3404
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,330
playing in the water and shit.

3405
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,141
I'm like,

3406
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:29,310
and I'm thinking about other ships,

3407
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:33,420
so I constantly remind myself
what is the most important thing?

3408
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:35,910
That motherfucker right there,

3409
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,860
he's the most important thing.

3410
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:39,480
That little mother fucker right there.

3411
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:39,840
Yeah,

3412
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,680
like you know what I mean?

3413
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,300
So I'm going to stop.

3414
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:42,661
I'm not,

3415
01:30:42,661 --> 01:30:43,410
you know,

3416
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,500
I'm done for sure.

3417
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:45,211
Any more kids though?

3418
01:30:45,211 --> 01:30:45,540
If you're like,

3419
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,200
I do,

3420
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,033
I do.

3421
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:47,933
I want more.

3422
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:49,260
Well,

3423
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,093
I'm done

3424
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,970
to what you're saying is all beautiful.

3425
01:30:53,971 --> 01:30:54,451
For sure,

3426
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:54,691
man.

3427
01:30:54,691 --> 01:30:55,070
I'm worried.

3428
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:56,100
That's the most important thing.

3429
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:57,120
When I find myself,

3430
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:57,450
I'm like,

3431
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:57,631
shit,

3432
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:58,231
I got all this shit.

3433
01:30:58,231 --> 01:30:58,760
I'm like,

3434
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,593
no.

3435
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:00,623
US.

3436
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,830
I think for all of us,

3437
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:05,220
like living in the moment is very
important and it's tough to do.

3438
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:05,671
It's hard.

3439
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:06,210
It's hard to do.

3440
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,390
It's like something you've got to be
real conscious of because it's so easy to

3441
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:11,880
get trapped up with your thoughts.

3442
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:15,060
Your thoughts can get gummed up
with some unnecessary patterns,

3443
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:16,201
even plans.

3444
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:16,940
Right?

3445
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,773
We see the future.

3446
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:21,600
You got to remind yourself what the
most important thing is and the most

3447
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:22,051
important thing.

3448
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:24,360
If you got kids that is every,

3449
01:31:24,361 --> 01:31:25,190
that should be your,

3450
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:26,040
your fucking,

3451
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,920
that should be the base of
your existence right there.

3452
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,480
It's not something's wrong.

3453
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:32,440
Besides having kids like there,

3454
01:31:32,441 --> 01:31:33,330
there are those moments.

3455
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,180
When do you think like when you were
in your thirties and you had that,

3456
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:41,030
that one switch where you decided
you were going to check page demands.

3457
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,070
Antler spray commercial.

3458
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:42,871
No,

3459
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:44,070
this is that bullshit.

3460
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:46,320
A mobile phone.

3461
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,820
It's like cricket but for UFC,

3462
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,873
Oh huh.

3463
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,130
Metro pcs.

3464
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,151
They're only in the hood.

3465
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:52,140
She's adorable.

3466
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,020
99 flood flows.

3467
01:31:54,021 --> 01:31:56,110
A sad like there's,

3468
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,330
they're like diminishing.

3469
01:31:57,330 --> 01:32:01,200
That poor man has to chase her and
she's not tired and he's exhausted.

3470
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,220
Metro pcs.

3471
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,670
Metro Metro.

3472
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:06,600
Metro is cricket.

3473
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,151
Right?

3474
01:32:07,151 --> 01:32:07,661
Like if she,

3475
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:09,400
if he tried to give fucking crazy,

3476
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,600
she would beat his ass.

3477
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,780
Maybe that's the connection to black belt.

3478
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:13,990
No,

3479
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,180
no,

3480
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:14,341
no,

3481
01:32:14,341 --> 01:32:14,870
no.

3482
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:15,703
In that commercial,

3483
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:17,400
that girl beats at Duke.

3484
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,300
He put me in that commercial.

3485
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:20,470
I'll sprint pass that bitch.

3486
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:24,910
Brendan champion mean anywhere in
the world to like three years ago.

3487
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:25,480
God,

3488
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:25,781
Dude,

3489
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:26,381
you got to let her be.

3490
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:27,910
You ain't fucking Hammon man.

3491
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,110
Two or three years ago,

3492
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:33,650
guys would there MMA fans
or experts or whatever they,

3493
01:32:33,651 --> 01:32:38,651
there would be a big movement on how no
matter how good an MMA female fighter

3494
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:39,040
is,

3495
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,630
she could never beat a normal man.

3496
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:41,590
It's totally different.

3497
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:41,800
Like,

3498
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:46,310
well I think shit's different now cause
you know it depends on the culture.

3499
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:46,690
Ready.

3500
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:46,910
Oh,

3501
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:51,910
competitive culture come when Claudia
Spain look up a dude who doesn't train a

3502
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:53,620
dude who doesn't train,

3503
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:56,110
which is how big it does.

3504
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,540
Well it does matter.

3505
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:01,480
It always matters and everything
within experts in Jujitsu it matters.

3506
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:02,590
It always matters.

3507
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:05,080
But on 2,250 pound dude,

3508
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:13,660
but he's like 99.99999% of the
population who doesn't train.

3509
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,200
I'll put my fucking Claudia
who you talking about?

3510
01:33:17,201 --> 01:33:17,760
Cologic a Dale.

3511
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,490
Yeah.

3512
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,323
Oh yeah.

3513
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,640
The answer with the right hand,

3514
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:23,040
he's 250 pounds.

3515
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,780
If he doesn't train,

3516
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,860
I would,

3517
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,320
she would still get his back
and still chuck the fuck.

3518
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:29,991
I'll put my,

3519
01:33:29,991 --> 01:33:31,690
my maybe cause she's got Jujitsu.

3520
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:32,680
It's possible.

3521
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:33,420
It's possible.

3522
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:37,270
250 pound guy that doesn't
train against Claudia today.

3523
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,500
If you're going to put your money on,

3524
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,740
Claudia will get her,

3525
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:43,320
but she'll guide that kind of guy.

3526
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:45,260
Hey listen,

3527
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,860
like ray Lewis doesn't try and

3528
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,170
mad,

3529
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:50,003
but you know what I'm saying?

3530
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,330
[inaudible]

3531
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:54,243
doesn't drain.

3532
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,630
Kwania touches him.

3533
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:59,080
He's gonna flicker to f
back talking about 250 beds.

3534
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,453
Ray Lewis,

3535
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,770
I'm talking to some guy

3536
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:04,121
population.

3537
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:04,954
Just trying.

3538
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,591
Yeah.

3539
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:08,830
I'm trying to just see
what kind of trail clear.

3540
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:14,950
My point is.

3541
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:19,210
The top UFC female fighters today will,

3542
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,260
I will.

3543
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:20,570
Oh,

3544
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:25,030
I like triple h doesn't
train on them over a guy.

3545
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,160
Any guy on the planet that doesn't train.

3546
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:27,791
God bless you.

3547
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:31,300
In all my money on a
professional UFC champion.

3548
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,550
Come on one night

3549
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,840
on the street and then you're talking
about a champion hundred and 90 pound guy

3550
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:40,330
who's talking about who are you
going to put your money on it?

3551
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:41,440
There was a confrontation

3552
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,730
going to go show me the fucking guy.

3553
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:46,583
Oh,

3554
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,100
come on.

3555
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:52,310
Generally I'm not talking about
technically what are you going to get that

3556
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,600
grounding and what he did
growing up and all that shit.

3557
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:58,040
I'm talking about the high
school football is 250

3558
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,341
pounds.

3559
01:34:58,341 --> 01:34:59,670
He's in shaped us crossfit.

3560
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:08,780
You're going to put your money on a
crossfit guy who's never trained martial

3561
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:10,360
arts Holbrook over Joanna.

3562
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:11,030
Come on.

3563
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:12,020
Who's wearing some caterpillar?

3564
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:13,680
Doesn't give a fuck about.

3565
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,693
Yeah,

3566
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:15,733
you hate women.

3567
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:16,743
I love

3568
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:18,820
diamonds.

3569
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:19,430
I'm done.

3570
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,560
I'm done on my money on cloudy.

3571
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,071
If they have,

3572
01:35:22,071 --> 01:35:23,450
Claudia got to see the guy.

3573
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:23,711
Eddy.

3574
01:35:23,711 --> 01:35:28,711
Johan is 115 pounds and she was going to
go against a 200 pound random dude who

3575
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:29,654
she's going to

3576
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:32,923
be a little,

3577
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:36,050
that's what he talking about.

3578
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:39,150
Jesus fucking Christ this perfect.

3579
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:41,270
These are professional killers.

3580
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,540
Just cause the girls like no guys.

3581
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:45,320
The Guy,

3582
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:45,620
oh,

3583
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:47,150
a guy just smashed that.

3584
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:47,541
Brendan.

3585
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,580
It's a background person.

3586
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,090
It depends on what kind
of guy you're talking to.

3587
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,220
Professional.

3588
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:53,450
It just depends.

3589
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:57,530
I'm with you 100% if the guy played
high school football and he's fucking a

3590
01:35:57,531 --> 01:35:58,410
state champion,

3591
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,560
I would take a Stacy state champion.

3592
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,040
Come on.

3593
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,873
That's where I,

3594
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,960
I disagree.

3595
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,111
Oh,

3596
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:03,760
you're going to put your,

3597
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,130
oh,

3598
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:04,970
those got big.

3599
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:05,571
Never trained.

3600
01:36:05,571 --> 01:36:06,740
Now they never drained.

3601
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:08,300
Know how to attack this.

3602
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,520
If you have like you've got a college
football guy or don't want to throw you

3603
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:19,880
the train to throw
punches and he got a train

3604
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,130
in all earnestness in all our studies

3605
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,350
has to be some sort of a like a
weight that you're talking about.

3606
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:31,760
Like if there's two,

3607
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:33,980
if there's two people at 115 pounds.

3608
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:39,080
One of them is you on a young Jay check
and the other one it's Mitch Frickin

3609
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:42,200
fuck at Kinko's from fucking West Chester,

3610
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:42,581
New York.

3611
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:43,380
He's going to sleep.

3612
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:43,641
Yeah.

3613
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:47,480
This guy who works in an accounting
office and eats McDonald's every weekend.

3614
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,960
He's getting his head kicked
cause he's getting to know,

3615
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:55,480
he's getting to know and he's a man but
the about a non training athlete or non

3616
01:36:57,961 --> 01:36:59,330
athlete male.

3617
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:00,350
The same size as her.

3618
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:01,980
She's going to kill and lesbian community.

3619
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,603
Listen man,

3620
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,180
we're just trying to establish
some parameters here.

3621
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:11,240
What what she's capable of doing is,

3622
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:11,840
if you,

3623
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,420
you're talking about
there's like there's a,

3624
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:13,940
there's,

3625
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:18,940
there's a spectrum and there's the non
training non-athlete male that's the same

3626
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:20,300
size as her.

3627
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:21,380
She would kill him.

3628
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,250
He's going to get fucked up.

3629
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,900
He's going to get fucker at most likely,

3630
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:24,530
right?

3631
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:29,110
But then as you get procedure
in bigger you get is different.

3632
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,230
You get different things.

3633
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,440
What is the guy wrestled in high school?

3634
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:34,670
Does that count as being trained?

3635
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,950
Did he wrestled tarsal?

3636
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,140
Okay,

3637
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:38,970
what if,

3638
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:39,803
what if?

3639
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:43,190
What if he took some karate
classes when he was in high school?

3640
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:47,390
What if he knows that he can punch,

3641
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,730
but he also does crossfit and
he's 250 fucking pounds shredded.

3642
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,710
Then it gets weird.

3643
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:53,020
You know it gets well done here where?

3644
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:53,963
Cause you're not gonna hurt him.

3645
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,990
What if he's just fighting Barb

3646
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,340
local Taco?

3647
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,710
Claudia,

3648
01:37:58,710 --> 01:37:59,980
I put my money on that.

3649
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,383
You're going to

3650
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:05,710
195 pound high school,

3651
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:07,080
a football player,

3652
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,270
not combat everything.

3653
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:09,990
High School football
player against Claudia.

3654
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:11,880
He might win,

3655
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,631
but you got to go.

3656
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:13,260
Shit,

3657
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,410
you don't know what's
going to happen for sure,

3658
01:38:14,411 --> 01:38:15,244
but you might get

3659
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,130
trained.

3660
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,140
She's going to get this dude.

3661
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,880
I've seen big dudes come
in class all the time.

3662
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,360
They get direct by my girls and
my total is that all the time.

3663
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:27,000
It's totally possible to,

3664
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,210
they're starting in a guard.

3665
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,570
That verse,

3666
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:31,080
that Big Dude on his,

3667
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:31,973
on his feet.

3668
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:32,640
Yeah.

3669
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,290
That's where he lands in opera cut.

3670
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,620
That bitch is going to think
she's not another dimension.

3671
01:38:36,621 --> 01:38:39,270
He knows where to punch at
all and he's a big giant.

3672
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:40,290
Never trained.

3673
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:41,390
They've never had,

3674
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:42,253
it has a point.

3675
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,560
99% of the population was grim or tray.

3676
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,660
I'm agree with Eddie.

3677
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:48,500
If they're the same

3678
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:50,820
chicks.

3679
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,940
Oh No,

3680
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:52,621
Eddie's right.

3681
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:55,940
If you guys take draw now
this Claudia guys in on it,

3682
01:38:56,070 --> 01:39:01,070
if it's Claudia or if it's your honor
and they're fighting 195 pound male who's

3683
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,034
never trained,

3684
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,160
the mail's going to be in some
trouble for a lot of reasons.

3685
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:06,390
One on the ground,

3686
01:39:06,391 --> 01:39:07,350
he's going to have some trouble.

3687
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:09,843
Hold on.

3688
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,843
Hold on.

3689
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:13,380
Let's stop the sex thing altogether.

3690
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,750
Let's just go with the size of humans.

3691
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:20,220
If mighty mouse has to fight
ray Lewis in his prime,

3692
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,720
there's a fucking problem.

3693
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,291
Correct.

3694
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:23,124
Kay Ray Lewis,

3695
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,350
mighty mouse hacking.

3696
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:25,930
Fucking giant problem.

3697
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,070
Put my money on my book.

3698
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:27,530
Okay,

3699
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:28,110
but Eddie.

3700
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:28,471
Okay,

3701
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:30,930
but let's stop saying
male or female thing.

3702
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:34,350
You want to Nj check weighs 10
pounds less than mighty mouse.

3703
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:34,710
Correct.

3704
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:35,131
Okay,

3705
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:36,030
and she's a woman.

3706
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:37,200
It's not,

3707
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,300
there's not saying that women
can't beat the fuck out of men.

3708
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,260
They absolutely can,

3709
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,640
but at a certain weight,

3710
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,350
it becomes weird.

3711
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,970
And it depends on what kind of
athlete you're talking about.

3712
01:39:45,971 --> 01:39:46,230
Yes.

3713
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:46,891
It depends on,

3714
01:39:46,891 --> 01:39:48,450
it depends if they have any,

3715
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,060
any experience in moving
their body at all.

3716
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:56,061
And we were totally uncoordinated and
they have no one couldn't with all that.

3717
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:57,241
Honestly,

3718
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:57,661
honestly,

3719
01:39:57,661 --> 01:40:01,320
what kid grows up with zero
knowledge of how to throw a punch?

3720
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:03,060
Who the fuck are they?

3721
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,350
I want to meet these people.

3722
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:06,300
Most people can't throw punches.

3723
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:07,920
You may know shitty.

3724
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:12,780
They know how to throw a shitty dog shit.

3725
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,160
If it lands and you're
way smaller than them,

3726
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:17,701
you're fucked.

3727
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:21,510
If you're a 110 pound accountants
and there's a 300 pound Samoan dude,

3728
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:22,930
this never get some,

3729
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,130
okay,

3730
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:27,380
listen,

3731
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:32,380
David talking about the odds and
bedding and it's at 100% you're right.

3732
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:34,380
You're talking about,

3733
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:37,290
of course you're going to,

3734
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,040
you're never going to bend.

3735
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,270
Go 1000000%.

3736
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:40,104
I'm going to win.

3737
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:46,470
If that big dude lands that crazy looping
punch that he learned from watching

3738
01:40:46,471 --> 01:40:47,340
Chuck Norris movies,

3739
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:47,760
yes,

3740
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,690
he will knock 'em out,

3741
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,380
but the money,

3742
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,310
you've got to put the money,

3743
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,181
the money's on,

3744
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:51,710
Claudia.

3745
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,730
Claudia is not going
to get hit by overhead.

3746
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,070
Shitty

3747
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,750
loves move out of the way.

3748
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,550
That dude's back.

3749
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,020
You and I are feminists.

3750
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,190
You guys are fucking children.

3751
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,290
This is the point.

3752
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,530
This is what we love about MMA.

3753
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,110
This is the point and what
I love about martial arts,

3754
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,490
you might be right.

3755
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,180
Yeah,

3756
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,720
you might be right to pretend you
know you're right is ridiculous,

3757
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:13,960
right?

3758
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,340
But you might be right,

3759
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,340
but it's entirely possible
that collage a good deal.

3760
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:22,360
You could fuck up Ray Lewis and that
they could have a crazy wild scrap.

3761
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,500
Not Ray Lewis don't use

3762
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:27,840
super.

3763
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,790
She catches him.

3764
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:34,650
Good athlete radio skills are the same.

3765
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,673
When I,

3766
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:41,340
when I think of a guy who's
not a fighter buddies,

3767
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:43,930
just off fucking soap here,

3768
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:44,410
your ass,

3769
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,290
he's going to do whatever he wants.

3770
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:50,260
I think of Mary Lou because I
don't know shit about football,

3771
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:51,123
but

3772
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,460
I run through people.

3773
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:03,460
Herschel Walker less than Ray Lewis.

3774
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:06,910
Ms Ass away from me.

3775
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:07,601
No matter what.

3776
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:08,800
You weigh their point.

3777
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:08,901
Oh,

3778
01:42:08,901 --> 01:42:09,550
what percenters?

3779
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:10,383
Those guys,

3780
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:20,940
nobody's going about Betty.

3781
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,061
Stop.

3782
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:23,020
He'll run right out at you.

3783
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:25,360
Eddie [inaudible].

3784
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,980
He tackle these people
audio with fuck him up.

3785
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:31,720
I don't know what you smoked.

3786
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:32,554
Eddie.

3787
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,270
Connie would fuck up.

3788
01:42:34,271 --> 01:42:35,810
Ray Lewis said,

3789
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:36,460
dude,

3790
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,710
I can't call on Claudia.

3791
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:40,641
Here's the match.

3792
01:42:40,641 --> 01:42:41,474
Here's the match.

3793
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,750
The match.

3794
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:45,580
Cologic Adelia versus Ray Lewis.

3795
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:47,110
The middle of a football field.

3796
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,670
Ray gets a running start.

3797
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:52,080
How about the CYBORG versus dark

3798
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:55,510
side?

3799
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:56,350
Who would you put your money?

3800
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:58,150
Ray like Ray Lewis.

3801
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,740
Smash her on her head.

3802
01:42:59,741 --> 01:43:01,230
Like a wrestling move.

3803
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,960
You actually think so?

3804
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,191
No.

3805
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:04,660
Maybe 170 pounds.

3806
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:05,940
You can't put money on that.

3807
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,320
I'm going to leave this room.

3808
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,400
I'm a cyborg rounds brand.

3809
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:12,750
Louis fight.

3810
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:17,760
We got to really stop talking over each
other and we got to really like open up

3811
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:18,724
this discussion

3812
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:21,300
flow.

3813
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,600
Look at telus ladies right now.

3814
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:24,610
Take a fight break guys is
gonna take a five break?

3815
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,550
Hold on.

3816
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:27,890
[inaudible] got Chris Kamozi
is Barry taking a five break?

3817
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:29,200
That's bad news for Chris.

3818
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,363
Yeah.

3819
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,560
This is a world champion,

3820
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:34,540
Ray Ray Lewis is a superior athlete.

3821
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,351
I just picked the best.

3822
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:36,370
He's one of the best cars,

3823
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:38,290
but he's one of the best
players of all time.

3824
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:38,621
Well,

3825
01:43:38,621 --> 01:43:39,460
that's what I'm thinking.

3826
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:42,630
I'm thinking of soup and history.

3827
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:42,921
Well,

3828
01:43:42,921 --> 01:43:44,170
you against Claudia.

3829
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:44,351
Well,

3830
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:44,921
here's the thing.

3831
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:46,480
You can't say Herschel Walker,

3832
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,153
Herschel Walker,

3833
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,173
Herschel Walker

3834
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,220
from the Utah Jazz.

3835
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,410
John Stockton versus Claudia Goodell.

3836
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:55,640
John Stockton,

3837
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:57,290
that fucking wheel.

3838
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,550
Kick her in the face.

3839
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:58,941
Come on.

3840
01:43:58,941 --> 01:43:59,774
He's John Stock.

3841
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,840
You're going to put money
ever in the NBA guys.

3842
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:03,950
You're going to go with John Stock.

3843
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,510
Seriously,

3844
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:05,430
Claudia show.

3845
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,033
Oh my God.

3846
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,220
To please everybody,

3847
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,770
Claudia.

3848
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:11,211
Good day.

3849
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:11,720
Yeah,

3850
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,111
Brian,

3851
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:13,010
you fought taekwondo.

3852
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:14,270
You think you'd be cloudy up.

3853
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,010
You're 170 pounds soaking wet.

3854
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,671
Her name's Claude.

3855
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:16,810
Joe,

3856
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:17,330
who would you put you?

3857
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:18,100
Who would you put your mind?

3858
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,780
He beat her up.

3859
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,070
Who would you put your
money on bringing in?

3860
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:25,071
I don't want to cause you think you're
going to beat her up and know each other

3861
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:27,800
like this is ridiculous.

3862
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,981
No,

3863
01:44:27,981 --> 01:44:29,750
but John Thompson has never done anything.

3864
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,561
He never wrestled.

3865
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:32,510
Never told him he might've
been in bar fights though.

3866
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:35,030
So you think you're doing
a few years of taekwondo,

3867
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:36,350
you're getting a few years,

3868
01:44:36,351 --> 01:44:36,890
but keep going.

3869
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:37,910
You could beat her up.

3870
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:40,340
I had never said I could beat up anybody.

3871
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:41,870
Stop putting words in my mouth.

3872
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:45,950
I'm asking if a grown
man has never had skin.

3873
01:44:45,951 --> 01:44:46,161
Kim.

3874
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:46,941
Brian Callen.

3875
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:47,271
Fuck.

3876
01:44:47,271 --> 01:44:49,400
Did we go for Ray Lewis to Brian Calendar?

3877
01:44:49,401 --> 01:44:49,840
Yeah.

3878
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,850
John Dean Cain in the mix

3879
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,980
is a great name.

3880
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,470
Herschel Walker Walk Dean can

3881
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,610
get Dean Kane.

3882
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:08,460
What do you guys bridge?

3883
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,050
Mario Lopez?

3884
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,410
Or we might need another guy all the time.

3885
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:13,140
Oh,

3886
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:13,650
okay.

3887
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:14,190
Okay.

3888
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:14,610
You're right.

3889
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:15,240
You're right.

3890
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:15,960
There's Dean Cain.

3891
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:16,261
Yeah.

3892
01:45:16,261 --> 01:45:18,450
Now you might have to have
a guy between me and Dane.

3893
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,213
Just try and be nice.

3894
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:20,730
Thank you.

3895
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:23,070
I appreciate that gang of people.

3896
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,870
There's the gay people between you two.

3897
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,793
They're probably,

3898
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,110
what about Jason Statham

3899
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,660
to sidebar?

3900
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:31,583
Oh No.

3901
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:32,700
How about Ben Affleck?

3902
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,240
Who Ronda versus who?

3903
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,290
But Brett

3904
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:50,723
see you.

3905
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,820
I can bring you a gang of
bitches that can fuck up banner

3906
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,550
to say jump.

3907
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,370
I'll make a call.

3908
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:00,930
I'm going to make some shit right there.

3909
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:02,520
We'll get your ass.

3910
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:03,520
Ain't never seen you more.

3911
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,000
We'll get your ass kicked,

3912
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,610
but we let each other talk.

3913
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,391
This is one,

3914
01:46:09,391 --> 01:46:09,540
right?

3915
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,480
One of those things that where it does
really does come up like you're talking

3916
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:15,330
about the difference between a
trained fighter and an actor.

3917
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,020
Yes,

3918
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:17,730
he did work in Batman.

3919
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,750
Who would you put your money on?

3920
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:22,340
Ben Affleck or Cyborg right
now it's all so come on site.

3921
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,400
That's what I'm telling you.

3922
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,250
What everything

3923
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,471
represents.

3924
01:46:28,471 --> 01:46:29,460
The average man.

3925
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,333
Yeah.

3926
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,490
We start off with buggies.

3927
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:33,241
The average.

3928
01:46:33,241 --> 01:46:33,470
You May,

3929
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:33,900
well,

3930
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:37,340
let me say Ben Affleck looks athletic
and I don't know how much he did in

3931
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:38,223
Staunton Batman.

3932
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:39,361
He can move.

3933
01:46:39,361 --> 01:46:40,194
He's a big guy,

3934
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:41,323
strong guy.

3935
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:44,070
That giant difference
between him and a Cyborg.

3936
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:44,933
Let me ask a question.

3937
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,893
I want to ask her.

3938
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:49,030
This is the bread and the MMA fights
Batman and he was in good will.

3939
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,840
He did do some light for real.

3940
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:53,070
This is this a real question.

3941
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:53,940
Let's get scientific.

3942
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,380
You guys ready to get scientific?

3943
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:56,611
I'm serious.

3944
01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:56,761
Here.

3945
01:46:56,761 --> 01:46:57,060
Ready?

3946
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:57,490
Okay.

3947
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:00,540
Brendan Cyborg at 175 pounds.

3948
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:03,990
You put her in the octagon against Ray
Lewis and I'm talking about Ray Lewis

3949
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:04,824
when he was playing.

3950
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,371
Okay.

3951
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:06,400
Now we know Ray Lewis.

3952
01:47:06,401 --> 01:47:09,030
He's a freak athlete when greatest
football players of all time.

3953
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:09,840
Hold on.

3954
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,673
Hold on.

3955
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,301
Hold on now.

3956
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:12,960
Wait,

3957
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,290
wait.

3958
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,123
Keep going.

3959
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:19,250
Explain to me though how ray Lewis deals
with cyborgs striking and her Jujitsu.

3960
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,860
So how bout he picks her up and
throws her to the fucking moon?

3961
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,880
What would it

3962
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:28,723
hurt to the ground?

3963
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:29,651
I'm going to do Brian.

3964
01:47:29,651 --> 01:47:30,700
He's so,

3965
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,710
let me explain.

3966
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,710
Let's get some bread board brawls,

3967
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:40,940
right?

3968
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:43,470
Let's say Cyborg tax and
not to knock them out.

3969
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:43,860
Sure.

3970
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:47,730
He Lands One fucking Baltimore Park.

3971
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,420
The trained she like,

3972
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,990
she says she gets hit all the tongue.

3973
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:59,400
She might slip her weave a tale of
the tape with Cyborg versus Ray Lewis.

3974
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,760
Here we need one.

3975
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,970
Here's issue number one.

3976
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,660
Okay.

3977
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:08,660
We're dealing with almost a hundred
pounds of difference of pure and the man.

3978
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:09,300
Yes.

3979
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:09,691
Okay,

3980
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:14,160
so we're dealing with a super athlete and
Ray Lewis guest who's a good solid two

3981
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:18,270
40 versus a woman who fights at one 45
but really is one 45 is also a hall of

3982
01:48:18,271 --> 01:48:19,104
Famer.

3983
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,720
Some say the best
linebacker on both sides,

3984
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:28,210
but we're making good
live wrestling experience.

3985
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:28,921
Huge difference.

3986
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:29,760
That's a giant deal.

3987
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:30,720
You guys are making this point.

3988
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:34,040
Just yell guarantee you ray Lewis
has beat someone's ass before

3989
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:37,980
you got to train to throw.

3990
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,900
One of his friends are allegedly,

3991
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,380
he was involved in an altercation where,

3992
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:41,641
man,

3993
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:42,474
hold on

3994
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:45,623
guys.

3995
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,033
Hold on.

3996
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:47,790
Lewis.

3997
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:48,623
Ray Lewis.

3998
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,340
Ray Lewis could also,

3999
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:51,271
he could pick her up,

4000
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:52,050
throw out of the ground.

4001
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:55,800
Ray Lewis Cross start punching in the
face and get arm barred and we know that

4002
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:57,450
you're talking about
readiness is huge arm.

4003
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,070
Hold on.

4004
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:59,340
He know he takes her down.

4005
01:48:59,360 --> 01:48:59,710
Okay.

4006
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:00,870
He takes her down to listen.

4007
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:04,080
Can he learn about this fight a week
before it happened and so that just

4008
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:05,040
happened in here.

4009
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:06,600
Answer to that question sir,

4010
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:07,900
is no,

4011
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:12,571
listen to me.

4012
01:49:12,571 --> 01:49:14,820
If I could get Michael Irving the game.

4013
01:49:14,821 --> 01:49:15,654
Michael,

4014
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:16,920
this is Michael Ervin.

4015
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:17,161
Know,

4016
01:49:17,161 --> 01:49:20,520
40 something I could just get six weeks.

4017
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:22,530
Any,

4018
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:25,290
any woman in the world that
wants to get crazy could step up

4019
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,120
and bring him to for us the hobby.

4020
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:31,170
No training camp.

4021
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,460
We're not talking about
a fucking train again.

4022
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:34,770
What does you just Ray Lewis,

4023
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:35,693
you took my training

4024
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:38,443
ass.

4025
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:42,750
He finds out.

4026
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,040
Okay,

4027
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,090
and then you fight cyborg versus rate.

4028
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:49,420
My money would be on Ray
Lewis 100% of the time.

4029
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,313
Amazing.

4030
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:51,840
I'm shocked.

4031
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,400
Really standing.

4032
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,240
You're shocked with my
do not want football.

4033
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:56,230
Watch football.

4034
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:56,471
Okay,

4035
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:57,370
but let me tell you this.

4036
01:49:57,371 --> 01:50:02,050
I got my money on Cyborg 100% a hundred
times in a row against Ben Affleck.

4037
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:08,200
Throw down a house on the Brazilian Dow.

4038
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:11,450
Hundred percent a hundred
percent gotta reset.

4039
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,470
You would Paul the money
on Ray Lewis though.

4040
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:18,250
Ray Lewis is so much bigger and I
think he probably knows how to fight.

4041
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,110
It's not totally unskilled.

4042
01:50:20,111 --> 01:50:20,390
Now,

4043
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:21,223
Matt,

4044
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,400
you got listen to the shot.

4045
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:26,170
Do you think she can stop the shot?

4046
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,410
Ray Lewis is a bad example.

4047
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,970
You can stop the shot if
a staff champion Rashad,

4048
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:33,610
he's trying to tackle

4049
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,220
the Superbowl.

4050
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:42,580
Ray Ray though.

4051
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:43,271
Sit Bad example.

4052
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,860
He's just such a freak athlete.

4053
01:50:44,861 --> 01:50:45,011
Yeah,

4054
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:45,844
it's in that,

4055
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:50,543
hey,

4056
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:55,780
here's your huge x factor
is you saw it in this bitch.

4057
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:57,470
Cause then they're both Jews to the guild.

4058
01:50:57,990 --> 01:51:02,990
A looking like she's looking very natural

4059
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,593
world.

4060
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,490
She's been tested as much as anybody.

4061
01:51:09,491 --> 01:51:10,900
She's 100% clean now.

4062
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,793
She's,

4063
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,270
she's not,

4064
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:16,900
she's not crazy up no more cause
cyborg get beat Louis like this.

4065
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:17,734
Absolutely not Sir.

4066
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:18,500
Why not?

4067
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,680
Because not because we
live in the real world,

4068
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:21,514
but he does not have stopped.

4069
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:23,030
Dan,

4070
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:24,670
the difference between you,

4071
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,181
Brian,

4072
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:26,014
just you,

4073
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:31,020
you and a ray Lewis
[inaudible] imagine jail fight.

4074
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:33,370
Brandon Ray Lewis would
give me some problems.

4075
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,151
That's not true.

4076
01:51:34,151 --> 01:51:34,870
You would kill him.

4077
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:35,370
I don't think.

4078
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:36,880
Stop Him in less than a minute.

4079
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:38,170
I can't tell you why.

4080
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:38,681
And I'll tell you why.

4081
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:39,514
If he'd never trained,

4082
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,740
you would choke him.

4083
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,920
We till he's trained.

4084
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:42,581
Well,

4085
01:51:42,581 --> 01:51:43,660
ray did some wrestling

4086
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:48,520
training camp,

4087
01:51:48,521 --> 01:51:49,354
but hold on,

4088
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:49,941
hold on.

4089
01:51:49,941 --> 01:51:52,000
But hold up the training camp.

4090
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:53,200
But let's be realistic.

4091
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:56,380
You don't think someone has shown great
Lewis had a choke people to sleep.

4092
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,060
How do I hold it like this?

4093
01:51:58,061 --> 01:51:58,241
Yeah,

4094
01:51:58,241 --> 01:51:58,820
you're probably like,

4095
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:00,030
this here mean,

4096
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:03,400
just do this on the
captain of the fucking deep

4097
01:52:13,150 --> 01:52:14,130
breath is coming in on.

4098
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,353
Oh Shit.

4099
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:16,690
He's a smart guy.

4100
01:52:16,691 --> 01:52:17,350
Champion rest.

4101
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:18,340
He's also a smart,

4102
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,920
he's asked Jesus Christ.

4103
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,580
If you're a captain of a defense team.

4104
01:52:21,581 --> 01:52:23,260
He was explaining me how
intricate football is.

4105
01:52:23,261 --> 01:52:24,400
You got to have a brain.

4106
01:52:24,401 --> 01:52:25,250
That dude is smart.

4107
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:26,231
Ray Lewis.

4108
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:27,220
He's a bad motherfucker.

4109
01:52:27,221 --> 01:52:28,270
Make no mistake about it.

4110
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:32,700
Maybe the fact that he ain't
gonna learn no fucking rear naked.

4111
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:36,430
He's not going to be weird to you
guys are not being respectful that MMA

4112
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:37,420
discussed it.

4113
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:40,240
Maybe five months into Jujitsu.

4114
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:40,601
You know,

4115
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:42,150
maybe your Shit Kamasi with it,

4116
01:52:42,151 --> 01:52:42,740
right?

4117
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,850
[inaudible] scraps.

4118
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,430
Fuck Moz is so tough.

4119
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:46,911
He's fine.

4120
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:49,090
You and really Louis
Theroux is way better know.

4121
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:53,060
One of the things I liked the most about
Kamasi is he's maintains a steady pace.

4122
01:52:53,061 --> 01:52:54,260
Like if he chose,

4123
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,810
look at these charts.

4124
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,653
Him Out

4125
01:52:57,990 --> 01:53:00,260
at his pace just destroys PT.

4126
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:01,340
Bravo just went to the bathroom.

4127
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,180
Let's talk shit about them.

4128
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,930
Motherfuckers on tonight.

4129
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:08,390
I'm gonna focus on one.

4130
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:10,640
He's so passionate,

4131
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:11,750
super passionate,

4132
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,400
and you know what I think,

4133
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:17,140
I think the moral of the story at
night and he needs that more kids dot.

4134
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,290
Some little afternoon kids.

4135
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:18,501
Well,

4136
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:19,280
it's beautiful.

4137
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,113
I love hearing that.

4138
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:21,890
I love hearing that now.

4139
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:22,641
All 20 minutes.

4140
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:23,474
I love,

4141
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:26,900
he got a little crazy 20
minutes after a while.

4142
01:53:26,901 --> 01:53:27,930
I got it in the first day.

4143
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:29,540
It was just sweet though.

4144
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,160
There was no way it was going to end.

4145
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,370
I tried even jumping in,

4146
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:33,960
man,

4147
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,450
he's a passionate guy and he,

4148
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,110
he's,

4149
01:53:36,110 --> 01:53:40,760
what he is saying is what is on his
mind and he's so overwhelmed with it,

4150
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:42,650
but that's why he's so
great at everything he does.

4151
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:43,430
He's also right,

4152
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:44,510
gets obsessed with things.

4153
01:53:44,511 --> 01:53:44,961
He is right.

4154
01:53:44,961 --> 01:53:45,591
He's also right.

4155
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:50,591
But he gets obsessed with things and
it's why it's why he's this Jujitsu.

4156
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:52,520
Um,

4157
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:52,940
yes.

4158
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,180
I mean that's really what it is.

4159
01:53:54,181 --> 01:53:56,210
And his mind works like that
with everything and it's,

4160
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:58,340
it's working like that
with parenthood too,

4161
01:53:58,341 --> 01:54:01,370
which is a beautiful thing if you're
not obsessed with a kid that I kind of

4162
01:54:01,371 --> 01:54:02,204
suck.

4163
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,260
A lot of people aren't.

4164
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:07,100
It's uncommon for sure to think that
there's said that we don't really care and

4165
01:54:07,101 --> 01:54:09,300
they don't love people that are
with them and they're don't,

4166
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,760
don't love their families.

4167
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,860
Brian,

4168
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,491
a lot of people,

4169
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:13,201
I brightened their day.

4170
01:54:13,201 --> 01:54:13,461
You can't,

4171
01:54:13,461 --> 01:54:14,210
that's not fair.

4172
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:15,043
Hey Bro.

4173
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:19,670
I said it twice in a really weird way.

4174
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:20,510
Like in a movie I went,

4175
01:54:20,511 --> 01:54:23,360
a lot of people aren't Brennan Brennan.

4176
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,920
When you say something twice,

4177
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:26,570
it's always kind of like
one of those things.

4178
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:27,623
I

4179
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,620
know it means something
else that you can take.

4180
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:31,011
Watch this.

4181
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,780
Ready Joe?

4182
01:54:32,781 --> 01:54:36,020
Rogan's a strong hold on
Joe Rogan's a strong guy.

4183
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:37,880
He's a strong guy.

4184
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,171
You're dead.

4185
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:39,391
Yeah,

4186
01:54:39,391 --> 01:54:40,310
there's a way to live.

4187
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:42,110
You can sarcastically expect,

4188
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:44,610
especially if you flatly,

4189
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:45,111
yeah,

4190
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:46,130
you can do a lot of different things.

4191
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:51,140
What I thought sometimes it's dead serious
if you like overemphasize the second

4192
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:51,974
time.

4193
01:54:52,330 --> 01:54:54,470
Did you like Conor McGregor
is a bad motherfucker,

4194
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:54,801
dude.

4195
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:57,320
Conor McGregor is all bad.

4196
01:54:57,321 --> 01:54:57,810
Period.

4197
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,290
Yes.

4198
01:54:58,290 --> 01:54:59,123
Period.

4199
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:00,020
Hold on.

4200
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:00,320
Fuck.

4201
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,310
Here's an acting job.

4202
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:04,430
Can you say it three times
and change the third times?

4203
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:05,264
Meaning

4204
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:10,280
like what do you mean Greg is Bama is bad.

4205
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:12,900
That mother fucker is bad.

4206
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:14,050
You see I'm just pulling boat.

4207
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,950
Super Black.

4208
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:17,631
That's how I talk.

4209
01:55:17,631 --> 01:55:18,370
I'm from Aurora.

4210
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,203
What we do,

4211
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:21,940
remember when Kimbo slice
asked you if you were black,

4212
01:55:23,190 --> 01:55:23,760
you know,

4213
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,280
it's like one of my favorite steps.

4214
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:26,350
The way,

4215
01:55:26,350 --> 01:55:28,160
say mostly stuff that he was black.

4216
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,330
They had heard that there was a guy on
the podcast or on the podcast on the

4217
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:33,290
ultimate fighter.

4218
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,153
Oh Shit.

4219
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:36,290
Tell slate does us Kamozi he taps

4220
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:40,110
Dallas's Jujitsu's legitimate farts.

4221
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,220
Kamozi he gets joc rate twice.

4222
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:44,140
And then as

4223
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,090
ladies,

4224
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:47,190
that's a big win for [inaudible].

4225
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:48,200
Yeah.

4226
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,130
I haven't seen him in a long time.

4227
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:54,240
So there was a guy on the ultimate
fighter that was a possibly a Nazi.

4228
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:54,900
He went full,

4229
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,531
full rogue,

4230
01:55:55,531 --> 01:55:55,950
racist.

4231
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:57,900
And they got together and they were,

4232
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:58,380
they were,

4233
01:55:58,380 --> 01:55:59,310
they were all talking about it.

4234
01:55:59,311 --> 01:56:01,350
And they went to Brendon cause it said,

4235
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:01,920
uh,

4236
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,281
you know,

4237
01:56:02,281 --> 01:56:04,020
they thought that Brendan
was black and Brown is like,

4238
01:56:04,021 --> 01:56:04,201
dude,

4239
01:56:04,201 --> 01:56:04,830
I'm not black.

4240
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:07,140
So you ain't black and
Kimbo so what did he say?

4241
01:56:07,141 --> 01:56:07,411
He goes,

4242
01:56:07,411 --> 01:56:08,244
that's why

4243
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:09,830
I love the chuck is until,

4244
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:11,190
what the fuck you

4245
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:20,800
Thomas latest always had a nasty joke,

4246
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:23,020
has always had a nasty Cho.

4247
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,880
Joey's had a nasty,

4248
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:26,661
you know what?

4249
01:56:26,661 --> 01:56:28,520
If he would have held that
in for 30 more seconds,

4250
01:56:28,521 --> 01:56:30,020
he would have turned
them into a vegetable.

4251
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,011
Get chance.

4252
01:56:31,011 --> 01:56:31,721
That's why there's rafts.

4253
01:56:31,721 --> 01:56:32,554
They're red here.

4254
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,411
There's a play,

4255
01:56:33,411 --> 01:56:38,411
a sick play called the Toyer and it's
about this guy who has been coming into

4256
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:43,640
women's houses and he sticks a needle
in their back that caused them to become

4257
01:56:43,641 --> 01:56:45,170
vegetables like you're talking about.

4258
01:56:45,171 --> 01:56:47,440
And then he like dresses
them up like galls bevy.

4259
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:48,050
Look up there.

4260
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:48,883
Oh no,

4261
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:53,300
that's awesome.

4262
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,870
Did you Jamie,

4263
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:56,940
Jamie,

4264
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,773
Jamie,

4265
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:58,733
Jamie,

4266
01:56:59,460 --> 01:56:59,870
Jamie.

4267
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:01,250
There's so ridiculous,

4268
01:57:01,251 --> 01:57:03,950
amazing fucking calendar.

4269
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:08,810
Can you a Photoshop ray Lewis and full
football gear like tackling somebody in

4270
01:57:08,811 --> 01:57:13,550
the octagon with side cheese and it
says this ain't the Superbowl bitch.

4271
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:15,620
That's a lot of work.

4272
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:19,400
Listen to Photoshop,

4273
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:20,100
Steve.

4274
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,820
They're already doing it right and
there people are doing it right now.

4275
01:57:22,821 --> 01:57:23,690
When you get out of here,

4276
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,920
you're going to have 40 of them

4277
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,231
too much.

4278
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:28,064
I apologize.

4279
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:30,060
Just regard that

4280
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:30,661
request.

4281
01:57:30,661 --> 01:57:31,301
Nate Diaz,

4282
01:57:31,301 --> 01:57:32,320
Conor McGregor too.

4283
01:57:32,321 --> 01:57:34,600
What's your call and give a call it,

4284
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:35,520
I don't ever yell.

4285
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:35,890
I'm just,

4286
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:36,581
I'm being dramatic.

4287
01:57:36,581 --> 01:57:37,270
Listen man.

4288
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:38,710
Nate Diaz has a full camp,

4289
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:40,660
but he also has all that goddamn press.

4290
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:45,850
He's also got all that pressure and
Connor has an opportunity to prepare

4291
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,200
exclusively just for him.

4292
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:50,630
And it's not like he didn't have some
success in the first fight because a lot

4293
01:57:50,631 --> 01:57:52,450
of pretty much dominated the first round.

4294
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,441
He looked beautiful,

4295
01:57:53,441 --> 01:57:58,441
but the problem was he tried to use
those one hitter quitter punches.

4296
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:01,060
He tried to just crack them and drop them.

4297
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:02,980
And Nate is a bigger,

4298
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:06,340
stronger man than most of the
people that Connor's fought.

4299
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,200
And he knows how to absorb punches.

4300
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:13,210
And he's sparred with a lot of
world class boxers like Andre Ward.

4301
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:13,711
It's fine.

4302
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:14,590
It's fine tonight.

4303
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:15,790
Don't tell me the results.

4304
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:16,541
I don't know the results.

4305
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:20,080
I'm not touching my phone until you
get back mean to you guys are great.

4306
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,220
I love Andre Ward.

4307
01:58:21,221 --> 01:58:22,054
He's one of my favorite.

4308
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:22,421
Awesome.

4309
01:58:22,421 --> 01:58:23,560
He's so fucking smart.

4310
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:24,970
That's what I like about Andre Ward.

4311
01:58:24,971 --> 01:58:25,804
Pound for pound.

4312
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:26,500
Damn.

4313
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,580
He's so God damn smart.

4314
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,080
When he breaks down boxing,

4315
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:31,740
like when he does a the
analyst position on each photo,

4316
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:32,950
you realize like,

4317
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:33,311
oh,

4318
01:58:33,311 --> 01:58:33,491
okay,

4319
01:58:33,491 --> 01:58:34,031
this is dude.

4320
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:35,950
It's just a super smart

4321
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,470
undefeated gold medal

4322
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:40,093
in the Olympics.

4323
01:58:40,110 --> 01:58:40,540
Yeah,

4324
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,060
yeah.

4325
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,200
What I was talking to hiring

4326
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,800
very high last night,

4327
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:45,281
Andre Ward,

4328
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:46,070
because no,

4329
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:47,080
is that football?

4330
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:48,663
Andre Ward.

4331
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:50,860
The ward play for the lions.

4332
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:51,220
You're right.

4333
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:51,850
That's what I'm,

4334
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,600
that's it.

4335
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,650
There's a boxer now.

4336
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:54,563
Yes.

4337
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,650
He's there to wear boxing.

4338
01:58:56,651 --> 01:58:57,070
I'm like,

4339
01:58:57,070 --> 01:59:00,820
is that guy like 45 now and fighting
and fighting like burnt on the ward.

4340
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:03,070
You're talking about played
for the Detroit Lions Yas.

4341
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:03,390
Good.

4342
01:59:03,390 --> 01:59:04,223
Call it.

4343
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:09,080
I had a conversation with
Andre Berto in camp confused.

4344
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:11,313
I'm sorry,

4345
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,243
go ahead.

4346
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,040
I had this conversation with Andre Berto.

4347
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:19,120
What about Andre Ward and because they're
in the same camp and their buddies,

4348
01:59:19,121 --> 01:59:23,020
they came together and he was telling
me that he learned a lot just watching

4349
01:59:23,021 --> 01:59:23,831
Andre Ward,

4350
01:59:23,831 --> 01:59:25,750
like when the wave version
of hunter has him do it.

4351
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:26,950
If you watch him warm up,

4352
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,600
he'll do things.

4353
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:32,530
He's so technical where he
like literally will just,

4354
01:59:32,531 --> 01:59:34,510
he won't throw punches when shadow boxes.

4355
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:39,190
He spends a lot of time literally
just doing the perfect kind of hooks.

4356
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:43,270
Like everything is like he's obsessed
with people and not watching it.

4357
01:59:43,271 --> 01:59:43,571
You do it.

4358
01:59:43,571 --> 01:59:46,150
Everything super slow in the
air and she has everything.

4359
01:59:46,151 --> 01:59:48,550
He's obsessed with perfect technique,

4360
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:53,790
like every detail where his feet are
and he always does that and he obsesses

4361
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:59,011
over exactly where his body is going to
be in almost slow motion for a long time

4362
01:59:59,321 --> 02:00:01,000
and then he'll start doing things.

4363
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:03,700
But well I didn't
fundamentals when I was a kid.

4364
02:00:03,701 --> 02:00:06,970
I used to think that forms were stupid
and I should think that like even

4365
02:00:06,971 --> 02:00:11,080
throwing kicks in the air couldn't compare
to doing things like throwing kicks

4366
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:14,350
on the bag and they're like a lot of the
decorative aspects of martial arts like

4367
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:14,860
you know,

4368
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:18,020
throw a side kick and you hold it up
there and then you throw second sidekick

4369
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,140
and then you do all these
different combinations that
you'd have to do in these

4370
02:00:20,141 --> 02:00:20,680
forms.

4371
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,520
I just think they're stupid,

4372
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:25,900
but now understand that it's almost
like you're doing like a form of yoga.

4373
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:26,520
Yes.

4374
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,890
Throwing those kicks out there and you're
holding them in place and even though

4375
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:31,480
that's not how you would ever fight,

4376
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:34,180
these are all important movements.

4377
02:00:34,181 --> 02:00:36,400
If you could figure out how to
do that and make it beautiful.

4378
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,340
Float while also body control.

4379
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,180
Yeah,

4380
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,200
control body control.

4381
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,280
Hey Jamie and bring up to
Andre Ward for like sidekicks.

4382
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:48,970
That is like one of the most important
aspects of throwing a sidekick is

4383
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,110
throwing it in the air.

4384
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:54,670
Learning how to throw it in the air while
your body is moving forward because if

4385
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:57,430
you use a bag prematurely,

4386
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:01,570
you grow up customed to bouncing off
of it and that's the difference between

4387
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:05,920
someone who bounces off of that technique
and drives through it and the person

4388
02:01:05,921 --> 02:01:07,030
who drives through it,

4389
02:01:07,031 --> 02:01:08,440
when they drive with their hip,

4390
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:12,040
there's so much more power and
it takes the same amount of time.

4391
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:14,200
There's no difference
in the amount of time,

4392
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:17,680
but the amount of force that someone
who knows how to really drive their hip

4393
02:01:17,681 --> 02:01:18,460
forward,

4394
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:22,810
that you developed that a lot of is by
kicking the air cause you snap and you

4395
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:26,770
extend that side kick out and you pull
it back and you snap and it's all about

4396
02:01:26,771 --> 02:01:28,390
doing it as fast as you can.

4397
02:01:28,510 --> 02:01:31,030
And then once you developed
the technique perfectly,

4398
02:01:31,031 --> 02:01:32,890
then you start moving to kicking things.

4399
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:34,720
And usually it's a person with a cushion.

4400
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:39,010
They moves towards you slowly or it's a
really light bag and you slowly develop

4401
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:41,060
ability to move your weight into it.

4402
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:42,440
But if you don't do it right,

4403
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,640
you can develop.

4404
02:01:43,641 --> 02:01:46,910
This is this one aspect of that
kick that most people have,

4405
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:48,870
which is they kick off of people.

4406
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,390
They kicked him and they push off.

4407
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:50,841
That's right.

4408
02:01:50,841 --> 02:01:51,890
The woman,

4409
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,460
um,

4410
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,160
in this,

4411
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,910
in who's responsible for the
Russian revolution and tennis,

4412
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:58,550
like she came out with a
sharp pauvre off and all the,

4413
02:01:58,551 --> 02:01:58,880
uh,

4414
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,410
Sarah Poba and all these movies,

4415
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,790
these amazing tennis player.

4416
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:07,250
She will have her students in a
group before they even hit a ball.

4417
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,350
Just slowly,

4418
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:10,070
you know,

4419
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:14,450
literally just practicing their
stroke in a really slow manner.

4420
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:16,240
It's the same exact
thing that clutch goes.

4421
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,750
Does the same thing the first week there?

4422
02:02:17,751 --> 02:02:20,750
I think the first two weeks of the
camp is all basics and super slowly.

4423
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:21,190
Yeah.

4424
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:24,350
Jamie put bring up Andre Ward
like shadow box and warming up.

4425
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:25,880
It's really wild to watch.

4426
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:28,580
Nobody upset a bit going
on right now though.

4427
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,060
Yeah,

4428
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:30,590
it is really interesting man.

4429
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:35,770
It really interesting like though the
idea of what is the best way to learn how

4430
02:02:35,901 --> 02:02:37,490
to execute certain techniques,

4431
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:38,810
which there's always,

4432
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,520
there's always a lot of debate about it,

4433
02:02:40,521 --> 02:02:41,060
man.

4434
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:44,570
There's a lot of debate about how much
sparring you should do versus how much

4435
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:48,890
you know simulation drills you should do
versus how much bad work you should do

4436
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:50,960
when this might be it.

4437
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,600
I don't know if this is the one
we're watching them right now.

4438
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:55,340
There's another one where he's,

4439
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:55,881
yeah,

4440
02:02:55,881 --> 02:02:57,800
he's being watched right now
so he's going to go faster.

4441
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,330
Well just doing regular
shuttle them off to them,

4442
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,510
but bringing up man,

4443
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:01,850
fuck.

4444
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:02,840
Bring up the other one.

4445
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:04,280
Bring up the other one where he's,

4446
02:03:04,281 --> 02:03:06,680
you'll see it going to be,

4447
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:07,880
Holy Shit.

4448
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:10,430
Look at how specific or too
though I'm interested in.

4449
02:03:10,431 --> 02:03:11,900
I don't want to know who won tonight,

4450
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:13,370
but if Andre Ward wins,

4451
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:17,390
I'm very interested in him
versus the one that's the plan.

4452
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:18,920
It's for sure a cola has a fight.

4453
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,100
War has a fight.

4454
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:22,750
And then next is Covello
very interested enough.

4455
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:24,070
I can't walk man,

4456
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:24,890
if I,

4457
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:25,830
if I had to put my money on.

4458
02:03:25,831 --> 02:03:30,831
So right now it's Cova love Kovalev
is Cain killed a guy he did and he,

4459
02:03:31,701 --> 02:03:32,330
you know what?

4460
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,710
I was really most impressed
with what he's done.

4461
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:35,711
Boxed pornography.

4462
02:03:35,711 --> 02:03:36,544
He's doing right.

4463
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,320
Don't look at this.

4464
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:38,840
Got He was boxing them up.

4465
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:40,700
It was going pretty fast.

4466
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,120
No,

4467
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:43,953
he's tried.

4468
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,080
Some of it was slow.

4469
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:45,411
Yeah.

4470
02:03:45,411 --> 02:03:45,560
No,

4471
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:46,340
that's super slow.

4472
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:46,890
There we go.

4473
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:51,320
So now he's the most impressive
shadowboxing I've ever seen.

4474
02:03:51,321 --> 02:03:52,190
I thought he's awesome.

4475
02:03:53,070 --> 02:03:53,870
He's so good.

4476
02:03:53,870 --> 02:03:54,531
Interesting.

4477
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:56,300
Cause he's stolen those
punches with power.

4478
02:03:56,301 --> 02:03:57,740
You could tell them in the snap.

4479
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,430
It's all,

4480
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:59,950
what's the perfect word?

4481
02:03:59,951 --> 02:04:00,784
Like when we were

4482
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:02,951
caught up,

4483
02:04:02,951 --> 02:04:03,310
oh,

4484
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,530
you want to forums called bubble.

4485
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,340
People talk shit on cotton for so long.

4486
02:04:07,341 --> 02:04:08,174
This is just caught up.

4487
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:08,571
Yeah,

4488
02:04:08,571 --> 02:04:10,450
it might be even better even than Catia.

4489
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:13,730
You know what's interesting when you
watch a guy like him do that as opposed to

4490
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:15,440
that Russian gentleman that
we were seeing earlier,

4491
02:04:15,441 --> 02:04:16,460
that's learning how to box.

4492
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,900
That's where you see the difference.

4493
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:19,480
We're talking about best
in the world for us,

4494
02:04:19,481 --> 02:04:20,890
the guy who just had last week,

4495
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:22,160
but those movements,

4496
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,450
they're not unattainable.

4497
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:24,290
You know what I'm saying?

4498
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:27,680
It's like watching someone do a move,

4499
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:28,071
right?

4500
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:29,300
Like say if they're doing a,

4501
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:33,120
they're choreographing Michael Jackson's
thriller when all the dunes would do,

4502
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:34,190
all the zombies are doing.

4503
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:35,720
That was like a choreographed thing,

4504
02:04:35,721 --> 02:04:36,140
right?

4505
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:38,700
So the idea that there's similar movement,

4506
02:04:38,701 --> 02:04:39,900
everybody has similar movement.

4507
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:43,620
That movement that he's
doing is not attainable.

4508
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,720
What he's doing is things
that everyone can do.

4509
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:47,430
They just can't do it
the way he's doing it.

4510
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:47,751
He's just,

4511
02:04:47,751 --> 02:04:48,720
which is what makes it,

4512
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:51,630
what makes it so special is nothing.

4513
02:04:51,631 --> 02:04:56,220
He's doing his crazy acrobatic ridiculous
movements that the average person

4514
02:04:56,221 --> 02:04:56,551
can't do.

4515
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:57,780
Like your Air Rodriguez,

4516
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,250
who are going to watch fight tonight.

4517
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,930
This fucking dude does.

4518
02:05:00,931 --> 02:05:05,931
Why you old shit flying knee bars flying
round kicks and jumping double round

4519
02:05:06,961 --> 02:05:07,321
kicks.

4520
02:05:07,321 --> 02:05:07,920
He's fun.

4521
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,390
He's ridiculously,

4522
02:05:09,391 --> 02:05:10,224
yeah,

4523
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:10,771
no,

4524
02:05:10,771 --> 02:05:14,370
he's a talk with no guy
can do the regular Mexican.

4525
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:15,263
Yeah,

4526
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:16,840
he's a bad motherfucker.

4527
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,180
No Mexican is fuck.

4528
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,133
Oh Shit.

4529
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,130
So,

4530
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:23,270
so the what he's going to
do the big differences.

4531
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,200
What he's gonna do his
shit that we can't do.

4532
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:28,230
Like you look at him throwing
those kicks in like fuck,

4533
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:29,850
like look at this crazy guy.

4534
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,410
Like he's for jumping,

4535
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:34,830
spinning cartwheels through the air and
roundhouse kick and dudes in the back of

4536
02:05:34,831 --> 02:05:35,221
the neck.

4537
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:36,270
Like it ain't for everybody.

4538
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:37,080
It's not fair.

4539
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,270
It's not for everybody.

4540
02:05:39,271 --> 02:05:42,210
Just most people have never
gone that far with the Reps.

4541
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:44,440
I don't think also some people aren't,

4542
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:47,340
even though it's not like
Cirque du Solei stuff,

4543
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,833
what he's doing,

4544
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:51,270
they take some genetic genetic.

4545
02:05:51,271 --> 02:05:53,360
My point is that no one,

4546
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:54,421
he's Mexican.

4547
02:05:54,421 --> 02:05:54,751
Come on.

4548
02:05:54,751 --> 02:05:55,584
It's not genetic.

4549
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:56,723
My point is it,

4550
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:01,740
no one has a problem doing
this or this or this or this.

4551
02:06:01,770 --> 02:06:05,610
No one has a problem with throwing
a normal punch at a very slow pace.

4552
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:08,040
But you can't even do what he's doing.

4553
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:09,120
Like those cartwheel kicks.

4554
02:06:09,121 --> 02:06:10,350
You can't even do that slowly.

4555
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,300
You can't move the way he's moving.

4556
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,030
So the difference between what
a guy like yeah here can do.

4557
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:16,260
And the guy like Andre War could do,

4558
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,220
I didn't even weigh it makes what Andre
Ward can do even more impressive way

4559
02:06:20,221 --> 02:06:24,840
more than cause he's boxing guys up and
he's doing it based on his understanding

4560
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:27,210
of each different position
that might come up.

4561
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,210
My two guys are trying to punch each
other in the face and also the basic,

4562
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:31,710
the basic superstar.

4563
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:32,940
But those basics,

4564
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:36,510
I could teach my daughter to do it if,

4565
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:39,690
if she just listened
to me and move slowly.

4566
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:40,890
I'm not saying that you know,

4567
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:43,410
someone could punch someone to
hurt someone like immediately,

4568
02:06:43,411 --> 02:06:45,840
but I think you could take
like a 60 year old executive.

4569
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:48,630
It never thrown a punch in his
life and you have them stand there.

4570
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:50,040
Just make him listen to you.

4571
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,140
Make him put his foot here.

4572
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:51,870
Lower your way,

4573
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:52,650
lower your weight.

4574
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:53,010
Okay.

4575
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:53,731
Square shoulders,

4576
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:54,211
hands up,

4577
02:06:54,211 --> 02:06:54,421
right?

4578
02:06:54,421 --> 02:06:55,111
Reaching bonds are,

4579
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:55,944
and just do this.

4580
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:57,103
I just want you to do this.

4581
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:58,013
Now do this.

4582
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:58,530
Okay,

4583
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:00,480
now try to get this same
guy to do a wheel kick.

4584
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:00,960
Yeah,

4585
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,160
like clothes.

4586
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:07,240
So you're convert trick is to do is in
one way more impressive cause he can do

4587
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:09,330
his physical shit that
most people can't do.

4588
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:13,440
But another way it makes what Andre
Ward does more impressive because Andre

4589
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:13,530
Ward,

4590
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:16,650
he's way better than everybody else
and just doing shit that everybody.

4591
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:17,903
That's true.

4592
02:07:19,330 --> 02:07:20,163
You're saying,

4593
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:25,180
but what you're actually saying is that
punching is more anatomically natural I

4594
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:27,960
think to a human being walking around.

4595
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:29,450
What's season is ticking.

4596
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:31,020
It's is really hard.

4597
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:34,830
Like understanding I'm really
good sidekick are around
house her a wheel kicked

4598
02:07:34,831 --> 02:07:35,830
back and not natural.

4599
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,130
It's

4600
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,530
not natural it tastes like,

4601
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,590
but it's like everything else,

4602
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,450
even though punching it seems to attain,

4603
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:44,410
you can drill it into someone over and
over and they can reach that razor sharp

4604
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:45,290
level of,

4605
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:49,720
of efficiencies wherein Andre
Ward or Kovalev is I think,

4606
02:07:49,721 --> 02:07:51,160
which I can't wait to see that fight.

4607
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:51,994
By the way.

4608
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:52,680
Keep calling.

4609
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:57,680
That's of the most radical taekwondo
kicks x that you could do in the cage.

4610
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:04,060
There's some acrobatics taekwondo stuff
that Cirque du Solei step when you have

4611
02:08:04,061 --> 02:08:06,370
those as forms and dudes
will store like fucking,

4612
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:07,760
they'll spin like flies.

4613
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:09,280
Yeah,

4614
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,810
that shit you'll never do.

4615
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,610
But maybe you will one day.

4616
02:08:12,611 --> 02:08:13,530
But I'm gonna.

4617
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:14,060
I'm gonna.

4618
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:16,210
A lot of guys can't do it though because
they're not athletic and if they don't

4619
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:17,044
have the vertical,

4620
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:19,460
that's the super crazy shit.

4621
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:22,240
If you could do it in the cage,

4622
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:23,253
anybody could do it.

4623
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:25,000
But listen to my page.

4624
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:26,591
Michael,

4625
02:08:26,591 --> 02:08:29,130
page three 60 roundhouse kick in Beltour.

4626
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:29,680
Yeah,

4627
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,340
he knocks him.

4628
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:32,360
Do that with a three 60
roundhouse kick in the face.

4629
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:37,140
He jumps spinning ThreeSixty roundhouse
kick like he was a fucking dude in is

4630
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:41,480
that video can see that
he's the same guy that face.

4631
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:42,600
Oh,

4632
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,150
so good.

4633
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:45,130
Michael Page page.

4634
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:45,911
I need to see.

4635
02:08:45,911 --> 02:08:46,744
It's fun to watch.

4636
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:49,240
Palatar but I remember him.

4637
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:51,160
He's the breakout star Bell tour.

4638
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,780
They need to handle them.

4639
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:54,120
And Lemon Chandler there.

4640
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:56,260
Wonderboy people don't know
how good Chandler is either.

4641
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,610
We'll Chandler beat Eddie Alvarez.

4642
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:59,680
EOC changes beat Eddie Alvarez.

4643
02:08:59,681 --> 02:09:00,730
Do you see what he'd knocked out?

4644
02:09:00,731 --> 02:09:01,780
Pitbull and his last fight.

4645
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:03,663
Fucking monster,

4646
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:04,503
dude.

4647
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:06,040
Michael Venom page.

4648
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:07,320
It could.

4649
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,170
It's possible.

4650
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:08,680
Look,

4651
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:09,430
I would love that.

4652
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:12,470
I wouldn't want to daddy say Simon
the El Toro versus UFC could apply.

4653
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:13,570
What the fuck would you have to do this?

4654
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,880
I would listen man.

4655
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:17,530
Guy With the new owners.

4656
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:19,963
Would that ruin,

4657
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:21,071
ruin Bella towards,

4658
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:23,080
but you'll see what I have
no reason to listen man.

4659
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:28,081
I don't think it's ruining anybody
can be a bad idea and money in it.

4660
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:29,260
I think there might be money in it.

4661
02:09:29,261 --> 02:09:29,621
Watch this.

4662
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:29,980
Watch this.

4663
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:30,970
Look at this.

4664
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:32,200
Watch this watch page.

4665
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:33,220
He backs up here,

4666
02:09:33,221 --> 02:09:35,250
comes check out.

4667
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:36,520
She got hurt and he got him hurt.

4668
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:40,200
Oh shh.

4669
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:41,993
There

4670
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:44,670
too.

4671
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:46,540
He just stands there and he's white.

4672
02:09:46,541 --> 02:09:47,374
He's a monster.

4673
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:49,330
It takes a lot of practice.

4674
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:51,810
You can't just do that and you got to,

4675
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:53,370
they're being smart with her too.

4676
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,150
They're being super smart
one what they should be.

4677
02:09:55,151 --> 02:09:55,630
He's uh,

4678
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:58,060
he's their star man and he speaks well.

4679
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,020
He's a character.

4680
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:02,020
He's entire 70 or 55,

4681
02:10:02,021 --> 02:10:02,890
77.

4682
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:06,460
I want to see that guy fight
like world class fighters.

4683
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:08,360
I want to see that guy fight a really,

4684
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:11,350
he just got caught looting Bella tour.

4685
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:15,340
If the UFC is not going to sign
Ben Aspirin Bella tour signed,

4686
02:10:15,341 --> 02:10:16,510
Ben asked Grin.

4687
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:17,481
You know what?

4688
02:10:17,481 --> 02:10:18,420
I'm string mops the floor.

4689
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:22,390
Know that there's like people who have
a problem with the guy who could just

4690
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:23,440
take everybody down.

4691
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:26,320
That's the other Andre Ward thing though.

4692
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:28,360
Ben Africans the best at the bay.

4693
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:29,630
You know exactly what the fuck.

4694
02:10:29,631 --> 02:10:31,120
He's new but he's still does it anyway.

4695
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,820
Is he not going to it?

4696
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:37,310
I'm not some people down in one FC cause
they let him use knees on the ground

4697
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,410
and he can use needs in the
ground now with the new rules,

4698
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:41,480
Ben asking him and gets
way more dangerous.

4699
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:43,880
Mops the floor within Wyndham.

4700
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:44,931
Andre Ward.

4701
02:10:44,931 --> 02:10:46,010
Is he knocking everybody out

4702
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:52,270
and he's at light heavyweight
like a printout Winokur no,

4703
02:10:52,290 --> 02:10:52,490
no,

4704
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:53,323
no.

4705
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:56,180
Watch this fight and honey
Jason and throwing down.

4706
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:56,520
Watch.

4707
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:59,150
Watch me mean as he's doing
his front kicks to his body.

4708
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,960
That's a young Roberto Duran right there.

4709
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,210
He's rough.

4710
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:05,390
Cut for boat drill was never that
thick to good call and no he wasn't.

4711
02:11:05,391 --> 02:11:06,930
But Duran is great.

4712
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:07,730
That's,

4713
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:08,600
it's just interesting.

4714
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:11,810
Roberto Duran crazy as that.

4715
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:13,790
Did you know that they made
a movie about Vinny Pazienza.

4716
02:11:13,791 --> 02:11:14,624
Have you seen that ad?

4717
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:19,690
I want to see that man's a car
accident came back and fought.

4718
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:21,560
What are you watching trailers all day?

4719
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:22,180
Oh No.

4720
02:11:22,180 --> 02:11:24,330
Now I don't envy.

4721
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,160
I love pies.

4722
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,270
Spoiler alert.

4723
02:11:26,271 --> 02:11:28,400
Spoiler alert type breaks his neck.

4724
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:28,731
Well,

4725
02:11:28,731 --> 02:11:28,851
no,

4726
02:11:28,851 --> 02:11:29,810
he did it in real life.

4727
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:30,501
You bastards.

4728
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:30,890
Look at,

4729
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:32,260
look at during this Dennis Bermudez,

4730
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:33,450
he's just crushing them.

4731
02:11:33,451 --> 02:11:34,530
He's a fucking monster.

4732
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,800
Like seven in a older
men are not the loss.

4733
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:41,420
I met her hands in Vegas once and he
was wearing this beautiful suit with a

4734
02:11:41,421 --> 02:11:44,380
Bandana that was made of
the same like materials.

4735
02:11:44,381 --> 02:11:45,160
So,

4736
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:45,440
aw,

4737
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,010
he's awesome.

4738
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:46,771
It's fucking right.

4739
02:11:46,771 --> 02:11:47,604
Beautiful,

4740
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:51,040
beautiful Badass.

4741
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,510
He's a bad ass time guy.

4742
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:55,010
I fucking love him.

4743
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:56,630
I went to see that guy fight.

4744
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:56,990
I,

4745
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:59,240
I paid to see him fight a couple of times.

4746
02:11:59,241 --> 02:12:00,560
Me and my friend Jimmy Wallace,

4747
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:02,030
we went to Providence,

4748
02:12:02,031 --> 02:12:04,940
Rhode Island to watch
him fight a bra lawless.

4749
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:06,200
Jimmy lawless.

4750
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:09,770
That's his name is he related to
his real name was blackie lawless.

4751
02:12:10,740 --> 02:12:11,290
I asked him,

4752
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:11,931
I asked boom,

4753
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:12,530
boom.

4754
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:13,191
Real name though.

4755
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:15,470
Jimmy lost like your name is Eddie
Bravo and that sounds ridiculous.

4756
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,000
His real name was Jimmy lawless.

4757
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:18,860
My name sounds ridiculous.

4758
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:19,641
Well it sounds cool.

4759
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:20,570
It sounds like a superhero.

4760
02:12:20,571 --> 02:12:21,200
Yeah.

4761
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:21,670
Bravo.

4762
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,960
It sounds like you picked
like bravo was like,

4763
02:12:23,961 --> 02:12:24,291
you know,

4764
02:12:24,291 --> 02:12:25,670
it's like Eddie awesome.

4765
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:26,091
He's like,

4766
02:12:26,091 --> 02:12:26,924
my name's Eddie off,

4767
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:28,620
so it really picked that.

4768
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:29,720
I wish my name was Brendan.

4769
02:12:29,721 --> 02:12:30,554
Awesome.

4770
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,940
My stage name.

4771
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:32,901
They really,

4772
02:12:32,901 --> 02:12:34,320
they think you fucking make it.

4773
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,700
Isn't it funny that you
can't pick your own name?

4774
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,050
I just want him named Marcel something.

4775
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:39,560
Awesome.

4776
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:40,400
Well why can't you?

4777
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:41,060
I did.

4778
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:41,421
I named,

4779
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:42,254
my name is the kid.

4780
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:43,190
Yeah,

4781
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:44,290
you did name itself.

4782
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:49,010
Came to set one day I was
doing a movie and I said,

4783
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:50,390
it's my new name is the kid.

4784
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,680
I never liked it to Larry.

4785
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:55,700
Larry effect and then him
calling him something,

4786
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,080
he caught myself,

4787
02:12:57,081 --> 02:12:57,620
the kid,

4788
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:58,453
they,

4789
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:01,100
the camera man started saying,

4790
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:01,851
Hey kid,

4791
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:02,121
can you,

4792
02:13:02,121 --> 02:13:02,601
and I was like,

4793
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:03,141
what'd you say?

4794
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:03,531
And he goes,

4795
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:03,831
kick.

4796
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:04,664
Can you Morocco.

4797
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,781
It's the kid.

4798
02:13:05,781 --> 02:13:07,760
So please call me and fucking,

4799
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:08,960
and I was dead serious.

4800
02:13:08,961 --> 02:13:09,830
So here's the thing,

4801
02:13:09,831 --> 02:13:13,650
Brian and I have been
friends for 22 years.

4802
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:15,260
1995 sir,

4803
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:16,790
21 years.

4804
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:19,720
And he always called himself the kid,

4805
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,860
the kid back when he was a kid.

4806
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:25,783
I love it.

4807
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,221
I mean young.

4808
02:13:26,221 --> 02:13:28,450
He was always the kid my age,

4809
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:28,700
you know,

4810
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:29,533
the kid rolls

4811
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,770
kid.

4812
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:33,200
He was always calling himself the kid.

4813
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:35,850
It's how the kid is kind of a good Ra.

4814
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,640
Pride count always was ridiculous.

4815
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:41,040
I remember the first time I
went over to Brian counts house.

4816
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:41,940
He had no door knob.

4817
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,200
Okay?

4818
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,160
I go to his door,

4819
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:45,960
I get to his door,

4820
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,570
there's no fucking door knob.

4821
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:47,821
I'm like,

4822
02:13:47,821 --> 02:13:48,061
dude,

4823
02:13:48,061 --> 02:13:49,150
you don't have a doorknob knob.

4824
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:49,591
It's like,

4825
02:13:49,591 --> 02:13:49,841
Nah,

4826
02:13:49,841 --> 02:13:50,301
Nah.

4827
02:13:50,301 --> 02:13:51,870
It's like it's fucking homeless.

4828
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:52,411
Lady came in,

4829
02:13:52,411 --> 02:13:53,010
she was cooking.

4830
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:55,650
One day I go white homeless lady.

4831
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:57,200
She was cooking eggs and is,

4832
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:57,441
yeah,

4833
02:13:57,441 --> 02:13:57,611
yeah.

4834
02:13:57,611 --> 02:13:58,250
I called the cops.

4835
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:58,550
Meelod.

4836
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:01,260
Denis Spooner's is beating
the fucking Tara and Johnny.

4837
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:02,123
Jason.

4838
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:04,110
I used to walk my pimples with no leash.

4839
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,040
They'd kill cats.

4840
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:06,953
Worst thing,

4841
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:07,950
they kill the neighbor.

4842
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:09,270
They killed this cow and I was like,

4843
02:14:09,271 --> 02:14:09,781
oh no.

4844
02:14:09,781 --> 02:14:10,614
And I grabbed the cat,

4845
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,240
ran away and buried it.

4846
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:14,110
There were signs everywhere.

4847
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:17,190
Case Bermudez is just so bad.

4848
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:18,840
I'm so close to a title shot.

4849
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:20,120
You want someone to place,

4850
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:21,870
yeah.

4851
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:24,810
There's some dudes you cannot
let posture up and made as a,

4852
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:25,653
certainly one of them.

4853
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:27,540
He knows strong wrestlers,

4854
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,880
drivers weight and smash.

4855
02:14:29,881 --> 02:14:31,890
You know he has a cooking show for me.

4856
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:33,810
It is done on youtube.

4857
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,740
It's a cooking show.

4858
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:35,130
Yeah,

4859
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:35,510
he's,

4860
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,740
he's,

4861
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:38,040
and he's doing well with it
because this guy's face texting.

4862
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:39,260
Nice call from him.

4863
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:40,441
He's on fire,

4864
02:14:40,441 --> 02:14:41,340
right about Cummins.

4865
02:14:41,341 --> 02:14:42,210
Do the same shit.

4866
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:43,213
I get it.

4867
02:14:43,650 --> 02:14:46,830
Even Pat Cummins and make like
their own Serratia and shit.

4868
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:47,760
Ride bikes.

4869
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:48,361
Oh man,

4870
02:14:48,361 --> 02:14:49,010
that's awesome.

4871
02:14:49,010 --> 02:14:49,650
He's came in,

4872
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:50,011
this guy,

4873
02:14:50,011 --> 02:14:51,550
this guy I love Pat Cummings,

4874
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:53,551
man.

4875
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:54,510
I hung out with him.

4876
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:59,511
We went to dinner like one of the nights
in Brazil before he beat phase Zhao and

4877
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:04,050
he's a fucking good dude.

4878
02:15:04,051 --> 02:15:06,190
He's one of the best means.

4879
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:10,260
Serratia hold the sugar free.

4880
02:15:10,261 --> 02:15:11,094
Seraching

4881
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:12,990
no,

4882
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:13,411
Pat,

4883
02:15:13,411 --> 02:15:14,730
you got to know buy it.

4884
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:16,890
I want other people to fucking Ralph's.

4885
02:15:16,910 --> 02:15:18,710
It's making in his backyard.

4886
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:19,340
We got to get,

4887
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:20,173
it's really cool.

4888
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:24,460
It's special to sell his formula
to honor and get pat his math.

4889
02:15:24,461 --> 02:15:25,020
Sarah.

4890
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,180
I'm not manifested yet.

4891
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:27,430
The great,

4892
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:30,370
I thought it was this
guy's fucking asshole,

4893
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:31,980
man.

4894
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:32,701
I'm sorry dude.

4895
02:15:32,701 --> 02:15:32,931
Sorry.

4896
02:15:32,931 --> 02:15:34,410
That man to stand.

4897
02:15:34,411 --> 02:15:35,244
And that was good.

4898
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:36,443
That's a funny guy.

4899
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:37,590
It's funny to loose.

4900
02:15:37,591 --> 02:15:39,830
One of my favorite people I'm
doing their podcast is weak.

4901
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:42,900
The UFC unfiltered.

4902
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:45,960
Matt Serra and Jim Norton
have a podcast that was funny.

4903
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,210
And so is Dana Dane actually pretty good.

4904
02:15:48,610 --> 02:15:49,620
Tammy is the ultimate fighter.

4905
02:15:49,621 --> 02:15:50,454
Tet Two.

4906
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:51,020
Why not?

4907
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:51,853
That's oppressive.

4908
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:53,310
Riding the storm pitch,

4909
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:54,463
get it.

4910
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:55,890
And that changed his life.

4911
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:56,753
You know,

4912
02:15:56,830 --> 02:15:58,590
but I know why not?

4913
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:01,800
Why not know what if it's like
changeovers ex girlfriend.

4914
02:16:01,801 --> 02:16:03,810
I know who else is on that chain.

4915
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:07,590
It's Jason from the movie Friday.

4916
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:09,030
That's who's on his arm.

4917
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:09,893
Yes.

4918
02:16:10,010 --> 02:16:11,550
And then it's back to his Jujitsu.

4919
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,361
I love it all,

4920
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:13,194
man.

4921
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:13,831
I love it all.

4922
02:16:13,831 --> 02:16:15,400
And then it was a Reebok sign on his man.

4923
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:21,340
Oh

4924
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:23,870
look at this.

4925
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:24,860
Do you know what box?

4926
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,940
Do you know what Reebok's new sang his.

4927
02:16:26,941 --> 02:16:27,510
You know what their,

4928
02:16:27,510 --> 02:16:29,070
their logo is my bad.

4929
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:30,100
Be more human.

4930
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:31,350
I want to be more human.

4931
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:33,610
I heard their newest one
name on a more human.

4932
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:34,780
More like Dennis Bermudez.

4933
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:36,400
Dude's a fucking creative.

4934
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:37,450
Look at them on top of here.

4935
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:37,931
Yeah,

4936
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:40,650
he is fucking Denny's per meeting.

4937
02:16:40,790 --> 02:16:42,430
Ultimate butterfat too sweet.

4938
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:43,151
Check this out.

4939
02:16:43,151 --> 02:16:45,190
Half Nelson will beat the shit out of you.

4940
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:48,430
Let me let me bully you real
quick in front of everybody.

4941
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:49,840
Motherfucking get paid for it.

4942
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:50,201
Damn.

4943
02:16:50,201 --> 02:16:50,800
He's tough.

4944
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:55,360
You know you rarely see an
MMA fight stopped on cuts.

4945
02:16:56,150 --> 02:16:57,280
Kotter has got his hands.

4946
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,830
Rarely comes out to 45 would you say?

4947
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:04,220
Kind of got his hands full with tenants
permitted as it becomes touching common.

4948
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:05,110
Hey Brian,

4949
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:05,440
Brian,

4950
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:05,681
Brian.

4951
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:06,261
Eddie was talking.

4952
02:17:06,261 --> 02:17:07,040
Come on man.

4953
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,110
You can't keep it interrupting each
other like that's fucked up in the UFC.

4954
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:13,750
Blood is in the big deal
like it is in boxing.

4955
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:16,450
It's like you rarely see
bite stopped on cuts.

4956
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:18,340
You certainly see that they let it go.

4957
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:24,760
Maybe blood in like in the WWF
and WWE blood equals money.

4958
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:25,451
She's like,

4959
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:26,830
guys are cutting themselves off.

4960
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,850
It's only three in Brown's.

4961
02:17:27,851 --> 02:17:28,460
That's why I think it's,

4962
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:28,890
no,

4963
02:17:28,890 --> 02:17:29,750
that's not true bro.

4964
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,030
Look at the floor minute.

4965
02:17:31,031 --> 02:17:32,230
This is a squirter.

4966
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,540
It's based off of time.

4967
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:39,220
Jason's head Dude,

4968
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:39,680
look at his,

4969
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:41,500
his head is literally dripping.

4970
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:42,250
I would have,

4971
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:44,440
I wouldn't as long as learning to
do his eyes out of the quarter.

4972
02:17:44,441 --> 02:17:45,760
Guys are like a ketchup,

4973
02:17:46,010 --> 02:17:46,751
just like blood.

4974
02:17:46,751 --> 02:17:47,950
Just squirting people.

4975
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,253
If it

4976
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:51,011
goes into his eyes,

4977
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:53,170
that's when this kicks today.

4978
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,210
Do you look at these kicks test?

4979
02:17:55,211 --> 02:17:55,451
We you're in.

4980
02:17:55,451 --> 02:17:56,680
It says beautiful technique dude.

4981
02:17:56,681 --> 02:17:58,900
He is fucking this kid up.

4982
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:02,520
Ryan Parsons very high on Dennis
Bermudez always has been hell.

4983
02:18:02,521 --> 02:18:02,761
He had,

4984
02:18:02,761 --> 02:18:04,360
he has been him and Pat.

4985
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:08,230
You know that fight would with
chairman Stevens was insane.

4986
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:08,771
What?

4987
02:18:08,771 --> 02:18:09,521
I'm crazy fight.

4988
02:18:09,521 --> 02:18:14,080
That was what a crazy knee Steven's
lands to close the show and think about

4989
02:18:14,081 --> 02:18:14,530
Bermuda.

4990
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:17,240
Well I think again Brian,

4991
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:18,670
get that fucking cheese out of my faith.

4992
02:18:18,671 --> 02:18:19,600
I can't stop eating it.

4993
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:20,893
I been eating

4994
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:25,370
some or is that the
real Santana that brown

4995
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:30,910
him and caught him and pat ride bikes
in the orange county like gets their

4996
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:31,900
fucking job.

4997
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:32,741
So these Tan,

4998
02:18:32,741 --> 02:18:33,880
you know he's driving with his shirt off.

4999
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:36,180
He's a Mexican gentleman.

5000
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:37,043
So Judas.

5001
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:39,040
So Bermuda's doesn't touch Khan.

5002
02:18:39,041 --> 02:18:39,431
He's not well,

5003
02:18:39,431 --> 02:18:41,180
he's not bringing enough
scarf to get in the door.

5004
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,090
I couldn't touch him.

5005
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:44,101
I say don't think it's fake.

5006
02:18:44,101 --> 02:18:44,710
So no,

5007
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:45,191
not at all.

5008
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:47,860
But we realize is a nice
Mocha Brown all the time.

5009
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,353
He's

5010
02:18:50,830 --> 02:18:51,490
eight Donald,

5011
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,323
he's Mexican,

5012
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:54,243
Puerto Rican,

5013
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:55,060
Spanish,

5014
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:55,880
Cuban,

5015
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:56,713
something like that.

5016
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:58,980
He's got scraped scan.

5017
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:00,060
I just got great skin.

5018
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:00,240
They,

5019
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:00,761
Jason's like,

5020
02:19:00,761 --> 02:19:02,650
get me the fuck out of here to be natural.

5021
02:19:02,651 --> 02:19:03,130
It's too,

5022
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:04,410
it's too perfect to be that.

5023
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:04,961
I don't think so.

5024
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:06,460
They ride with their
bike off in the ocean,

5025
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:06,780
man.

5026
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:07,990
There's big John McCarthy.

5027
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:08,873
Oh awesome.

5028
02:19:08,990 --> 02:19:12,040
10 and go under it went under what?

5029
02:19:12,090 --> 02:19:12,923
GS?

5030
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:14,020
Fake suntanning.

5031
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:14,231
Yeah.

5032
02:19:14,231 --> 02:19:15,250
You can't do that shit anymore.

5033
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:17,080
But did GSB of fake Tanner,

5034
02:19:17,081 --> 02:19:18,250
did he just get tanned a lot?

5035
02:19:18,251 --> 02:19:20,500
Because 10 makes your body
actually produces vitamin D,

5036
02:19:20,501 --> 02:19:23,370
which helps you in terms talking
about to your anabolic stage.

5037
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,550
I'm talking about the industry,

5038
02:19:24,551 --> 02:19:25,930
the fake Sun 10 industry.

5039
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:27,800
Did it go under hold on Sam Anymore?

5040
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,281
Hold on.

5041
02:19:28,281 --> 02:19:29,450
Say That is true.

5042
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:30,590
Tanning,

5043
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,460
tanning booths.

5044
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:33,080
When you see people tanning.

5045
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:33,300
No,

5046
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:33,650
it's on,

5047
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:34,483
it's all gone.

5048
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:36,710
There's an athletic benefit to that.

5049
02:19:36,890 --> 02:19:38,240
There's an actually athletic benefit.

5050
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:38,840
There's the,

5051
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:41,240
your body actually does produce vitamin D

5052
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:43,733
as well.

5053
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:47,870
Eddie Bravo called Maxwell.

5054
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,190
I think Jill was talking about it.

5055
02:19:49,191 --> 02:19:51,380
He said the GSP was at the center of this.

5056
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:51,920
Gee,

5057
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:54,590
Steve Maxwell was talking
about how Russian athletes
have been doing this for a

5058
02:19:54,591 --> 02:19:57,370
long time and a lot of other athletes
have figured out that Russian,

5059
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:58,210
you know,

5060
02:19:58,210 --> 02:20:01,460
we'll just do it in three
machines are doing it stores.

5061
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:04,940
Vitamin D there is new research shows.

5062
02:20:04,941 --> 02:20:07,550
Vitamin D can dramatically
increase athletic performance.

5063
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:09,770
So I know for a second yes,

5064
02:20:09,771 --> 02:20:12,770
you can find them and see you get the
same raise that you did from the sun.

5065
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:13,690
Just intensified.

5066
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:14,430
Yes.

5067
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:15,210
Oh Shit.

5068
02:20:15,210 --> 02:20:15,670
Yeah.

5069
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:16,503
That shit.

5070
02:20:16,730 --> 02:20:17,563
We did it for bolt.

5071
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:18,650
That's going to be floating.

5072
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:19,513
Who's a marketing.

5073
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:21,051
Well,

5074
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:23,150
GASB did it because he
knew it could help us.

5075
02:20:23,151 --> 02:20:23,990
Performance for sure.

5076
02:20:23,991 --> 02:20:24,470
He looked better,

5077
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:25,303
but yes,

5078
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:26,660
he's very savvy.

5079
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:28,760
Maxwell is like,

5080
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:30,230
he's got his thumb on the pulse.

5081
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:34,490
I mean of the whole like athletic spectrum
as far as like people strength and

5082
02:20:34,491 --> 02:20:34,851
conditioning,

5083
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:37,040
little little hacks and
little things that people do.

5084
02:20:37,041 --> 02:20:38,330
He's always got new shit.

5085
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:39,060
He's a,

5086
02:20:39,060 --> 02:20:39,501
he's like,

5087
02:20:39,501 --> 02:20:40,790
he's constantly on top of it,

5088
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:41,990
so when he was talking about that,

5089
02:20:41,991 --> 02:20:46,050
I take everything Maxwell says when
it comes to like physical fitness and

5090
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:47,540
strength and conditioning.

5091
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:48,290
He's,

5092
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:49,490
he's a very responsible,

5093
02:20:49,491 --> 02:20:49,640
yeah,

5094
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,480
I don't think he's bullshitting.

5095
02:20:50,481 --> 02:20:53,300
I think GSP was doing it
for looks and maybe that,

5096
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:53,930
but I am.

5097
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:54,681
I never heard that.

5098
02:20:54,681 --> 02:20:55,610
That's going to be the new thing.

5099
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:58,310
Dudes are going to be
coming in fucking Kansas.

5100
02:20:58,311 --> 02:20:58,851
Fuck.

5101
02:20:58,851 --> 02:21:01,830
They're going to look
like they've seen of tape.

5102
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:05,000
You could also take vitamin D,

5103
02:21:05,001 --> 02:21:08,030
especially d three and get
probably pretty similar results to,

5104
02:21:08,031 --> 02:21:09,110
he just wouldn't get the Tan,

5105
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:10,910
but you get both.

5106
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:13,070
You can also could supplement with it.

5107
02:21:13,071 --> 02:21:14,420
You could take her on a Tan.

5108
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:15,201
You could.

5109
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:16,460
You could do a lot of different things.

5110
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:18,860
So basically if you come
in white and not tan,

5111
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:20,750
you're not coming in
at your full potential.

5112
02:21:20,751 --> 02:21:23,540
That's not necessarily true because
you can take supplementing vitamin D.

5113
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:24,950
See if you'd take it.

5114
02:21:24,951 --> 02:21:29,580
I don't know if you get in d three
d three is a hard one again man.

5115
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:30,830
You're not 10 do you aint trying.

5116
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,983
I always 10

5117
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,390
for what?

5118
02:21:35,391 --> 02:21:36,290
An uncomfortable moment.

5119
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:37,090
Biases.

5120
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:38,720
Awkward Brian Collins Time.

5121
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:41,480
It's time to start talking and I
was going to say I'm waiting to

5122
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:47,090
get with this podcast is going
to bring back the tanning

5123
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:49,280
talking.

5124
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,020
Definitely not.

5125
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:53,960
You guys are talking about millions
of people listen to your shit.

5126
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:57,380
Here's what I was thinking when
we created the floating industry.

5127
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:58,243
What were you gonna say?

5128
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:01,100
I was saying as you're talking,

5129
02:22:01,101 --> 02:22:01,821
I was thinking to myself,

5130
02:22:01,821 --> 02:22:03,620
as people move to higher latitudes,

5131
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:07,940
they lost the melanin in their
skin because they needed,

5132
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:13,230
they got less sun so you have to lose
melanin in your skin so you can absorb the

5133
02:22:14,031 --> 02:22:16,850
ultraviolet rays that create vitamin D.

5134
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,140
That's why Russians are so white.

5135
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:18,651
That's right.

5136
02:22:18,651 --> 02:22:20,520
So as you get the skin cancer,

5137
02:22:20,521 --> 02:22:21,290
right?

5138
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:21,920
That's right.

5139
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,620
That was even making it
black people are actually,

5140
02:22:24,621 --> 02:22:26,190
I mean why people are actually black

5141
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:30,780
people who just need less sun
producing mother fuckers you lost.

5142
02:22:30,781 --> 02:22:32,030
That's evolutionary biology.

5143
02:22:32,031 --> 02:22:33,270
You racist bastards.

5144
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:35,490
White people are just black.

5145
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:37,520
True without the rest.

5146
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:39,860
What was the rest that
just need less fighting?

5147
02:22:39,870 --> 02:22:42,380
Less sun essential vitamin D,

5148
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:43,200
goddammit.

5149
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:47,860
Well you lost me that white
people are just black people.

5150
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:49,590
I'm just telling you
what my thoughts were,

5151
02:22:49,591 --> 02:22:50,424
dude.

5152
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:51,600
By the way,

5153
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,550
I'm mistreated through,

5154
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:55,740
I'm going to start speaking in a seductive
voice right now because I'm getting

5155
02:22:55,741 --> 02:22:58,270
some wine run into my body
and I feel real good and warm.

5156
02:22:59,190 --> 02:22:59,970
Nice inside.

5157
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:00,840
I love you guys.

5158
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:01,950
I mean as a group too,

5159
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:03,691
as a clump.

5160
02:23:03,691 --> 02:23:04,471
When I think of you guys,

5161
02:23:04,471 --> 02:23:06,760
I think you guys is a
fucking clump or immune is.

5162
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:08,263
I'm not done.

5163
02:23:08,530 --> 02:23:09,980
I don't give a fuck about three minutes.

5164
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:13,470
I think about you guys
is one big muscular clump

5165
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:18,780
brown around skilled muscular

5166
02:23:21,090 --> 02:23:26,090
tray lends another layer and
another one that's a stringer penis.

5167
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:29,140
Chop Chop,

5168
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:31,440
another leg and Rony.

5169
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:36,370
Jason is a tough row column Roadie.

5170
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,110
I called him rolly.

5171
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:40,960
He needs less sun.

5172
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,120
He needs less sun,

5173
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,620
but it was essential vitamin D

5174
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:47,910
it ended right here.

5175
02:23:47,911 --> 02:23:49,080
If he had a fucking antiques

5176
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:52,140
were radio band stuff.

5177
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:52,831
That shit.

5178
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:54,580
He's exhausted to his
being in his ass whooped.

5179
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:56,070
Throw that Anaconda.

5180
02:23:56,460 --> 02:23:57,293
Fuck.

5181
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:58,193
Whoa.

5182
02:23:58,610 --> 02:24:00,750
The other color of his shorts are exactly,

5183
02:24:00,751 --> 02:24:01,950
the color was settled.

5184
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:02,760
Why Buddy?

5185
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:04,140
It looks like he's naked.

5186
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,840
He's a white with the green tattoo.

5187
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:07,471
Come on Ui.

5188
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:08,304
Very fuck.

5189
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:12,490
She's Brazilian too.

5190
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:16,013
It's weird.

5191
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,330
He's Brazilian white.

5192
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:23,220
I shorts had the black like crap.

5193
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:26,610
Oh I can't catch like then
you could sublimate that.

5194
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,720
Why can't guys were skiing?

5195
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:30,760
Coach shores drawn on the front.

5196
02:24:39,850 --> 02:24:42,840
Withdrawn us with a Dick with a snake head

5197
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:47,800
like a bikini with your dick puff balls,

5198
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:48,740
but it's a bikini

5199
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:52,800
on the ski mountains.

5200
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:53,190
This app,

5201
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:54,720
you used the word sublimated correctly.

5202
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:57,600
I tried bro.

5203
02:24:57,601 --> 02:24:59,310
I went to a Halloween party.

5204
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:00,690
I'm never used that word.

5205
02:25:00,691 --> 02:25:03,300
Never sublimated be sure what it means.

5206
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:04,134
I just,

5207
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:05,460
it was legit.

5208
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:06,720
Submitted is a good word.

5209
02:25:06,721 --> 02:25:07,141
Industry.

5210
02:25:07,141 --> 02:25:07,591
It's real.

5211
02:25:07,591 --> 02:25:08,160
It's legit.

5212
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:10,560
If you get your mind can keep that up.

5213
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:11,640
You could print that.

5214
02:25:11,641 --> 02:25:12,474
She does that mean?

5215
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:14,420
Oh yeah,

5216
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:15,283
he's,

5217
02:25:17,070 --> 02:25:18,570
he's going to get us back
cause he's a Russell.

5218
02:25:18,571 --> 02:25:19,800
She was going to turn it stand up.

5219
02:25:20,110 --> 02:25:20,970
That's trouble man.

5220
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:22,343
Shit.

5221
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:23,213
That is risk.

5222
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:24,193
Oh

5223
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:25,811
it's over.

5224
02:25:25,811 --> 02:25:27,020
He got no fuck.

5225
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:28,520
He got 'em he got 'em.

5226
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:29,533
Oh

5227
02:25:31,230 --> 02:25:31,860
Gosh.

5228
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:32,620
Dammit.

5229
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:33,460
Fuck out of us

5230
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:37,653
standing up.

5231
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:38,680
Oh Shit.

5232
02:25:38,681 --> 02:25:39,041
Offense.

5233
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:39,551
Defense.

5234
02:25:39,551 --> 02:25:40,031
Stand up.

5235
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:40,361
Stand up.

5236
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:40,840
Speak.

5237
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:44,250
Oh Brown.

5238
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,810
Dan Severn bodyline
going right to that shit.

5239
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,040
Close that motherfucker.

5240
02:25:48,041 --> 02:25:51,100
How tough is Jason Rony?

5241
02:25:51,101 --> 02:25:52,930
Jason is tough as

5242
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:56,560
critical.

5243
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,140
Tony Blair fucked up.

5244
02:25:59,141 --> 02:26:00,430
Missed that under fumbled.

5245
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:04,630
Sublimate or supplemented
is to divert or modify,

5246
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:06,100
um,

5247
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:07,630
in the instrument business,

5248
02:26:07,631 --> 02:26:09,340
snow and instinctual impulse.

5249
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:09,731
Hey man,

5250
02:26:09,731 --> 02:26:12,400
to a culturally higher or
socially more acceptable.

5251
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:13,570
But that's infant care,

5252
02:26:13,571 --> 02:26:14,404
bro.

5253
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:15,523
Okay.

5254
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:17,590
It's sublimate infant care,

5255
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:19,083
infant care,

5256
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:20,800
reading informed care to.

5257
02:26:20,801 --> 02:26:21,900
You weren't reading the same amount.

5258
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:25,053
So how does,

5259
02:26:25,370 --> 02:26:25,691
how did,

5260
02:26:25,691 --> 02:26:27,190
was it used in this conversation?

5261
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:28,211
I don't know,

5262
02:26:28,211 --> 02:26:31,390
but I think he used it
wrong and that's all right.

5263
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:33,851
That's all right.

5264
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:36,940
That shows you're a dad tried buddy.

5265
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:41,140
I had a brilliant thought
Fox and they came out.

5266
02:26:41,150 --> 02:26:42,720
It was he can you share
it and then it's fun.

5267
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:44,350
Let's find out what
the real definition is.

5268
02:26:44,351 --> 02:26:49,120
Sublimate in the apparel business is now
they got machines now that you can take

5269
02:26:49,121 --> 02:26:51,250
any picture you want
and put it on material.

5270
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:52,233
It's not about like,

5271
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:52,660
oh,

5272
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:55,600
like those old school
graphic arts and supplement.

5273
02:26:55,601 --> 02:26:58,930
Then not sublimate their machines.

5274
02:26:58,950 --> 02:26:59,890
A couple other

5275
02:27:01,620 --> 02:27:03,220
you see rash sublimate no.

5276
02:27:03,221 --> 02:27:05,410
There's a couple of
different definitions here.

5277
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:08,320
Sexual when it appears
in the apparel business,

5278
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:10,840
it means make rash guards about,

5279
02:27:10,930 --> 02:27:14,260
you could take a picture and make a rash
guard out of it through the sublimation

5280
02:27:14,261 --> 02:27:15,094
process.

5281
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:16,843
Oh,

5282
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:21,400
I see what you're saying is
a crystal deposit on the car.

5283
02:27:21,401 --> 02:27:22,121
Just so amazing.

5284
02:27:22,121 --> 02:27:25,650
Now because of sublimation
before sublimation you,

5285
02:27:25,651 --> 02:27:28,630
you had to do like graphic arts,

5286
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:30,730
like to color type.

5287
02:27:30,731 --> 02:27:34,480
So logos you couldn't do right
now you could do anything.

5288
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:38,230
A bunch of different definitions because
that one was sexual in the beginning.

5289
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:39,910
Why?

5290
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:42,640
Why did we run out of noises
we can make with our face?

5291
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:47,760
Why do we have words mean a bunch of
different shit so people can sound smarter

5292
02:27:47,831 --> 02:27:49,900
than the other choices
we make with our face.

5293
02:27:49,901 --> 02:27:50,111
I mean,

5294
02:27:50,111 --> 02:27:50,771
did we run out?

5295
02:27:50,771 --> 02:27:50,981
We,

5296
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:53,170
why do we have to use something
for a bunch of different things?

5297
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:55,000
Like why should it be confusing?

5298
02:27:55,001 --> 02:27:58,180
You should be able to go to the dictionary
and it's just one fucking definitely.

5299
02:27:58,181 --> 02:27:58,410
Sure.

5300
02:27:58,410 --> 02:27:59,620
I fucking agree with that.

5301
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:00,820
It's so exhausting.

5302
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:01,120
Fees,

5303
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:03,280
you know like people
like words like trite.

5304
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:06,970
That was one of those words where people
are also afraid to say they don't know

5305
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:07,804
what it means.

5306
02:28:07,870 --> 02:28:08,680
Try it.

5307
02:28:08,680 --> 02:28:09,513
Try it.

5308
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:11,320
I just rolled with it.

5309
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:12,154
You know I tried.

5310
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:15,730
I don't think I've ever used
sublimate tried is like ridiculous.

5311
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:16,900
Nonsensical,

5312
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:19,430
like not not important dude.

5313
02:28:20,290 --> 02:28:22,070
Do you know what that means?

5314
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:22,820
Yeah.

5315
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:26,270
Cause I watched the Matt
Lauer Tom Cruise interview.

5316
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:26,900
He was like,

5317
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:27,261
Matt,

5318
02:28:27,261 --> 02:28:28,094
you're being Glib.

5319
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,193
Glib.

5320
02:28:30,310 --> 02:28:32,630
It's means like he's like dismissing.

5321
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:33,583
Oh gotcha.

5322
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:34,340
You know,

5323
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,570
like he's a,

5324
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,560
he's not,

5325
02:28:36,970 --> 02:28:39,050
it's like a harsh dismissal.

5326
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,280
Insincere.

5327
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:41,113
Thank you dude.

5328
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:42,830
You're explaining what cahoots may cause.

5329
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:45,990
I thought it meant enemy a
glip when we sang it like that.

5330
02:28:46,010 --> 02:28:47,060
You're saying he's being Glib,

5331
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:49,340
but still I think he's
saying he's being insincere.

5332
02:28:49,341 --> 02:28:50,920
I think he's saying who's being,

5333
02:28:51,460 --> 02:28:52,450
is this the actual word of it?

5334
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:56,230
The person speaking fluent and uh,

5335
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,450
voluble but insincere in cow.

5336
02:28:58,450 --> 02:28:58,961
Let me show.

5337
02:28:58,961 --> 02:28:59,631
I didn't want to say it,

5338
02:28:59,631 --> 02:29:00,670
but that's what it really means.

5339
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:01,773
Shell.

5340
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:02,780
Wow.

5341
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:04,303
Yeah,

5342
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:06,110
so I had it wrong.

5343
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:07,430
So glib would be B.

5344
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:08,770
When you're being,

5345
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:13,520
when you're not being almost reverential
to something that requires Gravitas,

5346
02:29:13,521 --> 02:29:15,620
like us with Cyborg fighting railer yeah,

5347
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,011
it'd be like,

5348
02:29:16,011 --> 02:29:16,371
yeah,

5349
02:29:16,371 --> 02:29:19,680
but what we're for basketball is just
like throwing a ball and to have,

5350
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:19,960
you know,

5351
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:22,250
a blowout recordings that
makes a big Glib runs.

5352
02:29:22,290 --> 02:29:26,120
That's not a word that's in
my frequent vocale vocabulary.

5353
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:27,740
If we used it,

5354
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:30,470
it would be like if a girl says
like you say son all the time,

5355
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:31,730
so I say son all the time,

5356
02:29:31,731 --> 02:29:32,564
it's fun.

5357
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:34,150
But if you use Glib,

5358
02:29:34,151 --> 02:29:34,950
I'd do that.

5359
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:36,050
Eddie hosted.

5360
02:29:36,130 --> 02:29:36,300
Now,

5361
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:37,720
right now you're talking
about two different things,

5362
02:29:37,721 --> 02:29:39,630
but that's what she went
on down a depressant for.

5363
02:29:39,850 --> 02:29:40,800
But what happens?

5364
02:29:40,801 --> 02:29:41,581
The antidepressant,

5365
02:29:41,581 --> 02:29:42,850
all it does is mask the problem.

5366
02:29:42,851 --> 02:29:45,600
There's ways of vitamins
and two extra educators,

5367
02:29:45,620 --> 02:29:45,840
I think.

5368
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,070
I'm not saying that that isn't real,

5369
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:49,650
but aren't there examples where it works?

5370
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:51,103
You don't even,

5371
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,113
you're granted,

5372
02:29:52,170 --> 02:29:53,340
you don't even know what religion is.

5373
02:29:53,790 --> 02:29:55,620
He started talking about
chemical imbalance.

5374
02:29:56,010 --> 02:29:59,640
You have to evaluate and read the research
papers on how they came up with these

5375
02:29:59,641 --> 02:30:00,001
theories.

5376
02:30:00,001 --> 02:30:00,580
Ma'Am,

5377
02:30:00,580 --> 02:30:05,310
he's telling us he's kind of
schooling last year though.

5378
02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:06,031
He's not.

5379
02:30:06,031 --> 02:30:08,760
I don't think Matt Lauer's Malik
was asking him real questions.

5380
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:11,670
Matt Lauer was asking him
questions and he was saying,

5381
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:12,091
Hey,

5382
02:30:12,091 --> 02:30:13,640
there are examples when
ads are depressants,

5383
02:30:13,650 --> 02:30:14,730
you're not a fucking doctor.

5384
02:30:14,731 --> 02:30:17,430
Tom Cruise there examples
when they work and save lives,

5385
02:30:17,431 --> 02:30:20,600
you fucking dummy stick to acting
and ag and make them believe.

5386
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:21,391
And that was a sign,

5387
02:30:21,391 --> 02:30:21,720
Todd,

5388
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:24,000
that was him on a Scientology riff.

5389
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:24,900
Easy.

5390
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:25,733
That guy.

5391
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:28,620
Come on fuck cause he got a roll over.

5392
02:30:28,621 --> 02:30:29,454
You know you hate the guy.

5393
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:32,740
If I'm being clear about Tom Cruise,

5394
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:34,900
don't bring up chem trails cause that's,

5395
02:30:35,250 --> 02:30:35,870
that's leave.

5396
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:37,680
This is when he went full batshit crazy.

5397
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:38,340
Oh,

5398
02:30:38,340 --> 02:30:40,410
what do you dance like this
too little Katie Holmes?

5399
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:40,970
Yeah.

5400
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:41,791
Fuck daddy loves you.

5401
02:30:41,791 --> 02:30:42,624
I got divorced.

5402
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:43,620
Tell you something about that guy.

5403
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:46,081
I've met him twice.

5404
02:30:46,081 --> 02:30:48,330
He's the nicest human
beings on the planet.

5405
02:30:48,390 --> 02:30:48,780
What's that?

5406
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:49,830
Are you a fan of Ritalin?

5407
02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:50,890
I don't know anything about them.

5408
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:51,360
Ritalin.

5409
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:51,810
Okay.

5410
02:30:51,810 --> 02:30:52,240
I don't know.

5411
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:52,381
I'm,

5412
02:30:52,381 --> 02:30:55,860
I'm not a fan of any medication that
I don't have to give to my children.

5413
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:57,870
But I do think that there are,

5414
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:03,120
there are certain drugs that are made by
big pharmaceutical companies that save

5415
02:31:03,121 --> 02:31:03,750
lives.

5416
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:03,871
Me,

5417
02:31:03,871 --> 02:31:05,760
which lives better or beneficial?

5418
02:31:05,850 --> 02:31:06,181
I don't know.

5419
02:31:06,181 --> 02:31:07,230
I'm not a pharmacologist,

5420
02:31:07,590 --> 02:31:10,230
but I can give you examples of
the things that I've seen with,

5421
02:31:10,231 --> 02:31:10,680
listen man,

5422
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:11,850
if you need antibiotics,

5423
02:31:11,851 --> 02:31:12,730
you need fucking science.

5424
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,740
God Damn right section.

5425
02:31:14,850 --> 02:31:15,960
If she had staph infection,

5426
02:31:15,961 --> 02:31:18,590
you better be listening to fucking
doctors and not listen to some food.

5427
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:24,053
Fuck yeah,

5428
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:25,590
fuck that staff.

5429
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:29,280
So I don't think there's a an either or.

5430
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:31,470
I think there's a lot
of medications to do.

5431
02:31:31,471 --> 02:31:32,011
A lot of people,

5432
02:31:32,011 --> 02:31:32,844
a lot of good.

5433
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,390
And I think there's also
a lot of medications that
pharmaceutical companies are

5434
02:31:36,391 --> 02:31:40,290
profiting off of people using them
in ways that they don't need them.

5435
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,290
But especially painkiller,

5436
02:31:42,090 --> 02:31:43,530
I grew that and a lot about this stuff.

5437
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:44,221
However you,

5438
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:44,881
for you Brenda,

5439
02:31:44,881 --> 02:31:45,870
you had a fucking real issue,

5440
02:31:45,871 --> 02:31:46,160
right?

5441
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:47,850
With those goddamn painkillers.

5442
02:31:47,910 --> 02:31:48,211
Yeah,

5443
02:31:48,211 --> 02:31:48,841
there's a rumor.

5444
02:31:48,841 --> 02:31:49,674
I hesitate to Dylan.

5445
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:51,870
You talked about it.

5446
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:53,270
You know it's,

5447
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:54,180
that's scary shit man.

5448
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:58,110
Cause you're a together guy like to
hear that you got caught in the grip of

5449
02:31:58,111 --> 02:31:58,944
those fucking things.

5450
02:31:58,950 --> 02:32:00,990
The most addictive thing
in the world they say,

5451
02:32:00,991 --> 02:32:04,120
and my doctor was trying to be cool and
I was only supposed to have like 15.

5452
02:32:04,121 --> 02:32:04,560
He's like,

5453
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,790
here's like 200 man.

5454
02:32:05,790 --> 02:32:06,061
Just,

5455
02:32:06,061 --> 02:32:06,540
you know,

5456
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:07,140
you know,

5457
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:08,690
explain what what she was saying.

5458
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:09,130
I was like,

5459
02:32:09,130 --> 02:32:09,910
okay,

5460
02:32:09,910 --> 02:32:12,420
but explain why what they
urge was our addictive.

5461
02:32:13,410 --> 02:32:14,910
So when you stop using them and you like,

5462
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:16,440
you're like depressed,

5463
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,011
you,

5464
02:32:17,011 --> 02:32:17,640
uh,

5465
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:18,780
you feel itchy,

5466
02:32:18,781 --> 02:32:19,870
so then you keep taking me.

5467
02:32:19,871 --> 02:32:22,290
You just makes you feel better
and they're not dependent on it.

5468
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:24,240
So when I'd go out with my friends,

5469
02:32:24,241 --> 02:32:24,530
I really,

5470
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:26,490
I knew I had 200 so I was like a mess.

5471
02:32:26,491 --> 02:32:29,820
We'll take one of those and not be
all cranky and itching and pain.

5472
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:30,601
I was taking one of those,

5473
02:32:30,601 --> 02:32:32,340
have one band that's a fun fucking night.

5474
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:33,323
Wow.

5475
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:34,051
And then mixing.

5476
02:32:34,051 --> 02:32:35,790
I know every morning I'm just boom,

5477
02:32:35,791 --> 02:32:36,271
boom,

5478
02:32:36,271 --> 02:32:36,691
boom,

5479
02:32:36,691 --> 02:32:37,110
boom.

5480
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:39,870
Until my friend and brother like
what the fuck are you doing?

5481
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:40,873
And they took him from me.

5482
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:43,260
I was talking to two
pretty well known fighters.

5483
02:32:43,390 --> 02:32:44,430
Does anyone have any in here?

5484
02:32:44,490 --> 02:32:47,190
Why wait til I'm addicted to
this fucking Conor Mcgregor,

5485
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:50,940
Nate Diaz countdown thing
they're doing right now.

5486
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:51,270
Me Too.

5487
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:51,801
I think Connor,

5488
02:32:51,801 --> 02:32:52,634
when am I can't wait.

5489
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:54,420
I think Connor wins a decision.

5490
02:32:54,421 --> 02:32:55,110
He might.

5491
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:55,943
Who knows?

5492
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:56,820
Yes.

5493
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:58,860
Nate might my get them.

5494
02:32:59,160 --> 02:32:59,311
I mean,

5495
02:32:59,311 --> 02:33:00,180
who the fuck knows man?

5496
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:02,970
All we know is Nate got him the
first time that I don't know.

5497
02:33:02,971 --> 02:33:04,890
I'm just telling you my educated opinion.

5498
02:33:04,891 --> 02:33:08,310
I think Conor Mcgregor wins by decision
based off that first round and more

5499
02:33:08,311 --> 02:33:09,144
knowledgeable training.

5500
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:09,421
Bria.

5501
02:33:09,421 --> 02:33:13,950
But he will to about Nate Diaz with
zero training coming in with 11 days and

5502
02:33:13,951 --> 02:33:14,950
owed five round fight.

5503
02:33:14,970 --> 02:33:16,930
Still one to five rounds,

5504
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:22,020
but do you know how like more comfortable
Nate is going to be with a full camp

5505
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:22,981
then he's going to be,

5506
02:33:22,981 --> 02:33:25,200
I mean you would just assume that given,

5507
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:25,950
okay.

5508
02:33:25,950 --> 02:33:29,130
There's psychological
variables that come into play,

5509
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:31,980
especially when you deal with the amount
of pressure that Nate is under now.

5510
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:34,860
If you deal with the amount
of press obligations,

5511
02:33:34,861 --> 02:33:39,120
he's now forced to a design done
more than he's ever done for sure,

5512
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:44,780
but he's also getting a good long stretch
of time to know what kind of shape

5513
02:33:45,061 --> 02:33:46,410
he's got to get in before the fight.

5514
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:47,273
Right.

5515
02:33:47,970 --> 02:33:48,803
This is a,

5516
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:49,801
I mean if you,

5517
02:33:49,801 --> 02:33:54,480
if you thought logically taking
psychological considerations
out logically would

5518
02:33:54,481 --> 02:33:54,661
say,

5519
02:33:54,661 --> 02:33:56,040
well if you won the first fight,

5520
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:59,310
if he's got more time to
prepare in the second fight,

5521
02:33:59,311 --> 02:34:00,710
he's going to be even
better than he wasn't.

5522
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,220
I could say the same
thing for Connor though.

5523
02:34:02,221 --> 02:34:04,680
He could say he's never
fight at one 70 before he,

5524
02:34:04,681 --> 02:34:08,010
all he did is still power punches that
first round and kind of murked him the

5525
02:34:08,011 --> 02:34:08,381
second round.

5526
02:34:08,381 --> 02:34:10,530
He was in trouble cause
he gas and got caught.

5527
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:10,921
Man,

5528
02:34:10,921 --> 02:34:13,260
if he didn't do in that
first round for 25 minutes,

5529
02:34:13,261 --> 02:34:14,094
he wins that fight.

5530
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:14,520
Yeah.

5531
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,090
Long time.

5532
02:34:15,090 --> 02:34:15,590
Sure.

5533
02:34:15,590 --> 02:34:16,470
It's your right.

5534
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:18,150
Look at him saying you
can play both sides.

5535
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:19,000
You know you can,

5536
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,580
you could say he was not without
success in the first fight.

5537
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:25,900
He had a very successful first round and
he had a very successful minute plus of

5538
02:34:25,901 --> 02:34:26,590
the second round.

5539
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:28,300
Then he got in trouble and he got a,

5540
02:34:28,301 --> 02:34:31,840
Trump got in trouble and Nate started
talking shit and then he started getting

5541
02:34:31,841 --> 02:34:35,630
gas and he started getting dinged and
then he shot Fred tamped down and know

5542
02:34:35,631 --> 02:34:38,420
where the pay downs and right in the
paydays if from Mcgregor wins because

5543
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:40,510
you're going to have to
have a a three pay three p.

5544
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:45,690
Well the pay day is if Mcgregor and
Diaz have an old time shrub or Naca and

5545
02:34:46,871 --> 02:34:47,770
Mcgregor wins.

5546
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:48,161
You had,

5547
02:34:48,161 --> 02:34:50,620
he has to win or he could have a fucking,

5548
02:34:50,621 --> 02:34:53,500
a real close decision
loss to then you can't,

5549
02:34:53,501 --> 02:34:54,130
you can't do that.

5550
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:55,480
I am obsessed.

5551
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:58,780
I will not stop until I beat Nate Diaz.

5552
02:34:58,930 --> 02:35:00,520
Cause you lose two in a row
and then you'll see it and go,

5553
02:35:00,521 --> 02:35:01,001
Nah Bitch,

5554
02:35:01,001 --> 02:35:01,834
go ahead and get down there.

5555
02:35:02,110 --> 02:35:02,771
They hit or not.

5556
02:35:02,771 --> 02:35:05,500
If you're a little white guy from
Ireland named Connor Mcgregor,

5557
02:35:05,501 --> 02:35:06,940
that's the pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow.

5558
02:35:06,941 --> 02:35:08,490
Mother fucker won't have a car.

5559
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:10,931
No,

5560
02:35:10,931 --> 02:35:11,860
the UFC is love Collins.

5561
02:35:11,861 --> 02:35:12,131
The guy,

5562
02:35:12,131 --> 02:35:14,050
he's juice to the gills
and here's Brock Lesnar.

5563
02:35:14,110 --> 02:35:14,701
That's your leopard.

5564
02:35:14,701 --> 02:35:15,640
Because I see other Leprechaun,

5565
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:17,380
the other little guy and he's way bigger.

5566
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:18,760
It's not your typical Leprechaun.

5567
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:20,770
That's a different number.

5568
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,793
Got It.

5569
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:23,080
Told us.

5570
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:23,913
That's communist one.

5571
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:24,730
Yeah.

5572
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:25,990
He dominated the first two rounds.

5573
02:35:25,991 --> 02:35:26,671
Three rounds a little bit.

5574
02:35:26,671 --> 02:35:27,580
This is the main event.

5575
02:35:27,581 --> 02:35:30,410
We haven't talked about single fucking
fight other than a few random stuff.

5576
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:31,623
We got detailed.

5577
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:33,011
Great.

5578
02:35:33,011 --> 02:35:34,240
Until that wine theme,

5579
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:38,390
we went a little off the deep end when
the wine came from the way it goes to you

5580
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:38,660
guys.

5581
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:39,100
The gun.

5582
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:40,390
It's not always

5583
02:35:42,170 --> 02:35:43,300
hung from masters here.

5584
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:45,700
Ah,

5585
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,230
that is hilarious.

5586
02:35:47,231 --> 02:35:48,640
So when you put that up on Youtube,

5587
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:50,540
beneficial pool.

5588
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:52,510
Hey Jamie chimp.

5589
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:52,950
Chimp,

5590
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:53,470
Phillip Chimp.

5591
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:55,960
Was that on Youtube when
you put it up tonight?

5592
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:56,561
It just put it on.

5593
02:35:56,561 --> 02:35:58,510
Someone just made a having a real video.

5594
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:00,040
I think that's hilarious.

5595
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:02,471
What is his name?

5596
02:36:02,471 --> 02:36:03,191
What is his name?

5597
02:36:03,191 --> 02:36:04,024
Philly chimp.

5598
02:36:04,310 --> 02:36:04,730
All right.

5599
02:36:04,730 --> 02:36:05,450
Philly Cho.

5600
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:05,810
Shut up.

5601
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:06,643
Shut up.

5602
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:08,650
You Know Ray Lewis
trained with Rashad Evans,

5603
02:36:08,651 --> 02:36:08,891
right?

5604
02:36:08,891 --> 02:36:09,640
We're aware of this.

5605
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:10,060
Yeah.

5606
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:11,410
A bunch with them in Miami.

5607
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:11,671
Yeah,

5608
02:36:11,671 --> 02:36:12,504
I didn't know that.

5609
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:17,520
If the new owners of fucking gangster
fucking make this happen too.

5610
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:20,123
Hi Sir,

5611
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:21,880
you're too tired.

5612
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:23,490
Very Lewis is retired.

5613
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:24,353
He's a millionaire.

5614
02:36:24,770 --> 02:36:25,603
It's to

5615
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:28,510
know Ray Lewis.

5616
02:36:28,511 --> 02:36:28,770
Listen,

5617
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:29,620
if you want to make the fight,

5618
02:36:29,621 --> 02:36:31,900
you make it with Herschel Walker
because he actually still fights.

5619
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,310
I'm not going to see those two old fucks.

5620
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:34,453
Walker Herschel.

5621
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:37,450
Hershel Walker's ready to
fight the matter of millions.

5622
02:36:37,550 --> 02:36:40,830
It's just here's 20 let me make a ton of,

5623
02:36:40,930 --> 02:36:42,160
here's 20 million.

5624
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:43,073
Make It.

5625
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:44,470
If it was an APP,

5626
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:48,850
if it was anybody else that was 50
years old that said he wanted to fight,

5627
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:49,541
I'd be like,

5628
02:36:49,541 --> 02:36:49,901
man,

5629
02:36:49,901 --> 02:36:50,734
you got to stop.

5630
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:51,940
Anybody else?

5631
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:53,230
I would say I don't want to see that.

5632
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:54,280
Anybody else?

5633
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,480
If it's Herschel Walker,

5634
02:36:55,690 --> 02:36:55,961
I'm like,

5635
02:36:55,961 --> 02:36:56,794
where do I,

5636
02:36:57,010 --> 02:36:58,190
how do I sign it?

5637
02:36:58,191 --> 02:36:58,600
Too High,

5638
02:36:58,600 --> 02:36:59,433
no duties.

5639
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:03,580
You saw him when he was 47 just jacked,

5640
02:37:03,581 --> 02:37:08,581
so I believe he was 48 I stopped
fighting at 31 two but dude,

5641
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:15,031
commercial walker is a
four re he's seen athletic.

5642
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:16,970
Yes he is.

5643
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:17,211
Dude.

5644
02:37:17,211 --> 02:37:18,980
You see the video of him
fighting strike force.

5645
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:19,581
Did you ever watch?

5646
02:37:19,581 --> 02:37:23,360
I've watched every single fight
he ever did and it is shock.

5647
02:37:23,361 --> 02:37:28,010
His ass would get eaten up like a fucking
offsite care porno by cyber jumped in

5648
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:28,780
the UFC.

5649
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:29,613
You

5650
02:37:30,670 --> 02:37:31,503
see man,

5651
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:31,761
Oh,

5652
02:37:31,761 --> 02:37:33,860
you're talking about like
someone fc or some shit.

5653
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:36,230
I'm talking about him just as us,

5654
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:37,700
a freak specimen.

5655
02:37:37,850 --> 02:37:40,040
Like if he was going to
have to fight Cyborg.

5656
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:41,420
We were talking about Ray Lewis,

5657
02:37:41,460 --> 02:37:42,141
like Ray Lewis.

5658
02:37:42,141 --> 02:37:43,400
We know he is a wrestler,

5659
02:37:43,401 --> 02:37:45,650
but we don't know how much
martial arts experience he had.

5660
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:47,810
That's one.

5661
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:49,130
But Herschel Walker,

5662
02:37:49,550 --> 02:37:54,550
Herschel Walker at whatever he is now
for 82 years old to 1590 9.9% of the

5663
02:37:56,301 --> 02:37:58,160
fucking planet we're going to run.

5664
02:37:58,320 --> 02:37:58,821
I agree.

5665
02:37:58,821 --> 02:38:03,530
You better except for every guy in the
light heavyweight division on the roster

5666
02:38:03,531 --> 02:38:04,550
in the UFC heavyweight.

5667
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:05,630
Okay.

5668
02:38:05,630 --> 02:38:06,590
Even worse,

5669
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:08,690
he comes to the UFC
that everyone's go wow.

5670
02:38:08,691 --> 02:38:10,820
But he's 50 years old.

5671
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:12,020
It's more than 50.

5672
02:38:12,021 --> 02:38:13,020
I think he's 52.

5673
02:38:13,270 --> 02:38:14,660
He's one of the biggest
freaks of all time.

5674
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:15,523
You'll 50.

5675
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:17,420
He might show him sprinting.

5676
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:19,520
Show him with a lot of guys in the UFC.

5677
02:38:19,521 --> 02:38:24,521
So show him Ryan the hunter in the
UFC when he was world class speed.

5678
02:38:24,651 --> 02:38:25,640
He had world class Pete,

5679
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:26,650
did you see that guy?

5680
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:27,290
Man,

5681
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:28,330
did you do well,

5682
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:31,460
let's just go back a year or two.

5683
02:38:31,550 --> 02:38:32,383
What is like,

5684
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:33,620
I don't even want to name a name.

5685
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:35,120
Think about some uh,

5686
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:39,740
questionable heavyweight performance
between a guy that's nowhere near the top

5687
02:38:39,741 --> 02:38:40,400
20.

5688
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:41,030
Right?

5689
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:41,691
Some new guy.

5690
02:38:41,691 --> 02:38:45,590
Maybe you don't think that Hershel
Walker could fuck up some new guy?

5691
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:46,673
No,

5692
02:38:47,180 --> 02:38:48,440
not at 50 shows.

5693
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:51,970
We'll watch Herschel Walker
Sprint this 20th let's,

5694
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:52,873
let's see him.

5695
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:54,290
This Herschel Walker would,

5696
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:54,681
let's see.

5697
02:38:54,681 --> 02:38:58,010
Strike Force where he's getting this
video of Herschel Walker fighting in

5698
02:38:58,030 --> 02:38:58,863
Strikeforce.

5699
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:00,651
Yeah,

5700
02:39:00,651 --> 02:39:04,010
but he's fucking strong as shit.

5701
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:05,410
I can't watch it.

5702
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:08,320
And it'd be stiff walls

5703
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:10,490
made.

5704
02:39:10,490 --> 02:39:14,000
It almost doesn't matter
when you turn 50 I can't.

5705
02:39:14,001 --> 02:39:14,241
Fuck.

5706
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:15,360
I wouldn't never have fights here.

5707
02:39:15,570 --> 02:39:16,100
It's faster,

5708
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:16,933
isn't everybody,

5709
02:39:17,390 --> 02:39:17,601
dude,

5710
02:39:17,601 --> 02:39:19,040
he's one of the biggest
freaks of all time.

5711
02:39:19,310 --> 02:39:21,910
I'm not saying that right now.

5712
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:24,080
The heavy weights would eat him alive.

5713
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:24,471
Yeah,

5714
02:39:24,471 --> 02:39:24,910
of course.

5715
02:39:24,910 --> 02:39:25,150
Yeah,

5716
02:39:25,150 --> 02:39:25,810
the heavyweights.

5717
02:39:25,810 --> 02:39:28,910
But they're lucky he didn't start
this shit about 20 years ago.

5718
02:39:28,911 --> 02:39:29,510
I agree.

5719
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,721
Oh,

5720
02:39:29,721 --> 02:39:31,880
if Bo Jackson decided to MMA,

5721
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:32,380
oh,

5722
02:39:32,380 --> 02:39:34,670
she can't fucking Dick the Jupiter.

5723
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,773
He's a month.

5724
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:41,230
There are some Herschel Walker
at 47 I think he was 48 here.

5725
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:42,583
Look at his body.

5726
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,790
Was He 48 here?

5727
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:44,330
Yeah,

5728
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:46,370
this is 48 here defending the leg lock.

5729
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:49,100
Beat your ass.

5730
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:50,233
Just

5731
02:39:52,610 --> 02:39:53,361
goodness.

5732
02:39:53,361 --> 02:39:54,050
Defense man.

5733
02:39:54,050 --> 02:39:56,750
Look at this spot around 40
and leave behind his back

5734
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,320
and he's a super athlete,

5735
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:01,790
one of the best athletes of all time.

5736
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:06,470
I think a lot of us sort of underestimate
the difference between the elite of

5737
02:40:06,471 --> 02:40:09,820
the elites and irregular cumin trained.

5738
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:11,870
You look how he just rag
tall that due to the ground.

5739
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:13,063
Oh my God.

5740
02:40:13,790 --> 02:40:14,820
At too tired either.

5741
02:40:14,821 --> 02:40:15,600
It doesn't look like,

5742
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:16,111
oh dude,

5743
02:40:16,111 --> 02:40:17,220
he's a stud.

5744
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:18,960
He's such a super athlete.

5745
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:19,350
Yup.

5746
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:21,510
There's the 25 years ago.

5747
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,530
Amazing athlete.

5748
02:40:22,531 --> 02:40:25,290
Didn't he win a gold medal in the bobsled?

5749
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:26,610
Laugh for a moment.

5750
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:27,600
Let's think for a moment.

5751
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:32,720
What if custom motto existed in 2016 and
he found a young 13 year old Mike Tyson

5752
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:37,770
and brought him to for Rasa Hobby.

5753
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:38,911
Yeah,

5754
02:40:38,911 --> 02:40:39,721
they'd be amazing.

5755
02:40:39,721 --> 02:40:43,350
Brought him to Matt Hume
because freak athletes,

5756
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:45,960
every now and then you get a dude like
you remember when Mike Tice used to hit

5757
02:40:45,961 --> 02:40:46,794
that heavy bag?

5758
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:52,740
You will never saw earthly Mike Tyson
couldn't handle Bo Jacksons jock strap if

5759
02:40:54,991 --> 02:40:57,130
you get Bo Jackson when he's 13 yeah.

5760
02:40:57,350 --> 02:40:57,871
These guys,

5761
02:40:57,871 --> 02:40:59,730
we are talking about different endeavors.

5762
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:03,150
We don't know what Mike Tyson's athletic
ability would have been if he had been

5763
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:03,990
playing football.

5764
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:04,211
Well,

5765
02:41:04,211 --> 02:41:08,610
we do know is what it was when he got
into boxing and it's almost better than

5766
02:41:08,611 --> 02:41:10,740
anybody ever in a lot of ways.

5767
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:14,460
And the fact that he was so short and
he had this crazy style of bobbing and

5768
02:41:14,461 --> 02:41:18,570
weaving and ripping ridiculous fucking
power and speed punches at you.

5769
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,171
Let me ask you this,

5770
02:41:19,171 --> 02:41:19,381
Joe,

5771
02:41:19,381 --> 02:41:21,600
who's the best guy that he beat?

5772
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:23,670
Probably Larry Holmes,

5773
02:41:23,671 --> 02:41:26,700
but Larry Holmes was out of his
prime to Leon Spinks or excuse me,

5774
02:41:26,701 --> 02:41:28,350
Michael Spinks washed this thug dude.

5775
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,930
I'm just saying compared
to the other heavyweights,

5776
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:30,751
I don't think he's the,

5777
02:41:30,751 --> 02:41:31,680
he's the best heavyweight.

5778
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:32,041
Well,

5779
02:41:32,041 --> 02:41:33,780
it was all before he went to jail,

5780
02:41:33,781 --> 02:41:34,370
man.

5781
02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:35,203
Awesome.

5782
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:39,640
Best guys beat an old Larry
Holmes or Spinks back to think of,

5783
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:42,000
it's the way he ran through the division.

5784
02:41:42,030 --> 02:41:42,720
He changed.

5785
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:43,590
He was in the pocket.

5786
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:47,400
But you look at like and Lennox Lewis on
banner Holyfield much more impressive.

5787
02:41:47,430 --> 02:41:47,940
It's true.

5788
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:48,211
No,

5789
02:41:48,211 --> 02:41:49,200
there's nothing more about it.

5790
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:51,780
Ultimately when Lennox Lewis,

5791
02:41:52,360 --> 02:41:54,090
when he beats Tyson Tyson,

5792
02:41:54,690 --> 02:41:55,250
he beat,

5793
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:55,440
no,

5794
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:55,751
he's those,

5795
02:41:55,751 --> 02:41:57,730
those old school boxing
shoes he used to wear.

5796
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:59,100
But when he'd be Tyson,

5797
02:41:59,101 --> 02:42:01,120
Tyson was an older man and you know,

5798
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:03,120
he had been in the game
a long fucking time.

5799
02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:04,350
It just wasn't the same.

5800
02:42:04,351 --> 02:42:08,350
Once he was disconnected more and
more from the original customers.

5801
02:42:08,510 --> 02:42:11,520
Look at the body of work compared to
a van or Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.

5802
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:12,780
If you look just on paper,

5803
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:15,360
my budget number has the scare factor.

5804
02:42:15,390 --> 02:42:16,440
That's what we all remember.

5805
02:42:16,441 --> 02:42:17,430
Remember Brendon,

5806
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:20,700
he went out there and fucked
everybody up in the first round.

5807
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:21,623
Nobody else's.

5808
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:23,683
He didn't pee.

5809
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:27,660
Fucking had the fear where
they fought Mike Tyson.

5810
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:28,740
They were fucking,

5811
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:30,210
and that's why we say he's the best.

5812
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,350
That's why you say he's the best.

5813
02:42:31,351 --> 02:42:32,520
But if you look at it on paper,

5814
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:33,341
he's really not.

5815
02:42:33,341 --> 02:42:36,990
And they were scared was cause he was
going through everybody with one fucking

5816
02:42:36,991 --> 02:42:37,620
punch.

5817
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:39,080
He was crushing the vendor.

5818
02:42:39,230 --> 02:42:40,090
Highfield wasn't scared.

5819
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,670
People were,

5820
02:42:40,670 --> 02:42:41,050
yeah,

5821
02:42:41,050 --> 02:42:41,431
it's true.

5822
02:42:41,431 --> 02:42:42,300
Buster Douglas when,

5823
02:42:42,301 --> 02:42:43,134
and scared and true.

5824
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:44,603
But it's true.

5825
02:42:44,680 --> 02:42:44,921
But,

5826
02:42:44,921 --> 02:42:45,000
uh,

5827
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,270
but if you look at Evander
Holyfield's career,

5828
02:42:48,390 --> 02:42:49,130
he wasn't,

5829
02:42:49,130 --> 02:42:51,120
he's a gold and shocking the world.

5830
02:42:51,121 --> 02:42:51,954
Like Mike Tyson,

5831
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:53,900
Mike Tyson was just a GP.

5832
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:57,120
Mike Tyson blew up paper view people.

5833
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:00,570
They were pissed that he would
not do doubt in the first round,

5834
02:43:00,571 --> 02:43:02,520
but just know that nobody's,

5835
02:43:02,521 --> 02:43:03,210
if you look at it,

5836
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:04,060
that was the problem.

5837
02:43:04,061 --> 02:43:04,620
Like book,

5838
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:06,320
you're just going to knock
them out on the first row.

5839
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,700
That was the proper people were
pissed off with the paper view.

5840
02:43:08,970 --> 02:43:11,980
My president is going to beat him in
the first round and we're going to lose

5841
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,431
our money.

5842
02:43:12,431 --> 02:43:13,264
Fuck.

5843
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:15,910
That was a problem he created.

5844
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:17,250
Nobody's if you'd like.

5845
02:43:17,460 --> 02:43:17,770
No,

5846
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:17,951
no.

5847
02:43:17,951 --> 02:43:21,660
He's got everybody up and
people were scared shitless.

5848
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:26,020
It was no other that provoked that.

5849
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:27,880
No,

5850
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:28,713
you're right.

5851
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:29,291
You're right.

5852
02:43:29,291 --> 02:43:30,640
He was a special force.

5853
02:43:30,641 --> 02:43:31,960
So scary side on earth.

5854
02:43:31,961 --> 02:43:35,920
But listen with with Brenda is talking
about is like hindsight like so when

5855
02:43:35,921 --> 02:43:39,220
Brendan is talking about it now when you
look back and you think about the guys

5856
02:43:39,221 --> 02:43:40,054
he beat,

5857
02:43:40,210 --> 02:43:43,900
it's very arguable that holy
field was the superior fighter.

5858
02:43:43,901 --> 02:43:46,030
He beat him twice and
we always want to say,

5859
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:46,181
well,

5860
02:43:46,181 --> 02:43:48,610
he wasn't the same guy as when Tyson,

5861
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:50,333
he doesn't matter.

5862
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:51,213
He's still beat him.

5863
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:53,170
When they got together and holy field,

5864
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:56,830
you got to put him on a higher level
because he was able to maintain his

5865
02:43:56,831 --> 02:43:59,590
enthusiasm for fighting
way longer than most folks.

5866
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:01,220
Natural cruiserweight.

5867
02:44:01,860 --> 02:44:03,040
So many fights like,

5868
02:44:03,041 --> 02:44:03,311
fuck,

5869
02:44:03,311 --> 02:44:05,560
we're really low and amateurs,

5870
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:06,331
amateurs,

5871
02:44:06,331 --> 02:44:07,470
man who won the gold,

5872
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:10,270
make the team look at the body of work.

5873
02:44:10,340 --> 02:44:12,190
His career was amazing.

5874
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:13,150
The fights he was in,

5875
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:16,180
but Tyson was known for going through.

5876
02:44:16,181 --> 02:44:16,380
Dude,

5877
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:17,670
that doesn't mean he's a better fighter.

5878
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:22,270
I think you have to give it to a van
or calls a vandal beat him twice,

5879
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:25,630
but Tyson is one of the all time greats
and they're both all time greats.

5880
02:44:25,631 --> 02:44:25,901
I mean,

5881
02:44:25,901 --> 02:44:28,330
we're super lucky to have
watched those guys fight.

5882
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:29,020
I agree.

5883
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:34,020
You know Tyson and Holyfield x factor
because he's so scared of the stock in

5884
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:34,930
these guys out.

5885
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:35,231
Boys,

5886
02:44:35,231 --> 02:44:36,190
can we go here we go.

5887
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,033
To manifest.

5888
02:44:37,390 --> 02:44:38,500
Tyson was more exciting,

5889
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:38,670
man.

5890
02:44:38,670 --> 02:44:40,150
It's 10 boy doesn't make you better fight.

5891
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:41,620
Here's Harrison.

5892
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:42,580
Yair Rodriguez,

5893
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:44,680
Tyson main event.

5894
02:44:44,681 --> 02:44:45,790
Look at that perfect hook.

5895
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:47,703
It's better than me.

5896
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:49,271
Yeah,

5897
02:44:49,271 --> 02:44:51,160
but you always got to
wonder like what was,

5898
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:54,910
what was the training like for Tyson then
in comparison to the training when he

5899
02:44:54,911 --> 02:44:55,360
was young?

5900
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,590
What was the mindset like?

5901
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,080
I,

5902
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:02,080
I'm a firm believer that a really elite
fighter could only maintain a certain

5903
02:45:02,561 --> 02:45:05,200
number of Rpms when they're
just smashing people.

5904
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:07,690
They can only maintain that
for a certain amount of time.

5905
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:08,711
I mean,

5906
02:45:08,711 --> 02:45:09,130
uh,

5907
02:45:09,130 --> 02:45:09,640
uh,

5908
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,020
the password prove you right.

5909
02:45:11,021 --> 02:45:11,531
You know what I'm saying?

5910
02:45:11,531 --> 02:45:12,490
You look get all fighters,

5911
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,400
but we don't realize it when
they're going through it.

5912
02:45:15,401 --> 02:45:16,570
Like if you look at Ronda,

5913
02:45:16,571 --> 02:45:16,901
it was like,

5914
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:17,021
yeah,

5915
02:45:17,021 --> 02:45:17,854
that's what she does.

5916
02:45:17,950 --> 02:45:19,240
You look at junior dos Santos,

5917
02:45:19,241 --> 02:45:20,350
you look at cane like certain,

5918
02:45:20,470 --> 02:45:21,161
it's weird.

5919
02:45:21,161 --> 02:45:21,851
Then you step back,

5920
02:45:21,851 --> 02:45:22,300
you'll,

5921
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:22,421
oh,

5922
02:45:22,421 --> 02:45:23,254
that was the Ra.

5923
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:24,670
That's the run there.

5924
02:45:24,970 --> 02:45:26,100
That's the greatest Rev.

5925
02:45:26,101 --> 02:45:28,510
We're going to see him make a
call right now as it's happening.

5926
02:45:28,511 --> 02:45:29,620
You really don't notice.

5927
02:45:29,650 --> 02:45:30,930
I was thinking about that the other days.

5928
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:33,180
You,

5929
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:33,370
uh,

5930
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:36,490
you're accustomed to it and you think
that's just what they do and then they

5931
02:45:36,491 --> 02:45:37,240
lose like two or three.

5932
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:37,720
You're like,

5933
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:38,553
oh shit.

5934
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:39,310
That was his,

5935
02:45:39,310 --> 02:45:39,911
that was it.

5936
02:45:39,911 --> 02:45:41,230
That was the run until six,

5937
02:45:41,231 --> 02:45:41,771
seven fights.

5938
02:45:41,771 --> 02:45:42,970
Which it was pure greatness.

5939
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:43,990
Music is like that too.

5940
02:45:43,991 --> 02:45:47,350
Like bands that would come out with
their new album but their new album,

5941
02:45:47,351 --> 02:45:48,880
it's not like they're old shit.

5942
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:50,970
Their new album is no like the old chick.

5943
02:45:51,070 --> 02:45:54,010
But then that new shit is old shit.

5944
02:45:55,410 --> 02:45:56,243
Fight,

5945
02:45:56,890 --> 02:45:57,723
fight,

5946
02:45:58,150 --> 02:46:00,010
washed our rig is how he's better.

5947
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:04,840
Rodriguez is going to reduce is to
Sarah's is fucking threatened him a few

5948
02:46:04,841 --> 02:46:05,360
times.

5949
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:07,510
This is a heavy favorite
midsummer to spinning this.

5950
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:08,980
He shows getting back fast.

5951
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:09,833
Nah.

5952
02:46:09,910 --> 02:46:11,330
Oh Cause Harris has to rant.

5953
02:46:11,370 --> 02:46:12,203
He's um,

5954
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:13,520
he's athletic but he's,

5955
02:46:13,521 --> 02:46:14,150
he's too,

5956
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:14,720
uh,

5957
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:15,553
for sure out.

5958
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:16,850
He doesn't have the fundamentals.

5959
02:46:16,851 --> 02:46:17,820
I don't think that Rodrigo,

5960
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:18,893
oh,

5961
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:22,483
mistakes.

5962
02:46:22,660 --> 02:46:23,660
It makes big mistakes.

5963
02:46:23,661 --> 02:46:24,494
His hands are down.

5964
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:27,260
He's been getting tagged and
then wanting to fight with her.

5965
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:28,050
Hands down.

5966
02:46:28,050 --> 02:46:29,060
No Rodriguez,

5967
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:34,090
Rodriguez Kellen on this when they're
close read because his hands are up.

5968
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:38,780
Defense made a better
default is excellent.

5969
02:46:38,781 --> 02:46:39,470
But Dude,

5970
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:40,760
cause Sarah's is very good,

5971
02:46:40,761 --> 02:46:41,571
very athletic,

5972
02:46:41,571 --> 02:46:42,141
very good.

5973
02:46:42,141 --> 02:46:42,410
He,

5974
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:42,790
he,

5975
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:43,220
he's,

5976
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:44,150
he needs Brian towns.

5977
02:46:44,151 --> 02:46:45,410
Workshops got fundamental.

5978
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:47,060
He's not as good fundamentally.

5979
02:46:47,061 --> 02:46:48,950
He's just not as Rodriguez.

5980
02:46:48,951 --> 02:46:50,240
He's just not watch your mouth.

5981
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:51,740
I would,

5982
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:52,850
I would disagree with you.

5983
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:53,260
All right.

5984
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:55,340
I would say because
Sarah's is very underrated,

5985
02:46:55,341 --> 02:46:57,200
is very crafty in our athletic,

5986
02:46:57,201 --> 02:46:58,880
very crafty and watching lenses.

5987
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,300
He's very comfortable in they
Brian Rodriguez a heavy favorite.

5988
02:47:02,301 --> 02:47:02,450
Yeah.

5989
02:47:02,450 --> 02:47:03,410
I'm not saying that.

5990
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:06,650
My point is be this beautiful
leg lock attempt here.

5991
02:47:06,651 --> 02:47:07,850
Barbara Drugas it's not,

5992
02:47:07,851 --> 02:47:09,350
I'm not saying that he's not going to win.

5993
02:47:09,351 --> 02:47:12,380
I'm just seeing you like you saying
that it doesn't have good fundamentals.

5994
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,930
I'm not being insulting to concerns.

5995
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:16,320
What I'm saying is anything,

5996
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:21,400
I just watched their first one minute
guys and I saw and I saw him make big

5997
02:47:21,981 --> 02:47:25,010
mistakes where he's coming in and throwing
and being really athletic but getting

5998
02:47:25,011 --> 02:47:26,510
caught in the face by a,

5999
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:28,520
by a guy who was a really
a better counter punch.

6000
02:47:28,521 --> 02:47:30,030
I don't see that and I fought for it.

6001
02:47:30,050 --> 02:47:30,380
Yeah.

6002
02:47:30,380 --> 02:47:31,790
Well I did cause you weren't watching.

6003
02:47:31,791 --> 02:47:33,100
You were talking the whole time,

6004
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:34,980
dammit.

6005
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:35,830
Are you a fan?

6006
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:37,580
If you ever watched a fight before?

6007
02:47:37,581 --> 02:47:39,830
I have fight with Sergio Pettis.

6008
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:40,693
Great.

6009
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:42,110
What happened to the fight was her job,

6010
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:43,010
but I didn't see that fight.

6011
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:45,943
He beat him.

6012
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:47,360
He was the first guy to beat.

6013
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:48,560
Not saying he's not really good.

6014
02:47:48,561 --> 02:47:52,610
I'm saying he doesn't have the fundamental
is that to fight in the Harris is

6015
02:47:52,611 --> 02:47:56,130
listened to me right now and don't
ever say anything different compared to

6016
02:47:56,430 --> 02:47:57,510
compared to rugby again.

6017
02:47:57,511 --> 02:47:57,980
Please.

6018
02:47:57,980 --> 02:47:59,720
Alex Harris is a bad motherfucker.

6019
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,531
I never seen her.

6020
02:48:00,531 --> 02:48:02,350
Rodriguez is a bad one of the foul.

6021
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:04,570
Have Fun right now.

6022
02:48:04,571 --> 02:48:05,200
You fuck.

6023
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:05,640
Hey.

6024
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:06,200
Hey.

6025
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:09,530
I said [inaudible] has
better fundamentals.

6026
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:12,140
That's what I said.

6027
02:48:12,170 --> 02:48:12,690
You sit here,

6028
02:48:12,690 --> 02:48:13,760
no fundamentals.

6029
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:15,110
You need the movement.

6030
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:18,070
You see how he evaded that high
kick and then watching what y'all,

6031
02:48:18,071 --> 02:48:20,510
he's evading every stop
trying to control my eyeballs.

6032
02:48:20,570 --> 02:48:22,700
Bryan Harris was very good.

6033
02:48:23,070 --> 02:48:23,960
I've of course,

6034
02:48:23,961 --> 02:48:24,611
he's very good.

6035
02:48:24,611 --> 02:48:25,940
I said he's not as good as Bermuda.

6036
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:29,181
Fuck.

6037
02:48:29,181 --> 02:48:31,620
His fundamentals are not as
good as [inaudible] as Arab,

6038
02:48:33,130 --> 02:48:34,070
not Bermuda is you?

6039
02:48:34,071 --> 02:48:34,521
Fuck,

6040
02:48:34,521 --> 02:48:35,354
sorry man.

6041
02:48:36,050 --> 02:48:36,390
Jumping.

6042
02:48:36,390 --> 02:48:37,720
Don't tell about Oh,

6043
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:39,440
good fundamentals.

6044
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:40,640
Good fundamentals.

6045
02:48:41,150 --> 02:48:42,020
Good fundamentals.

6046
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,070
Oh my God.

6047
02:48:43,130 --> 02:48:43,641
There it is.

6048
02:48:43,641 --> 02:48:44,600
Look at the fundamental grip.

6049
02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:49,630
We're like a bunch of children with the
example of how not to behave when you're

6050
02:48:49,731 --> 02:48:50,990
on a live podcast.

6051
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:51,980
It's so true.

6052
02:48:52,340 --> 02:48:54,590
What does that going to be equally,

6053
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:56,990
I don't think they an issue for men.

6054
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:58,580
I think it's an issue for women.

6055
02:48:58,581 --> 02:48:59,001
That is,

6056
02:48:59,001 --> 02:49:00,380
at least as far as what I read,

6057
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:04,160
I loose loosely looked over
it and see if you can find it.

6058
02:49:04,161 --> 02:49:06,440
Jamie with the new regulation
is about women's clothing.

6059
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:10,510
If I just made that up like Joe
doesn't say anything about women,

6060
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:14,430
we put something in my coffee bro.

6061
02:49:14,431 --> 02:49:15,380
That's what's so said,

6062
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:15,781
man.

6063
02:49:15,781 --> 02:49:16,680
She's fucking Bro.

6064
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:17,491
Cause I lose shit.

6065
02:49:17,491 --> 02:49:18,770
What does the Holy Shit do for us?

6066
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:19,870
Nothing.

6067
02:49:19,870 --> 02:49:20,703
It's just

6068
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:24,510
because of wardrobe malfunctions.

6069
02:49:24,890 --> 02:49:25,723
Someone

6070
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:29,220
was hanging out recently.

6071
02:49:29,430 --> 02:49:30,263
Sorry.

6072
02:49:31,350 --> 02:49:32,850
Maybe I'm talking about the fight before.

6073
02:49:32,851 --> 02:49:34,350
Maybe I was thinking about
Bermuda has just now.

6074
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:34,601
Oh,

6075
02:49:34,601 --> 02:49:39,070
because Sarah's powerful sugar ray
Leonard still fucking whack in that bag.

6076
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:39,540
It's still,

6077
02:49:39,540 --> 02:49:40,470
he's still fuck you up.

6078
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:43,670
It's in Skechers each aspect by getting,

6079
02:49:43,930 --> 02:49:48,060
you can't the white sox imagine if he's
wearing Birkenstocks with socks and beat

6080
02:49:48,061 --> 02:49:48,894
the fuck out.

6081
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:52,373
He could

6082
02:49:54,370 --> 02:49:55,310
just fuck.

6083
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:57,000
That's George.

6084
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,833
Come on.

6085
02:49:58,250 --> 02:49:59,030
Wait a minute.

6086
02:49:59,030 --> 02:49:59,600
Wait a minute.

6087
02:49:59,600 --> 02:49:59,971
Hold on.

6088
02:49:59,971 --> 02:50:00,271
Hold on.

6089
02:50:00,271 --> 02:50:00,631
What do you mean?

6090
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:01,440
That's George Hamilton.

6091
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:04,980
I believe that would be George
Hamilton is talking fried chicken.

6092
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:06,091
Colonel Sanders.

6093
02:50:06,091 --> 02:50:07,470
Now what happened in Norm Macdonald?

6094
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:07,621
No,

6095
02:50:07,621 --> 02:50:08,440
it's norm macdonald.

6096
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:08,760
Nope,

6097
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:09,421
that was not,

6098
02:50:09,421 --> 02:50:10,340
that was George Hamilton.

6099
02:50:10,341 --> 02:50:11,940
I click five different ones recently.

6100
02:50:13,230 --> 02:50:14,340
One per commercial kind of.

6101
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:15,990
Oh,

6102
02:50:15,991 --> 02:50:16,824
they're getting crafted.

6103
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,980
It doesn't take place until
January 1st it says to Joe,

6104
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:21,150
if they give you $1 million,

6105
02:50:21,151 --> 02:50:23,940
would you be colonel Sanders
just for just for one campaign.

6106
02:50:24,710 --> 02:50:25,650
Just only three months.

6107
02:50:25,651 --> 02:50:26,071
Think about it.

6108
02:50:26,071 --> 02:50:26,904
I like chicken.

6109
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:31,870
Female competitors must wear a short
sleeved above the elbow or sleeveless form

6110
02:50:31,871 --> 02:50:32,521
fitting rash,

6111
02:50:32,521 --> 02:50:33,930
guard and or sports bra.

6112
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,000
No loose fitting tops are allowed.

6113
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:40,290
Female competitors will follow the same
requirements for bottom coverings as a

6114
02:50:40,291 --> 02:50:41,124
male competitors.

6115
02:50:41,430 --> 02:50:41,820
Oh,

6116
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:42,420
okay.

6117
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:47,420
So they only have to have a tight fitting
upper top because did anybody ever

6118
02:50:48,061 --> 02:50:49,260
have a loose fitting upper Tom?

6119
02:50:49,470 --> 02:50:49,741
You don't.

6120
02:50:49,741 --> 02:50:51,040
You can't have your titty slang,

6121
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:52,170
but did anybody,

6122
02:50:52,290 --> 02:50:53,910
did they just want to
cover their ass with that?

6123
02:50:53,911 --> 02:50:54,744
Is that what that was?

6124
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:55,351
Nobody,

6125
02:50:55,351 --> 02:50:56,190
but it was never an issue.

6126
02:50:56,191 --> 02:50:56,431
Right.

6127
02:50:56,431 --> 02:50:57,264
And having dinner.

6128
02:50:57,730 --> 02:50:58,563
Oh yeah.

6129
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:00,730
Bra got fucked up and she
had to look at the ref.

6130
02:51:01,530 --> 02:51:02,180
Oh yeah,

6131
02:51:02,180 --> 02:51:02,390
yeah,

6132
02:51:02,390 --> 02:51:02,731
yeah.

6133
02:51:02,731 --> 02:51:03,790
Dad

6134
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:06,333
doing cartwheels.

6135
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:08,580
His taekwondo is off the charts.

6136
02:51:09,090 --> 02:51:10,520
This shows you the chance to talk with us.

6137
02:51:10,530 --> 02:51:11,290
This shit.

6138
02:51:11,290 --> 02:51:12,123
The guy,

6139
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:12,751
Brian,

6140
02:51:12,751 --> 02:51:16,020
you sound like a guy acting like a
commentator and a movie right there.

6141
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:17,003
Who Does?

6142
02:51:18,310 --> 02:51:20,190
It's like the karate kid.

6143
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:21,033
Seven.

6144
02:51:21,180 --> 02:51:22,013
Did I just say

6145
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:26,460
I've never it off the charts
in my life and I just did.

6146
02:51:27,310 --> 02:51:29,490
Just don't talk.

6147
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:34,720
That's blocked off.

6148
02:51:34,930 --> 02:51:35,920
I can't stop laughing.

6149
02:51:36,030 --> 02:51:38,180
Get Joe doing the KFC commercials.

6150
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:39,900
You do it for a certain price.

6151
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:41,453
Probably not.

6152
02:51:41,620 --> 02:51:42,750
Now that you guys brought it up,

6153
02:51:46,470 --> 02:51:49,920
he has thrown some fucking whipping kicks.

6154
02:51:50,220 --> 02:51:50,491
Yeah,

6155
02:51:50,491 --> 02:51:50,790
man,

6156
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:52,230
it's fundamentals are so sound,

6157
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:53,990
dude.

6158
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:58,990
Tell him you look how good you can
say this is defenses man says sliding.

6159
02:52:00,530 --> 02:52:01,590
Beautiful young man.

6160
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:04,200
At what point does the APP
pro become like a hindrance?

6161
02:52:04,230 --> 02:52:04,680
Never.

6162
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:05,020
Never.

6163
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:08,140
Never cushion for those
fucking hard brand kicks.

6164
02:52:08,141 --> 02:52:11,510
The back of the head pushing
that is he just did a backhand.

6165
02:52:11,820 --> 02:52:12,620
Oh he back.

6166
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:13,020
Can't you?

6167
02:52:13,020 --> 02:52:15,430
Punched his knee and then
came up with a backhand.

6168
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,060
Wow.

6169
02:52:16,060 --> 02:52:16,421
You know what,

6170
02:52:16,421 --> 02:52:19,660
the reps are probably allowed
kids to the back of the head.

6171
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:20,583
Guys of both.

6172
02:52:22,390 --> 02:52:23,950
This is a five round fight boys.

6173
02:52:23,951 --> 02:52:24,490
This is getting,

6174
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:27,280
Rodriguez happened like
really trying to end.

6175
02:52:27,281 --> 02:52:29,050
This shit is increasing him down here.

6176
02:52:30,070 --> 02:52:32,470
George Hampton has the new
car colonel second called it.

6177
02:52:32,530 --> 02:52:33,430
How many uh,

6178
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:35,320
kernels or they're going to be Jamie.

6179
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:37,300
You know they have to do a block one.

6180
02:52:37,301 --> 02:52:38,800
Right hire is going to spin.

6181
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:40,840
What about a Mexican?

6182
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:42,313
That too.

6183
02:52:42,950 --> 02:52:45,850
Can't just have one like
all the time wizard it.

6184
02:52:45,990 --> 02:52:46,510
Mix it up.

6185
02:52:46,510 --> 02:52:47,343
It's racist.

6186
02:52:48,330 --> 02:52:48,570
Yeah,

6187
02:52:48,570 --> 02:52:50,160
she definitely go a black colonel Sanders.

6188
02:52:50,161 --> 02:52:50,600
Yeah.

6189
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:52,270
That would be the best
way to sell chicken.

6190
02:52:53,660 --> 02:52:54,493
Colonel Sanders,

6191
02:52:54,850 --> 02:52:58,660
the real Colonel Colonel Sanders in his
white have a black eye take over the

6192
02:52:58,661 --> 02:53:01,150
colonel Sanders and it would
have it be like a deal.

6193
02:53:01,151 --> 02:53:04,300
She ugly character who just makes
fun of white people and that's,

6194
02:53:05,170 --> 02:53:07,630
that's the new Colonel Sanders image.

6195
02:53:07,631 --> 02:53:10,020
Like a hilarious black standup comedian.

6196
02:53:10,270 --> 02:53:11,103
What?

6197
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:13,540
Tony Robbins has a thing
about carnal sandwich.

6198
02:53:13,930 --> 02:53:14,763
It wouldn't do it.

6199
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:20,800
He would demand picks up sort of Latino
name outside kick God damn envelope of

6200
02:53:22,871 --> 02:53:26,080
just fucking this somehow with someone.

6201
02:53:26,430 --> 02:53:31,210
It wouldn't be racist if you got a guy
like if you paid a hilarious standup

6202
02:53:31,211 --> 02:53:31,630
comedian,

6203
02:53:31,630 --> 02:53:32,463
Kevin Hart,

6204
02:53:32,950 --> 02:53:34,300
he's too valuable.

6205
02:53:34,330 --> 02:53:35,200
He probably wouldn't do it.

6206
02:53:35,350 --> 02:53:36,220
But if you hadn't been wanes,

6207
02:53:37,090 --> 02:53:38,080
I'm not going to be rude.

6208
02:53:38,590 --> 02:53:39,510
Let's come up with someone,

6209
02:53:39,790 --> 02:53:41,020
some Richard Pryor,

6210
02:53:41,021 --> 02:53:41,651
some notes,

6211
02:53:41,651 --> 02:53:43,210
I'm non non real person.

6212
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:45,380
But if you were like a pretty
decent standup comedian,

6213
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:46,150
really funny guy,

6214
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:50,020
I ruined book and they were
willing to pay you to be deal.

6215
02:53:50,021 --> 02:53:50,201
Who?

6216
02:53:50,201 --> 02:53:54,220
The new black Colonel Sanders and you
had a bunch of jokes where the only made

6217
02:53:54,221 --> 02:53:55,054
fun of white people.

6218
02:53:55,060 --> 02:53:55,690
Martin Lawrence,

6219
02:53:55,690 --> 02:53:57,190
you would kill the bill.

6220
02:53:57,210 --> 02:53:58,330
It'd be a great idea.

6221
02:53:59,080 --> 02:54:00,100
Do you think he could do it?

6222
02:54:00,190 --> 02:54:00,820
What is this?

6223
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:03,450
Campsie taps David Allen Grier's
the first African American.

6224
02:54:03,720 --> 02:54:04,960
The Fuck Outta here.

6225
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:06,190
Oh my God.

6226
02:54:06,191 --> 02:54:07,180
That's hilarious.

6227
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:07,931
That was a white guy.

6228
02:54:07,931 --> 02:54:09,130
You show it and express.

6229
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:11,060
That guy is a letter to Larry.

6230
02:54:11,770 --> 02:54:13,180
So fucking we knew it.

6231
02:54:13,370 --> 02:54:13,871
That's hilarious.

6232
02:54:13,871 --> 02:54:15,820
We were speculating.

6233
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:17,920
Meanwhile this is
actually a real thing yet.

6234
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:19,490
Oh cause it has to be a that.

6235
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:20,140
That's just,

6236
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:22,660
how do you think he's lying
to Sarah's coming on strong.

6237
02:54:22,661 --> 02:54:23,800
Y'All Rodriguez.

6238
02:54:23,950 --> 02:54:25,030
Welcome to deep waters.

6239
02:54:25,060 --> 02:54:25,361
Alex.

6240
02:54:25,361 --> 02:54:26,360
Would no fundamentals going.

6241
02:54:26,390 --> 02:54:28,700
Brian Callen coming on strong or said he

6242
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:34,650
never said he didn't have fundamental
amazing finds any at bat from him.

6243
02:54:34,651 --> 02:54:36,490
I'm not as good as Rodrigo.

6244
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:37,490
I don't remember what,

6245
02:54:38,270 --> 02:54:40,330
I just want to be really
honest about this.

6246
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:40,720
Yeah,

6247
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:43,930
you probably should have
stopped somewhere in the middle.

6248
02:54:43,931 --> 02:54:44,350
You just,

6249
02:54:44,350 --> 02:54:45,460
I know you feel it too.

6250
02:54:45,461 --> 02:54:45,761
Right?

6251
02:54:45,761 --> 02:54:47,590
Like you got on a roll too.

6252
02:54:47,591 --> 02:54:50,410
You are defending your
position and I got to keep,

6253
02:54:50,411 --> 02:54:53,050
depending on what we now know
that Brenda knows more than Nope,

6254
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:53,913
I'm going to die.

6255
02:54:54,810 --> 02:54:55,331
Right.

6256
02:54:55,331 --> 02:54:55,790
And the just,

6257
02:54:55,790 --> 02:54:59,200
Sarah's is obviously handling himself
in his fight against one of the most

6258
02:54:59,201 --> 02:55:00,610
dangerous guys in the division.

6259
02:55:00,610 --> 02:55:03,100
I'm going down and getting
his own shots in as well.

6260
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:03,951
You know about that day.

6261
02:55:03,951 --> 02:55:05,170
That year is a fucking beat.

6262
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:08,060
Your case of consent can't really do,

6263
02:55:08,061 --> 02:55:08,440
Bro.

6264
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:10,100
You can agree with you and
I'll tell you something else.

6265
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:11,350
Two body shots.

6266
02:55:11,620 --> 02:55:13,350
Adam was three straight Yas,

6267
02:55:13,380 --> 02:55:13,830
right?

6268
02:55:13,830 --> 02:55:17,570
I told you her Daniel Allen Greer
will not be the first Colonel Sanders.

6269
02:55:17,740 --> 02:55:18,573
It's a lie.

6270
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:19,863
He backed me.

6271
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:23,240
He tweeted it lands David Alan Grier.

6272
02:55:23,330 --> 02:55:24,560
He's trying to jump in the plot.

6273
02:55:24,650 --> 02:55:26,930
You don't have enough fucking contract.

6274
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:27,591
He knew what he did.

6275
02:55:27,591 --> 02:55:28,370
He was joking.

6276
02:55:28,370 --> 02:55:28,521
No,

6277
02:55:28,521 --> 02:55:29,340
he's honey Dicken.

6278
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:30,390
What's it honey in KFC.

6279
02:55:30,391 --> 02:55:30,711
You'd be like,

6280
02:55:30,711 --> 02:55:30,861
yeah,

6281
02:55:30,861 --> 02:55:31,760
that's a great idea,

6282
02:55:31,761 --> 02:55:32,630
is a great idea.

6283
02:55:32,631 --> 02:55:33,950
Said KFC is racist as fuck.

6284
02:55:33,951 --> 02:55:34,521
Like absolutely.

6285
02:55:34,521 --> 02:55:37,130
I would like to volunteer
to make fun of white people.

6286
02:55:37,131 --> 02:55:38,830
If he gets that job too would help.

6287
02:55:39,130 --> 02:55:39,630
I will.

6288
02:55:39,630 --> 02:55:41,060
I will help write some chokes.

6289
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:41,923
I'll buy the chicken.

6290
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:44,550
You got to keep it white.

6291
02:55:45,900 --> 02:55:47,540
They could get ugly.

6292
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:48,403
No.

6293
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:49,420
Well,

6294
02:55:49,420 --> 02:55:50,870
Popeye's does it kind of.

6295
02:55:51,350 --> 02:55:52,250
I can't wait.

6296
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:53,330
You got to keep it white.

6297
02:55:53,810 --> 02:55:58,200
I can't wait until all fried chicken
places just make fun of white people suck

6298
02:55:58,201 --> 02:56:00,310
and eat fried chicken with zero kilt.

6299
02:56:01,790 --> 02:56:05,630
Just muck all whiteness.

6300
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:07,490
I'll make it delicious chicken.

6301
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:08,240
I'll take it.

6302
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:10,220
I'll go through some
shit to get that chicken.

6303
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:11,241
Sorry.

6304
02:56:11,241 --> 02:56:12,560
Things are the way they are.

6305
02:56:12,830 --> 02:56:15,710
I'm surprised he didn't mean for anything.

6306
02:56:15,711 --> 02:56:17,870
Anybody that looks like
me did in the past.

6307
02:56:17,871 --> 02:56:18,710
I don't know those fucking beat.

6308
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:19,670
Both of them do with it.

6309
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:23,270
I don't agree with it all
to pieces with a biscuit.

6310
02:56:23,300 --> 02:56:25,130
Make Fun of white people
and give me some chicken.

6311
02:56:27,320 --> 02:56:28,153
Make Fun of Weipa.

6312
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,290
I Wa wa anybody please.

6313
02:56:30,291 --> 02:56:31,370
Let's level this playing field.

6314
02:56:31,371 --> 02:56:32,610
I'll roast them with you guys.

6315
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:33,560
Thing,

6316
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,680
thing that something's delicious.

6317
02:56:34,681 --> 02:56:37,340
It's fried chicken is in
somehow or any way racist.

6318
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:38,660
Everybody should breathe freely.

6319
02:56:38,661 --> 02:56:39,500
Enjoy a drink.

6320
02:56:39,501 --> 02:56:41,200
I love a nice grape sodas

6321
02:56:43,010 --> 02:56:43,750
for real.

6322
02:56:43,750 --> 02:56:45,410
There is a not be race.

6323
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:46,221
I'm not trying to be funny.

6324
02:56:46,221 --> 02:56:47,380
Try Drinking a grape soda.

6325
02:56:47,381 --> 02:56:48,680
I'm just being cool too.

6326
02:56:49,730 --> 02:56:53,030
I had some buttermilk fried
chicken in a restaurant in Atlanta.

6327
02:56:53,031 --> 02:56:53,380
It's really,

6328
02:56:53,380 --> 02:56:55,010
it was so good.

6329
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:56,113
That's not racist,

6330
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:59,180
so God damn good ahead it two
years ago and I never forgot it.

6331
02:56:59,181 --> 02:57:00,810
Fried Chicken's incredible.

6332
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:02,313
Good

6333
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:06,470
white people make chick filet chicken,

6334
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:08,910
but this wasn't chick filet chest.

6335
02:57:09,250 --> 02:57:11,990
It's just like a gourmet
restaurant made fried chicken.

6336
02:57:11,991 --> 02:57:12,681
That's what I'm saying.

6337
02:57:12,681 --> 02:57:13,460
The old school way.

6338
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:14,360
While I was just thinking in my head,

6339
02:57:14,361 --> 02:57:15,320
I was having a conversation again,

6340
02:57:15,321 --> 02:57:17,330
but KFC,

6341
02:57:17,330 --> 02:57:17,331
Popeye's,

6342
02:57:17,331 --> 02:57:17,540
right?

6343
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:17,980
It's Kinda,

6344
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:18,620
you know.

6345
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:19,010
Right.

6346
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:20,680
And then chick fil A's owned by Mormons.

6347
02:57:20,690 --> 02:57:22,610
Is this why they shut down the Mormon?

6348
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:23,001
So there's,

6349
02:57:23,001 --> 02:57:25,430
there's some kind of crazy
Christians chicken too.

6350
02:57:25,790 --> 02:57:26,623
But how about this?

6351
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:28,080
How about there's a,

6352
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:29,170
I don't want to mention though.

6353
02:57:29,250 --> 02:57:29,541
Shit,

6354
02:57:29,541 --> 02:57:31,190
you guys are missing some great fighters.

6355
02:57:31,191 --> 02:57:33,870
T and off on this because it's fun.

6356
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:36,253
It's fun.

6357
02:57:37,410 --> 02:57:38,780
Have you ever had that chicken bag?

6358
02:57:38,781 --> 02:57:42,040
Get at the ARC light with watermelon?

6359
02:57:42,080 --> 02:57:42,780
Have a hat.

6360
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:43,613
I've lived it.

6361
02:57:43,730 --> 02:57:44,050
Oh,

6362
02:57:44,050 --> 02:57:44,310
nice.

6363
02:57:44,310 --> 02:57:45,180
Left hand by

6364
02:57:47,270 --> 02:57:48,103
Barb.

6365
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:50,210
Racist at Arc light.

6366
02:57:50,350 --> 02:57:52,310
I Riggins is no joke.

6367
02:57:52,580 --> 02:57:53,413
I sure haven't.

6368
02:57:54,850 --> 02:57:58,710
Rodriquez a style they
close on Sunday at site.

6369
02:57:58,730 --> 02:58:00,620
They closed on Sundays
because Christian beliefs.

6370
02:58:00,890 --> 02:58:01,530
What about us?

6371
02:58:01,530 --> 02:58:02,220
What about his style?

6372
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:04,890
His style requires a lot of exploding.

6373
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:10,190
Like his style is all like leaping forward
and leaping back and moving forward

6374
02:58:11,101 --> 02:58:11,821
fast is,

6375
02:58:11,821 --> 02:58:14,460
has a lot of like serious explosions.

6376
02:58:14,461 --> 02:58:15,560
It's fun to watch what is,

6377
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:16,010
it's no,

6378
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:16,561
it's great.

6379
02:58:16,561 --> 02:58:17,150
Amazing.

6380
02:58:17,150 --> 02:58:17,521
It's great.

6381
02:58:17,521 --> 02:58:17,961
But what I'm,

6382
02:58:17,961 --> 02:58:18,870
what I'm saying is like,

6383
02:58:18,871 --> 02:58:23,820
it takes a really high level of fitness
to fight this style because he's doing

6384
02:58:23,821 --> 02:58:25,620
essentially like wrestling.

6385
02:58:25,621 --> 02:58:28,260
But like with all these
plyometrics built into it,

6386
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:28,861
you know,

6387
02:58:28,861 --> 02:58:30,720
he's like leaping forward and backward.

6388
02:58:30,721 --> 02:58:31,250
Yeah.

6389
02:58:31,250 --> 02:58:31,960
Yeah.

6390
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:32,880
Where's Alex Dream?

6391
02:58:32,881 --> 02:58:34,170
Remember this isn't Utah,

6392
02:58:34,171 --> 02:58:36,240
so the level elevations high,

6393
02:58:36,630 --> 02:58:40,200
but Rodriguez comes from Albuquerque
so it's not gonna be as high as

6394
02:58:40,201 --> 02:58:40,770
Albuquerque.

6395
02:58:40,770 --> 02:58:43,530
So I would assume later in rounds
is going to favor Rodriguez.

6396
02:58:43,560 --> 02:58:44,393
If you think about that.

6397
02:58:45,160 --> 02:58:46,560
He's also been t and off.

6398
02:58:46,561 --> 02:58:47,280
Like he's,

6399
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:48,600
he's doing crazy stuff.

6400
02:58:48,601 --> 02:58:49,080
It's hard to,

6401
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:52,220
how do you train for a guy like Doris?

6402
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:55,030
But because Sarah's is from uh,

6403
02:58:55,031 --> 02:58:59,190
the John Crouches camp and they do
do some training up in the mountains.

6404
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:00,151
That's an Arizona.

6405
02:59:00,151 --> 02:59:00,541
Yeah,

6406
02:59:00,541 --> 02:59:00,841
they did.

6407
02:59:00,841 --> 02:59:02,160
They go into those Arizona mountains,

6408
02:59:02,161 --> 02:59:03,500
like Arizona does have mountains.

6409
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,740
A lot of people don't realize how,

6410
02:59:04,741 --> 02:59:05,040
fuck,

6411
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:05,431
hey Brandon,

6412
02:59:05,431 --> 02:59:06,920
when he throws this right way,

6413
02:59:06,990 --> 02:59:08,910
ways head's going all the
way to the side like that.

6414
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:10,500
That's a really interesting thing.

6415
02:59:10,501 --> 02:59:10,800
Is that,

6416
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:11,760
is that normal or,

6417
02:59:11,761 --> 02:59:12,594
I didn't see it.

6418
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:13,110
Joe,

6419
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:14,810
did you see him throw this right and he,

6420
02:59:14,850 --> 02:59:15,631
he ducks his head,

6421
02:59:15,631 --> 02:59:15,880
his head,

6422
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:16,600
see what he's doing.

6423
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:16,890
Who?

6424
02:59:16,890 --> 02:59:17,380
His head.

6425
02:59:17,380 --> 02:59:17,820
Sarah's.

6426
02:59:17,820 --> 02:59:19,500
I know a red Rodriguez.

6427
02:59:19,530 --> 02:59:20,363
Really interesting.

6428
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:22,470
He keeps punching the needs when he,

6429
02:59:22,471 --> 02:59:23,250
you'll see him go down,

6430
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:25,860
he punches the knees just damn.

6431
02:59:26,010 --> 02:59:28,890
Although Alex or through a
fucking knee had been trouble.

6432
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:29,753
But yeah,

6433
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:31,380
all the way to the side when he does it,

6434
02:59:31,381 --> 02:59:32,640
watch what that lesson was it,

6435
02:59:32,670 --> 02:59:34,350
it's knowing when he see what he's doing.

6436
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:36,240
It's knowing when you
could do something too.

6437
02:59:36,241 --> 02:59:37,800
It's like knowing when your,

6438
02:59:37,801 --> 02:59:41,550
your opponent is leaning his weight
backwards and reveal a time it right.

6439
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:46,140
Or knowing when he's committing to one
side or another side and being able to

6440
02:59:46,141 --> 02:59:47,500
anticipate it and time it.

6441
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:48,930
It's very one sided fight right now.

6442
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:50,850
Very one sided fun fight though.

6443
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:51,220
Yeah,

6444
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:51,450
but,

6445
02:59:51,450 --> 02:59:56,400
but inside you're so connected
to help me out with this.

6446
02:59:56,760 --> 02:59:57,900
Just think about what I'm saying.

6447
02:59:58,410 --> 03:00:03,410
You're so connected to your
previous statement that you
are not willing to enjoy

6448
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,760
this fight as it plays out.

6449
03:00:05,790 --> 03:00:06,001
No,

6450
03:00:06,001 --> 03:00:06,231
sorry.

6451
03:00:06,231 --> 03:00:06,561
You're wrong.

6452
03:00:06,561 --> 03:00:07,530
You're wanting this fight.

6453
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:08,753
Turn them up.

6454
03:00:09,010 --> 03:00:12,260
Just hit him with a beautiful knee to
the body and a nice combination of right

6455
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:13,960
would be there was a good shot.

6456
03:00:13,961 --> 03:00:15,150
Rodriguez isn't dominated.

6457
03:00:16,060 --> 03:00:16,740
I'm fine.

6458
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:17,573
It's amazing.

6459
03:00:19,580 --> 03:00:20,460
Oh,

6460
03:00:20,461 --> 03:00:23,670
Sarah's just rang that bell sign
might be changing a little bit here.

6461
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:25,470
Please just listen to your,

6462
03:00:25,530 --> 03:00:26,670
listen to your voice.

6463
03:00:26,671 --> 03:00:28,500
The instinct of the back of my
head is telling you right now.

6464
03:00:28,501 --> 03:00:29,334
Shut the fuck up.

6465
03:00:29,430 --> 03:00:30,090
No,

6466
03:00:30,090 --> 03:00:31,740
he doesn't have that and
I don't know because no,

6467
03:00:31,780 --> 03:00:33,870
she's saying so far in,

6468
03:00:33,871 --> 03:00:34,071
in,

6469
03:00:34,071 --> 03:00:37,350
in round has been winning this fight.

6470
03:00:37,351 --> 03:00:38,184
Handling.

6471
03:00:38,750 --> 03:00:41,640
It looks like you sound
like a guy in a movie.

6472
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:43,460
Hey Brian handily,

6473
03:00:43,740 --> 03:00:48,210
because I use the word handedly isn't
handling your headedly triangle a tent.

6474
03:00:48,230 --> 03:00:49,680
We get this wrong knee bar.

6475
03:00:50,550 --> 03:00:53,070
Oh step Rah Rah.

6476
03:00:53,071 --> 03:00:53,701
Slippery,

6477
03:00:53,701 --> 03:00:54,211
slippery,

6478
03:00:54,211 --> 03:00:55,410
slippery third round.

6479
03:00:55,990 --> 03:00:56,380
Hud.

6480
03:00:56,380 --> 03:00:57,540
Regus is God.

6481
03:00:57,541 --> 03:00:58,171
Yeah man.

6482
03:00:58,171 --> 03:01:00,340
So is Alex to Harris who's on top bitch?

6483
03:01:00,730 --> 03:01:01,060
No,

6484
03:01:01,060 --> 03:01:03,910
they need a real Mexican guys.

6485
03:01:03,911 --> 03:01:04,744
A champ

6486
03:01:06,780 --> 03:01:07,660
that first round.

6487
03:01:07,661 --> 03:01:11,410
And why can Sarah was hard to deal with.

6488
03:01:11,411 --> 03:01:14,410
I will admit that I'm thinking
about that first round.

6489
03:01:15,580 --> 03:01:17,530
He's just making fun of you right now.

6490
03:01:17,531 --> 03:01:17,990
Brian.

6491
03:01:17,990 --> 03:01:19,380
Whatever was on top,

6492
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:22,460
I didn't take the bait up.

6493
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:22,671
Yeah,

6494
03:01:22,671 --> 03:01:26,500
you're Rodriguez and he's making
fun of you ignoring your bait.

6495
03:01:26,501 --> 03:01:27,370
Cause I see the hook.

6496
03:01:27,690 --> 03:01:31,210
I not making pick nor at green cause
he's winning this fight right now.

6497
03:01:31,570 --> 03:01:31,901
Alex,

6498
03:01:31,901 --> 03:01:32,860
you Sarah says winning.

6499
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:37,000
This is a school yard fight and they
pulled Alex to Sarah's off right now

6500
03:01:37,030 --> 03:01:39,580
everyone would agree that Alex
because tariffs one that'd be truth.

6501
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:41,540
Wants to be where he's created all the

6502
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:45,880
travel was being sarcastic.

6503
03:01:45,881 --> 03:01:50,230
Ladies and gentlemen just as what he
does and you don't want you to know it.

6504
03:01:50,231 --> 03:01:51,670
You would assume he's on your side.

6505
03:01:51,671 --> 03:01:52,810
What's called honey ticking.

6506
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:56,200
Hey could you do you
know what you're doing?

6507
03:01:56,230 --> 03:01:57,220
Cause Sarah's won that round.

6508
03:01:57,221 --> 03:01:58,054
I'll give it to him.

6509
03:01:58,440 --> 03:02:00,070
He's probably two one but it's close.

6510
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:03,250
Doing judge fights ever
for fear of your own life,

6511
03:02:04,170 --> 03:02:09,010
for your safety to and fighters know the
fans listening are going to back me up

6512
03:02:09,011 --> 03:02:09,780
on this.

6513
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:10,810
I guess you're the uh,

6514
03:02:10,900 --> 03:02:11,561
well it's two one,

6515
03:02:11,561 --> 03:02:12,311
yeah I agree with you there.

6516
03:02:12,311 --> 03:02:17,040
But I guess a year in the circle of trust
her so you can judge the fights bank's

6517
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:21,520
money and I agree with you that first
round he did win first and second buddy

6518
03:02:21,970 --> 03:02:22,803
first and second.

6519
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:25,240
[inaudible] a nice straight left hand.

6520
03:02:25,510 --> 03:02:25,881
Let me look.

6521
03:02:25,881 --> 03:02:29,260
Cause Sarah is a lucid to the head.

6522
03:02:30,010 --> 03:02:30,843
That was beautiful.

6523
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:32,710
He's not touching.

6524
03:02:32,711 --> 03:02:33,830
He's not really hitting cause he was.

6525
03:02:33,831 --> 03:02:34,080
Look at it.

6526
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:34,780
Boom.

6527
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:35,613
Hit him there man.

6528
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:36,191
Boom them.

6529
03:02:36,191 --> 03:02:37,024
They're a little bit,

6530
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:38,500
a little bit cut up right there.

6531
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:39,333
It's cut.

6532
03:02:39,690 --> 03:02:40,520
Cut.

6533
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:41,230
Brian.

6534
03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:46,230
That was one highlight from a more than
a minute of ground and power when he was

6535
03:02:47,801 --> 03:02:48,634
on top.

6536
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:49,480
No big deals.

6537
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:50,320
It's more than a minute.

6538
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:52,860
Two minutes probably.

6539
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:53,853
I guess.

6540
03:02:54,490 --> 03:02:56,890
I'm not exactly sure how much time
and weapons around two minutes,

6541
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:59,830
but he beat him up on the
ground for at least a minute.

6542
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:00,280
Beat up.

6543
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:01,780
Beat him up as a strong,

6544
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:02,813
a strong statement.

6545
03:03:03,160 --> 03:03:03,791
It's a strong,

6546
03:03:03,791 --> 03:03:04,980
you're strong.

6547
03:03:04,981 --> 03:03:07,870
You're being strong and
you're being a little strong.

6548
03:03:07,940 --> 03:03:09,260
That beautiful round kick their butts.

6549
03:03:09,310 --> 03:03:09,551
It gets,

6550
03:03:09,551 --> 03:03:11,080
has he whips it man.

6551
03:03:11,540 --> 03:03:12,373
Fucking weapon.

6552
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:13,720
Look at it.

6553
03:03:13,720 --> 03:03:15,460
Oh he's so quick.

6554
03:03:15,461 --> 03:03:17,470
Look and see what he's doing when
he's ducking his head like that.

6555
03:03:17,471 --> 03:03:18,304
It's interesting.

6556
03:03:18,310 --> 03:03:19,870
I haven't seen a lot of
people throw writes that way.

6557
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:23,500
He's obviously like super fit because
he's recovered from that grappling.

6558
03:03:23,740 --> 03:03:24,840
Keeps the next round.

6559
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:25,733
Yeah.

6560
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:27,560
Super feminist values.

6561
03:03:28,270 --> 03:03:28,361
Oh,

6562
03:03:28,361 --> 03:03:30,150
you have to be a cardio machine.

6563
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:30,970
Have to be.

6564
03:03:30,970 --> 03:03:31,331
Yeah,

6565
03:03:31,331 --> 03:03:34,300
you have to be so ready to
explode for five rounds.

6566
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,620
But he's connecting.

6567
03:03:35,630 --> 03:03:38,750
I would love to talk to him about
like what kind of protocol he follows.

6568
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:42,880
Like for strength and conditioning
because he's like all this is so fast.

6569
03:03:43,060 --> 03:03:46,390
Like he's relying like a lot of his
moves are like countermoves and like,

6570
03:03:46,630 --> 03:03:49,180
oh his angles though.

6571
03:03:49,181 --> 03:03:50,200
He keeps catching.

6572
03:03:50,210 --> 03:03:51,130
It's really interesting.

6573
03:03:51,640 --> 03:03:52,990
Well they both have really good angles,

6574
03:03:52,991 --> 03:03:53,560
man.

6575
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:54,131
I'm telling you.

6576
03:03:54,131 --> 03:03:55,120
Cause Sarah's you,

6577
03:03:55,140 --> 03:03:57,760
you like you're looking at
that Afro and you're going,

6578
03:03:57,770 --> 03:03:58,130
this guy's

6579
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:58,670
silly.

6580
03:03:58,670 --> 03:04:00,520
I'm not a bad mother.

6581
03:04:00,521 --> 03:04:02,510
Fucking amazing athlete
and a great fighter.

6582
03:04:02,511 --> 03:04:04,750
It's just to sleep better.

6583
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:06,930
He's also a really cool
looking at this stuff,

6584
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:08,233
Alex to Sarah.

6585
03:04:08,380 --> 03:04:10,130
I'm not cool being in any way.

6586
03:04:10,490 --> 03:04:14,420
I don't think I'm being in any way as
one of the nicest friendliest dudes.

6587
03:04:14,770 --> 03:04:15,380
And he's,

6588
03:04:15,380 --> 03:04:17,570
I love watching them like
dance on the way to the,

6589
03:04:17,750 --> 03:04:18,640
to his fights too.

6590
03:04:18,650 --> 03:04:21,490
Cause I loved when he come out and
when he came on the Bruce Lee jumpsuit,

6591
03:04:21,890 --> 03:04:22,750
the yellow and black,

6592
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:23,750
this shit was so sick.

6593
03:04:24,030 --> 03:04:26,400
He looks he was going to struggle.

6594
03:04:27,530 --> 03:04:28,041
It's awesome.

6595
03:04:28,041 --> 03:04:29,150
When you guys talk over each other,

6596
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:32,313
look at that.

6597
03:04:37,180 --> 03:04:38,013
Aye.

6598
03:04:38,230 --> 03:04:39,340
The count.

6599
03:04:40,060 --> 03:04:40,440
I mean,

6600
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:41,000
uh,

6601
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,820
rhetoric is landed a lot more shots,

6602
03:04:42,821 --> 03:04:44,820
but Sarah's is sell tough.

6603
03:04:45,540 --> 03:04:45,880
Whoa.

6604
03:04:45,880 --> 03:04:48,790
Was that done an assessment?

6605
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:53,250
Is this 55 you're only comfortable if no
one's talking about it just feels weird

6606
03:04:53,251 --> 03:04:53,951
when no one's talking,

6607
03:04:53,951 --> 03:04:54,450
right?

6608
03:04:54,450 --> 03:04:54,670
Yeah.

6609
03:04:54,670 --> 03:04:55,503
Here is,

6610
03:04:55,570 --> 03:04:57,820
he's so good on the outside,

6611
03:04:57,850 --> 03:04:58,611
but because Sarah,

6612
03:04:58,611 --> 03:05:01,750
it has an excellent idea
of distance where if,

6613
03:05:01,810 --> 03:05:02,111
you know,

6614
03:05:02,111 --> 03:05:05,260
he's connecting like when he's
moving forward in particular,

6615
03:05:05,470 --> 03:05:08,610
but because Sarah's is able to
avoid a lot of the shit that y'all,

6616
03:05:08,620 --> 03:05:09,550
you're throwing it bro.

6617
03:05:09,580 --> 03:05:11,650
I can't get fried chickens out of my mind.

6618
03:05:11,770 --> 03:05:12,430
I love it.

6619
03:05:12,430 --> 03:05:13,263
Love Fried Shit.

6620
03:05:13,990 --> 03:05:17,230
It's one of the problems with going
kio someone have kido fried chicken.

6621
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:17,930
Oh,

6622
03:05:17,930 --> 03:05:20,320
can't you do it with
like a damn delicious?

6623
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:21,791
Well,

6624
03:05:21,791 --> 03:05:22,240
you could,

6625
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:25,360
we could what we could do you
get chickens ripped the skin off.

6626
03:05:25,450 --> 03:05:25,870
Listen,

6627
03:05:25,870 --> 03:05:26,890
it doesn't have to be fried.

6628
03:05:26,890 --> 03:05:29,080
Let me tell you something
about this fucking place.

6629
03:05:29,081 --> 03:05:32,200
This Cuban joint in Encino,

6630
03:05:32,201 --> 03:05:32,920
California,

6631
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:33,753
was it called?

6632
03:05:33,880 --> 03:05:34,451
Oh my God.

6633
03:05:34,451 --> 03:05:35,560
What does that joint called?

6634
03:05:35,640 --> 03:05:38,710
It was a place on Versailles
to Versailles is everywhere.

6635
03:05:39,590 --> 03:05:40,240
They're in Venice.

6636
03:05:40,240 --> 03:05:40,711
I know there's a,

6637
03:05:40,711 --> 03:05:41,544
there's a couple of them.

6638
03:05:41,770 --> 03:05:42,700
I've only been to one.

6639
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:43,833
I've been to the one,

6640
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:44,741
oh my God,

6641
03:05:44,741 --> 03:05:45,520
the chicken there.

6642
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,410
But they have this garlic
checking with onions.

6643
03:05:47,530 --> 03:05:48,880
Holy Shit Dude.

6644
03:05:48,910 --> 03:05:49,410
It's Quito.

6645
03:05:49,410 --> 03:05:50,243
Holy Shit.

6646
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:51,233
No,

6647
03:05:51,580 --> 03:05:52,380
I'm sure it's not.

6648
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:52,660
It might,

6649
03:05:52,660 --> 03:05:52,950
it might.

6650
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:53,610
It might be.

6651
03:05:53,610 --> 03:05:54,443
It might be.

6652
03:05:54,570 --> 03:05:54,820
Hey,

6653
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:55,690
sugar in the song.

6654
03:05:55,800 --> 03:05:57,130
If it's can't fuck with the beans.

6655
03:05:57,220 --> 03:05:57,821
Fried Chicken.

6656
03:05:57,821 --> 03:05:58,301
Fuck off.

6657
03:05:58,301 --> 03:05:59,081
It's not fried.

6658
03:05:59,081 --> 03:05:59,441
I don't think.

6659
03:05:59,441 --> 03:06:00,320
I think it's broiled.

6660
03:06:00,470 --> 03:06:00,760
Ever.

6661
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:02,380
Eat the fried chicken and fuck off.

6662
03:06:02,381 --> 03:06:03,041
I'm telling you,

6663
03:06:03,041 --> 03:06:08,041
these Cubans are masters of the chicken
watering their masters of this lemon

6664
03:06:09,551 --> 03:06:11,110
garlic chicken with onions,

6665
03:06:12,590 --> 03:06:13,240
onions.

6666
03:06:13,240 --> 03:06:14,073
I mean smothering,

6667
03:06:14,260 --> 03:06:15,700
barely seared onions.

6668
03:06:15,700 --> 03:06:16,540
I love a nice son,

6669
03:06:16,541 --> 03:06:16,821
Joe.

6670
03:06:16,821 --> 03:06:18,160
You are you ever gonna not be,

6671
03:06:18,161 --> 03:06:18,440
Kiddo.

6672
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:19,273
Now that you've done it,

6673
03:06:19,750 --> 03:06:20,583
thousands of a calmer.

6674
03:06:20,710 --> 03:06:21,970
I think it's a,

6675
03:06:22,060 --> 03:06:24,730
I think it's very
beneficial for your health.

6676
03:06:24,760 --> 03:06:25,600
Is that it right there?

6677
03:06:26,230 --> 03:06:26,411
Ooh,

6678
03:06:26,411 --> 03:06:27,244
beautiful

6679
03:06:31,030 --> 03:06:32,020
black beans.

6680
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:35,320
I had a yam today and you'll
lead to a black beans as well.

6681
03:06:35,321 --> 03:06:35,981
But you know what,

6682
03:06:35,981 --> 03:06:36,251
man,

6683
03:06:36,251 --> 03:06:36,520
I'm,

6684
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:37,570
I follow.

6685
03:06:37,610 --> 03:06:38,040
You don't,

6686
03:06:38,040 --> 03:06:39,190
then it's Ketogenic.

6687
03:06:39,191 --> 03:06:40,810
I follow the primal.

6688
03:06:41,060 --> 03:06:42,940
Do Rice very little,

6689
03:06:42,941 --> 03:06:43,360
man.

6690
03:06:43,360 --> 03:06:46,150
I just think that your
body should at the most,

6691
03:06:46,590 --> 03:06:46,960
uh,

6692
03:06:46,960 --> 03:06:48,520
get you like a certain amount of car.

6693
03:06:48,521 --> 03:06:50,470
Like some people think
it's 25 grams of sugar.

6694
03:06:50,471 --> 03:06:52,210
They think that's probably
the most important one.

6695
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:53,560
Forget about carbohydrates.

6696
03:06:53,740 --> 03:06:57,390
Like the real important one in terms of
like your own health is never allowing

6697
03:06:57,391 --> 03:06:59,310
yourself to get over 25
grams of sugar a day.

6698
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:00,121
For most people,

6699
03:07:00,121 --> 03:07:02,070
that's not even a single glass of soda.

6700
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:04,460
That's hard for people
to deal with it too.

6701
03:07:05,510 --> 03:07:06,343
That's a big part.

6702
03:07:06,810 --> 03:07:08,160
It's a big part of Mark Sisson's.

6703
03:07:08,180 --> 03:07:08,460
Uh,

6704
03:07:08,460 --> 03:07:09,380
ideas shine.

6705
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:11,670
Kini black beans,

6706
03:07:12,210 --> 03:07:13,050
you can't even money.

6707
03:07:13,560 --> 03:07:13,830
No,

6708
03:07:13,830 --> 03:07:15,000
you're not really supposed to.

6709
03:07:15,150 --> 03:07:16,950
You could fuck around with it a
little bit every now and then,

6710
03:07:16,951 --> 03:07:19,140
but it shouldn't be a primary
on every day you're dying.

6711
03:07:19,380 --> 03:07:19,501
Well,

6712
03:07:19,501 --> 03:07:20,790
you want to do is get your body,

6713
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:23,220
eat comfortable with
eating a lot of Avocados,

6714
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:23,580
fat,

6715
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:24,600
a lot of healthy fats,

6716
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:26,790
coconut oil,

6717
03:07:26,791 --> 03:07:28,680
healthy fats like a mola.

6718
03:07:28,681 --> 03:07:28,921
If you,

6719
03:07:28,921 --> 03:07:29,760
you're getting protein,

6720
03:07:29,761 --> 03:07:31,380
you don't wanna get too much protein.

6721
03:07:31,410 --> 03:07:31,650
You know,

6722
03:07:31,650 --> 03:07:32,940
you want to have a good,

6723
03:07:32,970 --> 03:07:35,220
healthy amount of like
lean animal protein.

6724
03:07:35,820 --> 03:07:37,320
But you guys,

6725
03:07:37,321 --> 03:07:39,480
you guys gotta Watch
this many causes fight.

6726
03:07:39,750 --> 03:07:41,190
You simply have to have to do anything,

6727
03:07:41,191 --> 03:07:41,790
Bro,

6728
03:07:41,790 --> 03:07:44,970
come on at a respect for these
amazing big kid who kid fighters.

6729
03:07:45,090 --> 03:07:45,430
Um,

6730
03:07:45,430 --> 03:07:45,720
uh,

6731
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:47,760
some guy came up to me
at the UFC and said,

6732
03:07:47,761 --> 03:07:48,121
hey man,

6733
03:07:48,121 --> 03:07:48,781
can I get your picture?

6734
03:07:48,781 --> 03:07:49,614
I'm a kito kid.

6735
03:07:49,930 --> 03:07:50,763
I said,

6736
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:53,113
no,

6737
03:07:53,670 --> 03:07:54,503
no,

6738
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:55,040
no.

6739
03:07:55,040 --> 03:07:55,540
Yourself.

6740
03:07:55,540 --> 03:07:56,171
You Fuck,

6741
03:07:56,171 --> 03:07:56,940
you can't,

6742
03:07:56,940 --> 03:07:58,980
can't tell me you're a kito kid and answer

6743
03:08:01,310 --> 03:08:03,100
a bunch of Keto kid a tee shirt.

6744
03:08:03,540 --> 03:08:04,373
Everybody.

6745
03:08:04,530 --> 03:08:05,363
I'm kidding.

6746
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:07,800
It's so funny.

6747
03:08:07,801 --> 03:08:08,010
No,

6748
03:08:08,010 --> 03:08:08,461
he can't.

6749
03:08:08,461 --> 03:08:09,294
So No,

6750
03:08:09,330 --> 03:08:11,570
you're not shut the fuck up.

6751
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:12,993
No,

6752
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:14,193
no,

6753
03:08:14,310 --> 03:08:15,143
no,

6754
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:16,733
no.

6755
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:17,231
I'll do,

6756
03:08:17,231 --> 03:08:18,270
did say that to me.

6757
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:21,160
But I was running back for taking,

6758
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:22,710
I was running back from taking a leak.

6759
03:08:22,711 --> 03:08:23,544
It was in between fights.

6760
03:08:23,890 --> 03:08:26,040
I like the idea of two grams of sugar.

6761
03:08:26,041 --> 03:08:27,060
That's a really good,

6762
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:29,040
how about at our last show?

6763
03:08:29,041 --> 03:08:32,620
I had a old swinger swinger couple
asked me to go back to the hotel.

6764
03:08:33,750 --> 03:08:34,800
They wanted me to sign dick.

6765
03:08:34,801 --> 03:08:36,540
While he watched with his old ass wives.

6766
03:08:36,870 --> 03:08:37,440
Sounds right.

6767
03:08:37,440 --> 03:08:37,891
Your idea,

6768
03:08:37,891 --> 03:08:40,230
if you discuss it with your life
and want to kill yourself soon,

6769
03:08:40,590 --> 03:08:40,861
I said,

6770
03:08:40,861 --> 03:08:41,101
bitch,

6771
03:08:41,101 --> 03:08:42,780
you gotta you gotta you gotta be crazy.

6772
03:08:44,930 --> 03:08:49,930
I just need something really fucking
gross to push me over the edge.

6773
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:53,033
I just see

6774
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:57,833
myself

6775
03:09:00,990 --> 03:09:02,160
as long as you're not

6776
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:05,240
sure yet,

6777
03:09:05,240 --> 03:09:06,220
fuck her in the ass.

6778
03:09:07,870 --> 03:09:09,330
She doesn't share her ass all either.

6779
03:09:09,331 --> 03:09:10,440
She's from the 60s.

6780
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:15,950
[inaudible] over the egg.

6781
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,571
I love these guys.

6782
03:09:18,571 --> 03:09:19,404
These are men.

6783
03:09:19,860 --> 03:09:20,371
Men.

6784
03:09:20,371 --> 03:09:22,860
Brian keeps showing
reverence isn't counter well.

6785
03:09:22,861 --> 03:09:23,920
They're huffy each other,

6786
03:09:23,930 --> 03:09:24,510
man.

6787
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:26,940
These guys are warriors
putting it all out there.

6788
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:27,121
Oh,

6789
03:09:27,121 --> 03:09:28,350
just please shut the fuck up.

6790
03:09:29,410 --> 03:09:30,330
Cachet machine.

6791
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:31,980
There's no,

6792
03:09:31,980 --> 03:09:32,813
Hey,

6793
03:09:33,670 --> 03:09:37,020
these guys are out here in the ring.

6794
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:37,451
Yes,

6795
03:09:37,451 --> 03:09:38,880
Don Gi Joe.

6796
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:40,350
These guys are sweating.

6797
03:09:41,910 --> 03:09:42,960
You call me a cliche.

6798
03:09:43,550 --> 03:09:47,340
You should narrate like a
children's show about war.

6799
03:09:48,570 --> 03:09:50,770
He's never been so into watching.

6800
03:09:51,270 --> 03:09:52,103
These men are all,

6801
03:09:52,140 --> 03:09:53,010
they're all seniors.

6802
03:09:53,150 --> 03:09:55,960
And when the wind warrior,

6803
03:09:55,961 --> 03:09:58,260
me and Sam Sheridan Been
Eric Apple Powerful.

6804
03:09:58,730 --> 03:09:59,670
I like care capital.

6805
03:09:59,810 --> 03:10:00,400
Good Dude.

6806
03:10:00,400 --> 03:10:01,233
He's a good dude.

6807
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:03,700
Sinews tech guys too,

6808
03:10:03,701 --> 03:10:04,420
man.

6809
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:05,253
Eric Capitol.

6810
03:10:05,290 --> 03:10:06,030
Petit's uh,

6811
03:10:06,030 --> 03:10:10,030
his wrist broke so many times I
think I'm going to do this injustice,

6812
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:12,610
but I think they like had to like shorten.

6813
03:10:12,760 --> 03:10:14,010
Like one of his wrists,

6814
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:18,170
he shattered it so badly
and they had told them like,

6815
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:20,500
there's no way you'll
ever be able to punch.

6816
03:10:20,501 --> 03:10:20,831
He's like,

6817
03:10:20,831 --> 03:10:21,031
yeah,

6818
03:10:21,031 --> 03:10:21,461
whatever.

6819
03:10:21,461 --> 03:10:22,920
I'm fighting who's like,

6820
03:10:23,110 --> 03:10:24,430
he fought with this thing and it's,

6821
03:10:24,431 --> 03:10:24,791
but it's,

6822
03:10:24,791 --> 03:10:25,624
it's that apparently

6823
03:10:27,990 --> 03:10:28,960
when we were doing warrior,

6824
03:10:28,961 --> 03:10:32,200
he went and got an extra because his
neck was all fucked up and he broke his

6825
03:10:32,201 --> 03:10:33,034
neck.

6826
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:34,030
She's just crying.

6827
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:34,761
He's like,

6828
03:10:34,761 --> 03:10:35,594
oh my neck broke.

6829
03:10:36,330 --> 03:10:37,001
Complete lie.

6830
03:10:37,001 --> 03:10:38,260
But Jesus Christ,

6831
03:10:38,340 --> 03:10:40,390
I had a chance to hang out
with that dude in England.

6832
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:41,733
He's a good dude.

6833
03:10:41,980 --> 03:10:42,281
When you,

6834
03:10:42,281 --> 03:10:42,540
when you,

6835
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:43,890
when people in the road like Eddie,

6836
03:10:43,900 --> 03:10:44,561
you came with us,

6837
03:10:44,561 --> 03:10:44,861
right?

6838
03:10:44,861 --> 03:10:46,030
Eddie wasn't in England.

6839
03:10:46,031 --> 03:10:47,020
We all hung out together.

6840
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:47,940
Oh Shit.

6841
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:49,870
I'm talking about this
because here it's on the town.

6842
03:10:50,980 --> 03:10:53,770
I don't remember when we all
went out trip from the next,

6843
03:10:53,860 --> 03:10:57,040
I know there were so many
pen cause Sarah's on top.

6844
03:10:57,430 --> 03:10:57,670
Oh,

6845
03:10:57,670 --> 03:11:00,130
Hammer fist here with
Jake is working for leg.

6846
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:01,113
Welcome for the leg.

6847
03:11:01,350 --> 03:11:02,183
Oh,

6848
03:11:02,410 --> 03:11:02,920
he's fine.

6849
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:03,491
Beautiful.

6850
03:11:03,491 --> 03:11:04,270
Beautiful job.

6851
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:05,320
Easing the leg lock.

6852
03:11:06,270 --> 03:11:07,140
Fight this.

6853
03:11:07,150 --> 03:11:07,983
I'm a pot.

6854
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:09,280
Not so good though.

6855
03:11:09,460 --> 03:11:10,420
These guys are using it.

6856
03:11:10,421 --> 03:11:11,080
Maybe it's sweet.

6857
03:11:11,080 --> 03:11:12,010
Get past the right leg.

6858
03:11:12,240 --> 03:11:12,761
Back up to you.

6859
03:11:12,761 --> 03:11:14,140
If you kidding me with this fight.

6860
03:11:14,170 --> 03:11:15,670
Are you kidding me with this fight?

6861
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:16,001
Wow.

6862
03:11:16,001 --> 03:11:16,271
Brian,

6863
03:11:16,271 --> 03:11:18,590
you really nailed it and I ain't no

6864
03:11:21,490 --> 03:11:23,320
fucking here's turbo.

6865
03:11:23,330 --> 03:11:24,370
Whoa.

6866
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:34,120
Hold on a timeout guys.

6867
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:35,681
We've got a time.

6868
03:11:35,681 --> 03:11:36,170
You fucks.

6869
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:37,003
Hold on.

6870
03:11:37,240 --> 03:11:38,100
Any boring fight.

6871
03:11:38,101 --> 03:11:39,450
Brian's going to bring
in another attainment.

6872
03:11:39,660 --> 03:11:41,320
Whoa.

6873
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:42,773
He's perfect.

6874
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:44,870
You're going to turn it
into the play by play guy.

6875
03:11:44,940 --> 03:11:45,380
Not Bad,

6876
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:45,940
right?

6877
03:11:45,940 --> 03:11:47,410
The mark of the Mike Goldberg.

6878
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:49,950
I should be the third guy
in their broken Kohlberg.

6879
03:11:49,960 --> 03:11:50,810
Joe would kill him.

6880
03:11:51,310 --> 03:11:54,130
Don't get a level one guy or
the play by play guy here.

6881
03:11:54,970 --> 03:11:55,571
I think so too,

6882
03:11:55,571 --> 03:11:55,870
buddy.

6883
03:11:55,870 --> 03:11:57,330
You would definitely get your ass kicked.

6884
03:11:58,240 --> 03:11:59,530
Someone's going to beat your ass.

6885
03:12:00,130 --> 03:12:00,720
It's going to be out.

6886
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:01,553
A matter of time.

6887
03:12:02,320 --> 03:12:03,071
I'm going to be like,

6888
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:03,310
doc,

6889
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:04,420
I get me Dad.

6890
03:12:04,421 --> 03:12:06,300
I mean by meet your old bull ring.

6891
03:12:06,600 --> 03:12:07,660
I mean that's what I mean.

6892
03:12:08,780 --> 03:12:10,240
Is that what out of here Brian?

6893
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:13,420
Brian counts and trying to save your life.

6894
03:12:13,421 --> 03:12:13,771
Fuck,

6895
03:12:13,771 --> 03:12:16,300
because some guy's about to
beat the fuck out I and they go,

6896
03:12:16,301 --> 03:12:16,820
Holy Shit.

6897
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:18,140
I was just fundamental dad.

6898
03:12:18,200 --> 03:12:22,390
I've never answered a boxing
buddy that could do you pop.

6899
03:12:22,391 --> 03:12:22,930
Pop is,

6900
03:12:22,930 --> 03:12:23,540
I've never had,

6901
03:12:23,540 --> 03:12:25,920
I've never seen him so
nobody could do gel.

6902
03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:26,320
Right.

6903
03:12:26,320 --> 03:12:26,830
Done.

6904
03:12:26,830 --> 03:12:27,551
It's not that good.

6905
03:12:27,551 --> 03:12:30,490
You're so out there and you're still
pronounced and you've got like such a

6906
03:12:30,491 --> 03:12:30,971
character,

6907
03:12:30,971 --> 03:12:31,804
but nobody could do.

6908
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:33,430
I could take care of
them if I worked at it.

6909
03:12:33,431 --> 03:12:34,264
I could do to,

6910
03:12:34,430 --> 03:12:35,590
let me see you do it right now.

6911
03:12:35,591 --> 03:12:36,424
Brian.

6912
03:12:36,890 --> 03:12:39,730
It's feel super uncomfortable as
big fights going on right now,

6913
03:12:39,731 --> 03:12:40,280
boys.

6914
03:12:40,280 --> 03:12:41,113
Oh yeah.

6915
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:43,540
Oh sweet.

6916
03:12:43,630 --> 03:12:44,280
Deep Sense.

6917
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:48,220
We take crazy crazy punches
to the fuck off bro.

6918
03:12:48,370 --> 03:12:50,370
The Fuck Jay was.

6919
03:12:50,530 --> 03:12:52,220
Imagine if the Afro did actually protect

6920
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:52,890
mine some more.

6921
03:12:52,890 --> 03:12:54,590
[inaudible] don't think it does.

6922
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:56,900
He can't cut his beard.

6923
03:12:56,901 --> 03:13:00,230
Remember that they want Kimberly beer
cause they said guilty and or a punch on

6924
03:13:00,231 --> 03:13:01,040
the chin.

6925
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:02,000
It was cushion it.

6926
03:13:02,030 --> 03:13:02,863
There's an art.

6927
03:13:02,930 --> 03:13:05,480
Roy Nelson is an argument for chokes.

6928
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:06,710
It get does get in the way.

6929
03:13:06,740 --> 03:13:06,921
Yeah.

6930
03:13:06,921 --> 03:13:07,754
I mean sure,

6931
03:13:07,970 --> 03:13:11,270
you try it again and a
little harder to close up.

6932
03:13:11,271 --> 03:13:11,810
Correct.

6933
03:13:11,810 --> 03:13:12,611
But I wonder if that,

6934
03:13:12,611 --> 03:13:14,690
that's a lot of hair that
that would act as question,

6935
03:13:14,691 --> 03:13:15,200
don't you think?

6936
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:16,033
But meanwhile if,

6937
03:13:16,260 --> 03:13:16,710
yeah,

6938
03:13:16,710 --> 03:13:20,720
I mean Kimbo slice had a fucking
magnificent beard though.

6939
03:13:20,810 --> 03:13:21,470
Amazing Beer.

6940
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:21,741
I mean,

6941
03:13:21,741 --> 03:13:22,820
for the sake of the people,

6942
03:13:22,821 --> 03:13:25,880
you've got to let them have that
big asking him to fucking cut.

6943
03:13:26,250 --> 03:13:27,083
Hello.

6944
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:28,790
Look gas in Chuck Norris.

6945
03:13:28,791 --> 03:13:31,250
Shave his mustache as you guys.

6946
03:13:31,300 --> 03:13:31,671
Yeah,

6947
03:13:31,671 --> 03:13:33,740
and look at Alex because
Sarah's coming on strong.

6948
03:13:33,741 --> 03:13:34,081
Solid.

6949
03:13:34,081 --> 03:13:34,761
He's missing,

6950
03:13:34,761 --> 03:13:35,750
but he's awesome.

6951
03:13:36,530 --> 03:13:37,370
Rodriguez.

6952
03:13:37,970 --> 03:13:39,080
Beautiful combination.

6953
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:39,913
They're both guys.

6954
03:13:41,510 --> 03:13:43,970
They are both guys and
this is an amazing fight.

6955
03:13:44,240 --> 03:13:45,620
A couple of men,

6956
03:13:45,980 --> 03:13:47,840
a couple of men who see,

6957
03:13:47,841 --> 03:13:49,250
this is my question about yard,

6958
03:13:49,310 --> 03:13:49,641
right?

6959
03:13:49,641 --> 03:13:50,510
Yahya Rodriguez,

6960
03:13:50,511 --> 03:13:51,344
a style.

6961
03:13:51,560 --> 03:13:53,840
It's almost never been employed.

6962
03:13:53,841 --> 03:13:55,190
Like all these kind of kicks.

6963
03:13:55,220 --> 03:13:59,330
It's almost never been employed
this way for five rounds.

6964
03:14:01,130 --> 03:14:03,470
What's the question he's,

6965
03:14:03,471 --> 03:14:04,221
he's doing,

6966
03:14:04,221 --> 03:14:06,320
he's doing stuff that
takes a lot of energy,

6967
03:14:06,321 --> 03:14:06,740
right?

6968
03:14:06,740 --> 03:14:10,250
A lot of it is jumping and leaping
and it's not a lot of damage though,

6969
03:14:10,251 --> 03:14:10,940
is he?

6970
03:14:10,940 --> 03:14:11,271
Well,

6971
03:14:11,271 --> 03:14:12,530
he's not as damaged guy.

6972
03:14:12,650 --> 03:14:13,880
A really skillful guy.

6973
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:17,420
I mean he did damage to a Andre Fili and
his last fight he knocked him out with

6974
03:14:17,421 --> 03:14:19,230
the jumping jumping round two.

6975
03:14:19,250 --> 03:14:21,230
But before that is two decisions.

6976
03:14:21,570 --> 03:14:21,800
Yeah.

6977
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:23,230
But he's fighting tough guys man.

6978
03:14:23,240 --> 03:14:27,770
I mean if he lands shit dude man shit.

6979
03:14:27,860 --> 03:14:28,221
Wow.

6980
03:14:28,221 --> 03:14:28,951
What a whole life.

6981
03:14:28,951 --> 03:14:29,570
Fuck.

6982
03:14:29,570 --> 03:14:30,050
Wow.

6983
03:14:30,050 --> 03:14:30,621
What a fight.

6984
03:14:30,621 --> 03:14:31,640
What studs.

6985
03:14:31,641 --> 03:14:32,011
Beautiful.

6986
03:14:32,011 --> 03:14:34,730
What studs and that was a great fight.

6987
03:14:34,731 --> 03:14:36,920
Dad Late racisms duds.

6988
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:37,651
Sorry.

6989
03:14:37,651 --> 03:14:38,690
This is a good dude.

6990
03:14:39,170 --> 03:14:39,651
He is.

6991
03:14:39,651 --> 03:14:41,390
But he lost that fight
but he's a great day.

6992
03:14:41,410 --> 03:14:43,730
I'm sure he was definitely
not scoring that fight.

6993
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:45,460
And I know you were.

6994
03:14:45,790 --> 03:14:46,080
No,

6995
03:14:46,080 --> 03:14:46,141
no,

6996
03:14:46,141 --> 03:14:46,210
no,

6997
03:14:46,210 --> 03:14:46,700
no.

6998
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:50,540
There's no question that the only fight
the only round cause here's one was one

6999
03:14:50,690 --> 03:14:54,200
round and that's no disrespect to cause
there's probably shouldn't be talking

7000
03:14:54,201 --> 03:14:54,590
right now.

7001
03:14:54,590 --> 03:14:55,371
No disrespect.

7002
03:14:55,371 --> 03:14:57,380
It's just that Rodrigues is amazing.

7003
03:14:58,220 --> 03:14:59,053
He's amazing.

7004
03:14:59,450 --> 03:15:02,660
God there was at one round that
because Sarah seem to be winning,

7005
03:15:02,661 --> 03:15:03,290
right?

7006
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:03,980
At least.

7007
03:15:03,980 --> 03:15:04,540
Oh for sure.

7008
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:05,373
Yes.

7009
03:15:05,390 --> 03:15:08,240
You could probably get
him to fight you for sure.

7010
03:15:08,270 --> 03:15:08,540
Three,

7011
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:09,140
two.

7012
03:15:09,140 --> 03:15:10,010
I will tell you for sure.

7013
03:15:10,011 --> 03:15:11,320
I definitely wasn't paying attention.

7014
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:12,200
I wouldn't put money,

7015
03:15:12,940 --> 03:15:14,150
put more money on it and me neither.

7016
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:19,580
He listen to you guys I didn't
miss around or a second.

7017
03:15:19,940 --> 03:15:21,740
It is super interesting.

7018
03:15:21,741 --> 03:15:26,741
The concept of adjusting and changing how
fights are scored and the new criteria

7019
03:15:27,951 --> 03:15:28,401
for a 10,

7020
03:15:28,401 --> 03:15:29,090
eight round.

7021
03:15:29,090 --> 03:15:33,770
That could also be a giant new issue
and especially three round fights.

7022
03:15:33,800 --> 03:15:35,590
You're talking about a game changer.

7023
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:37,250
The guy has to get a
finished basically to win.

7024
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:39,170
Well think of those two new moves.

7025
03:15:39,171 --> 03:15:40,790
Just the two new moves that we know.

7026
03:15:41,230 --> 03:15:41,600
The,

7027
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:42,500
the new uh,

7028
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:47,560
hands down position being a like in order
to be where you are off balance or a

7029
03:15:49,201 --> 03:15:53,280
off of a bounce for head
kicks or knees to the ground,

7030
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:55,380
you have to have both hands,

7031
03:15:55,381 --> 03:15:57,300
flat palms flat on the ground.

7032
03:15:57,301 --> 03:15:57,960
Anything else?

7033
03:15:57,960 --> 03:15:58,930
Even the tips of your fingers.

7034
03:15:58,931 --> 03:16:00,210
The guy could punt you in the face,

7035
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:03,510
you know he's saying
remember if like Whoa,

7036
03:16:03,560 --> 03:16:04,700
we got one down.

7037
03:16:04,710 --> 03:16:05,430
You couldn't touch them.

7038
03:16:05,430 --> 03:16:05,850
Yes.

7039
03:16:05,850 --> 03:16:06,870
Now getting remarried.

7040
03:16:06,871 --> 03:16:07,530
They do this,

7041
03:16:07,530 --> 03:16:08,220
they do this thing.

7042
03:16:08,220 --> 03:16:08,460
Yes.

7043
03:16:08,460 --> 03:16:09,810
Now you have to have both down.

7044
03:16:09,960 --> 03:16:11,700
Now we've got one blue one hand,

7045
03:16:11,701 --> 03:16:14,220
I can you in the face like
I can kick you in the face.

7046
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:15,181
Damn,

7047
03:16:15,181 --> 03:16:16,800
that's so cute to changes.

7048
03:16:16,801 --> 03:16:17,940
And then the new change,

7049
03:16:17,941 --> 03:16:20,100
the criteria of how to
score ten eight rounds,

7050
03:16:20,340 --> 03:16:25,340
they're establishing clearer understanding
of what does and does not constitute

7051
03:16:25,351 --> 03:16:26,184
a ten eight round.

7052
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:27,713
And uh,

7053
03:16:27,780 --> 03:16:30,240
I think that's always going to be open to,

7054
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:31,103
uh,

7055
03:16:31,380 --> 03:16:32,280
to people's judgment.

7056
03:16:32,310 --> 03:16:32,830
You know,

7057
03:16:32,830 --> 03:16:36,000
there's always an issue with the subject
kill a motherfucker to get a ten eight

7058
03:16:36,060 --> 03:16:36,721
back in the day.

7059
03:16:36,721 --> 03:16:37,290
Now.

7060
03:16:37,290 --> 03:16:37,771
Yeah.

7061
03:16:37,771 --> 03:16:41,460
I've had some ridiculous conversations
with people about what does and does not

7062
03:16:41,461 --> 03:16:42,570
constitute a 10,

7063
03:16:42,571 --> 03:16:45,840
nine round or extending how
that works in boxing I year one.

7064
03:16:46,470 --> 03:16:46,900
Yeah,

7065
03:16:46,900 --> 03:16:47,700
of course.

7066
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:49,380
Powerful Yahya Richard and powerful.

7067
03:16:49,381 --> 03:16:50,214
Eric's could Sarah's,

7068
03:16:50,430 --> 03:16:50,921
he's a bad mother.

7069
03:16:50,921 --> 03:16:51,754
Motherfucker cray fight.

7070
03:16:51,870 --> 03:16:53,070
Great fight in boxing.

7071
03:16:53,071 --> 03:16:54,630
All you gotta do is knock a guy down.

7072
03:16:54,630 --> 03:16:55,920
And unless you completely like,

7073
03:16:55,921 --> 03:17:00,921
say if a guy like Andre Ward is beaten
your fucking ass all round the ring for

7074
03:17:01,980 --> 03:17:02,813
two minutes,

7075
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:03,930
56 seconds.

7076
03:17:05,100 --> 03:17:05,933
Split decision.

7077
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:06,181
Oh,

7078
03:17:06,181 --> 03:17:07,140
this is one 45.

7079
03:17:07,141 --> 03:17:08,100
One 40 45.

7080
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:08,850
Yeah.

7081
03:17:08,850 --> 03:17:13,140
So if a guy like Andre Ward's beating the
fuck out of you for two minutes and 50

7082
03:17:13,141 --> 03:17:16,800
seconds and then you just close your
eyes and swing and catch him on the Chin

7083
03:17:16,801 --> 03:17:20,160
and he falls down on his ass and he gets
up at the count of eight and they dust

7084
03:17:20,161 --> 03:17:22,530
as gloves off in the round
dance and by ten eight no,

7085
03:17:23,200 --> 03:17:24,180
probably be nine nine.

7086
03:17:24,210 --> 03:17:24,990
Okay.

7087
03:17:24,990 --> 03:17:27,330
But any other circumstance when you are,

7088
03:17:27,331 --> 03:17:30,240
it's a close fight or close
round and the guy gets dropped.

7089
03:17:30,241 --> 03:17:32,070
It's always a ten eight okay.

7090
03:17:32,100 --> 03:17:33,220
It's pretty much established.

7091
03:17:33,221 --> 03:17:37,110
That's a ten eight so we know if we're
watching the fight at home and we know

7092
03:17:37,111 --> 03:17:40,920
like say if a Manny Pacquiao was fighting
some dude and he knocks the dude down

7093
03:17:40,921 --> 03:17:42,740
three times in the first five rounds.

7094
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:43,740
So like that guy's fucked.

7095
03:17:43,741 --> 03:17:44,790
You can't win a decision,

7096
03:17:44,970 --> 03:17:45,660
you can't,

7097
03:17:45,660 --> 03:17:46,560
I mean it can,

7098
03:17:46,561 --> 03:17:48,210
but he'd have to knock Manny down round.

7099
03:17:48,211 --> 03:17:51,180
So if you knock somebody out
in one round that three times,

7100
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:52,830
if knock somebody down
three times in one round,

7101
03:17:52,831 --> 03:17:53,910
what would the score be usually?

7102
03:17:54,060 --> 03:17:54,361
Well,

7103
03:17:54,361 --> 03:17:55,890
it's one point for every knocked down.

7104
03:17:55,891 --> 03:17:57,090
So it's ten eight for one,

7105
03:17:57,091 --> 03:18:01,990
knocked down ten seven for two knock
downs and in most title fights they waive

7106
03:18:01,991 --> 03:18:05,910
the three knockdown rule so he can have
some fucking crazy chaotic shit like

7107
03:18:05,911 --> 03:18:08,100
some ass beating some organizations.

7108
03:18:08,101 --> 03:18:09,590
They waved that three knockdown rule.

7109
03:18:11,050 --> 03:18:13,830
The state in the beginning it
was a no three knockdown rule.

7110
03:18:14,430 --> 03:18:16,290
K One took it to the next level.

7111
03:18:16,291 --> 03:18:18,240
K One had a two knockdown rule.

7112
03:18:18,900 --> 03:18:20,400
If you got knocked out twice in a fight,

7113
03:18:20,401 --> 03:18:23,010
it was over cause they made you
fight like three times a night.

7114
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:23,873
Damn.

7115
03:18:23,890 --> 03:18:24,451
Makes Sense.

7116
03:18:24,451 --> 03:18:25,284
That's sick.

7117
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:25,591
Yeah,

7118
03:18:25,591 --> 03:18:26,424
it makes sense.

7119
03:18:26,760 --> 03:18:28,020
But here magic it fells one.

7120
03:18:28,021 --> 03:18:28,740
Slice the cheese.

7121
03:18:28,740 --> 03:18:29,010
Nope,

7122
03:18:29,010 --> 03:18:31,020
I'm good getting knocked down.

7123
03:18:31,350 --> 03:18:33,240
You eating a pound of
cheese but it's so good.

7124
03:18:33,300 --> 03:18:34,860
I knew you'd love this age provolone.

7125
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:36,720
There's nothing quite
like and my grandfather,

7126
03:18:36,950 --> 03:18:37,950
hundred percent Sicilian.

7127
03:18:38,210 --> 03:18:39,740
I used to have a wheel is a shoe.

7128
03:18:39,910 --> 03:18:40,470
Is this?

7129
03:18:40,470 --> 03:18:41,160
You're for real.

7130
03:18:41,160 --> 03:18:41,993
I'm being dead serious.

7131
03:18:42,770 --> 03:18:43,340
No,

7132
03:18:43,340 --> 03:18:43,620
that's,

7133
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:44,310
it's amazing.

7134
03:18:44,310 --> 03:18:45,960
My grandfather would bring it home.

7135
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:48,370
He'd bring a wheel of aged provolone.

7136
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:50,440
Apologize to Alex Cause Sarah's now

7137
03:18:52,600 --> 03:18:54,190
you said he didn't have any fundamental,

7138
03:18:54,191 --> 03:18:54,650
I didn't.

7139
03:18:54,650 --> 03:18:56,410
I said his fundamentals are not as sound.

7140
03:18:56,420 --> 03:18:56,810
Essentially.

7141
03:18:56,810 --> 03:18:57,643
He said,

7142
03:18:58,900 --> 03:18:59,650
Jamie,

7143
03:18:59,650 --> 03:19:01,720
did he say his fundamentals
aren't very good?

7144
03:19:01,721 --> 03:19:02,020
I don't,

7145
03:19:02,020 --> 03:19:03,670
I honestly don't remember what I said.

7146
03:19:04,060 --> 03:19:08,230
I knew it had something to do with
never said anything about him at all.

7147
03:19:08,231 --> 03:19:08,890
But look at it.

7148
03:19:08,890 --> 03:19:09,580
Go back.

7149
03:19:09,580 --> 03:19:12,230
Take a look at the difference there Brian.

7150
03:19:12,270 --> 03:19:13,390
It was a split decision,

7151
03:19:13,391 --> 03:19:15,970
which means one judge thought
that Kiss Harris did enough.

7152
03:19:16,240 --> 03:19:16,530
Judge,

7153
03:19:16,530 --> 03:19:17,620
you said an idiot.

7154
03:19:17,830 --> 03:19:18,101
Oh,

7155
03:19:18,101 --> 03:19:19,600
I'm not so sure is it's,

7156
03:19:19,610 --> 03:19:22,570
it's no disrespect cause here's he's
fighting an amazing fighter and he did a

7157
03:19:22,571 --> 03:19:23,111
great job,

7158
03:19:23,111 --> 03:19:24,960
but he did get tagged a lot and,

7159
03:19:25,080 --> 03:19:28,180
and we'll give that our boy didn't
get hit much full and that crazy.

7160
03:19:28,181 --> 03:19:29,420
The whole kick does.

7161
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:30,401
I agree with you,

7162
03:19:30,401 --> 03:19:31,121
but he lost the fight.

7163
03:19:31,121 --> 03:19:34,270
I'm just saying you can't tell from
the naked eye that guide and have good

7164
03:19:34,271 --> 03:19:34,751
fundamental,

7165
03:19:34,751 --> 03:19:35,350
I just,

7166
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:36,750
I didn't say you didn't have good funnels.

7167
03:19:36,810 --> 03:19:37,380
You did.

7168
03:19:37,380 --> 03:19:38,213
I do.

7169
03:19:38,410 --> 03:19:40,840
I said you don't remember
what he said is fundamental.

7170
03:19:40,841 --> 03:19:42,400
Are Not as good as say.

7171
03:19:42,401 --> 03:19:43,234
That's first.

7172
03:19:45,130 --> 03:19:45,930
Remember what I said.

7173
03:19:45,930 --> 03:19:48,310
I do think what I meant was let's,

7174
03:19:48,311 --> 03:19:51,100
let's just give you a chance to clarify
right now because this has already been

7175
03:19:51,101 --> 03:19:51,641
principally,

7176
03:19:51,641 --> 03:19:52,270
so here's the,

7177
03:19:52,270 --> 03:19:53,740
here's what I and then a website,

7178
03:19:53,960 --> 03:19:54,611
but here's what I,

7179
03:19:54,611 --> 03:19:55,300
six wheels,

7180
03:19:55,300 --> 03:19:56,133
here's what I say.

7181
03:19:56,380 --> 03:19:58,480
All I was saying when I was watching that,

7182
03:19:58,481 --> 03:19:59,314
as I said,

7183
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:00,100
Huh,

7184
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:02,770
it looks like when Chris
Harris throws the shot,

7185
03:20:02,771 --> 03:20:05,560
he takes it in the face
and Mrs. Rodriguez,

7186
03:20:05,561 --> 03:20:08,470
this is round one and I went and
I saw it three times and I'm like,

7187
03:20:08,890 --> 03:20:09,910
well and then,

7188
03:20:09,940 --> 03:20:13,660
well I'd see Rodrigues throw
shot and when he throws shot,

7189
03:20:13,661 --> 03:20:15,580
he was in a position
where he couldn't get hit.

7190
03:20:15,581 --> 03:20:16,330
And I said,

7191
03:20:16,330 --> 03:20:20,920
that looks like Rodriguez has better
fundamentals then [inaudible] you like

7192
03:20:20,930 --> 03:20:22,560
stand by that 100% who?

7193
03:20:22,660 --> 03:20:26,080
Well well-read version of the
old man at the gas station.

7194
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:26,501
Correct.

7195
03:20:26,501 --> 03:20:27,800
Talks to his other old man.

7196
03:20:29,140 --> 03:20:32,650
We get together and you're like what
he needed to do cause we did wrong.

7197
03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:34,400
This is why you don't understand boxing.

7198
03:20:34,660 --> 03:20:37,540
Got Some Gay Sam guy that
critiques Don Brady stolen motion.

7199
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:38,140
I have to you.

7200
03:20:38,140 --> 03:20:38,580
No,

7201
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:39,700
I do some boxing.

7202
03:20:39,970 --> 03:20:44,220
I obsess over fundamentals and I love
it and I think I'm qualified to at least

7203
03:20:44,380 --> 03:20:46,300
know my naked eye.

7204
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:50,140
Oh my naked actions to professional
Missouri with my naked eye.

7205
03:20:50,141 --> 03:20:51,720
I'm able to quiet sir.

7206
03:20:51,970 --> 03:20:53,000
With my naked eye,

7207
03:20:53,110 --> 03:20:53,890
sir,

7208
03:20:53,890 --> 03:20:54,550
sir,

7209
03:20:54,550 --> 03:20:56,800
if I may with my naked eye,

7210
03:20:56,920 --> 03:21:00,490
I am able to see who is
actually a little better.

7211
03:21:01,170 --> 03:21:02,003
We'll to

7212
03:21:03,340 --> 03:21:04,090
grade you.

7213
03:21:04,090 --> 03:21:06,150
What you said to a t,

7214
03:21:06,151 --> 03:21:09,790
you said Alex doesn't
have any fundamental dude.

7215
03:21:09,791 --> 03:21:13,160
What I'm saying at the end of the
day is that if you look at funny,

7216
03:21:13,161 --> 03:21:14,350
if you have two fighters,

7217
03:21:14,380 --> 03:21:17,410
I think there's a sudden you're not
qualified to judge the two fighters.

7218
03:21:17,440 --> 03:21:20,620
Then I'm able to fucking
look at my fucking arms.

7219
03:21:20,621 --> 03:21:22,330
I'm going to fucking
start doing more curls.

7220
03:21:22,750 --> 03:21:23,230
Listen,

7221
03:21:23,230 --> 03:21:23,470
yeah.

7222
03:21:23,470 --> 03:21:24,310
Years of peace,

7223
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:25,180
no doubt about it.

7224
03:21:25,181 --> 03:21:26,080
But I just,

7225
03:21:26,470 --> 03:21:26,881
I just,

7226
03:21:26,881 --> 03:21:27,330
uh,

7227
03:21:27,330 --> 03:21:30,730
just didn't think you were totally
fair to what could Sarah's brings.

7228
03:21:30,731 --> 03:21:31,810
His life is not fair,

7229
03:21:31,811 --> 03:21:32,560
Joe.

7230
03:21:32,560 --> 03:21:34,330
I just didn't think it
was totally accurate.

7231
03:21:34,360 --> 03:21:35,870
I'm not living in a nursery school.

7232
03:21:35,880 --> 03:21:39,370
I think you've got a little defensive
afterwards and started defending it in

7233
03:21:39,371 --> 03:21:40,320
some sort of a weird way.

7234
03:21:41,350 --> 03:21:41,711
Guys.

7235
03:21:41,711 --> 03:21:42,850
I know had a good case,

7236
03:21:42,851 --> 03:21:43,330
comfortable.

7237
03:21:43,330 --> 03:21:44,081
I really listen to,

7238
03:21:44,081 --> 03:21:44,651
ultimately,

7239
03:21:44,651 --> 03:21:46,010
you can walk with this fairly

7240
03:21:46,010 --> 03:21:47,630
unscaved because yeah,

7241
03:21:47,631 --> 03:21:49,430
you're Rodriguez want a split decision,

7242
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:50,361
so it's all good.

7243
03:21:50,361 --> 03:21:53,220
But they're both beasts based.

7244
03:21:55,880 --> 03:21:56,950
Sarah Rodriguez,

7245
03:21:56,960 --> 03:21:58,010
he's only three,

7246
03:21:58,011 --> 03:22:00,630
so 23 five and on the UFC,

7247
03:22:00,631 --> 03:22:01,310
he's so good.

7248
03:22:01,310 --> 03:22:02,930
He threw up on my holy shit.

7249
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:04,610
He threw up on me once.

7250
03:22:05,070 --> 03:22:05,903
It wasn't his fault.

7251
03:22:05,930 --> 03:22:06,171
I mean,

7252
03:22:06,171 --> 03:22:07,700
it just took some of it got on my shoes.

7253
03:22:07,970 --> 03:22:09,110
He threw up on himself.

7254
03:22:09,111 --> 03:22:11,270
He like actually threw up underneath his,

7255
03:22:11,271 --> 03:22:11,510
uh,

7256
03:22:11,510 --> 03:22:11,990
shirt.

7257
03:22:11,990 --> 03:22:13,850
It was one of his fights
at a brutal fight.

7258
03:22:14,180 --> 03:22:16,280
And a while I was talking to
him while I was interviewing me.

7259
03:22:16,281 --> 03:22:17,630
He threw up Jesus Christ.

7260
03:22:18,410 --> 03:22:18,621
Hey,

7261
03:22:18,621 --> 03:22:21,050
you should be ashamed of himself to you.

7262
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:23,540
He knows what judge gave off right now.

7263
03:22:23,541 --> 03:22:24,081
I'm honored.

7264
03:22:24,081 --> 03:22:24,600
I'm honored.

7265
03:22:24,600 --> 03:22:25,920
[inaudible] Gigas you know,

7266
03:22:25,940 --> 03:22:28,550
one judge gave her all three
rounds an hour to look at that.

7267
03:22:28,551 --> 03:22:29,900
46 49 for Alex.

7268
03:22:29,901 --> 03:22:30,890
I might've changed his story.

7269
03:22:30,891 --> 03:22:34,040
He might've like throw like a particle
might've landed on my foot and now all of

7270
03:22:34,041 --> 03:22:35,390
a sudden I'm like,

7271
03:22:35,391 --> 03:22:36,224
he threw up on me.

7272
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:37,041
He doused.

7273
03:22:37,041 --> 03:22:38,390
You still counts,

7274
03:22:38,570 --> 03:22:38,810
Bro.

7275
03:22:38,810 --> 03:22:41,540
It was like that fucking blueberry pie
eating contest from that Stephen King

7276
03:22:41,541 --> 03:22:42,320
movie.

7277
03:22:42,320 --> 03:22:44,940
Stand by me back.

7278
03:22:45,050 --> 03:22:45,561
Remember that?

7279
03:22:45,561 --> 03:22:46,130
Lard ass.

7280
03:22:46,130 --> 03:22:46,411
Yeah.

7281
03:22:46,411 --> 03:22:49,040
That's my real hard ass lard ass.

7282
03:22:49,130 --> 03:22:50,390
That was a fucking awesome movie.

7283
03:22:51,240 --> 03:22:52,040
You know.

7284
03:22:52,040 --> 03:22:53,410
I wish they would recreate it.

7285
03:22:53,870 --> 03:22:54,250
It,

7286
03:22:54,250 --> 03:22:55,083
yeah.

7287
03:22:55,720 --> 03:22:57,690
I think they were saying that they
were going to do something like that.

7288
03:22:57,760 --> 03:23:00,830
Marie daily could is redoing the haylage.

7289
03:23:00,840 --> 03:23:00,981
No,

7290
03:23:00,981 --> 03:23:01,814
that's so good.

7291
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:03,470
Are they really any McBride's in it?

7292
03:23:03,590 --> 03:23:03,951
Ooh,

7293
03:23:03,951 --> 03:23:04,784
I love it.

7294
03:23:05,260 --> 03:23:05,961
That's it.

7295
03:23:05,961 --> 03:23:06,540
He's good.

7296
03:23:06,540 --> 03:23:06,920
He's,

7297
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:07,690
I love him.

7298
03:23:07,690 --> 03:23:07,840
Oh,

7299
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:08,750
it's cause Sarah's,

7300
03:23:09,050 --> 03:23:11,180
this is a fucking fun
fight to watch highlights.

7301
03:23:11,260 --> 03:23:13,190
It is when we're not trying to calm,

7302
03:23:13,191 --> 03:23:13,520
calm,

7303
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:14,353
calm down.

7304
03:23:15,790 --> 03:23:16,270
Beautiful.

7305
03:23:16,270 --> 03:23:16,390
Yeah.

7306
03:23:16,390 --> 03:23:21,240
It's called a spinning of that format
and that's the last month of the funny

7307
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:22,190
shit.

7308
03:23:22,190 --> 03:23:23,480
That's the last move of the fight,

7309
03:23:23,481 --> 03:23:23,901
by the way.

7310
03:23:23,901 --> 03:23:25,250
That's the same division.

7311
03:23:25,430 --> 03:23:28,270
How crazy would it that fight
be Connor Mcgregor player?

7312
03:23:28,270 --> 03:23:28,970
Rodriguez?

7313
03:23:28,970 --> 03:23:29,803
Not right now

7314
03:23:31,190 --> 03:23:32,390
to build up too though,

7315
03:23:32,480 --> 03:23:33,000
for sure.

7316
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:36,770
Smart thing to build up
to a year is 23 years old.

7317
03:23:36,800 --> 03:23:37,221
Wow.

7318
03:23:37,221 --> 03:23:39,220
Kid isn't even close to his prime.

7319
03:23:39,230 --> 03:23:40,370
I make a call right now.

7320
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:41,051
You're looking at,

7321
03:23:41,051 --> 03:23:41,884
please don't,

7322
03:23:41,930 --> 03:23:43,670
please don't put that division.

7323
03:23:43,671 --> 03:23:44,211
No Shit.

7324
03:23:44,211 --> 03:23:45,730
He's 23 amazing.

7325
03:23:45,740 --> 03:23:46,040
I made,

7326
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:46,731
that's my call.

7327
03:23:46,731 --> 03:23:48,530
Everybody while you're going down,

7328
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:50,060
it is highly possible.

7329
03:23:50,630 --> 03:23:53,510
Highly possible that at one point in his
career he could hold the title though.

7330
03:23:53,511 --> 03:23:54,310
I'll tell you why.

7331
03:23:54,310 --> 03:23:56,540
I have a guy that talented at 23.

7332
03:23:56,630 --> 03:23:57,530
It's fucking nuts.

7333
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:58,151
That's crazy.

7334
03:23:58,151 --> 03:23:58,490
So,

7335
03:23:58,490 --> 03:23:59,300
so good.

7336
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:00,140
And like,

7337
03:24:00,141 --> 03:24:01,340
have you ever seen him hit the pads?

7338
03:24:01,550 --> 03:24:05,390
She really kind of interesting because
he does all that shit like as a regular

7339
03:24:05,391 --> 03:24:06,260
part of his training.

7340
03:24:06,470 --> 03:24:06,860
You're like,

7341
03:24:06,860 --> 03:24:07,041
you know,

7342
03:24:07,041 --> 03:24:08,960
a lot of guys will throw kicks like one,

7343
03:24:08,961 --> 03:24:09,771
two left hook,

7344
03:24:09,771 --> 03:24:10,760
right leg kick left.

7345
03:24:10,761 --> 03:24:11,530
Took Ruffin,

7346
03:24:11,530 --> 03:24:11,810
right?

7347
03:24:11,810 --> 03:24:12,531
Bodytech yeah,

7348
03:24:12,531 --> 03:24:13,364
nothing fancy.

7349
03:24:13,400 --> 03:24:16,910
And that's like the majority
of the training when Yair
Rodriguez does pad work,

7350
03:24:16,911 --> 03:24:17,840
it's like Jab,

7351
03:24:17,841 --> 03:24:22,460
we'll kick jab three 60
roundhouse kick his flying knee.

7352
03:24:22,520 --> 03:24:23,330
Oh yeah,

7353
03:24:23,330 --> 03:24:23,620
dude.

7354
03:24:23,620 --> 03:24:25,850
His videos online of him,

7355
03:24:25,851 --> 03:24:26,240
uh,

7356
03:24:26,240 --> 03:24:30,740
at a gym doing pad work or
super super trust three.

7357
03:24:30,741 --> 03:24:31,574
That's not,

7358
03:24:31,610 --> 03:24:32,271
but I'll tell you what,

7359
03:24:32,271 --> 03:24:32,740
man,

7360
03:24:32,740 --> 03:24:33,070
I'm a,

7361
03:24:33,070 --> 03:24:35,120
I'm still a believer in
Aleks because Sarah's,

7362
03:24:35,121 --> 03:24:36,440
I'm a big fan of the chippy.

7363
03:24:36,860 --> 03:24:38,000
I've been saying that from day one.

7364
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:39,000
I was trying,

7365
03:24:39,780 --> 03:24:40,410
he has,

7366
03:24:40,410 --> 03:24:40,690
I mean,

7367
03:24:40,690 --> 03:24:40,970
he is,

7368
03:24:40,970 --> 03:24:41,840
oh my God.

7369
03:24:41,960 --> 03:24:45,320
What the flu is that it was like,

7370
03:24:45,330 --> 03:24:46,163
just see

7371
03:24:47,890 --> 03:24:48,330
Brian,

7372
03:24:48,330 --> 03:24:48,930
you,

7373
03:24:48,930 --> 03:24:49,380
Brendan,

7374
03:24:49,380 --> 03:24:50,600
whether you have your,

7375
03:24:50,601 --> 03:24:50,721
uh,

7376
03:24:50,721 --> 03:24:52,800
your finger on the pulse
of American pop culture.

7377
03:24:52,870 --> 03:24:53,081
Yes,

7378
03:24:53,081 --> 03:24:53,880
he does.

7379
03:24:53,880 --> 03:24:54,121
Yes,

7380
03:24:54,121 --> 03:24:54,541
he does.

7381
03:24:54,541 --> 03:24:54,881
Bristol Bay.

7382
03:24:54,881 --> 03:24:56,710
When it's time for a new it and Bam.

7383
03:24:57,660 --> 03:24:58,980
You did it totally independently.

7384
03:24:59,010 --> 03:24:59,701
I did.

7385
03:24:59,701 --> 03:25:01,100
And Colonel Sandals.

7386
03:25:02,950 --> 03:25:03,930
Turtle Sandals.

7387
03:25:05,010 --> 03:25:06,260
Black girl Sanders,

7388
03:25:06,261 --> 03:25:07,120
her sandals.

7389
03:25:07,430 --> 03:25:09,390
Turtle sandals out to be a rumor though.

7390
03:25:09,660 --> 03:25:10,411
Oh yeah,

7391
03:25:10,411 --> 03:25:11,130
that's bullshit.

7392
03:25:11,130 --> 03:25:11,670
Yeah.

7393
03:25:11,670 --> 03:25:12,503
They need a Bloomberg.

7394
03:25:12,710 --> 03:25:13,390
It's probably real.

7395
03:25:13,390 --> 03:25:14,440
W W was a room,

7396
03:25:14,441 --> 03:25:15,480
but then he started himself though,

7397
03:25:15,481 --> 03:25:15,860
right?

7398
03:25:15,860 --> 03:25:16,693
Yeah.

7399
03:25:16,740 --> 03:25:17,370
It was just,

7400
03:25:17,370 --> 03:25:18,151
he was just having fun.

7401
03:25:18,151 --> 03:25:19,050
That's some bullshit.

7402
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:21,390
They should do it.

7403
03:25:21,390 --> 03:25:22,100
They should,

7404
03:25:22,100 --> 03:25:22,933
if they were smart,

7405
03:25:23,250 --> 03:25:24,810
they should get George Wallace to do it.

7406
03:25:24,990 --> 03:25:25,551
And the shift,

7407
03:25:25,551 --> 03:25:26,384
Dave Chappelle it,

7408
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:31,380
that would be good to Chris rock and
Dave Chappelle would be willing to do it.

7409
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:31,970
Well,

7410
03:25:31,970 --> 03:25:33,300
you got to do it just
cause you love chicken.

7411
03:25:34,140 --> 03:25:35,820
I don't think it's that
hard to get chicken.

7412
03:25:36,590 --> 03:25:36,741
Well,

7413
03:25:36,741 --> 03:25:38,740
I'm going to have to act when
you're a multimillionaire.

7414
03:25:38,760 --> 03:25:39,410
If you want chicken,

7415
03:25:39,410 --> 03:25:40,710
I'm saying you let them fuck.

7416
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:40,951
No,

7417
03:25:40,951 --> 03:25:41,101
no,

7418
03:25:41,101 --> 03:25:41,251
no.

7419
03:25:41,251 --> 03:25:42,960
I'm not thinking of photos to get chicken.

7420
03:25:44,840 --> 03:25:45,450
Dammit.

7421
03:25:45,450 --> 03:25:46,910
You love the chicken so much.

7422
03:25:46,911 --> 03:25:48,030
I don't care about the money.

7423
03:25:48,031 --> 03:25:49,110
So he's doing the commercial.

7424
03:25:49,110 --> 03:25:51,540
That's rare ground foul taste.

7425
03:25:51,541 --> 03:25:52,800
Just like chicken.

7426
03:25:52,860 --> 03:25:54,810
I like your a attempt at recovery.

7427
03:25:54,811 --> 03:25:56,170
I liked what he tried to do there.

7428
03:25:57,420 --> 03:25:58,980
Of course they can afford chicken.

7429
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:01,530
Michael Bisping looked very
fucking well tailored fighting.

7430
03:26:01,560 --> 03:26:04,790
Dan Handles and it's true
and it's got to fix that.

7431
03:26:04,791 --> 03:26:04,951
I,

7432
03:26:04,951 --> 03:26:06,750
that's going to be huge to come on.

7433
03:26:06,810 --> 03:26:07,710
Is it going to be huge?

7434
03:26:07,890 --> 03:26:09,060
Are you kidding me?

7435
03:26:09,240 --> 03:26:10,470
After that first fight,

7436
03:26:10,860 --> 03:26:11,970
what this means.

7437
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:14,160
This is a fucking crazy.

7438
03:26:14,200 --> 03:26:19,200
I imagine when they're about willing to
watch this Michael Bisbing about to go

7439
03:26:19,890 --> 03:26:20,640
again,

7440
03:26:20,640 --> 03:26:20,911
dude.

7441
03:26:20,911 --> 03:26:25,911
It's going to be fucking enhance
these retiring be barriers,

7442
03:26:26,980 --> 03:26:27,900
legendary,

7443
03:26:27,960 --> 03:26:28,793
epic,

7444
03:26:28,830 --> 03:26:29,700
Iconic Shit,

7445
03:26:29,701 --> 03:26:30,060
right?

7446
03:26:30,060 --> 03:26:30,181
Oh,

7447
03:26:30,181 --> 03:26:31,230
I'm a growth guys.

7448
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:34,980
I love this idea of a title fight.

7449
03:26:34,981 --> 03:26:36,870
I think that's one of the
beautiful things about the UFC,

7450
03:26:36,871 --> 03:26:38,520
being able to make crazy fights like this.

7451
03:26:38,940 --> 03:26:39,930
Dan Henderson was like,

7452
03:26:39,931 --> 03:26:40,141
you know,

7453
03:26:40,141 --> 03:26:41,040
I'm probably done.

7454
03:26:41,041 --> 03:26:41,520
I don't know me.

7455
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:43,540
I would fight for the title and

7456
03:26:45,110 --> 03:26:50,110
he's the first fighter ever to hold
two consecutive titles in two different

7457
03:26:51,211 --> 03:26:52,440
weight classes in pride.

7458
03:26:52,650 --> 03:26:53,640
Never got the UFC.

7459
03:26:53,641 --> 03:26:54,930
One man's never got the UFC one,

7460
03:26:54,931 --> 03:26:55,291
but if he,

7461
03:26:55,291 --> 03:26:57,000
if he gets it with this and then retires,

7462
03:26:57,090 --> 03:26:58,110
oh my God,

7463
03:26:58,170 --> 03:26:58,621
it goes down.

7464
03:26:58,621 --> 03:26:59,311
Pound for pound.

7465
03:26:59,311 --> 03:27:00,170
One of the best ever.

7466
03:27:00,220 --> 03:27:05,220
He's already in the running right as
like 10 forget about like numerically,

7467
03:27:05,611 --> 03:27:06,780
like who's more valuable?

7468
03:27:06,781 --> 03:27:11,400
Who accomplished more just
straight up hall of fame legends.

7469
03:27:11,610 --> 03:27:13,830
Who's more legendary than Dan Henderson?

7470
03:27:13,840 --> 03:27:14,673
Randek door,

7471
03:27:15,030 --> 03:27:16,080
maybe a day inhaler.

7472
03:27:17,490 --> 03:27:18,323
He's right up there.

7473
03:27:18,450 --> 03:27:22,380
Randy gets a bit more
because Randy won the UFC,

7474
03:27:22,410 --> 03:27:22,860
correct.

7475
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:23,760
Heavyweight title.

7476
03:27:23,761 --> 03:27:25,770
He won the UFC light heavyweight title,

7477
03:27:25,890 --> 03:27:27,180
but at the time when Randy did,

7478
03:27:27,181 --> 03:27:28,800
when the light heavyweight title I,

7479
03:27:28,801 --> 03:27:29,300
I would,

7480
03:27:29,300 --> 03:27:32,190
I would say it's more impressive with
Dan Henderson was doing in pride.

7481
03:27:32,760 --> 03:27:33,960
The guys who was beating,

7482
03:27:34,180 --> 03:27:35,760
it's the drug testing.

7483
03:27:35,910 --> 03:27:36,330
Yeah.

7484
03:27:36,330 --> 03:27:37,190
Maybe his,

7485
03:27:37,191 --> 03:27:37,891
his weight,

7486
03:27:37,891 --> 03:27:38,490
his height.

7487
03:27:38,490 --> 03:27:38,910
It's great.

7488
03:27:38,910 --> 03:27:40,830
One Randy coture knocked down Tim,

7489
03:27:41,770 --> 03:27:44,170
he's outweighed by like 50 pounds.

7490
03:27:44,200 --> 03:27:46,450
He drops Tim Sylvia with a fake,

7491
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:46,840
uh,

7492
03:27:46,840 --> 03:27:50,770
inside leg kick and a bomb of overhand
right saint punched by the way that

7493
03:27:50,771 --> 03:27:52,880
Henderson used when he
fought Bisbing boat.

7494
03:27:52,970 --> 03:27:57,190
Remember when he beat the brakes
off Gonzaga Gonzaga Brennan choppy.

7495
03:27:57,570 --> 03:28:02,080
He beat can taco concise and he beat
him with ed cocoa farm memory broke.

7496
03:28:02,081 --> 03:28:02,531
Randy's,

7497
03:28:02,531 --> 03:28:05,350
our rain was beating him
with his fucking broken arm.

7498
03:28:05,920 --> 03:28:08,440
And then remember when Randy and I said,

7499
03:28:08,441 --> 03:28:08,621
oh,

7500
03:28:08,621 --> 03:28:09,370
Captain America.

7501
03:28:09,370 --> 03:28:09,770
Cool.

7502
03:28:09,770 --> 03:28:11,070
Can I douche tooth?

7503
03:28:12,430 --> 03:28:13,820
That was the end of the row.

7504
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:15,610
[inaudible] last fight.

7505
03:28:15,611 --> 03:28:16,540
You don't have to bring that up.

7506
03:28:16,570 --> 03:28:16,751
Well,

7507
03:28:16,751 --> 03:28:16,931
no,

7508
03:28:16,931 --> 03:28:18,940
I'm just fighting to bring
everybody to bring that out,

7509
03:28:18,941 --> 03:28:19,540
bro.

7510
03:28:19,540 --> 03:28:20,340
Why you gotta bring that up?

7511
03:28:20,340 --> 03:28:21,280
You know what's amazing?

7512
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:23,200
I was not disrespectful.

7513
03:28:23,210 --> 03:28:26,180
You are these fighters first and
second fight in the UFC right there.

7514
03:28:26,230 --> 03:28:27,240
I was doing the backstage.

7515
03:28:28,470 --> 03:28:29,260
You and I,

7516
03:28:29,260 --> 03:28:29,940
you are not there.

7517
03:28:29,940 --> 03:28:30,121
We,

7518
03:28:30,121 --> 03:28:34,170
you and I went to the fight between
Randy couture when he beat Vito Belfort.

7519
03:28:34,540 --> 03:28:36,460
We thought Vittorio was
going to kill everybody.

7520
03:28:36,910 --> 03:28:37,743
Remember that?

7521
03:28:38,300 --> 03:28:40,160
I was powerful.

7522
03:28:40,200 --> 03:28:41,033
Veto power.

7523
03:28:41,370 --> 03:28:46,370
Papa Joe and I flew down to baton
rouge or somewhere like that.

7524
03:28:46,990 --> 03:28:47,141
Well,

7525
03:28:47,141 --> 03:28:48,820
Vito was so big,

7526
03:28:48,821 --> 03:28:49,151
man.

7527
03:28:49,151 --> 03:28:51,130
He was like two 40 back then,

7528
03:28:51,370 --> 03:28:52,600
and I'm not exaggerating,

7529
03:28:53,020 --> 03:28:54,520
he looked like a lion.

7530
03:28:54,550 --> 03:28:54,910
Jamie,

7531
03:28:54,910 --> 03:28:55,590
he's crazy.

7532
03:28:55,590 --> 03:28:57,040
But the Vito Belfort,

7533
03:28:57,041 --> 03:28:59,120
Randy couture's traps,

7534
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:00,790
he punched like frank the tank.

7535
03:29:01,480 --> 03:29:02,890
He looked like bluedot from,

7536
03:29:03,010 --> 03:29:03,670
from Papa.

7537
03:29:03,670 --> 03:29:03,900
Well,

7538
03:29:03,900 --> 03:29:07,420
Eddie and I worked with Eddie and I
used to work out with his trainer,

7539
03:29:07,810 --> 03:29:08,890
which worked out with this dude.

7540
03:29:08,891 --> 03:29:10,330
We used to call them garden hoses.

7541
03:29:10,870 --> 03:29:12,810
You're talking about the
Korean guy who is jazzed?

7542
03:29:12,810 --> 03:29:13,680
Purple is new.

7543
03:29:14,290 --> 03:29:17,440
He was a super nice guy and he a wound up.

7544
03:29:17,470 --> 03:29:18,303
Oh Shit.

7545
03:29:18,580 --> 03:29:18,970
I don't know.

7546
03:29:18,970 --> 03:29:19,803
I don't know what him,

7547
03:29:19,940 --> 03:29:21,490
30 minute real young.

7548
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:22,751
Yeah.

7549
03:29:22,751 --> 03:29:23,584
We don't have to see it.

7550
03:29:23,710 --> 03:29:24,430
Everything.

7551
03:29:24,430 --> 03:29:25,360
Look at the sides of them.

7552
03:29:25,570 --> 03:29:26,440
Jesus Christ.

7553
03:29:26,441 --> 03:29:30,070
So they had some seller to get
deep into the fight itself.

7554
03:29:30,190 --> 03:29:31,480
Mr. Take Yo girl.

7555
03:29:31,690 --> 03:29:32,000
Ready?

7556
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:32,833
Cool.

7557
03:29:33,300 --> 03:29:33,970
A,

7558
03:29:33,970 --> 03:29:35,290
I think this is like,

7559
03:29:35,350 --> 03:29:36,700
is this the actual fight itself there?

7560
03:29:36,701 --> 03:29:37,534
There it is.

7561
03:29:37,800 --> 03:29:37,990
Yeah.

7562
03:29:37,990 --> 03:29:39,040
It started from the beginning though.

7563
03:29:39,050 --> 03:29:39,883
Start from the beginning.

7564
03:29:40,120 --> 03:29:41,110
That's the end of the round.

7565
03:29:41,620 --> 03:29:42,270
He was yelling.

7566
03:29:42,270 --> 03:29:44,010
I think it's just highlights fellas.

7567
03:29:46,410 --> 03:29:47,243
So angry.

7568
03:29:47,560 --> 03:29:49,450
They look very well.

7569
03:29:49,451 --> 03:29:50,560
He looks about the same age.

7570
03:29:50,910 --> 03:29:52,630
Big is big.

7571
03:29:52,690 --> 03:29:54,790
Vittores back is this was,

7572
03:29:54,820 --> 03:29:55,151
I mean,

7573
03:29:55,151 --> 03:29:58,030
what do you think it'd be
tour Wade then to 42 days.

7574
03:29:58,110 --> 03:29:58,720
Handsome.

7575
03:29:58,720 --> 03:29:58,931
See,

7576
03:29:58,931 --> 03:30:02,740
but this is like a prime example
of having maybe too much muscle.

7577
03:30:02,950 --> 03:30:07,950
Like you almost get too strong and too
powerful and maybe it's not like the

7578
03:30:08,141 --> 03:30:09,700
right thing for your friend,

7579
03:30:09,720 --> 03:30:10,553
not back then.

7580
03:30:10,800 --> 03:30:12,970
Look at the size of Woodley
would beg to differ.

7581
03:30:12,971 --> 03:30:13,340
Joe.

7582
03:30:13,340 --> 03:30:14,840
He's built different Woodley's,

7583
03:30:14,860 --> 03:30:15,790
thicker boned.

7584
03:30:15,970 --> 03:30:16,810
He's got bigger fleet.

7585
03:30:16,811 --> 03:30:19,540
Please also recall that he ever
look how small vittores feet are.

7586
03:30:20,080 --> 03:30:22,030
He's not a big giant guy,

7587
03:30:22,660 --> 03:30:23,291
but you know,

7588
03:30:23,291 --> 03:30:26,400
he's a super athletic guy and you know,

7589
03:30:26,410 --> 03:30:30,130
he's had a lot of issues with his hands
breaking cause he punches so hard and so

7590
03:30:30,131 --> 03:30:30,640
fast.

7591
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:31,640
He's also been doing it for the,

7592
03:30:31,690 --> 03:30:33,250
and he's fucked.

7593
03:30:33,390 --> 03:30:33,700
We'll beat,

7594
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:33,940
you know,

7595
03:30:33,940 --> 03:30:38,940
v towards had I believe at least
eight operations on his hands.

7596
03:30:39,080 --> 03:30:42,530
And he also had a PRT
path for white shoes.

7597
03:30:43,250 --> 03:30:43,461
Oh,

7598
03:30:43,461 --> 03:30:44,660
Randy couture was wearing shoes.

7599
03:30:44,661 --> 03:30:45,111
That's right.

7600
03:30:45,111 --> 03:30:45,800
Jamie.

7601
03:30:45,800 --> 03:30:46,221
Powerful.

7602
03:30:46,221 --> 03:30:47,180
Jamie and crazies.

7603
03:30:47,250 --> 03:30:49,170
One was um,

7604
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:50,070
used to be an option.

7605
03:30:50,180 --> 03:30:51,980
You could wear shoes up until,

7606
03:30:52,520 --> 03:30:53,360
fuck man.

7607
03:30:53,361 --> 03:30:54,500
When I was doing,

7608
03:30:54,501 --> 03:30:54,830
uh,

7609
03:30:54,830 --> 03:30:56,180
the post fight interviews,

7610
03:30:56,181 --> 03:31:00,080
it was always you could wear shoes
and early on it was no gloves.

7611
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:02,300
I think the gloves came along later.

7612
03:31:02,870 --> 03:31:03,531
Early on,

7613
03:31:03,531 --> 03:31:04,970
no one was wearing gloves.

7614
03:31:05,900 --> 03:31:07,500
Like the first fights I worked at,

7615
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:09,560
maybe like a couple of
guys were wearing gloves,

7616
03:31:09,561 --> 03:31:12,200
like Vito was wearing gloves
tank Abbott used to wear gloves,

7617
03:31:12,800 --> 03:31:13,481
but most guys wear,

7618
03:31:13,481 --> 03:31:14,314
I wear gloves,

7619
03:31:15,220 --> 03:31:16,053
I have gloves on.

7620
03:31:16,070 --> 03:31:18,590
But with ventral fun and he
said in this fire and he said,

7621
03:31:18,591 --> 03:31:19,340
I'm going to beat him.

7622
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:20,390
I beat him with boxing.

7623
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:21,261
Yeah.

7624
03:31:21,261 --> 03:31:23,120
Well he just kept pressure
on it till you can't,

7625
03:31:23,480 --> 03:31:24,710
Randy's a guy that you,

7626
03:31:24,711 --> 03:31:28,640
you can't take for granted and this kind
of defense bodies now there and look at

7627
03:31:28,641 --> 03:31:29,810
his body when he's 48.

7628
03:31:29,811 --> 03:31:30,644
And my keys,

7629
03:31:30,980 --> 03:31:31,760
I think if you do that,

7630
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:33,440
granted obviously he's on fucking,

7631
03:31:33,441 --> 03:31:34,320
he's juice to the gills.

7632
03:31:34,321 --> 03:31:37,640
But if you do that with any
48 year old to 19 year old,

7633
03:31:37,641 --> 03:31:38,570
they're going to look different.

7634
03:31:39,110 --> 03:31:40,690
This is a pretty technical fight for it.

7635
03:31:40,691 --> 03:31:41,960
Back then it was Randy.

7636
03:31:42,140 --> 03:31:44,600
Randy was not 48 30 years.

7637
03:31:44,630 --> 03:31:49,630
37 I'm saying V tore
his body when he's 19.

7638
03:31:49,800 --> 03:31:54,800
Anyone from 19 to fucking
39 or 42 cha Randy here.

7639
03:31:55,520 --> 03:31:56,181
Randy.

7640
03:31:56,181 --> 03:31:56,481
Well,

7641
03:31:56,481 --> 03:32:01,481
I believe he had his first fight in
the UFC when he was 36 to 34 36 34 I'm

7642
03:32:01,521 --> 03:32:03,290
pretty sure it's 36 well,

7643
03:32:03,291 --> 03:32:04,370
so he was in his thirties.

7644
03:32:04,660 --> 03:32:05,720
Well this was in what,

7645
03:32:05,900 --> 03:32:09,770
1999 or may not.

7646
03:32:09,860 --> 03:32:11,240
Probably not that late.

7647
03:32:11,570 --> 03:32:15,020
[inaudible] 97 98 so maybe,

7648
03:32:15,021 --> 03:32:15,261
well,

7649
03:32:15,261 --> 03:32:16,490
I came along,

7650
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:19,060
I started doing it at 97 and I did it.

7651
03:32:19,110 --> 03:32:22,460
I only did it for like a year and a half
until they wanted me to go to Japan.

7652
03:32:22,461 --> 03:32:22,761
I was like,

7653
03:32:22,761 --> 03:32:23,594
check please.

7654
03:32:23,690 --> 03:32:24,510
Was this the first,

7655
03:32:24,510 --> 03:32:27,290
this was your first time
playing where you call it done?

7656
03:32:27,350 --> 03:32:28,970
I didn't call the fights back then.

7657
03:32:28,971 --> 03:32:29,721
I just did the,

7658
03:32:29,721 --> 03:32:29,901
uh,

7659
03:32:29,901 --> 03:32:32,040
the interviews afterwards and I did,

7660
03:32:32,210 --> 03:32:34,190
I did definitely did the
interview after this one.

7661
03:32:34,220 --> 03:32:34,440
We,

7662
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:35,221
you and I went to Ken.

7663
03:32:35,221 --> 03:32:36,530
I remember the hospital's Great.

7664
03:32:36,560 --> 03:32:36,861
Randy.

7665
03:32:36,861 --> 03:32:37,900
Once he got that takedown,

7666
03:32:38,180 --> 03:32:39,770
this fight doesn't look dated.

7667
03:32:39,771 --> 03:32:41,590
This looks like a fight that could damage

7668
03:32:43,760 --> 03:32:44,150
to.

7669
03:32:44,150 --> 03:32:44,540
Great.

7670
03:32:44,540 --> 03:32:44,871
Yeah.

7671
03:32:44,871 --> 03:32:45,441
You know what I mean?

7672
03:32:45,441 --> 03:32:46,610
And this is so old.

7673
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:48,920
It doesn't look dated at all.

7674
03:32:49,040 --> 03:32:49,581
You're right.

7675
03:32:49,581 --> 03:32:50,230
You're right.

7676
03:32:50,230 --> 03:32:51,063
You're right.

7677
03:32:51,290 --> 03:32:52,500
You're Randy was a beast man.

7678
03:32:52,670 --> 03:32:56,380
I think he probably doesn't get nearly
enough respect or credit with today's

7679
03:32:56,390 --> 03:32:57,170
fighters.

7680
03:32:57,170 --> 03:32:57,910
You know,

7681
03:32:57,910 --> 03:32:58,970
not today's fighters,

7682
03:32:58,971 --> 03:33:00,530
rather a today's fans.

7683
03:33:00,680 --> 03:33:04,070
I don't think the people
that are newly to the game,

7684
03:33:04,310 --> 03:33:08,660
I don't think a big percentage of them
go back and watch the early fights.

7685
03:33:08,810 --> 03:33:10,070
It's one of the things about fight pass.

7686
03:33:10,071 --> 03:33:11,390
I hate to be a show for the company,

7687
03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:15,230
but a free like pass is fucking awesome.

7688
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:16,650
Not as a bypass.

7689
03:33:16,700 --> 03:33:18,200
He swam from the UFC son.

7690
03:33:18,201 --> 03:33:18,531
Come on.

7691
03:33:18,531 --> 03:33:19,490
They don't have on fight pass.

7692
03:33:19,550 --> 03:33:20,090
I don't think.

7693
03:33:20,090 --> 03:33:21,230
I'm almost positive it all.

7694
03:33:21,231 --> 03:33:22,550
His Shit's banned from the EOC.

7695
03:33:22,610 --> 03:33:22,821
Right?

7696
03:33:22,821 --> 03:33:23,720
He's not in the hall of fame.

7697
03:33:23,870 --> 03:33:24,830
Can't come to the events.

7698
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:26,270
I'm sure it's fucking on fight pass.

7699
03:33:26,300 --> 03:33:26,810
Is that true?

7700
03:33:26,810 --> 03:33:28,280
I'm barely on fight pass and I said,

7701
03:33:28,281 --> 03:33:29,090
Fuck Reebok.

7702
03:33:29,090 --> 03:33:30,500
I alone Randy couture.

7703
03:33:30,890 --> 03:33:33,500
I thought fight pass
was all the UFC fights.

7704
03:33:33,890 --> 03:33:34,723
It's not.

7705
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:36,740
I would be surprised a he's on there.

7706
03:33:37,050 --> 03:33:37,883
Find out Jamie,

7707
03:33:37,920 --> 03:33:38,251
you can't.

7708
03:33:38,251 --> 03:33:40,980
I don't think you can totally say
that without knowing for sure.

7709
03:33:41,080 --> 03:33:41,913
Let me this

7710
03:33:43,620 --> 03:33:45,210
beat downs with the scarf old.

7711
03:33:46,260 --> 03:33:47,010
He's on it.

7712
03:33:47,010 --> 03:33:48,120
I just Google it on my phone.

7713
03:33:48,121 --> 03:33:49,500
He comes up on it on fire.

7714
03:33:49,520 --> 03:33:50,380
You can watch his fights.

7715
03:33:50,530 --> 03:33:51,450
He's tired here.

7716
03:33:52,050 --> 03:33:53,300
This is technical shit.

7717
03:33:53,900 --> 03:33:54,733
All of this.

7718
03:33:54,870 --> 03:33:57,360
I know Randy couture control.

7719
03:33:57,361 --> 03:33:57,661
Where are you?

7720
03:33:57,661 --> 03:33:59,610
Like a sweater but we have fight pass,

7721
03:33:59,611 --> 03:34:00,444
right?

7722
03:34:01,020 --> 03:34:01,261
Yeah.

7723
03:34:01,261 --> 03:34:02,730
Once we get towards the legend,

7724
03:34:02,820 --> 03:34:03,960
where are you like a sweater?

7725
03:34:03,961 --> 03:34:06,200
You fucking you guys on that shit.

7726
03:34:06,990 --> 03:34:07,860
How's his fundamentals?

7727
03:34:08,640 --> 03:34:11,400
His fundamentals are sound
or sound fundamentals.

7728
03:34:11,401 --> 03:34:11,940
You guys,

7729
03:34:11,940 --> 03:34:13,230
he's such a stud wrestler.

7730
03:34:13,250 --> 03:34:14,190
When I wrestled I go,

7731
03:34:14,191 --> 03:34:14,851
I say the guys,

7732
03:34:14,851 --> 03:34:15,121
I go,

7733
03:34:15,121 --> 03:34:18,360
I'm wearing like a sweater motherfucker
and I put my chest on his chest.

7734
03:34:18,361 --> 03:34:20,370
Is this happened to other
than when you're asleep?

7735
03:34:20,880 --> 03:34:21,541
When I train,

7736
03:34:21,541 --> 03:34:22,021
when I train,

7737
03:34:22,021 --> 03:34:22,830
I always said that I go,

7738
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:25,580
you ready to be worn by like
a sweater at this turtleneck?

7739
03:34:25,770 --> 03:34:27,180
And then when I had strike with guys,

7740
03:34:27,181 --> 03:34:27,661
I say this,

7741
03:34:27,661 --> 03:34:28,140
I go,

7742
03:34:28,140 --> 03:34:28,650
hey dude,

7743
03:34:28,650 --> 03:34:29,700
you ever fight a ghost?

7744
03:34:29,970 --> 03:34:31,050
You're about to,

7745
03:34:31,320 --> 03:34:31,950
that's what I say.

7746
03:34:31,950 --> 03:34:32,761
I like the hope.

7747
03:34:32,761 --> 03:34:35,580
He likes swinging it fresh air cause
that's what you're about to get.

7748
03:34:35,880 --> 03:34:39,080
And then I fucking pull a Rodriguez on
him cause my fundamentals are sound.

7749
03:34:39,630 --> 03:34:42,360
Does anybody ever a tap
to the candle per anymore?

7750
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:44,513
Ooh,

7751
03:34:44,580 --> 03:34:45,990
I would mark crusher.

7752
03:34:46,410 --> 03:34:48,570
Mark Curry's again isn't that can opener.

7753
03:34:49,050 --> 03:34:49,620
Goddamn.

7754
03:34:49,620 --> 03:34:52,230
I remember Mark Kirk got
this Russian dude in the can,

7755
03:34:52,231 --> 03:34:55,080
Oprah and it was so god damn nasty,

7756
03:34:55,081 --> 03:34:59,020
nasty pulled on this guy's
head and mark her was hi ya Ya.

7757
03:34:59,021 --> 03:34:59,410
Yeah.

7758
03:34:59,410 --> 03:35:01,030
You know the last one?

7759
03:35:01,370 --> 03:35:06,370
You know the last one I remember I'll
scroll rooms brother against a ray Sefo in

7760
03:35:07,681 --> 03:35:09,200
strike force deleted.

7761
03:35:09,890 --> 03:35:10,723
That's right.

7762
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:12,610
Sappho cannot.

7763
03:35:12,630 --> 03:35:14,250
When you heard him him or what's up?

7764
03:35:14,350 --> 03:35:15,660
That was the last one I remember.

7765
03:35:15,661 --> 03:35:15,811
Yeah,

7766
03:35:15,811 --> 03:35:16,440
he got it from,

7767
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:16,770
yeah,

7768
03:35:16,770 --> 03:35:17,461
it was weird.

7769
03:35:17,461 --> 03:35:17,901
The over him.

7770
03:35:17,901 --> 03:35:19,230
His brother got him around him.

7771
03:35:20,110 --> 03:35:21,060
His brother tapped out.

7772
03:35:21,061 --> 03:35:21,810
Randy,

7773
03:35:21,810 --> 03:35:23,580
you know that right balance.

7774
03:35:23,670 --> 03:35:24,430
I didn't know that.

7775
03:35:24,430 --> 03:35:24,991
I'll turn it over.

7776
03:35:24,991 --> 03:35:25,830
He was a beast.

7777
03:35:26,100 --> 03:35:27,160
He was a really good man.

7778
03:35:28,140 --> 03:35:29,300
Was this a three round fight?

7779
03:35:29,400 --> 03:35:30,110
I can't remember.

7780
03:35:30,110 --> 03:35:30,943
He was a heavy guy.

7781
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:32,940
Back way to the ouster was fighting light.

7782
03:35:32,941 --> 03:35:34,890
Heavyweight Valentine
was was a heavyweight.

7783
03:35:35,400 --> 03:35:38,540
Can't you just hurt those brothers
were nightmares and no fucking uh,

7784
03:35:38,670 --> 03:35:39,240
the Netherlands,

7785
03:35:39,240 --> 03:35:39,541
by the way.

7786
03:35:39,541 --> 03:35:42,090
Look at how much time is
going on in this clock.

7787
03:35:42,120 --> 03:35:43,920
Five minutes and 49 seconds.

7788
03:35:43,921 --> 03:35:47,700
Five 55 51 like these are
long ass fucking rounds folks.

7789
03:35:47,760 --> 03:35:48,690
I have a hard time.

7790
03:35:48,840 --> 03:35:50,310
This is not the old UFC.

7791
03:35:50,311 --> 03:35:53,160
I don't even honestly remember
how long the fucking rounds where.

7792
03:35:53,610 --> 03:35:54,060
Well,

7793
03:35:54,060 --> 03:35:54,661
I just,

7794
03:35:54,661 --> 03:35:56,820
I'm distracted by John
McCarthy's boat color.

7795
03:35:56,870 --> 03:35:57,270
Welcome.

7796
03:35:57,270 --> 03:35:59,070
What happened to Randy coture shorts?

7797
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:01,020
You see what happened to
his shorts right there?

7798
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:03,000
His shorts are jacked and ripped open.

7799
03:36:03,300 --> 03:36:04,680
Still back to the boat color.

7800
03:36:05,430 --> 03:36:06,270
I'm going to have both color.

7801
03:36:06,271 --> 03:36:07,104
There you go.

7802
03:36:07,110 --> 03:36:07,860
Boat collar.

7803
03:36:07,860 --> 03:36:08,550
Tom Macarthur.

7804
03:36:08,550 --> 03:36:09,410
Go Regulatory.

7805
03:36:09,420 --> 03:36:10,253
I just saw him.

7806
03:36:10,650 --> 03:36:11,483
Yeah,

7807
03:36:11,700 --> 03:36:12,810
the Lesnar fight.

7808
03:36:13,400 --> 03:36:14,190
Oh,

7809
03:36:14,190 --> 03:36:15,120
I don't know if you can watch the,

7810
03:36:15,121 --> 03:36:16,980
I'm sure if he's done their
thing and I'm everywhere.

7811
03:36:17,650 --> 03:36:18,241
There you go,

7812
03:36:18,241 --> 03:36:19,074
Randy couture,

7813
03:36:19,080 --> 03:36:19,913
Brock Lesnar.

7814
03:36:20,440 --> 03:36:22,110
But we'll see if there's more though.

7815
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:23,970
See if there's ones where he wins.

7816
03:36:26,730 --> 03:36:27,110
It's like,

7817
03:36:27,110 --> 03:36:27,261
yeah,

7818
03:36:27,261 --> 03:36:28,094
you can watch it.

7819
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:29,190
Here's all of the losses.

7820
03:36:29,220 --> 03:36:30,550
You could only watch him get his ass.

7821
03:36:30,770 --> 03:36:33,360
He's Randy versus chocolate l one and two.

7822
03:36:33,900 --> 03:36:34,231
Oh No.

7823
03:36:34,231 --> 03:36:35,064
Two and three.

7824
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:40,600
You want a imagine if it was only
when you could need tyrannical tour,

7825
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:42,850
but imagine if it was only
Randy versus chocolate.

7826
03:36:42,860 --> 03:36:44,200
Dell two and three.

7827
03:36:44,201 --> 03:36:46,630
You could watch one watch
one cause he wanted one

7828
03:36:48,790 --> 03:36:51,040
damn rain eco tourists still
taking it to Vito here.

7829
03:36:51,041 --> 03:36:52,420
I forgot how long his fight last.

7830
03:36:52,460 --> 03:36:54,040
This is seven minutes
into the first round.

7831
03:36:54,310 --> 03:36:55,630
That's some grueling shit.

7832
03:36:55,780 --> 03:36:56,830
And he had the worm.

7833
03:36:57,550 --> 03:36:58,383
The worm.

7834
03:36:58,420 --> 03:36:58,760
Yeah.

7835
03:36:58,760 --> 03:37:00,460
You would think you had
a warm to brandy and

7836
03:37:02,730 --> 03:37:04,410
Punko cm punk out.

7837
03:37:04,680 --> 03:37:07,110
Fucking all kinds of shit
coming out of your asshole.

7838
03:37:09,340 --> 03:37:11,680
Knock you around like a
fucking old teddy bear.

7839
03:37:12,070 --> 03:37:14,520
Is there no fucking search
on this thing Jamie.

7840
03:37:14,730 --> 03:37:15,420
Wow,

7841
03:37:15,420 --> 03:37:15,730
Jamie.

7842
03:37:15,730 --> 03:37:16,563
And we got it.

7843
03:37:17,560 --> 03:37:19,780
We got to get the new
version of the bypass.

7844
03:37:19,810 --> 03:37:21,190
This version kind of blows,

7845
03:37:22,440 --> 03:37:22,750
not,

7846
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:23,650
not the fight pass,

7847
03:37:23,651 --> 03:37:28,651
rather the I the a apple ITV
version of that because if the tour,

7848
03:37:30,460 --> 03:37:33,220
but if you like watching
old school fights,

7849
03:37:33,280 --> 03:37:37,010
the fucking resource of the fight library,

7850
03:37:38,120 --> 03:37:41,400
it's so I'll look at these
knees to the head down to punt.

7851
03:37:41,410 --> 03:37:42,670
It needs to head illegal maneuver.

7852
03:37:42,671 --> 03:37:43,720
Now look at that.

7853
03:37:43,960 --> 03:37:46,900
So think about all these things that
are taking place in this fight with Vito

7854
03:37:46,901 --> 03:37:47,680
and Randy.

7855
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:48,460
First of all,

7856
03:37:48,460 --> 03:37:49,900
Randy still beating that ass.

7857
03:37:49,901 --> 03:37:52,950
It's seven minutes and 58 seconds in Pete.

7858
03:37:53,290 --> 03:37:54,430
He still beat that ass.

7859
03:37:54,431 --> 03:37:56,470
He's still got the
endurance to beat that ass.

7860
03:37:56,830 --> 03:37:57,191
Look at them.

7861
03:37:57,191 --> 03:37:59,170
It's just beating the
fuck out of this dude.

7862
03:37:59,170 --> 03:38:00,580
He's trying to break him and he's,

7863
03:38:00,581 --> 03:38:01,570
he's one of those dudes,

7864
03:38:01,571 --> 03:38:01,900
man.

7865
03:38:01,900 --> 03:38:02,950
If he feels you break in,

7866
03:38:02,951 --> 03:38:04,900
especially then so close to his,

7867
03:38:04,901 --> 03:38:05,171
uh,

7868
03:38:05,171 --> 03:38:09,040
his athletic prime as an amateur wrestler
and he's a fucking straight savage

7869
03:38:09,041 --> 03:38:09,660
right here.

7870
03:38:09,660 --> 03:38:10,241
Here's the flight,

7871
03:38:10,241 --> 03:38:10,421
right?

7872
03:38:10,421 --> 03:38:11,500
They just beat him down.

7873
03:38:11,890 --> 03:38:13,000
Collision course right there.

7874
03:38:13,001 --> 03:38:13,834
Randy beats it.

7875
03:38:14,020 --> 03:38:14,741
Maurice Smith,

7876
03:38:14,741 --> 03:38:15,190
he goes,

7877
03:38:15,190 --> 03:38:15,761
go to the bottom,

7878
03:38:15,761 --> 03:38:16,690
says related videos.

7879
03:38:16,691 --> 03:38:18,130
I think that's Randy verse.

7880
03:38:18,580 --> 03:38:19,050
Uh,

7881
03:38:19,050 --> 03:38:19,450
toward,

7882
03:38:19,450 --> 03:38:19,700
Ooh,

7883
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:20,291
got a stud.

7884
03:38:20,291 --> 03:38:21,220
He was back then.

7885
03:38:21,460 --> 03:38:22,300
God Damn Randy.

7886
03:38:22,301 --> 03:38:22,900
Coture.

7887
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:23,733
Yup.

7888
03:38:23,810 --> 03:38:28,540
Some savage El cap it go to go to a Randy,

7889
03:38:28,600 --> 03:38:30,760
go to Maury Smith versus tank Abbott.

7890
03:38:30,790 --> 03:38:31,630
Go to that fight.

7891
03:38:31,730 --> 03:38:32,800
[inaudible] tank Abbott.

7892
03:38:32,830 --> 03:38:34,180
Fuck yeah.

7893
03:38:34,570 --> 03:38:36,400
How about Mark Coleman versus listen,

7894
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:37,953
every,

7895
03:38:39,190 --> 03:38:42,370
everybody needed a dude
like tank Abbott around.

7896
03:38:42,371 --> 03:38:45,970
Just to let you know that you could think
that all martial artists are going to

7897
03:38:45,971 --> 03:38:46,930
be the same thing.

7898
03:38:46,931 --> 03:38:48,000
They're all going to be like the Yoda one.

7899
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:48,833
Cida balance.

7900
03:38:48,970 --> 03:38:49,151
No.

7901
03:38:49,151 --> 03:38:50,830
There's some dudes who
get drunk every night.

7902
03:38:50,831 --> 03:38:52,420
We'll beat the fuck out of me.

7903
03:38:52,920 --> 03:38:54,320
Kind of similar take out,

7904
03:38:54,321 --> 03:38:55,510
but tank even crazier.

7905
03:38:56,830 --> 03:38:59,500
Crazier than Roy Nelson from the looks.

7906
03:38:59,530 --> 03:38:59,861
You'd be like,

7907
03:38:59,861 --> 03:39:00,820
get the fuck on it.

7908
03:39:00,821 --> 03:39:01,011
Oh,

7909
03:39:01,011 --> 03:39:01,660
belly.

7910
03:39:01,660 --> 03:39:02,051
Yeah,

7911
03:39:02,051 --> 03:39:04,470
but he can fucking nuts or face off.

7912
03:39:04,510 --> 03:39:08,850
I ran into Mark Coleman after he lost
to Maurice Smith and he basically gassed

7913
03:39:08,851 --> 03:39:09,251
in that one.

7914
03:39:09,251 --> 03:39:10,084
I remember that fight.

7915
03:39:10,150 --> 03:39:11,020
It was like fucking,

7916
03:39:11,140 --> 03:39:15,880
he was leaning over a hands on his knees
and morning since the throne leg kicks

7917
03:39:15,881 --> 03:39:16,490
and shit.

7918
03:39:16,490 --> 03:39:19,840
He was barely hanging on and
he was like panicking and uh,

7919
03:39:19,870 --> 03:39:20,703
I,

7920
03:39:21,160 --> 03:39:26,160
I was working for a guy who was trying
to start a magazine and MMA magazine

7921
03:39:26,771 --> 03:39:27,670
called NHP.

7922
03:39:27,820 --> 03:39:30,700
And so I interviewed Mark
Coleman and ask them what uh,

7923
03:39:30,790 --> 03:39:32,560
what has it been doing
since that fight and he,

7924
03:39:32,890 --> 03:39:36,830
and this is that a bar of this look down
brothers look at my feet and I'm like

7925
03:39:36,831 --> 03:39:37,664
damn,

7926
03:39:37,850 --> 03:39:38,780
I got some running shoes.

7927
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:40,550
I've been running man running.

7928
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:41,511
That's what I'm doing.

7929
03:39:41,511 --> 03:39:42,201
That's the difference.

7930
03:39:42,201 --> 03:39:43,880
I'm running fucking tank.

7931
03:39:44,030 --> 03:39:45,500
Hey Jamie,

7932
03:39:45,501 --> 03:39:46,400
go back,

7933
03:39:46,460 --> 03:39:49,760
go back to they showed
the audience go back.

7934
03:39:49,761 --> 03:39:50,241
I wanted to,

7935
03:39:50,241 --> 03:39:51,300
I want to point this out.

7936
03:39:51,301 --> 03:39:52,490
We'll go back a couple of minutes.

7937
03:39:52,730 --> 03:39:54,560
Look how small the audiences,

7938
03:39:54,770 --> 03:39:56,330
this is crazy.

7939
03:39:56,760 --> 03:39:59,310
We just wash them and meet
head to show it back then I,

7940
03:39:59,311 --> 03:40:04,311
and this is a fight that I was at to
harm or this a couple of yeah cause I

7941
03:40:04,881 --> 03:40:05,780
remember people,

7942
03:40:06,170 --> 03:40:07,000
Maurice.

7943
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:07,400
Um,

7944
03:40:07,400 --> 03:40:11,150
I was really interested to see how tank
was going to be able to deal with those

7945
03:40:11,151 --> 03:40:16,151
leg kicks as Maurice was so fucking
skillful as far as like a real heavyweight

7946
03:40:17,661 --> 03:40:21,170
cause Maurice is a real natural
heavyweight is a big dude but a real

7947
03:40:21,171 --> 03:40:21,680
heavyweight.

7948
03:40:21,680 --> 03:40:26,680
That's that fucking good at Moy Tai who
comes over into it to MMA and again just

7949
03:40:27,981 --> 03:40:28,814
like,

7950
03:40:29,170 --> 03:40:33,170
like a lot of guys he came over
after a long career in kickboxing.

7951
03:40:33,230 --> 03:40:34,070
Super Long career.

7952
03:40:34,100 --> 03:40:34,281
Yeah.

7953
03:40:34,281 --> 03:40:35,750
I mean he's a legend in Denver.

7954
03:40:35,810 --> 03:40:35,991
Yeah.

7955
03:40:35,991 --> 03:40:37,550
He'd fought for a long time.

7956
03:40:37,551 --> 03:40:38,060
One a one,

7957
03:40:38,060 --> 03:40:39,110
a bunch of titles.

7958
03:40:39,590 --> 03:40:41,330
You said the weirdest
thing after this fight too.

7959
03:40:41,331 --> 03:40:42,020
I remember I said,

7960
03:40:42,020 --> 03:40:45,320
you said after the fight you
are next to him and he said,

7961
03:40:45,321 --> 03:40:48,770
I looked in his mouth and it looked like
his mouth had different parts in it.

7962
03:40:48,800 --> 03:40:49,880
Like he had just all these,

7963
03:40:50,030 --> 03:40:51,830
like these thick jaw muscles.

7964
03:40:51,831 --> 03:40:53,360
You just looked into his mouth tank.

7965
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:54,030
Yes.

7966
03:40:54,030 --> 03:40:54,200
Yeah.

7967
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:55,840
He's definitely built different
than the regular human.

7968
03:40:55,860 --> 03:40:56,820
What's he do these things.

7969
03:40:56,840 --> 03:40:57,930
I was wondering what he's meant.

7970
03:40:57,950 --> 03:40:59,560
That was getting money.

7971
03:40:59,720 --> 03:41:01,510
The angels,

7972
03:41:01,990 --> 03:41:04,340
his wait for anybody to
open their fucking pie hole.

7973
03:41:04,370 --> 03:41:04,821
God,

7974
03:41:04,821 --> 03:41:05,720
you don't want that.

7975
03:41:06,010 --> 03:41:08,400
Then a bar with a bad day
and he said scared though.

7976
03:41:08,401 --> 03:41:09,234
Want it?

7977
03:41:09,290 --> 03:41:11,270
He meant something like 600 pounds,

7978
03:41:11,840 --> 03:41:12,673
600 pounds.

7979
03:41:13,100 --> 03:41:14,030
He's a gorilla man.

7980
03:41:14,510 --> 03:41:15,260
Right up.

7981
03:41:15,260 --> 03:41:15,841
I like that girl.

7982
03:41:15,841 --> 03:41:16,041
Look,

7983
03:41:16,041 --> 03:41:16,550
gorilla.

7984
03:41:16,550 --> 03:41:17,450
I always enjoyed them too.

7985
03:41:17,480 --> 03:41:18,313
Me Too.

7986
03:41:18,680 --> 03:41:19,460
I was joining him,

7987
03:41:19,460 --> 03:41:20,300
watching him fight.

7988
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:21,830
I always enjoyed talking to him.

7989
03:41:21,980 --> 03:41:22,880
I always had a good time with that.

7990
03:41:22,881 --> 03:41:23,230
Dot.

7991
03:41:23,230 --> 03:41:25,490
Thanks was to fight this year
but didn't pass his physical.

7992
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:26,391
God Damn it,

7993
03:41:26,391 --> 03:41:26,601
man.

7994
03:41:26,601 --> 03:41:27,434
That's unfortunate.

7995
03:41:28,250 --> 03:41:30,330
You know what happened to was physical.

7996
03:41:30,430 --> 03:41:34,250
He said he didn't pass his physical
and they brought is built out.

7997
03:41:34,310 --> 03:41:35,270
That makes me feel bad.

7998
03:41:35,780 --> 03:41:36,281
Maurice.

7999
03:41:36,281 --> 03:41:38,000
Maurice had a great sense of humor too.

8000
03:41:38,120 --> 03:41:39,440
Was Maurice The champion?

8001
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:40,280
No,

8002
03:41:40,280 --> 03:41:41,660
it was this after he had beaten.

8003
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:42,513
Um,

8004
03:41:42,960 --> 03:41:43,401
there was this,

8005
03:41:43,401 --> 03:41:44,950
after he had beaten mark.

8006
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:45,500
Um,

8007
03:41:45,500 --> 03:41:48,020
Mark Coleman for the title cause
Morrie's beat Mark Coleman.

8008
03:41:48,021 --> 03:41:51,520
Remember he kept saying
come on ground and pound me.

8009
03:41:52,730 --> 03:41:53,563
Boom,

8010
03:41:54,400 --> 03:41:54,980
boom.

8011
03:41:54,980 --> 03:41:56,000
And the way Maurice is more,

8012
03:41:56,001 --> 03:41:57,080
it's like the nicest guy ever.

8013
03:41:57,340 --> 03:41:58,070
So he's talking,

8014
03:41:58,070 --> 03:41:59,210
he's talking like all calm.

8015
03:41:59,211 --> 03:41:59,451
Come on,

8016
03:41:59,451 --> 03:42:00,310
work grounded,

8017
03:42:00,320 --> 03:42:00,680
prompt me.

8018
03:42:00,680 --> 03:42:01,251
Ground up homie.

8019
03:42:01,251 --> 03:42:01,700
Mark,

8020
03:42:01,700 --> 03:42:02,533
what's he like?

8021
03:42:02,750 --> 03:42:03,381
What's he doing?

8022
03:42:03,381 --> 03:42:03,951
He's got a school,

8023
03:42:03,951 --> 03:42:04,520
right man,

8024
03:42:04,520 --> 03:42:05,780
I don't know he's doing,

8025
03:42:06,020 --> 03:42:06,950
he's a good dude though.

8026
03:42:07,670 --> 03:42:08,780
Enormous heart.

8027
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:11,120
He definitely has normally funny.

8028
03:42:11,121 --> 03:42:12,320
He had a great sense of humor,

8029
03:42:12,800 --> 03:42:14,390
but he's also very smart.

8030
03:42:14,630 --> 03:42:15,470
When it came to fighting,

8031
03:42:15,471 --> 03:42:19,430
he was very smart and one of the things
that he had above everybody is cardio.

8032
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:22,880
Maury Smith used to do
co Raisie cardio drills.

8033
03:42:22,881 --> 03:42:25,940
He would do like these back
and forth sprints in the pool.

8034
03:42:26,060 --> 03:42:26,630
Like,

8035
03:42:26,630 --> 03:42:30,110
like really hardcore
long range cardio stuff.

8036
03:42:30,350 --> 03:42:32,610
So when he got into these long fights,

8037
03:42:32,820 --> 03:42:33,001
you know,

8038
03:42:33,001 --> 03:42:33,930
because you've got to remember,

8039
03:42:33,931 --> 03:42:35,520
we're not even talking
about a five minute round.

8040
03:42:35,521 --> 03:42:35,791
I don't even,

8041
03:42:35,791 --> 03:42:37,530
what the fuck the rounds were back then?

8042
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:38,513
I don't remember.

8043
03:42:38,730 --> 03:42:39,700
Can you find out what the,

8044
03:42:39,750 --> 03:42:40,680
the rounds were?

8045
03:42:40,740 --> 03:42:45,000
Two 77 this is back like
UFC twelveish 13 ish,

8046
03:42:45,001 --> 03:42:45,960
somewhere around there.

8047
03:42:46,300 --> 03:42:47,640
UFC 12 is when I started.

8048
03:42:47,641 --> 03:42:50,060
This is maybe like 14 UFC 40 charters.

8049
03:42:50,970 --> 03:42:51,601
Oh my goodness.

8050
03:42:51,601 --> 03:42:52,920
He's a young Bruce.

8051
03:42:53,130 --> 03:42:54,090
Oh my goodness.

8052
03:42:54,630 --> 03:42:55,021
Crazy.

8053
03:42:55,021 --> 03:42:56,250
Can't believe he goes all the way back.

8054
03:42:56,460 --> 03:42:58,170
He's an inexorable,

8055
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:00,090
he's such a part of the thing.

8056
03:43:00,630 --> 03:43:02,520
You know God,

8057
03:43:02,521 --> 03:43:03,181
I gotta get Outta here.

8058
03:43:03,181 --> 03:43:04,110
I gotta fucking Gig.

8059
03:43:05,100 --> 03:43:06,180
I got to do those store.

8060
03:43:09,500 --> 03:43:10,333
Okay.

8061
03:43:11,240 --> 03:43:13,730
Scooch this up a hair so
we can watch this fight.

8062
03:43:13,790 --> 03:43:18,790
UFC 12 as the first one with
weight classes and UFC 15
set limitations and hair

8063
03:43:19,881 --> 03:43:21,020
pulling and banding of strikes.

8064
03:43:21,021 --> 03:43:24,380
The back of the neck and head headbutting
small joint manipulations in groin

8065
03:43:24,381 --> 03:43:26,930
strikes with five minute
rounds introduced to UFC 21.

8066
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:27,531
Uh,

8067
03:43:27,531 --> 03:43:28,370
UFC 21.

8068
03:43:28,371 --> 03:43:29,420
So I was already gone.

8069
03:43:29,480 --> 03:43:30,920
What do you think of the 12 to six rule?

8070
03:43:31,010 --> 03:43:31,910
They upheld that,

8071
03:43:31,911 --> 03:43:32,130
right?

8072
03:43:32,130 --> 03:43:32,840
Stupid,

8073
03:43:32,840 --> 03:43:33,441
stupid rule.

8074
03:43:33,441 --> 03:43:34,071
It doesn't make any sense.

8075
03:43:34,071 --> 03:43:34,311
Go ahead.

8076
03:43:34,311 --> 03:43:34,581
Right there.

8077
03:43:34,581 --> 03:43:35,414
Right there is good.

8078
03:43:35,690 --> 03:43:36,523
Right?

8079
03:43:38,970 --> 03:43:39,091
Well,

8080
03:43:39,091 --> 03:43:43,840
let's see how far away tax just
crapped out such a big giant ass dude.

8081
03:43:45,960 --> 03:43:46,793
What's going on with this?

8082
03:43:48,560 --> 03:43:48,741
Oh,

8083
03:43:48,741 --> 03:43:50,810
see we missed a giant chunk son.

8084
03:43:53,700 --> 03:43:54,121
I forgot.

8085
03:43:54,121 --> 03:43:55,470
Tanky avid gun on top of them.

8086
03:43:56,970 --> 03:43:57,803
Took them down.

8087
03:43:58,500 --> 03:43:59,333
I forgot that.

8088
03:43:59,500 --> 03:43:59,890
Ooh,

8089
03:43:59,890 --> 03:44:00,280
looking for,

8090
03:44:00,280 --> 03:44:00,980
sorry.

8091
03:44:00,980 --> 03:44:04,050
I had an old school wrestling devil late.

8092
03:44:04,190 --> 03:44:06,810
Maury Smith had a very underrated,

8093
03:44:06,811 --> 03:44:08,550
very good defensive guard.

8094
03:44:08,910 --> 03:44:09,950
He went butterfly a lot.

8095
03:44:09,951 --> 03:44:10,650
It was very,

8096
03:44:10,650 --> 03:44:12,750
back then it was very
hard to pass his guard.

8097
03:44:13,020 --> 03:44:13,440
Yeah.

8098
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:14,970
You couldn't just pass this guard.

8099
03:44:15,890 --> 03:44:16,080
Well,

8100
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:17,520
Maurice is smart dude.

8101
03:44:17,820 --> 03:44:18,720
He's a very smart,

8102
03:44:18,721 --> 03:44:19,770
when it comes to fighting too,

8103
03:44:19,771 --> 03:44:20,220
he has a,

8104
03:44:20,220 --> 03:44:24,510
he had a remarkable ability
to remain calm in combat.

8105
03:44:24,810 --> 03:44:25,643
You know,

8106
03:44:25,830 --> 03:44:27,480
it's one of the reasons
why he was so dangerous.

8107
03:44:27,481 --> 03:44:29,850
Like you could take him
out like we saw with the,

8108
03:44:29,851 --> 03:44:30,330
uh,

8109
03:44:30,330 --> 03:44:30,721
Ernesto,

8110
03:44:30,721 --> 03:44:31,554
who's head kick,

8111
03:44:31,650 --> 03:44:32,281
but that's a kicked,

8112
03:44:32,281 --> 03:44:35,470
it takes out everybody
that ever lived back then.

8113
03:44:35,471 --> 03:44:36,500
That was one of those kicks.

8114
03:44:36,550 --> 03:44:37,100
That's book.

8115
03:44:37,100 --> 03:44:39,240
That's a brutal kick that
he did on Maurice too.

8116
03:44:39,420 --> 03:44:41,040
Everybody gets Koi by that kick.

8117
03:44:41,490 --> 03:44:43,260
But what Maurice was,

8118
03:44:43,410 --> 03:44:47,070
was capable of was a,

8119
03:44:47,100 --> 03:44:49,260
at a super high world class level.

8120
03:44:49,261 --> 03:44:49,531
I mean,

8121
03:44:49,531 --> 03:44:50,364
he's,

8122
03:44:50,760 --> 03:44:53,940
he's an all time great when it
comes to from America for sure.

8123
03:44:53,970 --> 03:44:55,530
Just pass Moises guard.

8124
03:44:55,531 --> 03:44:56,580
Holy Shit.

8125
03:44:57,240 --> 03:45:00,390
I was talking so much shit about
Morris Garden Passes Guard.

8126
03:45:00,540 --> 03:45:03,150
Maurice put them right back in
it and you know what that is?

8127
03:45:03,410 --> 03:45:05,910
That's the transition
that I did not remember.

8128
03:45:06,310 --> 03:45:07,050
Yeah,

8129
03:45:07,050 --> 03:45:11,010
technical tank actually technically
passed Maury Smith's guard.

8130
03:45:11,020 --> 03:45:11,281
Who?

8131
03:45:11,281 --> 03:45:12,190
Shit tank it.

8132
03:45:12,191 --> 03:45:13,024
Russell.

8133
03:45:13,250 --> 03:45:14,160
Do you see this photo up?

8134
03:45:14,161 --> 03:45:17,640
There was that tank trying to throw a
guy out of the rain that ever happened?

8135
03:45:17,790 --> 03:45:18,770
He came close.

8136
03:45:19,150 --> 03:45:19,600
You got to go.

8137
03:45:19,600 --> 03:45:20,250
Go out.

8138
03:45:20,250 --> 03:45:21,960
The guy stayed sort of in it,

8139
03:45:22,320 --> 03:45:23,160
but it was an issue.

8140
03:45:23,161 --> 03:45:23,851
He almost fell out.

8141
03:45:23,851 --> 03:45:26,610
They didn't have a rule
then the good question.

8142
03:45:26,640 --> 03:45:27,360
You have to open the door.

8143
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:28,193
Let the guy back in

8144
03:45:30,250 --> 03:45:32,310
each feel like a real big
cheese sauce out of the ring.

8145
03:45:32,320 --> 03:45:33,153
You on a walk back,

8146
03:45:33,170 --> 03:45:33,610
get in.

8147
03:45:33,610 --> 03:45:33,761
Well,

8148
03:45:33,761 --> 03:45:36,690
I feel like that guy just wasted a
lot of energy and time to go after

8149
03:45:38,190 --> 03:45:41,230
good at surviving on the
ground as a kickboxer.

8150
03:45:41,790 --> 03:45:45,220
I don't really know that many
kickboxers with the guard is good.

8151
03:45:45,221 --> 03:45:45,760
It says,

8152
03:45:45,760 --> 03:45:45,941
well,

8153
03:45:45,941 --> 03:45:47,710
you know why Frank Shamrock,

8154
03:45:48,090 --> 03:45:49,060
he and frank shamrock,

8155
03:45:49,061 --> 03:45:52,240
we're very close and this is when
frank shamrock was at his best.

8156
03:45:53,580 --> 03:45:56,500
Like when frank shamrock
was a UFC champion,

8157
03:45:57,100 --> 03:46:00,430
when a frank beat John Lobur
that rematch like he was,

8158
03:46:00,431 --> 03:46:03,730
he was palling around with Maurice back
then think they both helped each other a

8159
03:46:03,731 --> 03:46:03,971
lot.

8160
03:46:03,971 --> 03:46:07,030
I think more he's helped
frank with a lot of cardio,

8161
03:46:07,060 --> 03:46:12,060
like really emphasizing how strong a role
cardio plays and also with Maurice of

8162
03:46:12,671 --> 03:46:17,500
course showing him like real proper
kickboxing fundamentals it sees in his

8163
03:46:17,501 --> 03:46:18,250
corner.

8164
03:46:18,250 --> 03:46:19,083
Yeah.

8165
03:46:19,240 --> 03:46:19,840
Frank.

8166
03:46:19,840 --> 03:46:20,673
Yeah.

8167
03:46:20,800 --> 03:46:22,670
Now he was in his corner for a,

8168
03:46:22,671 --> 03:46:25,390
I watched warnings fight once
and Draka you remember Draka?

8169
03:46:25,720 --> 03:46:26,440
I sure don't.

8170
03:46:26,440 --> 03:46:28,120
It was a like MMA,

8171
03:46:28,121 --> 03:46:28,691
but uh,

8172
03:46:28,691 --> 03:46:30,700
you could take dudes down or kickboxing,

8173
03:46:30,701 --> 03:46:31,660
but you could take dudes down.

8174
03:46:31,990 --> 03:46:32,823
It was real weird.

8175
03:46:33,370 --> 03:46:35,830
It was a just an alternative set of rules.

8176
03:46:37,110 --> 03:46:37,451
Yeah.

8177
03:46:37,451 --> 03:46:38,460
Do you remember any no.

8178
03:46:38,580 --> 03:46:39,220
Drunk?

8179
03:46:39,220 --> 03:46:39,461
Yeah.

8180
03:46:39,461 --> 03:46:42,510
You remember that shit only terrible
because you got to get used to it after a

8181
03:46:42,511 --> 03:46:42,731
while.

8182
03:46:42,731 --> 03:46:44,410
It was kind of fun to say it again.

8183
03:46:45,010 --> 03:46:47,320
Draka and little bell tours any better.

8184
03:46:47,850 --> 03:46:48,340
But it's like,

8185
03:46:48,340 --> 03:46:49,061
it seems like,

8186
03:46:49,061 --> 03:46:49,894
um,

8187
03:46:51,480 --> 03:46:53,830
like a kickboxing we take
downs is a big part of it.

8188
03:46:53,831 --> 03:46:54,670
More ties all about,

8189
03:46:54,671 --> 03:46:55,060
you know,

8190
03:46:55,060 --> 03:46:57,280
sweeps and the crazy sweeps.

8191
03:46:57,420 --> 03:47:01,520
Damn court me for throwing
dudes and Dominic steel.

8192
03:47:02,700 --> 03:47:02,980
Well,

8193
03:47:02,980 --> 03:47:03,751
they're crazy war.

8194
03:47:03,751 --> 03:47:04,810
I need to go back home and it,

8195
03:47:04,850 --> 03:47:05,650
I made it.

8196
03:47:05,650 --> 03:47:06,461
That should've made it.

8197
03:47:06,461 --> 03:47:08,420
That's fine.

8198
03:47:09,340 --> 03:47:10,720
Then just regular kickboxing.

8199
03:47:10,870 --> 03:47:12,700
Kickboxing with throws and Shin.

8200
03:47:12,970 --> 03:47:13,710
Yeah.

8201
03:47:13,710 --> 03:47:14,543
Interesting to me.

8202
03:47:15,640 --> 03:47:15,950
Yeah.

8203
03:47:15,950 --> 03:47:16,361
Oh,

8204
03:47:16,361 --> 03:47:17,290
Jamie's got it up there.

8205
03:47:17,860 --> 03:47:18,780
Is that drop drop?

8206
03:47:18,850 --> 03:47:19,683
Yeah.

8207
03:47:19,840 --> 03:47:20,200
Yeah.

8208
03:47:20,200 --> 03:47:20,321
Oh,

8209
03:47:20,321 --> 03:47:21,760
these guys are using MMA gloves.

8210
03:47:21,761 --> 03:47:23,170
This is another next level shit.

8211
03:47:23,200 --> 03:47:25,870
This is the truck to the 14.

8212
03:47:25,960 --> 03:47:26,311
Oh yeah,

8213
03:47:26,311 --> 03:47:26,441
yeah,

8214
03:47:26,441 --> 03:47:26,860
yeah.

8215
03:47:26,860 --> 03:47:28,330
When I saw this full Lma.

8216
03:47:28,690 --> 03:47:29,070
No,

8217
03:47:29,070 --> 03:47:31,020
it's Lma.

8218
03:47:31,670 --> 03:47:32,503
Draka.

8219
03:47:33,310 --> 03:47:35,360
Maybe Draka just moved to La man.

8220
03:47:36,250 --> 03:47:36,461
Fuck.

8221
03:47:36,461 --> 03:47:37,520
Are we doing with this book?

8222
03:47:38,590 --> 03:47:40,210
Oh God.

8223
03:47:40,211 --> 03:47:44,710
Guy Has on UFC trumps that he could
buy off the website and it's beautiful

8224
03:47:44,711 --> 03:47:45,031
trunk.

8225
03:47:45,031 --> 03:47:46,090
While why not wear them?

8226
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:47,470
Want to be you upstairs?

8227
03:47:47,800 --> 03:47:48,460
It's,

8228
03:47:48,460 --> 03:47:48,960
it's the only thing.

8229
03:47:48,960 --> 03:47:49,793
Sad.

8230
03:47:50,650 --> 03:47:52,210
It's got both the underwear on as well.

8231
03:47:52,240 --> 03:47:54,910
See that is the underwear on UFC trucks.

8232
03:47:54,940 --> 03:47:55,290
Hey man,

8233
03:47:55,290 --> 03:47:56,290
you guys gotta fucking dreams.

8234
03:47:57,220 --> 03:47:58,360
Obviously a bad motherfucker.

8235
03:47:58,510 --> 03:47:59,650
But the old Draka was,

8236
03:47:59,651 --> 03:48:00,010
uh,

8237
03:48:00,010 --> 03:48:01,030
it was kickboxing.

8238
03:48:01,080 --> 03:48:03,160
They have boxing gloves
on and they'd just,

8239
03:48:03,190 --> 03:48:04,660
but you could shoot like double lights.

8240
03:48:04,690 --> 03:48:06,250
You could do throws and stuff.

8241
03:48:06,490 --> 03:48:07,121
It was weird.

8242
03:48:07,121 --> 03:48:11,710
Like judo type shows all kinds of
throws some more you could do throws.

8243
03:48:11,770 --> 03:48:12,101
Oh my God.

8244
03:48:12,101 --> 03:48:12,934

8250
03:48:17,050 --> 03:48:19,540
I have obligations and
milestones for sleep.

8251
03:48:19,740 --> 03:48:20,050
Uh,

8252
03:48:20,050 --> 03:48:21,490
