1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,920
I try so hard.
Boom.

2
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:10,740
And we're live Hamilton Morris sober as 
fuck.

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:12,270
How about you?
Absolutely.

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:17,271
Say yes this time.
So we did a podcast seven years ago and 

5
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,770
most people apparently didn't know how 
fucked up we were,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,120
but uh,
I figured,

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,770
damn,
we're here with Hamilton Morris.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
We should go deep.
And we just kept hitting that joint 

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,450
until I lost most of my grasp on reality
while we're talking.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,760
It's just a very slippery conversation.
I was just too high to form coherent 

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:41,871
thoughts.
It was just whatever I pieced together 

12
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:41,871
was just a,
you know,

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,430
it was almost like miming a 
conversation,

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,850
but now seven years later and you have a
new place.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,020
Yeah.
That's beautiful.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.
Well you were at the early days.

17
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,360
We did it at my house.
Yeah,

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,490
that was way,
way,

19
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,040
way back in the day.
I had no idea really.

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,041
I knew you were of course,
but I didn't know about your podcast 

21
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,041
entirely.

22
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,300
I'd seen clips of you on youtube and it 
wasn't until I was driving home from 

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,390
that recording and my phone just filled 
with hundreds of emails that I realized,

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,420
Oh wow,
this is a serious phenomenon that I was 

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,810
not aware of and now I see.
It's just become huge.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,070
It's a weird thing,
dude.

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,470
It,
it's a,

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,450
it's got the wheel.
I just sort of have to show up.

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,500
It's a very strange and it sounds like,
um,

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,470
false modesty or something like that,
but I'm just being totally honest,

31
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:33,471
like this thing does itself.
I think a lot of it might have to do 

32
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:37,401
with the long form because people are so
used to seeing people's opinions 

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,410
condensed and filtered into these 
soundbites and snippets and to hear an 

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,061
extended conversation with someone where
they can actually tell stories and 

35
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,890
articulate their opinions and a nuanced 
careful ways.

36
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,790
So rare.
I agree.

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,330
It's one of the reasons why I don't do 
those shows anymore,

38
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,210
like panel shows and things like that.
It's just so frustrated.

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,320
It's insane.
I have very little experience with that 

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,810
sort of thing,
but I did Dr Oz last year.

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,430
Yes.
And I don't know how any normal person 

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,510
could function and that sort of 
environment.

43
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,130
I mean,
I have a TV show,

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,760
so arguably I'm well trained for that 
sort of thing,

45
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,200
but unless you're an actor who's 
prepared a line to say,

46
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:24,201
as soon as they point at you,
there's no way that you could function 

47
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:27,171
because it's not a genuine conversation.
It's just an opportunity to launch one 

48
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:27,690
sentence,
sound bites and an audience applause.

49
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,430
And also the audience is such a strange 
element to add to a conversation.

50
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,780
I mean,
if you and I were having this 

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,841
conversation exactly in this room,
but to the left of us is an enormous 

52
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,460
group of people.

53
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,830
We've feel weird.
We'd have to address them,

54
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,831
we'd have to turn to them.
It would be odd following illuminated 

55
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,830
applause and laughter signs.
God.

56
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,831
Those are the weirdest.
When there's always the warmup guys 

57
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:54,831
like,
okay,

58
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:55,440
we're ready.
We're coming back from break coming back

59
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,870
from Craig and they hold up the sign and
applause,

60
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,770
applause,
applause.

61
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,660
And everybody goes crazy.
And the create the worst environment.

62
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,930
I was on this,
uh,

63
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,620
discussion about [inaudible].
Are you familiar with this?

64
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm on it right now.
Oh Wow.

65
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,080
Yeah.
I just took some.

66
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,850
I,
I fucked my knee up the other day.

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,930
I did something and it's been stiff and 
painful.

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,270
So I used it before I came here and then
I just took,

69
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,880
took six of them.
See what happens.

70
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,710
Wow.
10 ones.

71
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,790
10.
One gram.

72
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't know how much.
I don't know.

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Can you grab that bag?
There's a bag that's sitting right on 

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:30,960
the sink.

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll tell you exactly what's in it.
But uh,

76
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,050
now I get why people might think it's a 
drug.

77
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,730
What is the drug?
Yeah,

78
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,530
for sure.
But when I took four,

79
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,640
I was like,
well,

80
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,641
I took two for the first time I took it.
I took two and a couple of times I took 

81
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:44,641
to him.
Look,

82
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,351
this is like a mild stimulant,
but then when you get into the range of 

83
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:49,420
eight to 10 pills,
it's like,

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,290
oh,
this,

85
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,480
this will fuck you up.
This stuff.

86
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,760
The stuff I take is urban ice organics 
and um,

87
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,650
see it says,
it says take two.

88
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,330
It doesn't say the amount of material in
the capsule was say 750 milligrams.

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Okay,
so not quite a gram,

90
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,780
not quite a gram.
All right.

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,870
It seems like a reasonable amount,
but they always construct these things 

92
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,810
in these ridiculous dramatic 
oppositions.

93
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:24,811
Like it was me versus a woman whose son 
had died of some Creton associated 

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,480
overdose,
and it turns into a thing like,

95
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:33,481
well,
what do you have to say to this woman 

96
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:33,481
whose son died?

97
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:33,780
And it's like,
I don't know.

98
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,810
You know,
there are people that die from caffeine 

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:38,810
overdoses as well.
It's tragic that this happened.

100
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,600
How people died from this.
Yes.

101
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,270
They have to have to take an enormous 
amount.

102
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
I mean,
I think a lot of people set up these 

103
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,300
unrealistic expectations with these 
drugs where they,

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,531
if they'd like a drug,
they want to say it's impossible for it 

105
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:52,531
to kill anyone.
It's impossible.

106
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,760
There's no possible way.
If you set that as your standard,

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,850
you'll always fail because people will 
die doing absolutely everything.

108
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,530
Running,
having sex deprecating aspirin,

109
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,150
aspirin.
Absolutely.

110
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,680
There's nothing in this world that can't
find its way into a human death.

111
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,490
So if people want to say,
and even you know,

112
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,530
cannabis,
obviously people say you can't overdose 

113
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,081
on cannabis and essentially you can't.
But if you look in the medical 

114
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,751
literature,
there are a number of these cannabis 

115
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:21,751
associated fatalities.

116
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:22,060
You know,
you can debate them endlessly,

117
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:27,061
but the point is,
once a drug enters a large enough 

118
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,671
population,
there'll be a number of sensitive 

119
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,801
individuals and someone will die.
It doesn't mean that the drug is 

120
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,921
dangerous.
It means that it's unrealistic to set a 

121
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:34,921
standard where if anything bad happens 
to anyone,

122
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,930
we have to decide that the drug is 
dangerous and should be banned.

123
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah,
I agree.

124
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:39,970
I mean,
look,

125
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:44,971
water kills people.
There's a lot of these hazing things 

126
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:48,571
where the fraternity kids will be asked 
to drink a shit ton of water and Oh 

127
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,380
yeah,
people have died from it.

128
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:54,060
A woman died in San Jose a few years 
back from a,

129
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,450
a contest to drink water,
get her son like an xbox or something 

130
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,420
like that.
Yeah,

131
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,100
yeah.
I mean,

132
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,180
there's a lot of things that are lethal,
but the ld 50 for cannabis,

133
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,190
I mean,
you literally have to smoke your body 

134
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,190
weight or something.

135
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,000
Right.
It's something crazy would be very 

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
difficult,
you know,

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,150
but it doesn't mean that you couldn't 
get so high that you did something 

138
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,680
really stupid wind up dying.
Right?

139
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.
Especially dependent upon the person and

140
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,340
the biological variability.
Right,

141
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,420
right.
Exactly.

142
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,870
And it's just.
I think it's also just as sort of a bad 

143
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,211
road to go down.
People always want to emphasize the 

144
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:31,211
safety of things,
but in my opinion,

145
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:35,051
safety isn't the point.
It doesn't ultimately matter to me 

146
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:37,010
whether or not something is safe.
I think we should have the freedom to do

147
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,830
dangerous things if we choose.
We're allowed to ride.

148
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:44,831
Motorcycles were allowed to shoot guns.
You're allowed to go skydiving and 

149
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,700
bungee jumping.
All those things carry risks,

150
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,850
but it's assumed that any adult that 
does them is aware of those risks.

151
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah,
I couldn't agree more.

152
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,480
I mean it's,
it's also who is.

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,300
If the society that we live in was just 
you and I was,

154
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,390
we were the only two people alive who 
are you to tell me what I can do or me 

155
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,880
to tell you what you can do.
It's ridiculous.

156
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:06,881
And so when you have grown adults 
telling a grown adult who's informed 

157
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,870
what they can and can't do,
then it becomes a question of children.

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,190
Well then it becomes an education issue 
and it becomes a parental issue.

159
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,370
I mean it's just,
you can't lie to your children about the

160
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:21,371
effects of certain drugs because then 
they're not going to believe you about 

161
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:21,371
the really actual,
the actual dangerous ones.

162
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,550
Right?
And this is of course reflected in the 

163
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,780
so called opioid epidemic.
Yes.

164
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,860
Right now,
yes.

165
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:32,861
There's endless finger pointing.
Everyone wants to find a culprit that's 

166
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,100
behind all of it.
And the easiest person to blame,

167
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:39,101
of course our pharmaceutical companies 
because everybody hates pharmaceutical 

168
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:39,101
companies,
so why not blame them?

169
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
But you know,
and I'm not pro pharmaceutical by any 

170
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,521
stretch of the imagination,
but I'm also not anti pharmaceutical 

171
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,970
either.
And when you look at the way,

172
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,971
for example,
the New York Times is covering the 

173
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:57,161
opioid epidemic,
it's always in this tone of like 

174
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:00,190
documents were uncovered,
the show that executives at Purdue 

175
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,420
Pharma,
we're aware that morphine was addictive 

176
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,670
as early as 1999.
And it's like,

177
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,170
well,
of course,

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,680
of course they were aware of.
People have known that morphine is 

179
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,781
addictive for hundreds of years.
This is old news and this whole idea 

180
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:18,011
that doctors were convinced by some 
letter in the New England Journal of 

181
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,270
Medicine that said that Oxycontin isn't 
addictive,

182
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:22,250
is absurd.
These are all morphine derivatives.

183
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,380
Any adult,
especially a medically trained adults,

184
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,890
should know that no matter what little 
variation you make on that molecule,

185
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:32,891
if it's structurally and 
pharmacologically and qualitatively 

186
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,080
similar to morphine,
of course it's going to be addictive.

187
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,690
And that in of itself isn't even a bad 
thing.

188
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,420
It should be okay to give people 
addictive drugs as well.

189
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,130
As long as everyone's aware of the 
risks,

190
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,380
as long as they understand the protocol 
to get off of it.

191
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
You,
you know,

192
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,090
there's so many people that get on these
things and then wind up taking them far 

193
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,980
longer than they're supposed to because 
it's easy to get hooked.

194
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,550
I mean we need to at least have some 
sort of responsible

195
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,300
direction of these people need to go to,
to get off of them once they're on them 

196
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,730
because people that get back operations,
any anything where they prescribe you 

197
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,560
high doses of opiates,
it's a huge problem.

198
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:15,561
I know many,
many people that have gotten hooked 

199
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,271
because of,
and in fact I should tell you that my 

200
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:19,131
good friend Justin wren,
his wife found out about Kratom because 

201
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:19,800
of you,
because of your show,

202
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,350
he had a problem with his shoulder,
got shoulder shoulder surgery,

203
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,530
they put them on Oxycontin's.
He was fucked up on them and he was 

204
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,190
having a really hard time getting off 
and having the shakes really bad.

205
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,330
And Kratom is the only thing that got 
them off it.

206
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,300
Right.
And that's not surprising.

207
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:41,301
I mean this has been known for a very 
long time in Thailand and that was 

208
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,480
actually the reason that it was 
originally prohibited.

209
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:47,481
I don't know if you're aware of that,
but because the government taxed opium 

210
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:51,830
and people started using Creton,
then they made Creton Elisa the right 

211
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,611
way to say it because people say Kratom,
you're the only one I've heard say 

212
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:55,611
Krypton people in.
It's a Thai word.

213
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:59,370
People in Thailand call it people in the
US called Kratom.

214
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,600
It's,
I,

215
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,500
it's also,
they have,

216
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,860
you know,
is maybe it's like Crikey,

217
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,930
dom,
something that we're not going to go to 

218
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:07,930
that forever.
Tom is closer.

219
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:07,930
If you did,
it would be weird,

220
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,710
but I feel as you know,
like American people that say Ecuador,

221
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,080
Argentina,
but it is Creton Creton.

222
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,150
Okay.
So we'll try to call it quits or 

223
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,150
something close to that.

224
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,150
It's closer to that thing.
Kratom.

225
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,200
And so the reason why I was made illegal
was because of the fact that it was 

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,990
pinching some of the profits off of the 
opium trade.

227
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,160
Yes.
Wow.

228
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,570
Yeah.
That's fucked up.

229
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,630
And so this has been known for a long 
time that it helps people get off more 

230
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,810
addictive opioids.
And how does it do that?

231
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,170
Well,
it's an opioid itself and a lot of 

232
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:42,170
people don't want to admit or 
acknowledge that,

233
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,191
but I think we need to get beyond this 
idea that drugs are inherently bad or 

234
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:49,791
opioids are inherently bad just because 
the ones that we're aware of have a lot 

235
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,060
of problems,
you know,

236
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,460
in some sense,
medicinal chemistry and pharmacology and

237
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:58,461
all of this are still in a very 
primitive state and there's so much to 

238
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,911
be learned.
So we're mostly giving people these 

239
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,170
derivatives of morphine that have been 
around for a hundred years and there are

240
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:05,100
better things.

241
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,180
We're going to continuously discover 
less addictive treatments for pain and I

242
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,741
think that the alkaloids in Kratom are a
step in that direction and which is so 

243
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:21,831
tragic that they're trying to now make 
it illegal because this is something 

244
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:25,881
that as far as I can tell,
has genuinely helped an enormous number 

245
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:29,530
of people reduce their intake of more 
addictive and more dangerous opioids.

246
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,060
Well,
one of the things that I've felt,

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,170
I mean,
and again,

248
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,430
my dose was not extremely high,
but when I was on it,

249
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,440
I was very coherent.
I was clear.

250
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,510
It was clear to me that was affected by 
something,

251
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,560
but it felt kinda good.
It didn't feel bad.

252
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,520
It felt a little,
a little uneasy,

253
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,660
like a little like,
whoa,

254
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,970
this world feels a little weird right 
now,

255
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,290
but it not feel like A.
I was impaired.

256
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,260
Like I know a lot of people who take it 
an exercise,

257
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,880
like a,
I have a friend,

258
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:05,881
he'll take 10 pills and exercise just 
just seems kind of fucking crazy.

259
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,940
But he says he has a great workout.
Right.

260
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,590
We're taking that stuff before he works 
out.

261
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Yeah.
I mean it seems to lend itself to a lot 

262
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,691
of different applications in Thailand.
It's used almost exclusively for that 

263
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:19,060
sort of purpose.
In the south,

264
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,560
it's a drug that Labor is used so they 
can collect the latex foam,

265
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,400
rubber trees and just get their job 
done.

266
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,020
That's what it's about.
I mean,

267
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,970
that's what opioids are about for a lot 
of the world,

268
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,870
both in the United States and in Africa 
and in Thailand is,

269
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,830
you know,
people live hard lives and,

270
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,030
and manual labor is painful and 
repetitive and difficult and anything 

271
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,811
that makes that a little bit more 
manageable is very important tool for 

272
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:50,671
humans.
I always felt like people that did 

273
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:51,100
heroin or opiates or something like 
that,

274
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,520
we're on a very short road to death 
that,

275
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,150
that was my perception when I was a kid.

276
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,460
And then I had a friend who was a 
longshoreman.

277
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,490
They worked on the docks bring.
They would bring fish in and fillet the 

278
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,830
fish for the market.
And um,

279
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,990
he worked with a guy that everyday at 
lunch the guy would go cop,

280
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,050
he would get his heroin,
who would shoot it up in his car and 

281
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,050
then he'd go back to work and I was 
like,

282
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,350
he'd go back to work and you're like,
Yup.

283
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,380
He worked everyday,
like everyday shot up and everyday he 

284
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,380
worked like,
yeah,

285
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,600
it was never late.
Nope,

286
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,360
just did his work.
Wow.

287
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,300
I didn't think you could do that.
I thought you did heroin,

288
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:33,301
the next thing you know,
you'd just be on the floor in a fetal 

289
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:35,851
position,
in your own urine and you would fall 

290
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:35,851
apart and die.
Right?

291
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:40,050
Yet there's this idea that people 
sometimes refer to as pharmacological 

292
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,460
determinism that a certain drug has to 
do a certain thing,

293
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,700
so alcohol has to sedate and disinhibit 
you.

294
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,930
Heroine has to addict you and make you a
slave to it and kill you.

295
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,830
Cocaine has to be a euphoric thing 
that's done at parties.

296
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:58,831
That's also very addictive.
PCP has to make you strip nude and run 

297
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:03,211
around a fighting,
constantly fighting cops and punching 

298
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:05,120
holes and wooden fences.
Um,

299
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
but when you look at this,
you know,

300
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:12,361
anthropologists have looked at certain 
drugs that are used cross culturally 

301
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,301
like alcohol.
And what you find is this whole idea of 

302
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,350
pharmacological determinism is 
fundamentally flawed.

303
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Drugs behave differently in different 
cultures depending on the set and 

304
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,151
setting of the user.
And so you find all sorts of instances 

305
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,701
that are major exceptions to these rules
that we've set up for these various 

306
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:32,701
drugs.
For example,

307
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:37,501
PCP,
which is arguably one of the most 

308
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,050
ubiquitously maligned drugs in the 
world,

309
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,390
I mean no one can imagine that PCP is 
medicinal,

310
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:45,391
but even to this day,
pcps and schedule to not schedule one 

311
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:48,820
like cannabis and LSD schedule to it can
still be prescribed actually.

312
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,190
And that's because it had a history of 
medicinal

313
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,250
use.
There was even PCP psychotherapy in the 

314
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,250
UK,
in the,

315
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,720
in the fifties.
So this is a something that most people 

316
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,521
wouldn't believe,
but to those patients that were taking 

317
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,311
it,
then there was none of this cultural 

318
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,441
association with PCP being a drug that 
causes psychosis or makes you strip 

319
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:15,431
nude,
who is simply another tool for a 

320
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,771
psychiatrist to use and help people 
release repressed memories or traumas 

321
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,870
that they were afraid to talk about when
sober.

322
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,630
Well,
we're seeing that now with Mtma,

323
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,290
right?
I mean,

324
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,780
and also ketamine,
ketamine,

325
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,500
you being used as an actual tool for 
psychotherapy,

326
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,800
particularly for people with depression.
So having really good results.

327
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,370
My,
um,

328
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,820
my friend,
excuse me,

329
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:40,120
Neil Brennan,
who is a hilarious comedian.

330
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,070
He's had struggles with depression.
He,

331
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,290
he got great relief from,
uh,

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,650
from

333
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,370
taking ketamine.
Right.

334
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,440
And what I think is really interesting 
is,

335
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:53,441
you know,
this is often packaged as a sort of 

336
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,410
psychedelic renaissance,
but I think in a larger context,

337
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:59,411
it's a drug facilitated psychotherapy 
renaissance because this was not just 

338
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:03,941
limited to psychedelics.
People did something called narco 

339
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:06,230
analysis where they would give people 
sedatives like propofol.

340
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,340
The drug that killed Michael Jackson or 
um,

341
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,130
various barbiturates or various other 
drugs and the relaxing effect would 

342
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,730
allow people to talk more openly to a 
therapist.

343
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:21,731
And it was considered very effective.
Now this idea of a psychiatrist 

344
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,450
injecting you with a drug in order to 
help you talk about your problems is 

345
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,930
it's unheard of.
I don't think anyone does it anymore,

346
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:31,931
but it used to be very common and I 
think a return to that is going to be 

347
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:31,931
really beneficial.

348
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,760
Yeah,
I,

349
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I agree with you.
I think the right drugs with the right 

350
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,741
cases and the right people,
and I think we've got to get past these 

351
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:43,651
schedules that when you have things like
marijuana and silicide been and 

352
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,810
especially DMT,
which your own body produces is a 

353
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,080
schedule one drug and the famous Terence
Mckenna line.

354
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:52,000
We're all holding.
You know,

355
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,950
when it comes to Dmt,
it's just stupid.

356
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,500
It's just stupid that these things are 
scheduled one.

357
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,570
When you're saying there's no medical 
benefit whatsoever,

358
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,280
a medical application for cannabis is 
fucking crazy.

359
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,580
When something that you want to have 
something that really actively promotes 

360
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:14,501
a distrust in law enforcement,
the scheduling of drugs is one of the 

361
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,131
best ones because when you look at 
something like marijuana and you see 

362
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:21,791
that that's a schedule one drug that,
that that's infuriating to people that 

363
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,190
gain huge benefits from cannabis.

364
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,340
I mean people that have going through 
chemotherapy,

365
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,010
people that have,
you know,

366
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,030
a interocular pressure from Glaucoma.
I mean you can go down the list over and

367
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:38,720
over and over again.
The kids that have epilepsy,

368
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,690
there's so many people that have had 
great benefit,

369
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,040
particularly from edible cannabis.
People that have seizures,

370
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,350
I mean you could keep going on and on 
and on.

371
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:53,351
It's just,
it's an amazing plant and to have that 

372
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:57,210
demonized because of some ridiculous 
propaganda from the 19 thirties that 

373
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,830
still somehow or another clung on in 
2018.

374
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:04,831
We think about all the information we 
have now with the Internet and the fact 

375
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,620
that cannabis is still scheduled.
One,

376
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:09,160
you have assholes like jeff sessions 
still saying things like,

377
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:13,150
good people don't smoke marijuana like 
this is crazy talk.

378
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,820
It's crazy,
but keep in mind it was just about a 100

379
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:20,821
years ago that alcohol was prohibited in
the United States and it took 13 years 

380
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:25,480
to reverse that and that was alcohol.
There's no drug more integrated into our

381
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,960
culture than alcohol and that took 13 
years to reverse.

382
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,000
What was that like back then?
That must have been madness when alcohol

383
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:38,001
was illegal.
When the cops would come in and 

384
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,831
jackbooted thugs would knock over jen 
mills and bust open kegs of whiskey and 

385
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,670
spill it all out.
Like,

386
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,380
what the fuck was that like?

387
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,120
It was.
It was disastrous.

388
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:50,121
But I think what's interesting about 
that is it was a worthwhile experiment 

389
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:53,190
to give them the benefit of the doubt.
It was worthwhile to see because on some

390
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,550
sense you could say the prohibition has 
a certain logic to it.

391
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,580
You could say drugs caused problems.
So if we just make all the drugs 

392
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,841
illegal,
then maybe those problems will 

393
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:05,841
disappear,
but it didn't work.

394
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:10,551
The experiment failed.
And there's nothing wrong with a failed 

395
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:11,510
experiment,
but it's a problem if you keep repeating

396
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:15,410
it over and over and over again for 100 
years looking for a different result.

397
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,070
Right?
And then go to other drugs and go,

398
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:18,610
well,
this one,

399
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,680
let's try this one.
Let's make this one illegal.

400
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,090
And it's a terrible

401
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,080
pr situation for the police as well.
If I were a police officer,

402
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:31,081
I'd be the biggest opponent of the war 
on drugs and have anyone in the 

403
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:34,591
government.
Because when you think about why does 

404
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,500
the average person in New York City love
of firefighter,

405
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,290
they love firefighters,
but they hate cops.

406
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,550
Why is that?
It's because of the drug war.

407
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,580
Because a firefighter isn't going to 
hurt you for something that wasn't 

408
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,870
really a crime to begin with,
for some kind of victimless crime.

409
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,290
A firefighter is just there to help you 
to save you if you're in trouble,

410
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,800
and the same would be true of police 
officers if it weren't for the drug war.

411
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,810
Ideally

412
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,880
there's a little more complexity to it.
There's certainly certainly more 

413
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,110
complexity when it comes to shootings 
and things along those lines,

414
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,730
but I mean the stop and frisks.
I've read something about stop and Frisk

415
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,730
in New York when they had,
when they had that instituted that most 

416
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,130
of it was drugs.
Most of it was like catching people with

417
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:13,610
marijuana.

418
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,420
Yeah.

419
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,210
Which is just fucking insane.
You just stay.

420
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,130
You look like you might be street.
Get over here

421
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,540
and that's the way these laws have 
functioned from the very beginning.

422
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,790
I mean,
if you look at drug law in the UK,

423
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:31,020
it tends to be very black and white.
Something is legal or illegal.

424
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,080
If it's legal,
it can be sold in stores because it's 

425
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,080
legal.
If it's illegal,

426
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,850
it can't be sold anywhere in the US.
They've instead created this nebulous 

427
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,590
far reaching gray area where there's all
sorts of things that are maybe illegal,

428
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,670
kind of illegal,
do it,

429
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,680
but don't get caught and uh,
and it's created and ability for the 

430
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,440
government to selectively prosecuted 
people whenever they want,

431
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,340
if they want.
Mm.

432
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,350
Yeah.
Well that seems to be lessening.

433
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,690
I mean,
when you have someone like Jeff sessions

434
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,030
in office,
it's very disturbing,

435
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,510
but then trump says things like he's 
very strong on states rights to past 

436
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,460
marijuana laws and things along those 
lines.

437
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,270
You're very incredulous.
No,

438
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,200
no.
I mean,

439
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,240
I,
I suppose I am a bit incredulous when it

440
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,570
comes to trump doing anything good.
But,

441
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:26,100
uh,
I think if you told him that people love

442
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,540
him more,
if he did things good,

443
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,590
he would do things good.
That's probably true.

444
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,560
I think of someone that he trusted said,
yeah,

445
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,910
I think that's as I think we've got to 
get somebody in deep.

446
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,970
We've got to get them all in there.
Got To get somebody who's good at back 

447
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,541
rubs get,
gets back on the podcast and I think 

448
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,820
that'll help.
I doubt it will help.

449
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,880
I mean,
it just,

450
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,190
I don't know,
what is the thing that'll help.

451
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,840
There's also the separation between the 
drug users and the policymakers.

452
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,530
Yes,
and one thing that I am certain will 

453
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,530
help,
and it's sort of tragic that this is the

454
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,040
case,
but it's capitalism.

455
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:04,450
It's the corporatization of these drugs 
because with cannabis,

456
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,380
um,
you know,

457
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:10,381
when it was hippies and the 
counterculture having marches down the 

458
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:13,390
streets of New York holding up for 20 
signs,

459
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,600
it doesn't,
I suppose have all that much clout in 

460
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,381
the eyes of lawmakers,
but when you have some guy from Yale 

461
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:23,920
business school who's never smoked weed,
who says,

462
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,050
you know,
this is a serious business opportunity,

463
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,690
we're going to make it big and gets 
investors,

464
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:31,630
invest millions and millions of dollars 
into it.

465
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,320
Hires lobbyists,
plays the game like a capitalist.

466
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,950
Then the laws do change and I wish that 
weren't the case,

467
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,980
but it is.
And it's tragic for the people that did 

468
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,070
fight and did go to prison and did 
sacrifice that.

469
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Then these,
these business school guys come along 

470
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,980
and reap all the benefits,
but that's the way it works.

471
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,170
Yeah.
That is the way it is

472
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,340
and that's okay.
I mean it's just a weird path.

473
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,370
It's a weird path,
but as long as we can get to 

474
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:02,370
legalization,
I'm 100 percent for that path.

475
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,910
I just think that might be the only way 
in this weird country,

476
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,690
this country is so enamored with money.
I mean we're,

477
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:13,030
we're so enamored with money and profits
and even for dying people,

478
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,720
even old people like Warren Buffet 
invested shit.

479
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:21,721
Tons of money in warehouses to sell to,
to grow cannabis in Colorado when the 

480
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:24,940
laws were passed.
I mean that guy has 150,000

481
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:29,941
years old.
He's worth billions of dollars and he's 

482
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:29,941
like,
who gives a shit?

483
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,780
I'm making more money now and more and 
more and more.

484
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,140
I mean even when they're really old,
they're massively motivated by profit.

485
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Yes,
and I think the same will be true for 

486
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,570
psychedelics and we'll probably be true 
for all of these things because you need

487
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:48,571
to have lobbyists need to have this sort
of typical white collar support to push 

488
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,360
things forward.

489
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,080
I agree.
I just,

490
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,490
I don't see any other way around it 
right now.

491
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,420
I mean,
the real hope is that cannabis,

492
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,100
not that it will get rid of capitalism,
but that we'll figure it out.

493
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:05,080
It's hard to wear those things with 
glasses on,

494
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:05,980
right?
Yes.

495
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,220
They are always talking about it.
The glasses digging your head that 

496
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,170
cannabis will.
W did not just cannabis,

497
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:23,171
but Campbell's will open the door to all
these different substances that will 

498
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,110
allow people to have to gain a greater 
perspective.

499
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,270
This is the ultimate goal,
in my opinion,

500
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,630
is to give people the opportunity to 
step outside of the momentum of their 

501
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,560
lives and look at things with fresh eyes
and make clear decisions.

502
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,830
This is one of the best things that I 
think that drugs provide is that these 

503
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,361
psychedelic drugs in particular provide 
an escape from the momentum of this life

504
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:46,220
that you've created or that you found 
yourself a part of.

505
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:51,221
It's very difficult for people to stop 
behavior patterns to stop and just look 

506
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,360
at themselves objectively and sort of 
rethink,

507
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:58,361
regroup and reassess and this is one of 
the best things about cannabis and about

508
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:04,031
suicide,
but in a lot of these other psychedelic 

509
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:06,341
drugs is that it gives you this newfound
perspective that allows you to 

510
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:06,470
reconsider things.

511
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,200
Yes,
absolutely.

512
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:11,710
And I think with Ketamine in the 
treatment of depression,

513
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:16,711
it's a similar idea because depressed 
people become used to these very 

514
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:21,730
ingrained patterns of thinking and 
anything that can break you out of that,

515
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:25,570
that can shake it up for a minute and 
maybe give you a different perspective I

516
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:28,270
think is inherently therapeutic.
Yeah,

517
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:29,740
I think so as well.
And I think

518
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,470
I'm hoping that what I see,
and this is what I believe I see,

519
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,380
is that we're changing our perceptions 
of it.

520
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:43,381
I had a conversation with a friend of 
mine the other day about marijuana 

521
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:43,700
where,
uh,

522
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,450
we were talking about,
um,

523
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,180
how you used to hide whether or not you 
did it from certain people and now that 

524
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:56,531
group of people that you have to hide it
from a smaller and smaller and that it 

525
00:25:56,531 --> 00:26:00,250
seems like everyone casually smokes 
marijuana now in,

526
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,390
in our circles,
there's so many people that do.

527
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:04,400
There's a few that don't sober people in
whatever,

528
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,610
but it's way more common.
Whereas 10,

529
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:12,611
15 years ago,
this was something you hid if you had a 

530
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:12,611
good job,
if you had a family.

531
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:13,640
This is not something you want people to
know about

532
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,220
in.
What I think is really interesting is 

533
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,920
that in and of itself changes the nature
of the cannabis experience.

534
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,430
So I think if somebody uses cannabis in 
a culture that supports it,

535
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,490
that approves of it,
their experience will be better by 

536
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,860
virtue of that fact.
So there's a certain shame that a lot of

537
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:35,390
people feel when using any drug I,
for whatever crazy reason,

538
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,400
feel it a little bit with cannabis.
It's a little just a hair of I should 

539
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,400
be,
you know,

540
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,610
I should be studying,
should be reading.

541
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,480
They should be you more focused.
This is a little hedonistic.

542
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:49,230
It's little comfort oriented.
I should be working harder,

543
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,320
but that's I think just the vestiges of 
this propaganda that I've been fed or 

544
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,510
something like that.
Or maybe it's true,

545
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,100
but I understand from one perspective 
why the cannabis culture,

546
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,470
drums,
the benefits of cannabis so hard.

547
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,810
You know that it cures all disease,
that it's good for you,

548
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:09,160
that it cures cancer,
all this stuff.

549
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,100
Because if you have that in your mind,
at the very least,

550
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:17,101
it's going to reduce that sort of 
internal shame that you might feel it 

551
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:20,191
makes the entire experience healthier 
and more beneficial because we do 

552
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:23,371
construct these limitations.
We construct these experiences to some 

553
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:26,371
extent.
So if you decide that cannabis is a 

554
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:28,981
dissociative drug that's hedonistic and 
comfort oriented and will take you away 

555
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,450
from your responsibilities and that's 
what it will become,

556
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,520
but if you decide like Terence Mckenna 
did,

557
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,610
that it's an intellectual catalyst that 
it will facilitate your ability to read 

558
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,200
and learn and think and write,
then it will become that as well.

559
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,680
Yeah,
it's,

560
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,090
it's a weird one,
right?

561
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,390
Because people that are people that take
it,

562
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,420
that are prone to paranoia or that are 
dealing with some difficult issues in 

563
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,980
their life right now that they're 
perhaps trying to avoid,

564
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,370
it becomes an uncomfortable experience.
Whereas people that are happy and having

565
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:05,420
a good time and in a good place,
the marijuana will sort of enhance that.

566
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,130
He was loving,
warm feeling of,

567
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,320
of comfort and have like sort of 
acceptance of your existence and it's 

568
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,640
going to be okay.

569
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Right?
But I think even the paranoia is like a 

570
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,260
sort of sort of,
um,

571
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:26,030
meme you could say a sort of vestige of 
this propaganda that makes people afraid

572
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:31,031
in the same vein as the bad trip.
I think the concept of a bad trip is a 

573
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:34,130
very damaging concept because,
and I know from personal experience,

574
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:38,030
I never really used psychedelics in high
school with the exception of Salvia,

575
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,610
um,
because I was terrified of a bad trip.

576
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,150
Talk to friends who'd described bad 
trips and they say,

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,230
oh,
it's bad.

578
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:47,720
It's bad trip.
It's really bad.

579
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,130
It's scary.
And I would think,

580
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:50,000
oh,
that's terrible.

581
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,830
I could,
I would never want a bad trip.

582
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:55,100
I'm never going to touch these things 
because a bad trip would be too much for

583
00:28:55,101 --> 00:29:00,101
me to tolerate.
And then I started using psychedelics 

584
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,861
and I realized there's no such thing as 
a bad trip anymore than there's a bad 

585
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:04,550
meal or a bad relationship or a bad day.

586
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,730
I mean,
having an occasional bad thing in life 

587
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,210
doesn't stop you from doing things like 
eating or having relationships or living

588
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:14,010
typically.
So what do you mean by this?

589
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,630
Are you saying there's no such thing as 
a bad trip saying there's no such thing 

590
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,110
as a bad meal?
I'm saying that there is such thing as a

591
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:27,111
bad meal but.
But it wouldn't prevent you from 

592
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:29,931
tripping.
And I think that even the bad or 

593
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:29,931
wouldn't prevent you from eating rather 
sorry about that,

594
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,200
but uh,
but I think even these bad trips,

595
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:36,201
although they can be difficult,
are beneficial and our learning 

596
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:36,201
experience in the same way that a bad 
meal could be.

597
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:41,091
You learned not to go to that restaurant
or maybe you learned something about 

598
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:41,091
what makes you sick or what to be 
careful of in the future.

599
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:45,830
You,
if you are approaching life from a non 

600
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,420
fearful perspective where your intention
is to learn,

601
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,570
then you can extract benefit from almost
any experience and these difficult 

602
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,470
psychedelic experiences.

603
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,470
I genuinely believe,
and this is what is maybe the hardest 

604
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,470
thing to communicate about psychedelics,
is that it's the difficult ones that are

605
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:03,610
often the best.
Those are the ones that really teach you

606
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:08,611
something.
And when you're trying to talk about 

607
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:08,611
psychedelics with people who've never 
used them,

608
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:09,990
it's not a great selling point to say,
oh,

609
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,590
you know,
the best thing that can happen is you're

610
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:16,591
going to think you're going to die.
But that is arguably the best thing that

611
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:22,161
can happen.
To think that you're going to die 

612
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:22,830
because that's a confrontation with the 
overarching fear,

613
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:26,160
the fear of that generates all other 
fears and if you conquer that fear,

614
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:26,910
then

615
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,420
your life will almost certainly 
improved.

616
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,450
Well,
what is one thing that's sort of 

617
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,521
genuine,
genuinely universally accepted as a 

618
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:38,060
beneficial experience is a near death 
experience,

619
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,290
sort of universally accepted as a 
transformative moment in people's lives.

620
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,510
Like I had this near death experience 
and I realized,

621
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,340
wow,
I gotta get my shit together.

622
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,490
After that heart attack,
I realized that life is a gift and I 

623
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,911
changed the way I think about things and
I started calling people that I loved 

624
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:55,660
and telling them that I loved them.
This is the same.

625
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,640
You can get a near death experience from
cannabis.

626
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:01,270
You just don't ever tie,
but you really do.

627
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,510
I mean,
it's the death of so many perceptions 

628
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,540
and so many things about your life,
especially from edible cannabis,

629
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:12,541
which I think is probably one of the 
least understood and most potent things 

630
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,070
that people are consuming on a daily 
basis.

631
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:20,071
I,
I can't tell you how many times I've 

632
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,781
given someone edible marijuana in their 
fucking convinced that it's been laced 

633
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,650
with something awful and that they're 
going to die,

634
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,320
but then afterwards they come out of it 
and they're like,

635
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,870
oh,
so I got some work to do.

636
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,640
The only way I would disagree with you 
is people that are prone to psychotic 

637
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,411
breaks because that there,
there is an absolute genuine connection 

638
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:46,360
between people who have a slippery hold 
on reality and some experiences with 

639
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,210
psychedelics that lead them down a bad 
road.

640
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,850
That's true.
It can.

641
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:57,810
It's a stressor and like all stressors,
it can precipitate a psychotic break.

642
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,960
A,
they've done pretty large scale 

643
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,281
epidemiological analyses of psychedelic 
drug users versus the non psychedelic 

644
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:08,740
drug using population and the incidence 
of mental illness isn't any higher.

645
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,700
So I don't think you can argue that 
psychedelics cause mental illness,

646
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:17,701
but you can add it in some measures.
It seems to actually reduce it in terms 

647
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,720
of things like alcoholism,
substance abuse disorders.

648
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,790
But,
um,

649
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,120
but it can be a stressor that would 
precipitate such an episode in a 

650
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,700
susceptible individual.
And I had a very traumatic and formative

651
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:34,701
experience myself for my best friend had
a psychotic break while I was with him 

652
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:36,090
tripping.
So I've seen this firsthand.

653
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,280
I know exactly what it looks like.
Yeah.

654
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,270
I've had friends.

655
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,150
I have real

656
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,150
bad experiences too where they're 
screaming and yelling and then 

657
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,830
disassociative and then afterwards 
become very strange and have a really 

658
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,670
hard time with reality for a bit.
Yeah.

659
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,710
I've never seen someone have a complete 
psychotic break promise that he never 

660
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:55,710
recovered.
He never,

661
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,210
he never recovered.
He was my best friend at the time and he

662
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,760
never recovered.
So he was fine before the psychedelic.

663
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,040
Yes.
Jesus Christ light again.

664
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:03,540
You know,
it's.

665
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,580
And that happened early.
So now he's still fucked.

666
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,430
Yes.
But again,

667
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,610
you know,
I,

668
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:15,611
I typically don't tell that story in 
public because it's could be 

669
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:18,220
misinterpreted as a scare story.
You know,

670
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,310
I don't.
It's impossible to prove the 

671
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,261
counterfactual.
Would it have happened without 

672
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:25,261
psychedelics?
Almost certainly.

673
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:29,220
I can't say.
All I know is that he took a very high 

674
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,911
dose of a Silicon Ester and um,
had this episode,

675
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,660
he was hospitalized and he was not the 
same afterwards.

676
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,620
So I'm aware that this is something that
happens,

677
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:44,110
but it also typically happens in the 
early twenties,

678
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,350
late teens,
the same time that people typically have

679
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
psychotic breaks and develop 
schizophrenia.

680
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,450
Yeah.
The incident.

681
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,480
This is of schizophrenia in people who 
use cannabis are a cannabis in 

682
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,251
particular,
but I don't know about other 

683
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,871
psychedelics,
but I would imagine they're very 

684
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,371
similar.
They're exactly the same as the 

685
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:05,760
incidences of schizophrenia and non 
using populations.

686
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:10,761
It's like one percent,
one percent across the board seemed to 

687
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:14,091
have issues with schizophrenia.
And the real question is how many of 

688
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:19,561
those people could mean isn't avoidable 
if your friend had never done that and 

689
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,730
instead had become a marathon runner or 
something and know,

690
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,360
found some other outlets for his energy,
would he have never gone down that road?

691
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,830
We don't know.
It's impossible.

692
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:36,831
It's impossible.
So I think it's very important to talk 

693
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,100
about that though.
And with further research,

694
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:43,101
perhaps we could isolate jeans they have
for cte now they have,

695
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,160
they can do an analysis of your genes 
and then determine whether or not 

696
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,541
something like football and be a 
dangerous path for you because you have 

697
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,380
a higher probability of developing cte.
It would be wonderful if they figured 

698
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:02,661
out a way to do that with psilocybin or 
with cannabis or with anything else and 

699
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,700
be able to recognize the potential links
to psychotic breaks and to,

700
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,330
you know,
a host of different mental disorders 

701
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,330
that could possibly be triggered by high
doses.

702
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,610
Yes.
I mean this is one of so many things 

703
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,180
that needs to be done and that's,
you know,

704
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,280
everyone's very excited about all of 
this clinical research that's happening 

705
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,280
right now.
I'm excited about it as well.

706
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,790
But on one level it is very politically 
oriented research,

707
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:33,791
you know,
the things that they're looking at have 

708
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:33,920
actually typically been done before.
Not all of it,

709
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,100
but the aim is to firmly establish these
things that have been known for a long 

710
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,920
time.
Silicide been occasions,

711
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,921
mystical type experience or Mtma is 
useful for treating ptsd or psilocybin 

712
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:51,891
has an anti addictive effect.
These are things that people have known 

713
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:53,520
for a little while,
but now it's about proving it,

714
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:58,521
but I'm really looking forward to 
getting deeper into these serious 

715
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:02,691
questions about,
you know exactly how these drugs 

716
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:06,180
interact with various subtypes of 
serotonin receptors because I think that

717
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:11,181
they're going to be very important tools
for understanding consciousness as a 

718
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:11,181
whole.

719
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,760
Yeah.
It would also be interesting knowing how

720
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:16,490
they react to different diets.
You know,

721
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,290
when people are,
you know,

722
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:23,950
when you're eating certain types of 
foods that are bad for your body,

723
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,070
I would really be curious to see what 
kind of effect that has.

724
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:32,071
I mean when,
when you have real large scale research 

725
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:35,431
that goes over really important 
variables in terms of human health and 

726
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:40,240
then you add in these different 
substances,

727
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:43,390
whether it's silicide or cannabis or 
whatever it is.

728
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,060
It's,
it's gonna be interesting to see how the

729
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:50,200
body reacts to these various 
preturbances,

730
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,000
these various changes of your state.

731
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,750
Yeah,
and that's,

732
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,840
you know,
traditionally in a lot of these 

733
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,610
indigenous groups,
the Diet plays a big role in the way 

734
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,821
that the drug is administered and I 
think we're slowly rediscovering a lot 

735
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,970
of things that have been known for tens,
maybe hundreds,

736
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:10,270
maybe thousands of years,
and some of these indigenous groups.

737
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,600
Have you had a chance to see any of my 
new show?

738
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,410
No,
no,

739
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:15,070
I haven't.
Oh,

740
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,280
I think you'd like it.
I'm sure I'd liked it.

741
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,760
I liked her old show.
This is,

742
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,800
I think it's a lot better than the old 
show.

743
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,790
Yeah.
Awesome.

744
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,930
Yeah,
but I,

745
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,510
you know,
I had the opportunity to look at the way

746
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:30,370
Salvia is used in the mountains of 
Wahaca and you know,

747
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,300
native American peyote use and all these
different things and yeah,

748
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:39,301
there's so much to be learned from all 
of these traditions that are not 

749
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:42,800
reflected in the current clinical 
climate because they can't be.

750
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,830
But I think that that's going to be a 
part of it is slowly integrating these 

751
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,430
other alkaloids that are present in the 
plants to see what role they play in the

752
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:50,510
same way that,
you know,

753
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,840
the initial medicalization of cannabis 
was Marinol,

754
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:58,841
which is just phc and sesame oil,
but now there's increased understanding 

755
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:03,181
of the way these accessory cannabinoids 
modulate the thc experience or whether 

756
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,020
thc is even the primary therapeutic 
agent for certain disorders.

757
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,320
And I imagine the same thing will be 
true for Peo Odi and for the Iboga 

758
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,020
alkaloids and probably even for some of 
the chemicals found in mushrooms.

759
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,780
So when you're doing this show,
have you had any problems?

760
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,050
Have you had any,
uh,

761
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,470
push back against what you're doing or 
any,

762
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,230
any issues with it?
Being on vice?

763
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,110
I've had an enormous amount of freedom,
you know,

764
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,160
ultimately I have very little to 
complain about when it comes to 

765
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,670
censorship.
There was,

766
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:41,200
um,
it,

767
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,560
the way the show got started,
the actual TV show is sort of an 

768
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,381
interesting story where they were 
starting up vice land and a producer 

769
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:53,011
who's now gone a gave me this deck of 
drug stories they were going to do and 

770
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:57,121
there are all kinds of terrible scare 
stories like the new drug Bromo Dragon 

771
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:01,351
flying.
It's killing teens and new drug Bromo 

772
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:01,351
driving.
Yeah.

773
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:01,750
Yeah.
What does that,

774
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,540
it's a really fascinating compound 
developed by this chemist David Nichols,

775
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,260
who,
um,

776
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,980
found that,
that these confirmation,

777
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,990
highly constrained Benzo fear in a 
amphetamine derivatives are like very 

778
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,780
high potency dob derivatives.
Anyway,

779
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:21,781
it's just a,
it's a super potent psychedelic 

780
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:21,781
amphetamine that has a cool tryciclics 
structure.

781
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,190
Huh?
Then it looks like a dragon fly.

782
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,440
The molecule looks like a dragon fly 
kind of.

783
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,880
And it's got a very high,
isn't it?

784
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,020
It's super,
super potent and very,

785
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:35,920
very long lasting.
So it lent itself to scare stories.

786
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,480
Um,
you know,

787
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,630
people,
it is a potent vasoconstrictor so people

788
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,900
will take very high doses of it and 
occasionally they would have to amputate

789
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,720
a finger or something like that.
But again,

790
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,600
you know,
this isn't because the drug is bad,

791
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:52,360
it's because people used it 
irresponsibly and this is something that

792
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:54,730
people have so much difficulty 
understanding.

793
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,910
We're so eager to blame drugs for all of
our problems.

794
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:02,911
Drugs have never heard anyone.
They're just inanimate constellations of

795
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:05,200
carbon and hydrogen,
nitrogen and oxygen.

796
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:10,201
They don't jump out of their bags and 
vials and attack your serotonin 

797
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:12,280
receptors for dopamine transport or 
anything like that.

798
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,520
So this is just a weird pattern that 
we've done repeatedly over time.

799
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,170
And I don't know if you read the new 
Michael Paulin book.

800
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:22,420
I know he was on the podcast I'm in 
right now.

801
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,710
Yeah,
it's great.

802
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,910
Yeah,
it is great.

803
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,720
But,
um,

804
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,780
one thing that I thought was interesting
about it is that he put a lot of the 

805
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,580
emphasis on the prohibition of 
psychedelics on leary and leary almost 

806
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:41,491
certainly played a role,
but I think it's slightly ironic that 

807
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:44,230
he's a journalist and didn't really go 
that deep into the role that journalists

808
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,360
played in all of this,
which was humongous.

809
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:51,361
You know,
journalists are sculptors of public 

810
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,551
opinion and it became the standard way 
of reporting on any of these things to 

811
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:56,920
say that they're bad,
to sensationalize it and to not have any

812
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:01,921
consideration for what that would do 
because anytime a journalist writes him 

813
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:05,620
scare story,
they can really mess with drug policy in

814
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:06,430
a serious way.

815
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,870
It might seem like nothing like,
oh,

816
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:12,871
there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn 
and they overdosed on some obscure 

817
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:17,491
synthetic cannabinoid amb food minuka 
who cares about amb food Venica no big 

818
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:22,201
deal.
Say that it turns people into zombies 

819
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:22,201
and if it gets thrown into schedule one,
who cares?

820
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,440
Not a big deal.
Well,

821
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,800
that's a very short sighted way of 
thinking about all of this because 

822
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,910
that's exactly what happened with 
psychedelics and then we're not learning

823
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:35,911
from the mistakes of the past that just 
because something it's fun to 

824
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,970
sensationalize and talk about how 
dangerous it is at this moment doesn't 

825
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,721
mean that 10 years from now we're going 
to recognize it as serious therapeutic 

826
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:46,961
potential and we made a big mistake 
outlawing it and I think a lot of that 

827
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:51,131
also comes from this sort of us versus 
them mentality that people have where 

828
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:52,250
it's cannabis is good.

829
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,310
Synthetic cannabinoids are bad.
Well synthetic cannabinoids don't have 

830
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,291
to be bad for cannabis to be good.
Cannabis can be good without something 

831
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,080
else being bad.
To counterbalance that you don't need to

832
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:07,081
hate something to justify your love of 
cannabis and this whole hatred of 

833
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:11,401
synthetic cannabinoids I think is 
totally misdirected because these are 

834
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:14,850
products of prohibition that most people
wouldn't even want to use in the first 

835
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,290
place and when they do use them,
they don't know what they're taking.

836
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:22,291
They don't know what dose they're 
consuming and so of course they're 

837
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,480
having bad experiences.
That would happen with almost any drug,

838
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:27,481
caffeine included if people just 
consumed enormous unmeasured doses 

839
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:32,171
without having any idea what they were 
getting into and so they're thrown into 

840
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:33,620
schedule one or what happens if 30 years
from now,

841
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,740
once the therapeutic potential of 
cannabinoids as being really seriously 

842
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,031
explored,
we find out that that Ambi Food Venica 

843
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:45,791
that everyone was saying turned homeless
people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 

844
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:49,100
turns out to activate a certain subtype 
of the CB one receptor that's especially

845
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:51,560
useful for Parkinson's disease or 
something like that.

846
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,900
Then we're going to regret having done 
that.

847
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,880
So I think people have to be very 
careful.

848
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,920
Anytime you say anything negative about 
a drug,

849
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:02,921
you have to be very,
very careful because the implications 

850
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:05,351
can be enormous.
I think that the best stance and all of 

851
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:07,750
this is to not speak ill of drug

852
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,580
drug.
The drugs are true drug enthusiastic,

853
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,930
but it's not a problem.
Also with just what journalism is.

854
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:19,050
It's like asking a comedian to talk 
about something but not make fun of it.

855
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:23,490
That's what their job in a certain sense
is to get people excited about things.

856
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,970
And I don't know whether you'd say the 
lazy way out or the common approach is 

857
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,790
to say something that scares people.
I mean that's.

858
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,830
That's what clickbait is mostly about 
either outrage or fear.

859
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,680
That's true,
but there's a lot of richness in truth.

860
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,660
I agree,
but it's hard to sell.

861
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,820
It's hard to settle that rich and hard 
to sell.

862
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:42,600
I think the people are

863
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,640
lazy,
you know,

864
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,520
is this idea that a lot of people have 
that,

865
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,680
you know,
journalism is organized by some 

866
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,570
malevolent Rupert Murdoch type puppeteer
who's telling everyone to.

867
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,870
You go off and you say that cannabis 
causes car accidents.

868
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,890
When you go off and you say this evil 
thing about this and say that again.

869
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:05,890
Alcohol is good.
Did you see when a Alex Jones was on my 

870
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,530
podcast and got high with me when I'm 
drunk and I.

871
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,370
and when it came up in his trial for his
divorce,

872
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,150
he said that George Soros puts a.
He tests marijuana every year to see how

873
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:24,381
much George Soros is influencing the 
levels of thc was his excuse that people

874
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,900
love these ideas.
They love the ideas of the,

875
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,370
the malevolent

876
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,340
puppeteer.
Because it denies individual agency,

877
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,400
but the reality,
and I say this as a journalist who's 

878
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,400
worked at many different publications,
not just vice is,

879
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,660
and this is a difficult reality to 
swallow,

880
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,810
is that people are free to say whatever 
they want.

881
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,920
Most of the time journalists choose to 
report on things this way.

882
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,530
It's true,
but it's also true that they like.

883
00:44:53,531 --> 00:44:58,531
I've been a part of stories that I've 
talked to the author of it and they 

884
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:58,531
said,
well,

885
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,580
this was manipulated by the editor.
The editor manipulated the title,

886
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:03,470
the chain.
It's a great excuse the perspective,

887
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,530
but it's true.
Like the rolling stone did an article 

888
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,611
about me and they called me as 
psychedelic warrior and I said to the 

889
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:11,740
guy who wrote down,
what the fuck is that?

890
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:13,000
I was laughing and he goes,
dude,

891
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,660
I did not write that.
Yeah.

892
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,100
The editor gets a hold of it,
tries to make it more salacious.

893
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:20,200
It becomes something that's

894
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:25,590
more.
It's more likely for people to buy or 

895
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:25,590
click.
Right.

896
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,940
Especially with headlines that that is 
true and the real problem is that the 

897
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:35,241
sort of outrage culture and comment 
culture that has emerged provides no 

898
00:45:35,241 --> 00:45:40,231
incentive for truth because suppose 
someone were to write an article about 

899
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:45,811
this conversation we're having right now
and it could say Hamilton Morris says 

900
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:47,050
Creton should be illegal,
or something like that.

901
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Then that will get so much more 
engagement because then you'll have all 

902
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,140
these people saying,
fuck Hamilton.

903
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,810
He,
he's a,

904
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,060
he's a trader.
How dare he say that?

905
00:45:55,061 --> 00:46:00,061
It should be illegal that it didn't 
watch it and then you'll have other 

906
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:00,061
people arguing with those people saying,
well,

907
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:00,830
listen to the interview.
Hey,

908
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,880
he actually never said anything about 
that and listened carefully to what you 

909
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:05,890
saying and then you create this whole 
engagement,

910
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:08,140
a bigger engagement for doing the wrong 
thing.

911
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,790
Then you'd get for doing the right 
thing.

912
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,380
True,
but.

913
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:10,500
But

914
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,240
the initial statement is much stickier.
The initial statement of Hamilton Morris

915
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:20,270
is a bad guy because he thinks kratom 
should be illegal or Katam should be 

916
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:24,351
illegal.
That is what more people are going to 

917
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:24,990
pay attention to.
Far less people read the retraction than

918
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,960
read the initial worries.
This is one of the more insidious things

919
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,260
about printing things that are patently 
untrue,

920
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,710
purposely that people do do things that 
are untrue with the caveat that they 

921
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:41,331
could just print a retraction that maybe
30 percent of the people that read the 

922
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:41,331
original article,
we're going to read that.

923
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,220
The initial imprint is what's going to 
stick with people.

924
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,980
Even if you.
Someone calls you a rapist,

925
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,070
okay,
and then it turns out that the person 

926
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,021
who called you a rapist was lying.
The people heard you were a rapist 

927
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:54,120
first.
They still have that in their head.

928
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,520
Oh,
he's a rapist rapist,

929
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,510
right?
It's just,

930
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,720
it's very difficult to get slippery 
ideas out of people's heads.

931
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:05,721
So if somebody writes some articles 
saying that you're against the 

932
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:10,041
legalization of certain drugs and they 
start looking at you as being 

933
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,251
compromised,
it's the influence that people have 

934
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,810
today can't be understated because the 
reach is so powerful.

935
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,800
The reach of any article,
any video,

936
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,890
any.
It's so significantly greater than any 

937
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,761
other sort of distribution of 
information in the history of human 

938
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,070
beings.
They have the

939
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,720
potential for it impacting large groups 
of people is so huge now.

940
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,830
Yes,
and this is the result of that is also 

941
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,991
that the viewers have a lot of power and
I think that in some sense they don't 

942
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:45,220
quite recognize the nature of that 
power.

943
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:49,210
It's like voting with your dollar.
If you spend all of your time commenting

944
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:54,211
hatefully on things you don't like,
you are actively encouraging the 

945
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,230
production of more of that thing that 
you don't like.

946
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,770
If you like something,
you need to engage with what you approve

947
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:03,850
of more because every time you engage 
with something you dislike,

948
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,910
advertisements are sold and it has been 
incentivized to do that bad thing and 

949
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,261
that's a really sticky thing when we 
have this culture where everyone loves 

950
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:17,011
to out show their outrage and virtue 
signal and show that they're on the 

951
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:19,150
right side and all this stuff constantly
to say,

952
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,170
hey,
step back.

953
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,300
You're just feeding the problem.
Yeah.

954
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,630
I think there's also a problem with a 
lot of what people are doing during the 

955
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,700
day is something they don't want to do.
A lot of what people are doing is some 

956
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,691
job that they don't enjoy and during 
that job they have freedom to go online 

957
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:39,970
and in this state of feeling like shit 
about what they're doing,

958
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
they enjoy complaining about stuff and 
so the they'll read things and type 

959
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,321
things and get engaged in things and 
there's some sort of a sport getting 

960
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:52,720
pissed off about stuff.
Instead of just spending your time doing

961
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,120
things you actually enjoy.
It seems so simple.

962
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,180
It sounds like a simple solution,
but if you could figure out a way to 

963
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,460
actively ignore things that are going to
piss you off and seek out things that 

964
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:07,180
are going to excite you and intrigue 
you,

965
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,650
you're going to be a healthier,
happier person and it doesn't.

966
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,850
That is that ultimately what everybody 
wants.

967
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,400
I want to be happier.
Don't you want to be happier?

968
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:20,430
Of course,
but why do we seek out shit that pisses 

969
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:20,500
us off?
Because it becomes a sort of addiction.

970
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,140
It's drug like in and of itself.
I mean,

971
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:24,490
I see it.
These arguments,

972
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:27,610
these people are frittering away,
finite time on earth,

973
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,020
engage in these endless common battles 
that no one reads and uh,

974
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,260
and it's a very dark reality,
but it is also something that's driving 

975
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,380
the current culture of journalism that 
we're.

976
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,860
Truth doesn't matter as much.
All that matters is engagement,

977
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,780
right?
It's just clicks.

978
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:51,781
It's just clicks and money.
It's interesting that you were saying 

979
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,151
something about drugs being inanimate 
objects and drugs don't actually kill 

980
00:49:54,151 --> 00:49:58,321
people.
It's so funny how drug enthusiast 

981
00:49:58,321 --> 00:49:59,320
parallel gun enthusiasts with their 
arguments.

982
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:02,290
It's really the same freedom argument 
and it's,

983
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:07,291
it's really,
I'm in an interesting perspective 

984
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:07,540
because I live in New York.
I'm like a whatever,

985
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,910
just a nerdy guy that doesn't let me 
guess.

986
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,940
You live in Williamsburg.
I do a big surprise.

987
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:20,041
So that's where the office,
I live close to the office that I work 

988
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:20,041
at,
but uh,

989
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:22,570
but you know,
I have no interest in guns.

990
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,090
I'm not,
so it's really easy for me to say,

991
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:27,980
well look,
there was this shooting and

992
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
all these people died and uh,
and this other guy got shot and these 

993
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,040
things are really causing a lot of 
problems.

994
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:39,041
Let's get rid of them because it doesn't
impact me and that's where you have to 

995
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,321
be the most careful because the worst 
thing you can possibly do is make 

996
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:46,541
judgments about how other people should 
conduct their lives based on your own 

997
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:47,600
preferences which people do all the 
time.

998
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,590
So you hear someone say,
well,

999
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,600
I don't like cannabis.
I don't like him.

1000
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:52,190
I don't smoke it.
Why should it be legal?

1001
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Because people go to prison for it 
because it ruins people's lives who 

1002
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,491
aren't your own.
And you have to think about people that 

1003
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:00,860
aren't you.
And so it's very difficult when it comes

1004
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:05,861
to gun control issues because this,
I'm faced with that exact same issue 

1005
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:08,300
where it would be so easy for me to say,
get rid of them all.

1006
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,160
It doesn't impact me.
I don't like guns,

1007
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,160
but I don't want to fall into that same 
trap.

1008
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,510
Yeah,
it is a trap

1009
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,640
and it's,
it also sort of highlights how slippery 

1010
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,670
life is in general that these absolutes 
that we look for,

1011
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:23,370
these ones and Zeros,
they don't necessarily exist in a lot of

1012
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,840
subjects.
You know,

1013
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:29,841
there's,
there's a lot of people that have done 

1014
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,740
bad things that have also done great 
things and that gets weird to,

1015
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,350
you know,
just human beings in general.

1016
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:35,310
We're,
we're not,

1017
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,920
we're,
we're complex preachers,

1018
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,280
you know,
and to just categorize something as 

1019
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,620
negative or positive,
it's,

1020
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,600
there's a lot of positive things that 
you could find with drugs.

1021
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,360
There's a lot of negative things you 
could find the drugs too,

1022
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:57,630
and they,
mere human behavior does a lot of 

1023
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:57,630
positive and negatives and humans

1024
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,400
behavior.
Yes.

1025
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:04,090
And back to this,
this journalistic issue in the coverage 

1026
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:04,090
of drugs,
I mean,

1027
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:08,060
one thing that worries me about the way 
cannabis and Creton and psychedelics are

1028
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:11,090
presented is that it's always couched in
their safe.

1029
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,800
They're therapeutic,
they're spiritual,

1030
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,530
they're historical,
but that isn't the point.

1031
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,870
Even if all those things are true and 
there's some debate,

1032
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,480
eventually someone will find a chink in 
that armor.

1033
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:22,730
Someone will die.
Maybe they're not,

1034
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,610
haven't been used as long as you thought
they were used.

1035
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,800
Maybe they don't always work 
therapeutically,

1036
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,570
so then what do you go back to?
Prohibition?

1037
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,220
No,
that's why I think you need to emphasize

1038
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:34,580
cognitive liberty.
You need to emphasize people to write,

1039
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,760
to explore these alternate states of 
consciousness regardless of whether or 

1040
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,450
not they're therapeutic or safe or 
traditional or spiritual.

1041
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,870
The point isn't that it's safe or any of
these other things.

1042
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,570
The point is that if you want to live in
a free society,

1043
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,200
you have to be allowed to take a certain
amount of risk.

1044
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,230
Yeah,
that's.

1045
00:52:52,231 --> 00:52:53,120
That's a big point.

1046
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,220
That's a very big point and I think it 
really fits well with your description 

1047
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,760
of the things that people are allowed to
do that are legal,

1048
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,040
that are very dangerous,
like race,

1049
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:06,720
car driving,
bungee jumping,

1050
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,550
all these things that we just allow them
to do.

1051
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:12,510
We don't think twice about it using a 
parachute.

1052
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,650
All that crazy shit.
We just openly and nobody's saying,

1053
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,470
hey,
we should ban skydiving.

1054
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,300
There was no one saying that.
The fucking.

1055
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,890
A lot of people die.
Skydiving,

1056
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:23,730
man.
I mean,

1057
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:27,300
it's fucking dangerous.
We don't seem to care.

1058
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,230
We seem to care about drugs because we 
think that somehow or another,

1059
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:35,640
either our children or someone we know 
is going to be insidiously infected with

1060
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,570
these things they're going to get into 
their lives and,

1061
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,640
and fuck them up.
You know?

1062
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,030
And I think the real problem with that 
is education.

1063
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,290
That's the real problem with that.

1064
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,500
I was extremely fortunate in a weird way
to see someone with a cocaine addiction 

1065
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:53,400
when I was in high school as a good 
friend's cousin who got really fucked up

1066
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:58,401
on cocaine when he was a couple of years
older than me and I watched his life 

1067
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,900
fall apart and I remember thinking when 
I was little like wow,

1068
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:04,110
I don't want to touch that shit.
Like cocaine's fucking terrible.

1069
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,020
And then from then on I've never done 
cocaine,

1070
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,610
but it's because of that education 
because of.

1071
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,760
And I think real education is something 
Pitsa fucking tough thing because you 

1072
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:19,820
don't really just get it from knowing 
information.

1073
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,190
You have to see things,
you have to talk to people,

1074
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:23,510
you have to experience things in your 
own.

1075
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,490
Like if someone talks about 
psychedelics,

1076
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:30,491
someone teaches about psychedelics,
but they have no experience in actual 

1077
00:54:30,491 --> 00:54:32,690
psychedelic states personally.
It's a very hollow conversation.

1078
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,490
It's like a certain amount of education 
has to be from real life experience.

1079
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,090
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1080
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,360
And the other thing is just again,
this idea of pharmacological 

1081
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,050
determinism,
like I had a friend that was very,

1082
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:51,051
very,
very seriously addicted to cocaine and 

1083
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:52,860
had the resources to do immense 
quantities every single day.

1084
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,810
And he'd always say,
well,

1085
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,520
you know,
if I try heroin,

1086
00:54:56,521 --> 00:55:00,450
I know it's all over for me.
I know that will be the last straw,

1087
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,760
so I'm never touching that stuff and he 
didn't.

1088
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,860
But my own perspective,
you know,

1089
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:09,861
I've essentially tried everything and if
you really just think about these things

1090
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,220
you can actually learn.
For example,

1091
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:15,080
I've tried heroin once,
I didn't think.

1092
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:17,060
Was that interesting?
Did you do it injecting?

1093
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,300
No,
you snort it.

1094
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,010
I snorted it.
Yeah.

1095
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:19,880
Yeah.
What was it like?

1096
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,360
It was boring,
I think.

1097
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,160
Boring.
Yeah.

1098
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,400
I don't think opiates are very 
interesting drugs psychologically.

1099
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,740
You know,
if I were to be totally honest,

1100
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:32,741
I think the cannabis is more euphoric 
and has so few side effects.

1101
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,060
You know,
opioids cause horrible constipation.

1102
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:38,150
They cause all kinds of weird sweating 
problems.

1103
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,160
I don't think they're especially 
pleasant drugs,

1104
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,760
but they're romanticized so much in our 
culture that people think that's it.

1105
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,410
Heroin,
the ultimate high.

1106
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,450
Well maybe it isn't.
Maybe it's not even that great at all.

1107
00:55:47,451 --> 00:55:49,710
Maybe it's garbage and it doesn't even 
matter.

1108
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,740
That's the same way I feel about snorted
cocaine.

1109
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,910
I don't even think it's a good drug.
It's not an issue of it's so addictive.

1110
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:58,520
You've got to stay away from it because 
it's so damn good.

1111
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,520
It's not good.
It's not even an enjoyable high.

1112
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:06,521
It has a short duration.
It you then feel bad almost immediately 

1113
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:08,600
afterwards.
It's a flawed substance.

1114
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,220
Same is true of alcohol,
I think as well.

1115
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:13,880
Alcohol is a crazily flawed molecule.
It's terrible.

1116
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:19,120
No other drug that I can think of causes
a hangover of that type where there's a 

1117
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,060
toxic metabolite that poisons you.
The following day,

1118
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,400
Dr Carl Hart

1119
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,400
was trying to explain to me what that is
and essentially he was saying that when 

1120
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,571
you are getting a hangover,
it's your body reacting to the addictive

1121
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:38,641
properties of alcohol,
that you're getting addicted to alcohol 

1122
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:41,971
almost almost immediately that your body
is compensating for that and then these,

1123
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,760
this,
this,

1124
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,930
this hangover is not just you being 
dehydrated,

1125
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:50,030
it's also your body withdrawing from 
alcohol.

1126
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,960
I would.
I am not familiar with any evidence for 

1127
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,310
that.
Dr Garcia actually tried to enter in the

1128
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,060
forum when I first moved to love that 
guy.

1129
00:56:59,110 --> 00:56:59,420
Yeah,
he.

1130
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,440
I have a lot of respect for them,
but I mean there's a.

1131
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,640
I'd have to look at is source for that.
You'd have to also look at the way I 

1132
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:06,980
described it because I probably 
butchered it.

1133
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:12,100
Okay,
but there's an alternate explanation 

1134
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,261
that's even simpler,
which is simply that alcohol is 

1135
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:15,150
metabolized into chemical assets held to
high.

1136
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,780
That's toxic so and with alcohol,
it's a very,

1137
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:19,130
very weak drug.
By weight,

1138
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:24,131
you're consuming insane amounts in terms
of the number of molecules you're 

1139
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:28,870
consuming insane quantities of the drug.
So all of this acid aldehyde accumulates

1140
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:32,270
in your body and it has a directly toxic
effect.

1141
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,180
Is there a way to counteract that?
Mitigate the effects?

1142
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,760
Yes,
there are proposed ways to do it.

1143
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:42,761
I haven't experimented with any of them 
myself because they don't really like 

1144
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:44,600
alcohol that much to begin with is in a 
glutathione that's a,

1145
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,660
that's something that allows your body 
to process it more easily.

1146
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,380
It would have to be something that 
prevents this specific conversion.

1147
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,670
I don't know off the top of my head.
What about Krokodil?

1148
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,280
You ever fuck with that stuff?
Well,

1149
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:03,281
this is another perfect example.
So you take a drug like Krokodil and 

1150
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:03,630
it's,
it sounds horrible.

1151
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,390
The Internet's drug the other fear drug,
yet people are.

1152
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,090
But behind every scare story,
there's nothing.

1153
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,810
Explain what that is.
So there's a scare story that,

1154
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:16,220
I believe it was in Moscow somewhere in 
Russia in,

1155
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:21,230
and this was hitting the news around 
2004.

1156
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:21,560
No,
no,

1157
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,440
no,
much later,

1158
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:26,910
2010,
something like that.

1159
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,590
I don't know.
And um,

1160
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,110
and the idea was that this is the worst 
stuff.

1161
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:36,111
It's ultra addictive.
You inject it and then you lose a limb 

1162
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:39,010
and you have profound necrosis all 
around the injection site,

1163
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,650
and this is the worst drug,
most addictive drug of all time.

1164
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,800
Well,
the drug itself is called desert 

1165
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,770
morphine and it's been used medicinally.
There's nothing especially addictive or 

1166
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:53,101
dangerous at all that desert morphine.
The problem is that people were 

1167
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:56,401
injecting completely impure reaction 
mixtures that had all of the components 

1168
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,810
from the synthesis that hadn't been 
removed,

1169
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,380
including phosphorus,
which is immensely toxic,

1170
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:08,650
so you have people basically reporting 
on ivy phosphorus toxicity as if it were

1171
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:13,250
a result of this drug when it's a 
completely separate issue,

1172
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,460
and this is what you see when you look 
at all of these things.

1173
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:19,220
It's never the drug,
any drug scare story.

1174
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:24,221
It's never the drug.
You always have to look for the root 

1175
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:26,180
cause because it's never the drug.
There's never been a drug in history and

1176
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,870
that is why if you look at the dea list 
of controlled substances,

1177
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:33,870
it's not dangerous drugs that are 
controlled.

1178
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,850
It's enjoyable drugs.

1179
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,470
Something like tetrodotoxin the chemical
and puffer fish.

1180
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:42,380
That's not a controlled substance.
There's some regulations in terms of how

1181
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:44,540
much you can purchase,
but it's not a controlled substance.

1182
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,810
Sega toxin,
the most potent known neurotoxin.

1183
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,440
It's not a controlled substance.
Lead isn't a controlled substance.

1184
00:59:52,441 --> 00:59:57,441
Mercury isn't a controlled substance.
Mercury chloride isn't a controlled 

1185
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,710
substance.
All of the deadly poisons.

1186
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:03,830
Cyanide isn't a controlled substance.
It's not about what's safe and what's 

1187
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,110
dangerous.
It's about what people like to use.

1188
01:00:04,111 --> 01:00:06,660
What's enjoyable,
what is the root of that.

1189
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,450
I think it's,
you know,

1190
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:14,451
a puritanical idea that,
that any sort of euphoria is bad.

1191
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:20,981
I mean,
euphoria is listed as a side effect in 

1192
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:23,531
some medications.
We assume that it's a bad thing to deal 

1193
01:00:23,531 --> 01:00:25,850
with diarrhea.
It's like euphoria.

1194
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:26,450
Diarrhea.

1195
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:29,420
That is a strange thing.
Like that's gonna.

1197
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,160
It's gonna,
cut back productivity,

1198
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,420
make you a lazy Ne'er do well and just 
become a,

1199
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:38,990
a burden on society.
That's common,

1200
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,790
common way of describing people use 
drugs.

1201
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,820
Sure.
And this fundamental idea that sobriety 

1202
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:46,820
is good.
Yes.

1203
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:46,950
You know,
you look on Instagram,

1204
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:49,860
people post a selfie and say six months 
sober.

1205
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:54,861
Guys,
thank you so much and tons of 

1206
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:55,230
congratulations because it's a virtue 
because you accomplished something.

1207
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:57,120
You're not using drugs.
Yeah.

1208
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,800
Whereas in other cultures that would not
be the case.

1209
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:01,520
People would just say,
Oh,

1210
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:05,270
you've decided not to work with a a 
certain medicine.

1211
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,130
That's an interesting choice.
Not An accomplishment.

1212
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:13,170
I was saying,
was it Kyle Kingsbury there was saying 

1213
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,020
that how much he hates the term plant 
medicine or was it Dennis?

1214
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,010
That was kyle.
You don't like the term plant medicine,

1215
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,100
do I don't?
Well,

1216
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:23,860
Dubai is a.
it's a weird sort of pretentious.

1217
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,610
Yes.
Yes.

1218
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:25,030
I know.
Well,

1219
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:27,430
people call Iowasca the medicine or 
things like that.

1220
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:28,630
Yeah.
Or towed medicine.

1221
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,710
I mean,
I wouldn't.

1222
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,350
You don't hate it.
I a lot of these,

1223
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:34,560
like more flowery terms.
Again,

1224
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,440
theologian,
I just don't use them myself,

1225
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:39,300
but I don't hate it.
Would your,

1226
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,890
you know,
I think people like you are very 

1227
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,571
important and I'm a big fan,
but I think one of the reasons why 

1228
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:50,080
you're important as you are a cognitive 
center of real drugs like you,

1229
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:56,131
you understand what they actually do.
You could explain them to the layman or 

1230
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:01,910
you could debate them with someone who 
was a doctor perhaps that wanted to,

1231
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:07,310
you know,
to talk about the dangers of them and 

1232
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,891
you understand all the various aspects 
of it and I think there's a tremendous 

1233
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,000
amount of ignorance when it comes to 
drugs,

1234
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:12,890
drug consumption.
What is a drug?

1235
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,920
I mean,
how many times have you seen a person 

1236
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:17,920
with a beer in their hand smoking a 
cigarette saying they don't do drugs.

1237
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,290
It is so fucking stupid,
but it's.

1238
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:23,350
It's so common.
There is this very,

1239
01:02:23,351 --> 01:02:28,351
very,
very common aspect of being a person 

1240
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,260
which is these desire to change your 
mental state and we've done it 

1241
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:33,050
throughout history with various 
substances,

1242
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:38,150
but there's so much stigma attached to 
it and one of the things I've been doing

1243
01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:40,190
lately on stage,
I'll ask people,

1244
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:43,230
how many people get piss tested at work?
It's fucking stunning.

1245
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:48,530
It's stunning.
It's like more than 10 percent of the 

1246
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,601
audience will raise their hand.
Like one out of 10 people gets through 

1247
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,310
their body tested to make sure that 
while they're not working,

1248
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:58,311
they're.
They're not putting anything in their 

1249
01:02:58,311 --> 01:02:58,311
body.
That's prohibited,

1250
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:01,350
which is such a horrible invasion of 
privacy that became so popular that in 

1251
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,190
the eighties during one presidential 
election,

1252
01:03:03,191 --> 01:03:08,191
all the candidates voluntarily had their
urine tested to prove that they were 

1253
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:08,191
sober.
I mean,

1254
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:11,560
this is like truly considered a virtue 
and it's immensely invasive.

1255
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:16,561
I say this as someone who's analyzed my 
own urine in a laboratory before and 

1256
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,090
it's like a strange portal into your own
life that you're showing to a stranger.

1257
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:21,640
Everything that you've consumed is then 
a parent there.

1258
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:22,960
Yeah,
and it's incredibly.

1259
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:26,950
It's a huge invasion of privacy that 
we've just decided is acceptable and you

1260
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:29,110
have to be very careful about these 
things.

1261
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:30,160
Yeah,
no,

1262
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:35,161
I agree.
It's and of course the synthetic 

1263
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:36,040
cannabinoid epidemic,
if you want to call it that,

1264
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:41,041
I actually don't want to call it that 
because I hate even the idea of a drug 

1265
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:45,121
epidemic,
but the popularity of synthetic 

1266
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,011
cannabinoids is largely driven by the 
fact that they didn't show up on these 

1267
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:49,690
urine tests,
so initially it was in the military than

1268
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,480
it was people who are on parole or 
probation.

1269
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:56,610
People who were living hard lives 
wanting to get high,

1270
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,960
couldn't get high.
This was a way that they could do it,

1271
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:04,080
and so they've incentivized people that 
just wanted to smoke weed using 

1272
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,190
completely untested synthetic 
cannabinoids instead,

1273
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,350
as a direct result of these urine tests.

1274
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,240
Well,
it's also just a complete 

1275
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,621
misunderstanding that comes to the 
actual effects and how long they last 

1276
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:22,531
you.
Now you're not even testing a person's 

1277
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:24,480
conscious state.
You're testing whether or not a person 

1278
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,440
has altered their state of consciousness
outside of their working time.

1279
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,100
You know,
it's not like you show up and they could

1280
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,460
scan your hand and realize that you're 
high on marijuana right now.

1281
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:38,790
That's not what they're doing.
What they're doing is they're testing 

1282
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,061
you for something that could linger in 
your body for weeks after the 

1283
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:42,370
psychoactive effects of long since gone,

1284
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Oh yeah.
Or even be the result of passive 

1285
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,131
exposure.
There was a great scientific article 

1286
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:52,321
that came out a couple of years ago 
where they found that just passive 

1287
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,201
exposure to cannabis smoke contaminates 
your hair with thc so that all these 

1288
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:58,120
people who had hair tests,
who actually had not smoked cannabis,

1289
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:00,400
but it sounds like an excuse,
I was just in the room,

1290
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,700
someone else is doing it,
just being in contact with someone who'd

1291
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:08,701
smoked cannabis could then deposit thc 
in your hair and cause you to test 

1292
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:10,690
positive so these tests aren't even 
necessarily reliable.

1293
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,200
This is the same problem.
There was a kind of trend a little while

1294
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,220
ago,
I don't know if you saw about this,

1295
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:20,221
where people would get their urine for 
different to quantify the levels of 

1296
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:22,510
neurotransmitter metabolites in the 
urine and this was supposed to be like a

1297
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:27,511
fingerprint of your mood,
so they'd quantify the level of 

1298
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:27,511
Serotonin,
dopamine,

1299
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:27,910
Gaba,
whatever,

1300
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:28,780
whatever,
whatever,

1301
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,590
and then they'd say,
oh,

1302
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:32,020
you're a little low on Saratonin.
You're pretty depressed.

1303
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:37,021
Actually.
You need to supplement with some five 

1304
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:38,731
htp or something like that.
It's a very reductive way of thinking 

1305
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:41,161
about consciousness,
but the main issue is that you're not 

1306
01:05:41,161 --> 01:05:43,681
testing in your brain,
you're testing or urine and a lot of 

1307
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:43,681
these neurotransmitters are biosynthesis
in the periphery,

1308
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:48,510
so just because you have these 
neurotransmitters in your urine doesn't 

1309
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,720
mean they were ever in your brain.
It doesn't say anything about anything,

1310
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,030
so it's just,
it's so juvenile in a way.

1311
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:01,220
It's such a.
it's such a piss poor way of maintaining

1312
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:02,180
order,

1313
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,950
checking people's

1314
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:10,110
consciousness and make immediate.
What you should do is judge people based

1315
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:15,571
on the productivity.
If I have some guy and he shows up work 

1316
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:15,610
and he kicks ass everyday,
I'm like,

1317
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:16,650
dude,
what's your secret?

1318
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,850
I get high.
Get high before work.

1319
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,130
It's great.
I feel good having a good time at work.

1320
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:26,430
Zippity Doo da Zippity Day.
I'm putting everything in order and it 

1321
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:26,680
just feels good.
Like keep doing what you're doing.

1322
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:33,050
I mean that's how it should be.
We should be judged based on whether or 

1323
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,420
not whatever we're doing is.
I mean,

1324
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,020
I guess

1325
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:35,780
the real

1326
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,140
caveat to bed would be people that do 
speed.

1327
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,380
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1328
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:45,260
you get pretty productive for a short 
period of time doing speed,

1329
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:47,450
but I think the downside of that,

1330
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,840
there's so many people that are on 
adderall today.

1331
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:50,380
Right?
What,

1332
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:55,420
what are your feelings on that?
I think that it's a very interesting 

1333
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,800
issue because it's amazing when you look
at the history of all these things,

1334
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:02,280
have these issues repeat themselves over
and over and over again.

1335
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:05,010
So it was a problem in the fifties and 
it's a problem in the sixties and it's a

1336
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:07,200
problem in the seventies.
Now it's a problem now.

1337
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,780
It's always a problem that we're 
treating as if it were a new thing,

1338
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:14,781
but people have been using amphetamines,
stimulants for the better part of 100 

1339
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,000
years.
And um,

1340
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:20,690
people will now the kind of popular 
thing to say is,

1341
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,890
you know,
didn't you know,

1342
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:24,770
adderall is one carbon atom away from 
meth.

1343
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:29,300
But here's the flip side.
Meth is one carbon away from adderall.

1344
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,030
So this whole idea that math,
again,

1345
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:37,031
back to pharmacological determinism,
that meth is a drug that turns you into 

1346
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:40,691
a toothless,
insane white trash guys stabbing the 

1347
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:44,561
walls with the cleaver.
Looking for people that are hiding and 

1348
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:44,630
whispering secret messages or something 
like that,

1349
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:49,510
like this is just a stereotype that we 
have created.

1350
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:54,511
Of course there are people like that,
but the reality is that these stimulants

1351
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:58,080
have an ambiguous potential for all 
sorts of things.

1352
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:00,180
Some people use low doses of 
methamphetamine,

1353
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,250
in fact,
methamphetamine,

1354
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:06,251
a schedule too because to this day it 
can be and is prescribed as a treatment 

1355
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:08,850
for Adhd in addition to amphetamine,
which is adderall.

1356
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,620
What do they call it when they 
prescribe?

1357
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:14,310
It does and is the brand name for 
methamphetamine?

1358
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,070
Uh,

1359
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,420
adderall is the brand name fettuccine 
and their vet and I've tried both drugs,

1360
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:22,610
both amphetamine and methamphetamine and
they're very,

1361
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:27,611
very similar drugs.
And that's not to say that either are 

1362
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:28,670
good or bad,
it's just a factual statement that if in

1363
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:33,671
a double blind placebo controlled or not
even placebo control just a double blind

1364
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:35,230
trial,
I don't think that I could,

1365
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,320
it could differentiate.
It could also help obese patients lose 

1366
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:40,490
weight.
Did you know that?

1367
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:45,491
Um,
there's a lot of people who think trump 

1368
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:45,491
is on diet pills.
Oh yeah.

1369
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:45,491
Yeah.
On a diagonal appropriate.

1370
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:46,040
Yeah,
right.

1371
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,650
Yeah,
and that he used to be on one of the,

1372
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,290
one of the elements of fen phen phen 
phen,

1373
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,010
phen,
phen,

1374
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:55,370
fenfluramine phentermine.
Well,

1375
01:08:55,371 --> 01:09:00,371
there was a,
some journalists that we even talked 

1376
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:00,371
about the DOJ.
We saved this.

1377
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:01,520
We have it on a folder now.
Would you say,

1378
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:01,850
Jamie?

1379
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,760
I've been hit up messages about that.
Journalists,

1380
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:07,200
that he might be sketchy,
sketchy or something like that,

1381
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:12,970
but even if he were on [inaudible] or 
fenfluramine or phentermine or fen 

1382
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,580
metrazole or any of these substances.
So what,

1383
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,810
you know,
the question is,

1384
01:09:18,811 --> 01:09:22,610
is judgment compromised because he's 
hopped up on speed,

1385
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,240
was judgment seems compromised 
regardless that?

1386
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,200
Is that why?
No,

1387
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:30,890
probably not,
but it could be why he gets so much shit

1388
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:32,720
done.
I mean,

1389
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:34,490
you remember when during the you,
you're,

1390
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:36,500
you're,
you just don't want to compliment them.

1391
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:37,310
And I understand that.
No,

1392
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:37,600
no,
no,

1393
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,160
that's not why it's again,
it's this idea.

1394
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,340
There's a certain exculpatory value that
drugs have.

1395
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:44,960
People make the same arguments about 
Hitler.

1396
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Hitler,
he was just high on speed that explains 

1397
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:50,200
it.
The Nazis,

1398
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:50,200
they were just high on speed.
That explains it.

1399
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,590
But what value does it really have?

1400
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:53,090
The same thing with Anthony Bordain.
They'll say,

1401
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:54,740
oh no,
drugs were found in his system.

1402
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:56,720
Postmortem.
So what?

1403
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,570
What if they had been then what?
Well,

1404
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:04,571
the idea is that he might have been 
experiencing a fucked up state of mind 

1405
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,170
because of some drug that made him make 
a poor choice and take his own life.

1406
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,070
But you wouldn't know.
You wouldn't know why he did it.

1407
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:18,550
Is that what you're saying?
It wouldn't explain anything really 

1408
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
because you still wouldn't know his 
internal state.

1409
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,720
It would just be you're projecting an 
assumption.

1410
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:25,810
So what if there were a small amount of 
heroin in his blood at the time of his 

1411
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:29,171
death,
then you would assume that he had 

1412
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:31,871
relapsed,
was so ashamed of his relapse that he 

1413
01:10:31,871 --> 01:10:34,541
then decided to kill himself.
But the reality is we can't make those 

1414
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:38,681
sorts of assessments.
We don't know other people's internal 

1415
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:38,681
states.

1416
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:38,750
We don't even know what these things do 
to other people.

1417
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:43,751
We don't.
But we do know that some things like 

1418
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:46,121
abilify and some other Ssri eyes and 
even some anti anxiety medication had 

1419
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:51,710
been strongly linked to suicidal 
thoughts and in fact there were actually

1420
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,590
listed as some side effects for a lot of
these drugs.

1421
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,790
Yes.
But when you think that.

1422
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:01,060
I mean,
I know correlation does not equal 

1423
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,011
causation,
but don't you think that that's worth 

1424
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:03,011
considering and it's something to be 
discussed.

1425
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:06,581
It's worth considering,
but I would be careful about assigning 

1426
01:11:06,581 --> 01:11:07,130
too much value to it,
which is what people tend to do the same

1427
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:08,240
thing with columbine.
They'll say,

1428
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:10,280
oh,
he was on that antidepressant.

1429
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:12,860
That's why is it?
Why does it really explain it?

1430
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:14,010
Because a hell of a lot

1431
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,860
of people that take those same drugs and
don't kill all of their classmates.

1432
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:17,770
Right,
right.

1433
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,810
For sure.

1434
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:24,090
For sure.
But it also could be a factor and this 

1435
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,020
is not something that I think we should 
avoid considering.

1436
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:29,220
I think it should be discussed.
Yes,

1437
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:34,221
I agree with you,
but I think we're trying to look at 

1438
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:34,221
things binary,
right?

1439
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:36,840
We're looking at things in terms of like
on or off black or white.

1440
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:39,870
One or zero and I,
I just don't think drugs work that way.

1441
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,370
No,
and I think you agree.

1442
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:44,160
Yeah.
The speed thing is curious to me because

1443
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:48,000
one of the side effects of these drugs 
is impulsive,

1444
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:53,060
irrational behavior and extreme 
confidence in oneself.

1445
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,190
Like this is,
this is right.

1446
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,590
This is what we always think of people 
that are hopped up on speed.

1447
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:02,190
People that have a coke confidence,
you know,

1448
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,490
confidence is a real phenomenon.
When people do cocaine,

1449
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:09,150
they feel very confident about 
themselves and they save ridiculous shit

1450
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:10,890
to people.
So the question is,

1451
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:13,890
is that really what's happening?
If they have I gave coke to you,

1452
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:18,750
would you start acting irrationally and 
feeling extremely confident yourself?

1453
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:23,751
Or is it just accentuating a problem 
that already exists in the person's 

1454
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:24,530
personality?

1455
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,120
Both.
Probably a combination of the two,

1456
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,300
but the other thing is even if he has 
been using this stuff for decades,

1457
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:32,220
he's probably tolerant to it and it's 
not.

1458
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:37,280
I don't think it would explain his 
behavior why thing is giving them 

1459
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,130
energy.
He's been like this for so long though.

1460
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,580
This.
I mean,

1461
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:41,430
this is a long history of this sort of 
behavior.

1462
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,930
Well,
this was what the journalist that talked

1463
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:47,931
about that he had been on this stuff for
a long time and that there was a actual 

1464
01:12:47,931 --> 01:12:51,980
Dwayne Reed pharmacy in New York where 
he described where he got the 

1465
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,461
prescription filled.
People were doing the same thing with 

1466
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:57,741
his finasteride as well though,
and I found that particularly obnoxious 

1467
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,060
finasteride is pizza pizza.
So they were saying,

1468
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:03,060
oh,
he's on finasteride and that explains,

1469
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:08,061
you know,
is a fair or that explains this because 

1470
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:08,061
it does this or that to your libido.
And again,

1471
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:11,960
it's like I don't know,
or not at all,

1472
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:16,490
or let's give him some credit for being 
a human being with freewill.

1473
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:21,491
That makes choices on his own that 
aren't entirely mediated by what 

1474
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:21,530
pharmaceuticals he uses.

1475
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Well,
finasteride also has side effects of 

1476
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,941
depression and we went over this 
yesterday with my friend Ari who was 

1477
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:33,440
really depressed at one point in time 
and it coincided with his use of 

1478
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:33,440
finasteride,

1479
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,000
right?
Yeah.

1480
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,430
I've seen,
but it's not very common.

1481
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,290
It does occur,
but it's not uncommon.

1482
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,110
Right.
But for the person that

1483
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:44,890
does get those side effects,
saying that it's not common,

1484
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:46,360
doesn't really offer any comfort.

1485
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,210
No,
no.

1486
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,230
Call.
Well,

1487
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,530
I'm one of the lucky ones.
I'm one of the lucky ones,

1488
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:56,440
ones that jump off a bridge to get my 
hair to grow back.

1489
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,640
But you know,
the reason that I'm so opinionated about

1490
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:02,220
this particular issue is because you see
it time and time again.

1491
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:03,180
It never stops.
You know?

1492
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:05,610
I don't know if you're familiar with the
Jeffrey Macdonald murder case.

1493
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,240
No,
I'm super fascinating.

1494
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:09,170
You probably have read about it and 
forgotten about it.

1495
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:14,171
It was a big thing and maybe 1970,
but he was this military doctor,

1496
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,780
um,
who's credentialed.

1497
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:18,940
The perfect man.
Did everything right,

1498
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:20,950
perfect family,
everything beautiful.

1499
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:26,070
And then one night he goes to sleep and 
claims that is right after the Manson 

1500
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:31,450
murders claims that these hippies walk 
into the house saying,

1501
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,760
kill the pigs.
Acid is groovy,

1502
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,560
kill the pigs,
acid is groovy.

1503
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,800
And then just brutally massacre his 
entire family and out of nowhere,

1504
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:42,940
out of nowhere.

1505
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,640
Yes.
And um,

1506
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,840
and it's a long and complicated story,
but he went to prison.

1507
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:55,290
I don't think that he is guilty,
but people had to find an explanation 

1508
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,700
for why and you don't think he's guilty.
I don't think he's guilty.

1509
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:02,701
He had no motive and there were an 
investigation was botched and so you 

1510
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:03,250
think someone came into his house and 
did that.

1511
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,330
He was accused of but,
but because he had no motive,

1512
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:12,810
people had to construct a motive.
They had to concoct a reason that this 

1513
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,800
doctor would have murdered his entire 
family.

1514
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,190
And so what's a good reason?
Oh,

1515
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,980
amphetamine.
He'd been using this,

1516
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:21,460
a amphetamine containing diet pills.
So that explains it all right.

1517
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,280
But it doesn't,
it's a terrible explanation.

1518
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:26,500
People use amphetamine all the time 
without killing their family.

1519
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:28,780
So I just want to be very careful about,
you know,

1520
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:30,670
do these things play a role in human 
behavior?

1521
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:33,340
Of course they do,
but do they determine human behavior?

1522
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,260
No.
That's a very good point.

1523
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,660
There's a lot of factors.
There's just,

1524
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:40,270
it's messy.
Being a person is missing.

1525
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:41,340
It's very complicated.
I mean,

1526
01:15:41,341 --> 01:15:44,290
you're a different person at noon then 
you are at 7:00

1527
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:44,920
PM,
of course.

1528
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,060
Yeah.
I mean,

1529
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:49,900
um,
it's just,

1530
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:56,340
it's so complicated and the more 
limitations we put on research and the 

1531
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:01,510
more stigma we put on the use of these 
things,

1532
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,240
the more murky these waters are going to
be.

1533
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,270
Yeah,
and I think people don't even appreciate

1534
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,480
the extent to which all these drugs have
been made illegal.

1535
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:15,481
Of course,
everyone's where cannabis is a schedule 

1536
01:16:15,481 --> 01:16:15,481
on LSD,
psilocybin,

1537
01:16:15,481 --> 01:16:16,180
Mtma,
but the list is long.

1538
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:21,210
It's hundreds and hundreds of chemicals 
and a lot of these chemicals are 

1539
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,470
chemicals with no supporters,
no one's fighting for them.

1540
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:27,310
There's a substance called two cn,
one of shoguns creations.

1541
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,380
They just threw it in schedule and no 
one uses it.

1542
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:32,260
If you scour the Internet,
I'd be surprised if you could find three

1543
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:34,960
reports of people using to cn totally 
unheard of,

1544
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,750
but they just throw it in schedule one 
because why the hell not.

1545
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,510
No one's going to stand up for it.
That's the end of two CN.

1546
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:42,490
But they miss a lot of shit too,
right?

1547
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:45,090
Like they miss five methoxy muscle trip.
To me,

1548
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,210
they missed that.
No,

1549
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:48,420
that was made illegal in 2011.
Right?

1550
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:51,820
For 1970 when everything else got thrown
into the mix,

1551
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:53,680
they made it illegal.
I bought that shit.

1552
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,210
Used to be able to buy it online.
Yeah,

1553
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,110
so did I.
Yeah.

1554
01:16:56,111 --> 01:17:01,111
It was crazy.
You could buy a fucking jug of it then 

1555
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:01,120
get the whole city high buyadol online.
Yeah,

1556
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,030
because it was never popular,
so how do they make it illegal?

1557
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,650
How do they.
How do they do that?

1558
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:11,370
They don't need any reason.
They can simply say that it has abuse 

1559
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,320
potential and make it illegal and if no 
one opposes it,

1560
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:17,321
then it becomes illegal.
That's how this list has gotten so long 

1561
01:17:17,321 --> 01:17:19,871
that you have all these people fighting 
for the legality of cannabis and these 

1562
01:17:19,871 --> 01:17:20,150
other substances that are known to have 
therapeutic potential,

1563
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:25,151
but these other more obscure substances 
that are really only a concern to 

1564
01:17:25,151 --> 01:17:28,811
scientists who are very seriously 
disinclined to break the law for the 

1565
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:32,190
sake of the research.
Drug users don't care about breaking the

1566
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,150
law.
Scientists are very unlikely because the

1567
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,840
whole purpose of science is to publish 
and you can't publish if you committed a

1568
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:43,841
crime in the context of your research,
so scientists are dramatically limited 

1569
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:49,690
by the prohibition of these substances 
and it's the obscure ones that end up 

1570
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:50,360
actually making a big difference.

1571
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:55,360
Not so much clinically,
but in terms of actually understanding 

1572
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:55,370
the mechanism of these substances,
the structure,

1573
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:56,570
activity,
relationships,

1574
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,700
the neuropharmacology yeah.
The,

1575
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,020
the stigma on psychedelic use and and 
even studying them has led so many 

1576
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,820
doctors or scientists,
researchers that would be inclined to 

1577
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,240
want to do research on these particular 
things.

1578
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:19,570
They avoid them because it could be 
incredibly damaging to their careers and

1579
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:24,731
it's bureaucratic.
I mean there was a group at Columbia 

1580
01:18:24,731 --> 01:18:27,401
that was doing really fascinating 
research on the drug Ibogaine and 

1581
01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:31,270
Parkinson's disease and the.
I was speaking with the head of this 

1582
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,351
study and he was saying how obnoxious it
was to have the government common way.

1583
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:39,650
His vial of Ibogaine every day and 
monitors logs and you know,

1584
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:41,660
this guy is a really serious researcher.
He's not gonna.

1585
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,750
If you were to get high,
he's not going to get high off this tiny

1586
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:49,751
supply of government mandated or 
government sanctioned Ibogaine that was 

1587
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:52,640
supplied to him,
but uh,

1588
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,390
but they give.

1589
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:58,390
These people are really hard time.
They make them buy a very expensive 

1590
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:01,691
safe.
They do all this stuff that these are 

1591
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:04,961
the last people to abuse the substances 
and they are the ones that are hurt the 

1592
01:19:04,961 --> 01:19:05,570
most severely except for,
of course,

1593
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:10,571
the people that go to prison,
they're the ones that are hurt the most 

1594
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:10,571
severely.
Yeah.

1595
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:13,541
It's a crazy thing to think that people 
are going to recreationally use 

1596
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:14,930
Ibogaine.
That's one of the weirder ones.

1597
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,610
Oh,
it's totally bizarre.

1598
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,890
Yeah.
And I'm.

1599
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:23,980
And Ibogaine is a drug with so much 
potential for those people that are 

1600
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:24,050
aware of.
I began.

1601
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:28,190
It's typically only discussed as a drug 
that treats addiction to opioids,

1602
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:29,420
which is very,
very important,

1603
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:34,421
especially now.
But that's the tip of the iceberg with 

1604
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:37,151
Ibogaine.
It has one of the most complex 

1605
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:37,151
pharmacology's of any drug I've ever 
studied.

1606
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:38,600
There's almost nothing it does not do.

1607
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,480
I mean it's,
you know,

1608
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,550
you have the Alpha three Beta four 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,

1609
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:47,030
which is also the target of Welbutrin 
and has a kind of smoking cessation,

1610
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:52,060
anti addictive effect.
Then you have really high affinity 

1611
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:52,940
relative to the other receptors for the 
MMDA receptors,

1612
01:19:52,941 --> 01:19:56,990
so as academy and type effect and as a 
classical psychedelic effect of the five

1613
01:19:56,991 --> 01:20:00,020
ht two a receptor.
Then it's a dopamine reuptake inhibitor,

1614
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:05,021
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
It just goes on and then it releases 

1615
01:20:05,021 --> 01:20:07,991
this protein bdnf,
which is considered one of the most 

1616
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:08,700
important proteins in treatment of 
Parkinson's disease.

1617
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:13,701
It's one of the only things that is able
to cause a regrowth of dopaminergic 

1618
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:13,740
neurons and people that have 
Parkinson's.

1619
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:18,860
So this is like really fascinating stuff
that's just in schedule one scientists 

1620
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,770
can't work with.
It is a tragedy.

1621
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,220
It is a tragedy and it's also so 
effective.

1622
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:30,221
I know so many people that have gone to 
Mexico and go into these clinics and 

1623
01:20:30,221 --> 01:20:33,380
done one Ibogaine session for 24 hours 
and come out of it.

1624
01:20:33,381 --> 01:20:38,381
A totally different person come out of 
it with a complete new perspective on 

1625
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:43,360
even why they were using whatever they 
were using in the first place in a way 

1626
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,501
that they didn't do.
Not only does it help eliminate the 

1627
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:49,010
addictive properties and the connection 
that your body has to those substances,

1628
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:54,160
but it also allows you to reexamined why
you went down that road in the first 

1629
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,160
place.

1630
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,520
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1631
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:59,521
And there was a sort of pharmaceutical 
push to develop non psychedelic 

1632
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:03,430
derivatives of Ibogaine that would 
retain the anti addictive properties,

1633
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:08,580
which sounds like a good idea in theory,
but so they created this drug called 18 

1634
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:13,391
mc and it wasn't psychedelic,
but then it also lacked some of these 

1635
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,600
neurotrophic factor releasing properties
of Ibogaine.

1636
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:21,750
But really the bottom line is that we 
shouldn't deny the fact that the 

1637
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:26,371
psychedelic activity of these substances
is therapeutic psychotherapeutic in and 

1638
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:26,950
of itself.
You know,

1639
01:21:26,951 --> 01:21:31,951
I had a friend who was severely,
severely addicted to heroin and he 

1640
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:34,360
traveled to the Netherlands to take 
Ibogaine and,

1641
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:35,560
you know,
took the drug,

1642
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:40,060
was going into the experience and then 
started feeling this intense craving for

1643
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,580
heroin.
And um,

1644
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:46,730
and started looking through his bags to 
see if he somehow had forgotten about a 

1645
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,850
little bit of heroin that could just get
them through the day.

1646
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:53,851
And then he goes into his bag and then 
finds a small bag of heroin and snorts 

1647
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,210
it.
And then it's like,

1648
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,810
I traveled all the way to the 
Netherlands to do this.

1649
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:01,030
This was,
I'm a failure.

1650
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:03,700
I'm relapsing after all of this money,
all this work.

1651
01:22:03,701 --> 01:22:05,200
I have no self control.
I'm a terrible,

1652
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:10,201
terrible person.
Why can't I just stop and then realize 

1653
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:10,900
that the whole thing was a holy nation.
There was no heroin.

1654
01:22:10,901 --> 01:22:14,110
He hallucinated his own relapse.
Whoa.

1655
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,140
Wow.
What was your experience with the ivory 

1656
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:24,250
game?
I've never taken high doses.

1657
01:22:24,251 --> 01:22:27,460
The most I've ever taken is 50 
milligrams of this ineffective dose.

1658
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:32,970
It really depends.
There's sort of move toward microdosing 

1659
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,340
Ibogaine because it actually does have a
cardio toxic effect,

1660
01:22:36,341 --> 01:22:41,341
especially at higher doses.
So people are looking into ways of 

1661
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:45,930
reducing that cardio toxicity by using 
it at lower doses for longer periods of 

1662
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,460
time.
Again,

1663
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:51,461
this is something that has to do with 
prohibition because in a this 

1664
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:52,850
prohibition market,
if you are addicted to heroin,

1665
01:22:52,851 --> 01:22:56,330
you go to Mexico or you go to Canada and
you go to an Ibogaine clinic,

1666
01:22:56,331 --> 01:22:59,570
you need to get as much bang for your 
buck as quickly as possible.

1667
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:04,571
You're not going to stay there for two 
months of treatment because most people 

1668
01:23:04,571 --> 01:23:05,440
have lives and can't afford to do that.
So do you.

1669
01:23:05,441 --> 01:23:07,380
Do they give you what,
what is called a flood dose?

1670
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:12,380
It's a massive dose off,
often a multi gram dose of Ibogaine 

1671
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:17,100
because it's just like a sledge hammer 
that knocks you down and allows you to 

1672
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,130
get out of it.
But is that the best way?

1673
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,280
That's the fastest way.
That's the most appetizing way for 

1674
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,640
someone that had to travel to do it,
but is it the best?

1675
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:29,790
Probably not because we know that at 
high doses it has this potential to 

1676
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:34,160
induce cardiac arrhythmias and that can 
kill and has killed.

1677
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,880
So people are now looking at lower doses
over longer periods of time.

1678
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:41,180
Which would be ideal if it were legal in
the United States,

1679
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:41,780
I believe.

1680
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,080
Yeah,
that's a,

1681
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,590
it's a really interesting one.
To me it's a,

1682
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:52,670
it's a really interesting one because 
it's got such a long history of use and 

1683
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:57,781
so many people have had these very good 
experiences with getting off of 

1684
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,410
addictive drugs from it.
Oh yeah.

1685
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:04,180
And so relatively unknown as well.
It's something that,

1686
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:09,181
you know,
talk to someone like you and of course 

1687
01:24:09,181 --> 01:24:09,550
you know about it,
but I bet if we walk down the street and

1688
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:12,640
asked 100 people,
I'd be shocked if one of them knew about

1689
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:12,760
it.

1690
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,480
Yeah.
And you know,

1691
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:19,481
Terence Mckenna would sometimes talk 
about silicide been as an invention of 

1692
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:22,110
mushrooms or is technology or as being 
synthetic and uh,

1693
01:24:22,111 --> 01:24:25,760
I don't really agree with that idea of 
an invention of mushrooms where he would

1694
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:30,761
sort of say like,
this is a synthetic as a coca cola 

1695
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:30,761
bottle.
This is like alien technology.

1696
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:32,510
That's how you would describe 
psilocybin.

1697
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,280
But in my opinion it's,
you know,

1698
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,530
it's a pretty simple derivative of trip 
to fan.

1699
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:41,531
You just decarboxylated methalate the 
nitrogen twice and then add this 

1700
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:42,170
phosphate Ester,
but,

1701
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:46,010
but Ibogaine,
that's a crazy molecule.

1702
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:51,040
That's like a three dimensional thing 
that no medicinal chemists would have 

1703
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,970
ever discovered that if there's,
you know,

1704
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:57,220
not to sound mystical,
but that strikes me as some sort of 

1705
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:57,220
plant technology.
I mean,

1706
01:24:57,220 --> 01:25:01,451
it's an amazingly complicated structure.
It's so complicated that it's almost 

1707
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:02,060
impossible to synthesize.
In fact,

1708
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:07,061
it can't be synthesized commercially.
All the Ibogaine that people use has to 

1709
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:08,510
be extracted from plants because that's 
the only way to get it.

1710
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:09,410
Wow.

1711
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,120
Um,
I first found out about it when,

1712
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:18,400
when hunter s Thompson accused Ed Muskie
of being on it during the presidential,

1713
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:20,080
uh,
race of,

1714
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,910
what was it,
1970 or whatever it was.

1715
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:26,200
Um,
that was a hilarious moment and a lot of

1716
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:31,201
people I think were introduced to what 
Ibogaine was by that when he said a 

1717
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:32,890
Brazilian,
which Dr had been flown in.

1718
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,010
Of course it doesn't even grow in 
Brazil,

1719
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,120
but yeah,
it doesn't even make sense.

1720
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,210
It's also,
it was hilarious when he was on the Dick

1721
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,150
Cavett show and they asked him about 
spreading those rumors and he's like,

1722
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:47,200
well,
there was a rumor,

1723
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,340
uh,
that,

1724
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:50,920
uh,
he was doing this a Ibogaine.

1725
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,850
And,
uh,

1726
01:25:52,410 --> 01:25:57,410
I know because I started the rumor,
I just reported factually,

1727
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:02,340
there was a rumor,
I mean it's,

1728
01:26:02,341 --> 01:26:03,230
uh,
there's,

1729
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,280
there's a,
a lot

1730
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,280
of these drugs that get put into various
categories and Ibogaine is one of the 

1731
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:14,921
very few that really isn't in any 
category in terms of like modern 

1732
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:18,851
culture,
like the way we discuss and consider 

1733
01:26:18,851 --> 01:26:19,580
these things because it's very different
structurally and logically.

1734
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,760
But that the hunter s Thompson story is 
really interesting because it's 

1735
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,240
obviously a very charming,
funny story and I'd have to know exactly

1736
01:26:26,241 --> 01:26:28,610
when it happened relative to the 
scheduling of Ibogaine,

1737
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,760
but that might be an example of how,
what's a frivolous joke that most people

1738
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:38,891
enjoy told in the wrong climate can 
result in the loss of a chemical that 

1739
01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:43,661
could be good,
that could save tens of thousands of 

1740
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:43,910
lives and could be a treatment for 
Parkinson's disease.

1741
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:49,220
You know,
this is the responsibility that 

1742
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,161
journalists have.
It's more responsibility than I think 

1743
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:51,161
they'd like to have often.
But that's the truth.

1744
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:52,310
You make a joke about Ibogaine.

1745
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:54,440
Next thing you know,
it's in schedule one.

1746
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:59,810
Maybe he made the joke afterwards,
but if he didn't have to wonder because 

1747
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,221
that was one of the first major mentions
of Ibogaine in the popular press and the

1748
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:04,700
same is true of,
you know,

1749
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:09,701
there was a rolling stone scare article 
that came out a while ago and it same 

1750
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:11,060
deal with this drug to ct seven and they
do a whole story,

1751
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:11,930
oh,
this teenager,

1752
01:27:11,931 --> 01:27:16,931
he took too much and this to ct seven,
it can kill you with just a little pile 

1753
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,500
of powder or whatever.
And uh,

1754
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:23,910
and then the drug is made schedule one 
shogun worked on psychedelics.

1755
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:29,410
Alexander Shogun,
great medicinal chemist who spent his 

1756
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,231
entire life studying psychedelics 
considered this one of the sixth 

1757
01:27:32,231 --> 01:27:35,350
greatest creations of his entire career 
squashed by a single stupid story in 

1758
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,490
rolling stone.
That's how easily it happens.

1759
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:38,580
That was the story.

1760
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,350
Stupid.
I mean,

1761
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:40,940
did it have any basis?
In fact,

1762
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:47,410
an editor at rolling stone told me that 
there were factual errors in it and 

1763
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:48,230
there's something weird about it,
but yes,

1764
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:51,800
people did die because yes,
people die from using drugs occasionally

1765
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:56,801
to deny that would be to lie,
but that doesn't mean that they don't 

1766
01:27:56,801 --> 01:27:59,300
have therapeutic activity and it doesn't
mean that they should be illegal.

1767
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,630
One of the ones that disturbs me the 
most is fentanyl.

1768
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,510
Fentanyl,
just.

1769
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:08,990
I don't even understand why anybody 
would want to make that.

1770
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,650
It seems to me that we have no one of 
opiates as it is.

1771
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,650
Why make one that's a thousand times 
stronger than heroin?

1772
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,840
Yeah.
I've known for fentanyl chemists,

1773
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:20,450
including the one that introduced 
fentanyl to the United States initially.

1774
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:22,850
He died recently.
Did he die from it?

1775
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,330
No one died of old age.
He's killed so many people.

1776
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,620
Yeah.
Tom Petty.

1777
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,450
David Bowie,
Bowie one.

1778
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,510
I'm not sure.
Prince.

1779
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,430
Yeah.
I'm mean.

1780
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:38,390
There's quite a few great people that 
we've lost to this stuff.

1781
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,830
Yeah,
it's really.

1782
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:42,020
It's unfortunate,
but again,

1783
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:47,170
fentanyl is not the problem.
The problem is people taking it and the 

1784
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:52,301
problem is lack of access to safer 
opioids and lack of education 

1785
01:28:52,301 --> 01:28:54,590
surrounding fentanyl because it doesn't 
even really have desirable properties.

1786
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:56,270
You know,
one thing that people always talk about,

1787
01:28:56,271 --> 01:29:01,271
the potency offense and on one thing 
that they don't often talk about is the 

1788
01:29:01,271 --> 01:29:01,271
duration.
It's a very,

1789
01:29:01,271 --> 01:29:05,040
very short duration opioid which 
necessitates compulsive,

1790
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,210
constant,
re dosing.

1791
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:11,211
If you're addicted to fentanyl,
unless you're doing a transdermal patch 

1792
01:29:11,211 --> 01:29:14,391
or something like that,
you typically can't make it through a 

1793
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,300
single night without having to reduce 
because the duration is so short.

1794
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:20,330
That's why it's always done in these 
prolonged release formulations like a 

1795
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:22,950
lollipop that you suck or a patch,
but anyway,

1796
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:23,130
it's.

1797
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:23,440
Yeah,
it's.

1798
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:27,030
It's not a drug that's well suited to 
street use.

1799
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:30,300
It's to the therapeutic index is too 
narrow.

1800
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:35,570
It's duration is too short.
It has a medical purpose that it works 

1801
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:39,501
very well for.
It shouldn't be used as a heroine 

1802
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:43,041
replacement,
but the economic reality is that you 

1803
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:43,610
have to make heroin from opium,
opium,

1804
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:46,110
s that come from a place where poppies 
are grown.

1805
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:51,290
That's a whole process.
Whereas fentanyl can be made by one guy 

1806
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:55,610
somewhere and the profit margin on the 
fentanyl is so much greater that there's

1807
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,410
an enormous economic incentive and the 
first chemist,

1808
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,320
this guy that was sort of a friend of 
mine that died to do it,

1809
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:06,770
considered it a good thing to do.
That's the complexity that you have to 

1810
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,850
recognize it so easy to say that all of 
these people are so bad,

1811
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,510
but often you don't know what's going to
happen until it happens.

1812
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,600
His idea was that one of the major 
burdens of being addicted to heroin is 

1813
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,160
that you can't afford it.
It's really expensive,

1814
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,640
so by substituting this relatively 
inexpensive material,

1815
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:28,880
the price of heroin would go down.
This financial burden associated with 

1816
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,170
opioid addiction would be reduced.
It would actually improve the quality of

1817
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:34,230
life of the users,
and it could even be a more pure,

1818
01:30:34,231 --> 01:30:37,110
potentially safer material.
If you look at certain literature,

1819
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:42,170
of course that's not what happened,
and many people died and he went to 

1820
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:42,750
prison as a result of it.
Did it really?

1821
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:44,730
Yes.
Why don't he go to prison for it?

1822
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:47,640
Because people died and it was traced 
back to him.

1823
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,380
Wow.
Yeah,

1824
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:52,890
so he wasn't doing this in any 
sanctioned?

1825
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,900
No.
He was a clandestine chemist.

1826
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:59,160
His name was George Marquardt.
Weird guy.

1827
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,660
Yeah.
Yes.

1828
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,220
Yeah.
But anyway,

1829
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,660
you know,
you just don't know.

1830
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,300
You don't know what's going to happen 
until it happens.

1831
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,020
You know,
of course,

1832
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:12,050
the legendary story that heroin was 
introduced by Bayer as a nonaddictive 

1833
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,041
alternative to morphine.
They probably did think that was the 

1834
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:19,881
case at the beginning,
but history has shown that that is not 

1835
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:23,691
the case.
That's one of the problems with 

1836
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:23,691
introducing any drug to a large 
population.

1837
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:28,101
You simply don't know.
It's and it's also one of the things 

1838
01:31:28,101 --> 01:31:30,680
that I find most interesting in and 
perhaps a silver lining in this whole 

1839
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,680
synthetic cannabinoid narrative that's 
been playing out over the last decade is

1840
01:31:34,681 --> 01:31:35,160
you could say,
oh,

1841
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:36,990
it's terrible.
People should just smoke cannabis,

1842
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:42,050
but we're learning so much about what 
cannabinoid receptor agonists can do 

1843
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:47,300
that we would have never learned if it 
weren't for the widespread use of 

1844
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:47,300
synthetic cannabinoids.
I mean,

1845
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:50,370
just for instance,
that it is possible for high potency,

1846
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:52,560
so cannabinoid receptor agonist to kill 
you,

1847
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:53,400
that's a big one.

1848
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,120
We didn't know that until recently that 
they can be addictive.

1849
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,770
We didn't know that.
What are they using,

1850
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,450
what is it?
It's so.

1851
01:32:01,451 --> 01:32:04,780
It's an impressively diverse array of 
chemicals.

1852
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:07,540
You know,
it started out with a drug called CP 55,

1853
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:10,970
9:40,
then it was cp a,

1854
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:16,900
what they call it,
cannibis cycle of hex and all now and 

1855
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,600
then Jwh jwh 73,
jwh 2:10

1856
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:24,601
on and on and on and on.
And then it just branched like a giant 

1857
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:26,530
cannabinoid fractal in every imaginable 
imaginable direction.

1858
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,690
And uh,
and a lot of these compounds,

1859
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,110
you know,
they,

1860
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:32,350
they were patented by various 
pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer for

1861
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:33,670
therapeutic purposes.
Again,

1862
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:36,040
this wasn't some level and chemist who's
cackling and saying,

1863
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:41,140
ha ha ha.
I figured out the most addictive thing 

1864
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,201
possible.
They were just looking to see what's 

1865
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:45,151
legal,
what looks pretty potent and reasonably 

1866
01:32:45,151 --> 01:32:45,151
safe.
Okay,

1867
01:32:45,151 --> 01:32:45,310
we'll make that,
we'll sell it.

1868
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:50,610
And uh,
and I've spoken with the chemists that 

1869
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:50,610
actually were behind a lot of these 
operations.

1870
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:52,780
Again,
not bad guys necessarily,

1871
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:54,160
they,
they,

1872
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:59,190
you know,
typically people don't want to hurt 

1873
01:32:59,190 --> 01:32:59,190
other people.
You know,

1874
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:03,120
genuine,
villainous people are pretty rare in my 

1875
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,601
experience.
Most people believe that what they're 

1876
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:06,970
doing has a justification that is good.
And again,

1877
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:11,440
with the synthetic cannabinoid ideas,
one is that although you won't hear this

1878
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:16,441
in the popular press and it's rarely 
said they can be very enjoyable and it 

1879
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:21,601
would be dishonest to say otherwise,
some of them are very euphoric and 

1880
01:33:21,601 --> 01:33:23,770
compare favorably to cannabis and in 
certain measures might even be superior.

1881
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,800
That doesn't mean they're safer.
It just means that there's something 

1882
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,500
very desirable but them,
and if you deny that,

1883
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,340
then you neglect to understand why 
people use them in the first place,

1884
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:34,570
which is that they make you feel good.

1885
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:40,470
So that's part of it.
But then the other thing is the urine 

1886
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:44,011
testing,
people wanting to be able to get high 

1887
01:33:44,011 --> 01:33:44,011
without breaking the law,
low cost.

1888
01:33:44,011 --> 01:33:48,160
I mean there's a lot of motivations for 
doing this and as it played out,

1889
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:51,580
people died.
People became addicted and random things

1890
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:53,320
that no one would have ever expected 
occurred.

1891
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,840
We learned,
here's another silver lining.

1892
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,020
I'm sure you're familiar with cannabis 
hyperemesis syndrome.

1893
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,090
No,
not,

1894
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:00,850
you know,
this,

1895
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:05,890
um,
this is our pattern that certain people 

1896
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:06,330
that smoke all day every day,
um,

1897
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,460
it started showing up in the medical 
literature about a decade ago.

1898
01:34:09,461 --> 01:34:11,860
People smoke all day every day and they 
start getting very,

1899
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:16,861
very nauseous and vomiting.
And the only thing that can relieve the 

1900
01:34:16,861 --> 01:34:17,100
vomiting is a hot shower.
Huh?

1901
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:22,120
So really weird.
So all these people are showing up in 

1902
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,420
emergency rooms when they run out of hot
water.

1903
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,360
I'm saying like,
I need some kind of a,

1904
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:28,330
I need some help or something like,
I don't know what's going on.

1905
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,600
The condition resolves itself very 
rapidly as soon as you stopped smoking 

1906
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,560
cannabis.
So it's not hard to treat.

1907
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:40,590
You can't smoke weed anymore,
but no one knew what caused it and why 

1908
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:43,750
it was happening now after thousands of 
years of human cannabis interaction.

1909
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:48,751
Why now for the first time in history?
And the answer is that people are 

1910
01:34:48,751 --> 01:34:51,750
smoking more weed now than ever before.
You know,

1911
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,960
the levels of thc ingestion with dabbing
and high potency strains are just higher

1912
01:34:56,110 --> 01:35:01,110
for some people,
it's much higher than it's ever been in 

1913
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:01,110
the past.
But um,

1914
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:02,140
but then the question is,
what is causing it?

1915
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,450
Is it the cannabis itself is a 
fertilizer,

1916
01:35:04,451 --> 01:35:07,330
is it a pesticide?
What is responsible for this?

1917
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:12,570
And it wasn't until people were using 
synthetic cannabinoids began to 

1918
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,020
experience the same constellation of 
symptoms that they realized that this is

1919
01:35:14,021 --> 01:35:17,650
an intrinsic property of certain 
cannabinoid receptor agonists.

1920
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,840
So that's something that you can learn 
from all of this,

1921
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:24,930
that it wasn't pesticides and it wasn't 
some kind of a fungus or something like 

1922
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:29,281
that girl on the planet,
but this is something that happens from 

1923
01:35:29,281 --> 01:35:31,351
prolonged high dose use of cannabinoids.
And there's all sorts of other lessons 

1924
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:31,351
that can be learned.

1925
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:33,870
Is that an issue with cannabis use?
Pesticides?

1926
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:37,500
Have you ever heard of people having 
real problem with this?

1927
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,230
It was certainly,
you know,

1928
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:41,710
paraquat pot.
Did you ever hear what's that?

1929
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:43,240
Paraquat was,
um,

1930
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:48,770
you know,
in one of many misguided attempts to 

1931
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:51,621
prevent people from using drugs,
they started spraying all of the 

1932
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:54,650
cannabis.
It was grown in Mexico with this ultra 

1933
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:57,351
toxic herbicide called paraquat and this
is a drug that induces Parkinson's 

1934
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:03,370
disease when you're exposed to it,
like really seriously nasty stuff.

1935
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:08,020
No joke.
And so the idea was if we poison all the

1936
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:13,021
cannabis and create this widespread fear
that whatever you're smoking might 

1937
01:36:13,021 --> 01:36:15,040
contain paraquat,
maybe people will use it less.

1938
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,520
And Luckily paraquat is a,
doesn't have a lot of thermo stability.

1939
01:36:21,101 --> 01:36:23,110
It's sort of denatured by the heat of 
smoking.

1940
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,990
So it's argued that people were not 
actually exposed to it,

1941
01:36:25,991 --> 01:36:29,140
who smoked it,
but still this is a horrendous thing for

1942
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:34,141
the government to have done.
They did the same thing during alcohol 

1943
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:34,141
prohibition by the way they would poison
alcohol.

1944
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:38,311
I mean that's the extent they'll poison 
people to prevent them from getting 

1945
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:39,140
high.
But um,

1946
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,170
that's a reality.
But,

1947
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,700
but now in turn,
you know,

1948
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:48,830
there's obviously a move toward organic 
gardening people using,

1949
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,240
you know,
neem oil and things like that.

1950
01:36:52,241 --> 01:36:53,940
So I wouldn't know.
I'll go in.

1951
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:54,610
There was,
yeah,

1952
01:36:54,611 --> 01:36:59,611
there was actually a big controversy in 
Colorado with a pesticide called Mike 

1953
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,270
Club.
You tennille I believe that was used.

1954
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:03,670
And potentially could release cyanide 
when smoked.

1955
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,450
So

1956
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,030
yes.
Yeah.

1957
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:11,330
Why would worry about that with large 
scale production things become 

1958
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:14,310
commercially viable.
The point where someone like rj reynolds

1959
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:19,311
gets into the mix and starts growing 
enormous marijuana plantations.

1960
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:26,300
Oh yeah.
I mean it's a concern with all the food 

1961
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,300
that we eat as well.
Of course.

1962
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,300
Yeah.

1963
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:31,460
What is interesting to you now?
Like is there anything that's coming up 

1964
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,571
or some new thing that people aren't,
might not be aware of that might be 

1965
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:35,571
fascinating to you?

1966
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:36,600
Yeah,
I mean,

1967
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,560
I'm,
I'm,

1968
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,820
I'm interested in everything.
You know,

1969
01:37:39,821 --> 01:37:41,260
I,
I love the history.

1970
01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:42,530
I love,
um,

1971
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:47,550
you know,
I did a piece in this last season of my 

1972
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:49,320
tv show or I traced the history of 
Psychedelic toad venom of five Meo dmt 

1973
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:54,360
containing toad venom because people 
have this idea that all psychedelics 

1974
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,571
have been used for thousands of years 
that every psychedelic an ancient 

1975
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:58,560
history.
But when you look at the history of five

1976
01:37:58,561 --> 01:38:01,320
Meo DMT,
there is no evidence.

1977
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:03,510
Really no convincing evidence that I'm 
aware of.

1978
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:08,511
Maybe you can point to a ceramic toad is
that evidence that people smoke toad 

1979
01:38:08,511 --> 01:38:08,511
venom?
Not In my opinion,

1980
01:38:08,511 --> 01:38:11,130
it might be some indication that maybe 
they did,

1981
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:16,131
but it's certainly not hard evidence.
Even if there were a guy sitting on his 

1982
01:38:16,131 --> 01:38:17,700
back smoking a pipe,
it wouldn't be hard evidence.

1983
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:23,150
But anyway,
so there isn't convincing evidence as 

1984
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:23,160
far as I'm concerned of ancient toad I'm
used.

1985
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,840
So then the question is,
when did it start?

1986
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:27,540
Who was the first person to do this?
And I,

1987
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:31,890
I love these little historical 
investigations to get to the bottom.

1988
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:34,230
Who is the first person to synthesize 
this drug?

1989
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,480
What were their intentions?
Who's the first person to smoke?

1990
01:38:36,481 --> 01:38:39,210
Toad venom.
And the total volume is a weird one too,

1991
01:38:39,211 --> 01:38:43,230
because there's this bizarre 
misconception that you lick the toads.

1992
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,670
Right?
Which again,

1993
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:49,671
journalistically produced,
maybe it was inspired by cartoons as 

1994
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:49,950
well to some extent,
but I.

1995
01:38:49,951 --> 01:38:54,951
Yes.
So the way you do it is you have to get 

1996
01:38:54,951 --> 01:38:58,041
the tow to excrete whatever this is and 
you put it on glass and then you dry it 

1997
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:58,770
out.
Is that the idea?

1998
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,880
That's the idea.
Yes.

1999
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,760
And then you scrape it off with a razor 
blade and then smoke it.

2000
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:04,620
That's it.
And does it come,

2001
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:07,440
is it a pure form of five Meo DMT?

2002
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:12,470
No,
and there's actually very little 

2003
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,470
chemical analysis that's been done in 
the 21st century.

2004
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:16,770
I analyzed a sample that I collected 
when I was in Sonora and it contained in

2005
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:21,771
addition to five Meo dmt.
It contained some interesting serotonin 

2006
01:39:21,771 --> 01:39:26,360
derivatives including serotonin sulfate 
and nobody knows how these different 

2007
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:31,640
tryptamine components as well as these 
steroidal lactones that are sometimes 

2008
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,910
called bufo talks and contribute to the 
experience.

2009
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,790
If I had to guess,
probably not that much,

2010
01:39:35,791 --> 01:39:40,791
but maybe there's a little bit of that 
sort of entourage effect that you get 

2011
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,941
with almost any plant that has a variety
of different alkaloids that might 

2012
01:39:43,941 --> 01:39:44,970
inhibit certain enzymes or do this or 
that.

2013
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:50,380
Um,
but it's about 15 percent according to 

2014
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:53,631
the older literature.
The analysis that I did wasn't 

2015
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:56,121
quantitative,
so I don't know exactly what the 

2016
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:56,121
concentration was,
but it's somewhere in that region.

2017
01:39:56,121 --> 01:40:00,591
And I'm sure it depends on whether the 
toad has been milked previously and all 

2018
01:40:00,591 --> 01:40:00,591
these other variables.

2019
01:40:00,591 --> 01:40:04,260
Does the experience mirror taking 
synthetic five meo dmt?

2020
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:09,530
I haven't tried.
I've tried synthetic five mud empty a 

2021
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,020
couple times.
I've tried boof,

2022
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,230
all various venom wanted a low dose once
at a high dose.

2023
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:15,870
There were all different,
but then everything is different.

2024
01:40:15,871 --> 01:40:17,790
Mushrooms are different.
Every time I take them,

2025
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:18,540
you know,
it's,

2026
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:23,541
it's really hard once you start 
explaining a different experience based 

2027
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:28,641
on the composition of the material 
because how do you assign it to the dose

2028
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:33,720
or the minute number of different 
tryptamines that are also present.

2029
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:36,060
It's really hard to say,
but you know,

2030
01:40:36,061 --> 01:40:41,061
I think that there is a strong argument 
to be made for using the synthetic as 

2031
01:40:41,061 --> 01:40:43,350
opposed to the pto drive materials 
simply because you don't have to harm or

2032
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:45,480
hurt.
Not that it necessarily does harm toads,

2033
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:49,740
but you don't even have to risk it and 
it's easy to synthesize.

2034
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,460
Yeah,
I'm sure it.

2035
01:40:51,461 --> 01:40:53,530
Toads aren't into getting rubbed on 
windshields.

2036
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:57,020
Yeah.
Similar to annoying day for a toad.

2037
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:57,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2038
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,690
They want to eat insects.
Yeah.

2039
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,650
Whatever the fuck they do.
Um,

2040
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:05,770
one of the more interesting stories out 
of the last decade or so was,

2041
01:41:05,771 --> 01:41:06,310
um,

2042
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,340
this

2043
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:11,150
story that I read about these scholars 
in Jerusalem,

2044
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:16,660
that we're connecting the story of Moses
in the burning Bush to the Acacia Bush 

2045
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:23,210
and the case should tree which is rich 
and dmt and they believe that,

2046
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,600
you know,
when you're talking about a story that 

2047
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,701
was told through oral traditions for who
knows how many years and then written 

2048
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:36,341
down in ancient Hebrew and then 
transcribed and you know,

2049
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:43,860
and translated to Greek and Latin and 
all these days there's a lot lost in the

2050
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:46,320
mix.
And they believed that,

2051
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:51,410
what that story might have been about of
Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with 

2052
01:41:53,281 --> 01:41:57,370
the tablets and having the experience 
with meeting God in a burning Bush.

2053
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:00,780
This is in fact was a dimethyltryptamine
experience.

2054
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,190
Maybe.
Yeah.

2055
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,010
A,
it's a big.

2056
01:42:05,011 --> 01:42:08,720
Maybe it's a big.
Maybe I can say that.

2057
01:42:08,721 --> 01:42:13,721
Um,
if you go to the south of Mexico in 

2058
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:13,770
Chiapas,
there's a tree that grows.

2059
01:42:13,771 --> 01:42:17,100
There is a weed called Mimosa hostility.
Maybe you're familiar with it.

2060
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,850
And this is so abundant that it's used 
to make fence posts.

2061
01:42:20,851 --> 01:42:23,490
All the fences on the side of the road 
are made of most of hostility.

2062
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:28,500
It's used as firewood to cook meals.
The air smells like dmt because people 

2063
01:42:28,761 --> 01:42:33,761
are using it as fuel all over the place.
Not a single person that I spoke with 

2064
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:37,910
was aware that it with psychoactive.
And these are people that are burning it

2065
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:39,480
all the time.

2066
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,600
Do they get high from it?
Is there like if you were in a tent or 

2067
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:48,261
something like that,
you were doing a hot box sort of 

2068
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:48,261
scenario,
would you get high from it?

2069
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:49,050
No,
I saw no.

2070
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,000
Would you?
It may be.

2071
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:56,880
It's about two percent dmt so you'd 
probably have to get so sick from 

2072
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:59,290
coughing and yeah,
it would be a very.

2073
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:02,210
I mean even just smoking pure crystal 
Dmt,

2074
01:43:02,211 --> 01:43:03,880
it can be very difficult for some 
people.

2075
01:43:03,881 --> 01:43:08,881
So my gas not to be like a wet blanket,
but my guess is not really.

2076
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:14,370
Um,
and that's a very strong source.

2077
01:43:14,371 --> 01:43:17,400
As strong as maybe there's some acacia 
stronger,

2078
01:43:17,401 --> 01:43:20,190
but that's certainly comparable.
And that's something people are using to

2079
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:22,160
cook food all the time and they're not 
aware that it's like,

2080
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:27,380
so was there a way or is there a way for
a person living thousands of years ago 

2081
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:33,390
to somehow or another extract dmt from 
something like the Acacia Tree?

2082
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:38,650
Um,
that's actually spent some time thinking

2083
01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:40,780
about that a while ago.
It would be,

2084
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,750
first of all,
depends on how you define extraction.

2085
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:47,210
If it were to in like an Iowasca sends 
like a tea,

2086
01:43:47,211 --> 01:43:48,320
of course,
yes.

2087
01:43:48,321 --> 01:43:51,050
But then they would need some sort of 
enzyme inhibitor to create the.

2088
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,970
If it were to create a,
an isolated smokable form again,

2089
01:43:55,971 --> 01:44:00,971
you know,
you could just do it like an aqueous 

2090
01:44:00,971 --> 01:44:00,971
infusion and then try that out and maybe
smoke that.

2091
01:44:00,971 --> 01:44:04,310
But in terms of like a real extraction 
that would produce crystals of DMT,

2092
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:09,490
I don't know what the non polar solvent 
they would be using to extract a 

2093
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:09,770
freebase.
Would it be like butter or something.

2094
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:11,510
And then how would you get rid of the 
butter?

2095
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:16,511
So what is the process like?
If you're going to take a tree that's 

2096
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:19,691
rich and DMT and extract dmt from it,
what do you have to use a.

2097
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:21,650
have you ever done it before?
No,

2098
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,550
I've never done it.
Oh,

2099
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:23,750
okay.
Well,

2100
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:29,290
it's um,
it's a very generalizable and simple 

2101
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:30,230
process that applies to almost 
everything in chemistry.

2102
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:30,740
It's,
you know,

2103
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:33,080
sometimes it's called an acid base 
extraction.

2104
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:38,500
Most people that are in the dmt 
community go something they call 

2105
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:38,990
straight to base and the,
you know,

2106
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:43,991
the idea is that the side chain of the 
dmt molecule contains a basic nitrogen 

2107
01:44:43,991 --> 01:44:48,400
that if it's protonated in an acidic 
solution than it's water soluble and if 

2108
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:53,240
it's deprotonated than it's only soluble
in a non polar solvent.

2109
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:58,241
So what you do is you just deprotonated 
the nitrogen with a base potassium 

2110
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:03,551
hydroxide or sodium hydroxide typically,
and then treat that aqueous basic 

2111
01:45:03,551 --> 01:45:08,051
solution with a non polar solvent like 
Nafa and isolate the Nafa,

2112
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:13,100
dry it out and you have your material.
And that applies to everything.

2113
01:45:13,101 --> 01:45:16,880
That's not a dmt specific process,
but that's what people do.

2114
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:20,270
Everything with the basic nitrogen.
Now,

2115
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:24,080
what's the earliest history of 
extraction that we will,

2116
01:45:24,081 --> 01:45:29,081
you know,
the first wave of DMT use in the United 

2117
01:45:29,081 --> 01:45:29,081
States was all synthetic.
In fact,

2118
01:45:29,081 --> 01:45:32,280
DMT was discovered synthetically before 
it was ever found in nature.

2119
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,030
The same is true of five mg.
Odm called.

2120
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:39,090
They do that.
There was a Canadian chemist named 

2121
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:40,110
Richard Hellmuth Mansky who,
um,

2122
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:45,310
I believe was looking at different 
alkaloids and strawberry plants and he 

2123
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:51,280
was synthesizing references for these 
potential strawberry alkaloids and made 

2124
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,551
dmt so he didn't know what he had made 
other than a potential natural product 

2125
01:45:54,551 --> 01:45:55,040
found in strawberries.
And um,

2126
01:45:55,910 --> 01:46:00,320
and then it wasn't until much later 
conducted self experiments with injected

2127
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:03,610
dmt that people became fully aware of 
its psychoactivity.

2128
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:05,300
And then people started finding it 
implants.

2129
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:06,980
I mean the,
the 19 fifties where like,

2130
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:11,981
uh,
an early sixties were of course a 

2131
01:46:11,981 --> 01:46:13,691
fascinating time in psychedelic research
because you have these convergences of 

2132
01:46:13,691 --> 01:46:13,691
these amazing ideas.

2133
01:46:13,691 --> 01:46:15,380
First you have the discovery of 
Serotonin,

2134
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:17,420
which is like,
you know,

2135
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:20,540
we take this for granted,
now it's in television commercials,

2136
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,910
but this was of course something that no
one knew about it.

2137
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:25,460
And suddenly they're finding this in all
kinds of different animals.

2138
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:30,320
Initially it was in the salivary glands 
of squid and I'm in different animals.

2139
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:31,940
Then they're finding it in the human 
intestine.

2140
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:37,150
Then they're also finding that all of 
these plants that people worshiped in 

2141
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:40,670
various indigenous societies also 
contain serotonin molecules.

2142
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:45,671
Then they discover lsd and find that 
that's maybe the most potent known 

2143
01:46:45,671 --> 01:46:49,481
pharmacological agent at that time.
And it binds to serotonin receptors.

2144
01:46:50,901 --> 01:46:54,680
It activates a Serotonin type response 
in isolated tissue.

2145
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:59,520
So there's like this weird triple 
convergence of information.

2146
01:46:59,521 --> 01:47:02,370
Super potent,
amazing compound LSD is discovered,

2147
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:05,100
Serotonin is discovered and all these 
different organisms.

2148
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:07,470
And there's a pharmacological 
convergence between the two of them.

2149
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:10,440
And then you have all these people 
worshiping serotonin molecules.

2150
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,400
So there was,
you know,

2151
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:15,960
a lot of enthusiasm at that time to 
figure all this out.

2152
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:22,390
So in terms of history,
so we're talking about somewhere in the 

2153
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:25,901
19 fifties they started extracting tmt.
The use of it orally dates back far 

2154
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:31,280
longer than that because of use of Mao 
inhibitors and creating Iowasca.

2155
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:36,610
But in terms of the first extraction,
we can kind of implants to smoke.

2156
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,340
It might've been even later.
It might've been in the eighties.

2157
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:45,530
Okay.
So the idea that people thousands of 

2158
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:49,960
years ago,
we're able to do something along those 

2159
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,731
lines is probably probably not accurate 
because because they're talking about a 

2160
01:47:52,731 --> 01:47:53,790
burning Bush.
That's why it's appealing to people.

2161
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:55,690
Right.
The idea of Moses d,

2162
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:01,040
do you think that maybe the 
understanding of synthesis from the 

2163
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:07,010
synthesizing this from these scholars,
maybe they don't have enough of an 

2164
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:07,440
understanding of chemistry?

2165
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:12,850
Well,
what would be really interesting is to 

2166
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:14,150
do an experiment to see what were the 
materials that were available.

2167
01:48:14,151 --> 01:48:17,720
How would this have been done?
Would you have to use butter as your non

2168
01:48:17,721 --> 01:48:19,790
polar solvent?
How well would that work?

2169
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:22,160
What would your butter preparation be 
done when you put it?

2170
01:48:22,161 --> 01:48:24,530
Would you take it rectally then?
Is that how it would work?

2171
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:26,900
I mean you have to kind of.
What would your base have been?

2172
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:31,460
They were talking about it being 
something from burning a burning Bush.

2173
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,770
Maybe it's just one of those things that
sort of gets conflated,

2174
01:48:33,771 --> 01:48:38,771
right?
Because you have people today that are 

2175
01:48:38,771 --> 01:48:41,081
very aware that people smoked dmt and 
have these incredibly intense religious 

2176
01:48:41,081 --> 01:48:44,810
psychedelic experiences,
and then maybe they looked at the acacia

2177
01:48:44,811 --> 01:48:45,860
bushes and said,
oh,

2178
01:48:45,861 --> 01:48:50,861
the acacia bushes rich and DMT.
That's probably where the Moses story 

2179
01:48:50,861 --> 01:48:51,200
came from.

2180
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:52,020
Right.
Well,

2181
01:48:52,021 --> 01:48:53,260
what's really interesting is,
you know,

2182
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:55,290
dmt has never been found in the human 
brain,

2183
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,900
even though Rick strassman says that it 
has been.

2184
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:01,410
So.
A lot of people are constantly assigning

2185
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:06,411
altered states of consciousness to Dmt,
but we can have these states without 

2186
01:49:06,411 --> 01:49:07,030
dmt.
I mean,

2187
01:49:07,031 --> 01:49:08,800
maybe it's never been found in the human
brain,

2188
01:49:08,801 --> 01:49:13,801
but also there's ethical and 
experimental issues with sampling fluid 

2189
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:14,510
from the living human brain.

2190
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,310
Right,
but it has.

2191
01:49:15,311 --> 01:49:18,720
They have founded in living rats were 
fairly recently.

2192
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:20,980
This is the cottonwood research 
foundation.

2193
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:21,900
That's their.
Their.

2194
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:26,910
Their attempt is to try to prove that 
the pineal gland is a source for DMT.

2195
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,160
We know that DMT exists in the human 
body.

2196
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:32,840
We know that the liver produces it,
and we know that the lungs produce it.

2197
01:49:33,130 --> 01:49:38,130
We're not totally aware of whether or 
not there's anecdotal evidence that 

2198
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:38,730
points to the pineal gland

2199
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,600
based on the rat idea and based on the 
presence of certain enzymes that could 

2200
01:49:44,831 --> 01:49:47,170
be responsible for it,
but even if it is,

2201
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,670
even if it is,
then what,

2202
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:51,850
there's still a whole question of how is
it released,

2203
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:54,720
how is it distributed,
what receptors does it activate in?

2204
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:59,120
Is it even necessary as an explanation 
for altered states of consciousness?

2205
01:49:59,121 --> 01:50:01,670
Because there are other things in the 
brain other than dmt.

2206
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:03,260
DMT has never even been found in the 
brain,

2207
01:50:03,261 --> 01:50:04,190
but there are other things,
you know,

2208
01:50:04,191 --> 01:50:08,570
you have endogenous proteins that bind 
to the kappa opioid receptor,

2209
01:50:08,571 --> 01:50:12,260
the same receptor that is responsible 
for the effect of Salvia,

2210
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,550
um,
things like that.

2211
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,010
They were responsible.
I mean,

2212
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:20,020
even carbon dioxide itself can induce a 
pretty strong altered state of 

2213
01:50:20,331 --> 01:50:21,110
consciousness.

2214
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:26,190
Right.
Which is why people like those 

2215
01:50:26,190 --> 01:50:26,190
psychedelic breathing exercises.
Yeah.

2216
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:28,210
Sort of.
Was it like hypoxic?

2217
01:50:28,211 --> 01:50:33,211
Is that what it is?
What are they doing when they have 

2218
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:33,211
those?
Um,

2219
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:33,280
the what,
what is it called?

2220
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:38,110
There's a type of breathing exercise 
that induces psychedelic states.

2221
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,330
Holotropic breathwork.
Yeah,

2222
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,250
and that is the idea behind that,
right?

2223
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:44,560
It increases the amount of carbon 
dioxide in your blood.

2224
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:47,160
I haven't seen it.
A mechanistic explanation.

2225
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:48,090
Hm.

2226
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,990
Yeah.
I think that was,

2227
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,510
but it would,
yeah,

2228
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,570
it would make sense.
In an early LSD psychotherapy,

2229
01:50:54,571 --> 01:50:59,571
one of the things that they would do 
before giving someone lsts would give 

2230
01:50:59,571 --> 01:51:02,211
them something called carbogen,
which was a gas that contains carbon 

2231
01:51:02,211 --> 01:51:05,541
dioxide and they would look at their 
response to the carbon dioxide 

2232
01:51:05,541 --> 01:51:06,790
inhalation and if it induced a panic 
response,

2233
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:11,940
they would say,
maybe you're not psychologically ready 

2234
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:11,940
for this lsd.
That's scary.

2235
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,680
So that was.
You're talking about a test.

2236
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:18,890
I mean that was a very primitive early 
tests that was used by psychiatrists to 

2237
01:51:19,071 --> 01:51:23,120
see if people were had this 
psychological fortitude to withstand the

2238
01:51:23,121 --> 01:51:23,840
experience.

2239
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:27,320
That's fascinating.
So tell me more about whatever is in the

2240
01:51:27,321 --> 01:51:29,870
brain that mirrors the effects of 
Salvia.

2241
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,280
It's a protein.
I can't remember off the top of my head.

2242
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:39,310
What did you look up?
Endogenous ligand for Kappa opioid 

2243
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:39,620
receptor.
It will come up.

2244
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:44,980
David Nichols recently wrote a paper 
that actually goes into alternate 

2245
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:48,040
mechanisms of how the DMT type a near 
death experience could be produced by 

2246
01:51:50,481 --> 01:51:52,730
non dmt compounds,
but I mean,

2247
01:51:52,731 --> 01:51:57,731
you know,
there was a lot of work also on 

2248
01:51:57,731 --> 01:51:59,561
endogenous and MDA receptor antagonists.
There was a a protein that was called 

2249
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:05,620
Alpha endo psychosis or Angel Dustin 
named after Angel Dust,

2250
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,890
but the main researcher died in a car 
accident,

2251
01:52:08,891 --> 01:52:13,330
like right as he was making some kind of
breakthrough breakthrough supposedly,

2252
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:18,430
but I'm q spooky music,
but you know,

2253
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:22,120
there's all.
This has been a longstanding question in

2254
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:25,870
psychiatry is you know,
what causes psychosis,

2255
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,730
what causes altered states of 
consciousness?

2256
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:32,760
Is there an endogenous psychedelic?
That was one of the major motivations 

2257
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,460
for a lot of this research in the 
sixties.

2258
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:37,900
Finding the endogenous psychotic and 
that is responsible for schizophrenia.

2259
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,160
Now it doesn't seem to be the case,
but it's still a question that comes up.

2260
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:45,650
What if dopamine is methylated in a 
certain way to create diamonds?

2261
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:48,680
Oxy Fin ethylamine or what about this?
What about that?

2262
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:50,360
I mean,
sheldon was very interested in it,

2263
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,660
but the metabolic production of various 
psychedelics that account for altered 

2264
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:59,651
states of consciousness,
it just hasn't been supported by 

2265
01:52:59,651 --> 01:53:02,950
evidence in a very strong way,
even though people really find the idea 

2266
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:06,140
compelling and there was also the 5 
million dmt and schizophrenia people's 

2267
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,140
crn.
That's also a thing,

2268
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:11,110
right?
And we know that the body does produce 

2269
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:12,020
five Meo DMT.
We just don't know where yet,

2270
01:53:12,021 --> 01:53:17,021
because again,
it's like what I was saying earlier 

2271
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:17,021
about the depression tests where you 
look at your urine,

2272
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:20,780
so you find five Meo dmt in your urine.
And your first assumption might be,

2273
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:23,360
okay,
there's five immuno DMT in my body.

2274
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:28,361
It was in my brain,
but you don't know that it could have 

2275
01:53:28,361 --> 01:53:29,870
been biosynthesis in your intestine and 
it could have been excluded without ever

2276
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:31,580
entering your brain.
Right?

2277
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,790
This is the whole idea of monoamine 
oxidase,

2278
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:39,791
right?
The idea that when we're eating things 

2279
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:40,670
that are rich and DMT,
monoamine oxidase is breaking it down in

2280
01:53:40,671 --> 01:53:41,650
the gut.
Yeah.

2281
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:46,910
So even if you're consuming something.
So if something is.

2282
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,040
So how do they know that this,
this,

2283
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:51,590
uh,
Salvia like substance

2284
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,900
exists in the mind or in the brain 
rather because this,

2285
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:58,230
this peptide or protein has been 
isolated.

2286
01:53:58,231 --> 01:54:00,460
Do you find the name of it?
Oh,

2287
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,770
okay.
How I caught four of those words.

2288
01:54:02,771 --> 01:54:06,110
You said I've lost what I was supposed 
to be.

2289
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:07,780
Um,

2290
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:14,050
so we know there's a host of different 
psychoactive substance are absolutely 

2291
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:15,560
produced by the body and in,
in,

2292
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:16,730
in the,
in the brain,

2293
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:21,940
and that there's different ways that 
human beings have been able to achieve 

2294
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:25,910
psychedelic states outside of consuming 
drugs.

2295
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:26,840
Have you

2296
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:31,090
done that?
I've done lucid dreaming things.

2297
01:54:31,091 --> 01:54:33,070
I've done Kundalini Yoga

2298
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:38,400
and one is the one that I'm most 
interested in because I have someone 

2299
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:38,770
who's,
a friend of mine that got really into it

2300
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:43,560
and he was saying that he can achieve 
very dmt like state

2301
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:48,820
know is a really interesting aspect of 
all of this that isn't often discussed,

2302
01:54:48,821 --> 01:54:53,821
which is the ability to have these 
states and still interact with your 

2303
01:54:53,821 --> 01:54:54,610
environment.
Because of course there's something very

2304
01:54:54,611 --> 01:54:58,840
physically taxing about breath of fire.
These Kundalini breathing techniques,

2305
01:54:58,841 --> 01:55:00,550
if you induce an altered state of 
consciousness,

2306
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,560
you need to be focused and you need to 
be in a specific place sitting down 

2307
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:09,570
where psychedelics have this amazing 
ability to allow you to have that 

2308
01:55:09,570 --> 01:55:12,631
experience,
but walk around and I think that's not 

2309
01:55:12,631 --> 01:55:16,021
to be underestimated,
the walking around because then you can 

2310
01:55:16,021 --> 01:55:17,620
really reexamine your environment.
That's a big part of it.

2311
01:55:17,621 --> 01:55:19,720
For me,
a big part of the psychedelic experience

2312
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:24,870
is seeing what is New York like,
what do I like or not like about New 

2313
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:29,070
York?
What do I like or not like about my 

2314
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:29,070
apartment?
These matters.

2315
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:29,950
These things matter.
This is your environment.

2316
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:32,470
Do you want to be surrounded by clutter 
that you don't like?

2317
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:38,010
If you don't get rid of it?
These are the sorts of thoughts you 

2318
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:38,010
have,
and this is my other issue with going to

2319
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:41,380
the Peruvian Amazon to have a 
psychedelic experience because if you do

2320
01:55:41,381 --> 01:55:44,550
it in this place that is superficially 
inappropriate,

2321
01:55:44,551 --> 01:55:48,760
like your apartment,
I think it has the most applicability to

2322
01:55:48,761 --> 01:55:51,100
your own existence in terms of the music
you listened to,

2323
01:55:51,101 --> 01:55:52,570
your friends,
your environment,

2324
01:55:52,690 --> 01:55:57,690
your life,
you're confronted by the books that you 

2325
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:57,690
read,
the photos of the people that,

2326
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:59,050
you know,
all the things that matter to you.

2327
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:04,080
Not a jungle,
although jungles are very beautiful and 

2328
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:04,080
visually stimulating and I'm sure and 
our,

2329
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,830
I know an amazing place to use 
psychedelics.

2330
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:11,010
Um,
I think that we underestimate the value 

2331
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:14,221
of these things have been integrated 
into a more normal type of experience 

2332
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:17,290
and that's something you can't do as 
easily with a Kundalini.

2333
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:18,320
Right,
right.

2334
01:56:18,321 --> 01:56:21,470
That makes sense.
So when you're using psychedelics,

2335
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,920
you will use them and walk around New 
York City?

2336
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:27,240
Yes.
What does that look?

2337
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:30,270
Um,
I often feel a lot of love for.

2338
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:30,960
Really?
Yeah.

2339
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:31,580
Which is,
you know,

2340
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:36,610
because I think that we also tend to get
into these very angry,

2341
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:41,140
the subways,
knowing guys taking up too much room.

2342
01:56:41,141 --> 01:56:43,870
I have to stand taking forever.
It smells weird,

2343
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:48,871
whatever.
Everyone is looking at their phones all 

2344
01:56:48,871 --> 01:56:48,871
the time,
which is a little bit dark.

2345
01:56:48,871 --> 01:56:50,870
Um,
and then you know,

2346
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,260
if you're on a low dose of a psychedelic
or even a higher one,

2347
01:56:54,261 --> 01:56:58,450
sometimes I'll look at everyone on their
phones and I'll just feel compassion and

2348
01:56:58,451 --> 01:57:03,451
love and think like what a strange 
situation we've all gotten ourselves 

2349
01:57:03,451 --> 01:57:04,480
into.
I love all these people and it's like,

2350
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:10,140
I don't know what to say about it,
but I understand that completely and I 

2351
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:13,171
don't know where we're going from here.
And he suddenly feel connected to 

2352
01:57:13,171 --> 01:57:16,861
something that's very real,
which is people on the subway not 

2353
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:17,090
looking at each other anymore.
I mean,

2354
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:22,110
this is in my own life.
Something that has changed dramatically 

2355
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:22,120
when I moved to New York.
No one looked at phones.

2356
01:57:22,121 --> 01:57:25,750
Now people only look at phones.
Everyone is looking at phones the entire

2357
01:57:25,751 --> 01:57:29,830
time they're on the subway is a total 
change in human behavior.

2358
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:35,040
And you really start thinking about 
things like that and it matters because 

2359
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:38,340
it's not in the Amazon,
it's your life and these are the things 

2360
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,131
that choices that you make.
Are you going to be a person that looks 

2361
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:41,131
at their phone all day

2362
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:41,180
time as well?
Yeah.

2363
01:57:41,181 --> 01:57:43,220
It's fascinating how quickly that took 
hold.

2364
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:45,480
Yeah.
If you look at human history,

2365
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:49,200
when the iphone is 10 years old,
I know that's really when it started,

2366
01:57:49,201 --> 01:57:51,030
so 10 years ago,
people's.

2367
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:55,140
And even then in the beginning of the 
iphone there were fucking useless,

2368
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:55,590
right?
You know,

2369
01:57:55,591 --> 01:58:00,591
you get online and it was really slow 
and terrible and so most of the time we 

2370
01:58:00,591 --> 01:58:05,421
just text messages,
but now with all the apps and social 

2371
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:09,501
media and constant constant updates of 
information and new things and new 

2372
01:58:10,231 --> 01:58:13,800
events and new trends and it's just.
It's always calling you.

2373
01:58:13,801 --> 01:58:15,290
I'm going to check,
make sure everything's done.

2374
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:17,250
We've been on this podcast for two 
hours.

2375
01:58:17,251 --> 01:58:19,590
Let me see what's going on.
I'll look at that.

2376
01:58:19,591 --> 01:58:23,820
All of these messages here,
you did it to me.

2377
01:58:23,821 --> 01:58:28,821
Actually.
I have this vivid memory of standing at 

2378
01:58:28,821 --> 01:58:29,390
your front door and you selling twitter 
to me saying like,

2379
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:29,970
Oh,
you've got it.

2380
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,100
You've got to use twitter.
It's amazing.

2381
01:58:32,101 --> 01:58:35,640
People send all thing you all these 
articles and it's so useful.

2382
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:40,641
You learn so much.
It's a really amazing set of only had 

2383
01:58:40,641 --> 01:58:42,010
one tweet at that time and now it's like
2,500

2384
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,010
tweets later and hundreds of hours of my
life.

2385
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:45,580
I'll never get it.

2386
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:47,360
Sorry.
I got Ya.

2387
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:49,320
Got Ya.
Um,

2388
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:54,370
it w,
it is that way still for me in many 

2389
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:57,371
ways.
I learn a lot about what's going on in 

2390
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:57,371
the world and I follow a lot of science 
tweets,

2391
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:02,800
twitter accounts,
and a lot of really interesting people 

2392
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,741
that post interesting stuff.
But you gotta know how to abandon a 

2393
01:59:06,681 --> 01:59:09,170
tweet.
Several words in like,

2394
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,420
this is bullshit.
I'm not reading that.

2395
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:12,560
No,
I'm not reading that.

2396
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,090
Oh,
what can they do now?

2397
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:16,010
Teeth are too long.
This is crazy.

2398
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,060
No,
it's not even that.

2399
01:59:17,061 --> 01:59:18,700
It's just knowing that it's going to be 
horse shit.

2400
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:23,730
This is going to be just either gossip 
or nonsense or not interesting,

2401
01:59:24,081 --> 01:59:29,081
but there's still a shit ton of really 
useful information that you can get out 

2402
01:59:29,081 --> 01:59:32,921
of twitter on a daily basis.
There's always something new that's 

2403
01:59:32,921 --> 01:59:34,880
coming out and I try to retweet those 
things as much as possible.

2404
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:39,080
When I see something that someone sends 
me and then that becomes,

2405
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:40,580
people know,
hey,

2406
01:59:40,581 --> 01:59:43,760
if you send joe something really cool 
and he reads it,

2407
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:48,761
if I get a chance to read it,
I'll retweet it and people get a kick 

2408
01:59:48,761 --> 01:59:49,820
out of that so they'll send me more cool
stuff and so then it's sort of.

2409
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:55,080
It's sort of becomes a like a little 
ecosystem almost for disseminating 

2410
01:59:55,941 --> 01:59:57,650
interesting ideas.
Yeah.

2411
01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:00,350
That's also bullshit too.
There's a lot of bullshit in there,

2412
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:02,150
a lot,
a lot of arguing,

2413
02:00:02,151 --> 02:00:04,370
which I don't do.
I just don't argue.

2414
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:07,940
I think it's a very ineffective way to 
communicate with people,

2415
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,180
with going back and forth with stuff 
like that online.

2416
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:12,950
It just doesn't work well.
It's.

2417
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:14,090
And it becomes,
I think,

2418
02:00:14,091 --> 02:00:19,091
more like idea sport with a lot of folks
like they're just trying to win these 

2419
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:22,940
little battles and find the whittier 
nasty thing to say and it's just,

2420
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:25,370
it's not productive.
It's not healthy.

2421
02:00:25,371 --> 02:00:26,060
I don't like it.

2422
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:31,140
Well,
they're doing the same thing that 

2423
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,140
journalists do,
which is that you get more attention for

2424
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:35,491
doing the wrong thing than you do for 
saying the right thing and we all know 

2425
02:00:35,491 --> 02:00:40,111
that feeling where someone says 
something about you that's unfair and 

2426
02:00:40,111 --> 02:00:40,111
wrong,
and you want to say,

2427
02:00:40,111 --> 02:00:41,590
Hey,
wait a second about that.

2428
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:45,310
That is totally incorrect.
I'm going to set the record straight.

2429
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:49,120
And that's what gets the engagement.
Not the kind thoughtful,

2430
02:00:49,121 --> 02:00:51,490
considerate thing that somebody says,
yeah,

2431
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:56,990
yes.
I would love to accentuate the trend of 

2432
02:00:56,990 --> 02:00:58,460
kindness.
I really think that that is one thing,

2433
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:03,580
if there's any one trend and to lean 
towards kindness to just to just to be 

2434
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
nicer to people and if we could all sort
of agree that this is a virtue worth 

2435
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,260
pursuing,
I think it would change the way human 

2436
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:17,201
beings interact with each other.
These shifts like the shift of looking 

2437
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:20,651
at your phone,
if we could figure out a shift and one 

2438
02:01:20,651 --> 02:01:20,870
of the more disturbing things to me that
comes from the left,

2439
02:01:20,871 --> 02:01:25,871
which I've always associated myself with
being a left leaning person that there's

2440
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
a lot of meanness coming from the left 
now and a lot of lot of by any means 

2441
02:01:32,001 --> 02:01:37,001
necessary.
A lot of feeling the need to squash 

2442
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:40,241
people and humiliate people and insult 
people because they agree with what you 

2443
02:01:40,241 --> 02:01:41,690
believe and that this.

2444
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:47,470
This is a.
I think this is a terrible path to go 

2445
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:50,090
down because then it sort of justifies 
people who think the opposite of that to

2446
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:55,091
be mean to you.
So now no one's getting anything done 

2447
02:01:55,091 --> 02:01:57,940
because this side's being insulting and 
that side's being insulting and people 

2448
02:01:57,940 --> 02:02:02,171
are getting kicked out of restaurants 
and people are protesting in front of 

2449
02:02:02,171 --> 02:02:05,231
people's houses because they disagree 
with things and he says a lot of 

2450
02:02:05,231 --> 02:02:06,260
cruelty.
A lot of like meanness and cruelty,

2451
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:11,261
which is the enemy of discourse.
As soon as that stuff gets thrown about 

2452
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:15,020
and soon as it becomes a war and idea of
war or an idea sport,

2453
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:20,170
people are just trying to win and the 
trying to get back at you for what you 

2454
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:23,051
said and you get back at them for that 
and it becomes this terrible stall out 

2455
02:02:23,051 --> 02:02:23,510
situation.

2456
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:28,600
Yeah,
we've all bought into a game and it's a 

2457
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,791
bad game to play.
It's the worst possible game and it's 

2458
02:02:30,791 --> 02:02:34,930
very transparent.
I mean you look at what shows up on the 

2459
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:38,051
first page of twitter and it's things 
that are perfectly designed to generate 

2460
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:41,720
opinions.
So teacher says that now classrooms will

2461
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:46,721
be equipped with a bucket of stones to 
throw at a school shooter and what do 

2462
02:02:46,721 --> 02:02:47,000
you feel?
Oh,

2463
02:02:47,001 --> 02:02:48,140
that's stupid.
Or Hey,

2464
02:02:48,141 --> 02:02:53,141
that's actually kind of a good idea.
It's better than nothing and everyone's 

2465
02:02:53,141 --> 02:02:53,690
engaging with it and you're buying into 
it.

2466
02:02:53,691 --> 02:02:56,240
You're supporting it and you're 
promoting it and you're making it bigger

2467
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:57,830
by paying attention to it.
I mean,

2468
02:02:57,831 --> 02:03:02,831
there's an amazing book that I recommend
anyone listening to this read called 

2469
02:03:02,831 --> 02:03:02,960
amusing ourselves to death by Neil 
Postman,

2470
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:07,010
which he wrote in 1985 before computers,
before social media,

2471
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:12,011
before any of this.
He predicts all of it perfectly without 

2472
02:03:12,011 --> 02:03:14,531
even knowing the faintest hint of what 
was going to happen and you know his 

2473
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:20,470
solution if there is one,
is you know partially to disengage from 

2474
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:22,820
all of this,
but to try to appreciate long,

2475
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:27,850
nuanced,
careful things which is very hard to 

2476
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:27,850
achieve on twitter or

2477
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,370
television or most places will try our 
best.

2478
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:35,730
Well,
I think that's one of the reasons why 

2479
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:37,501
podcasts like especially ones like this 
that are these long form conversations 

2480
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:43,140
are becoming popular because people are 
hungry for actual communication and 

2481
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:46,120
they're hungry for people that are just.
Even if we disagree on things.

2482
02:03:46,121 --> 02:03:50,560
I want to know why you think the way you
think and I want to hear it all.

2483
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:55,590
I want to hear all of your reasoning.
I want to hear the thought process that 

2484
02:03:55,590 --> 02:04:00,001
led you to that.
I want to hear that and I want to be 

2485
02:04:00,001 --> 02:04:02,701
able to talk to you about how I think 
and why I think the way I think and 

2486
02:04:02,701 --> 02:04:06,481
maybe we can come to some middle ground 
or at least understand each other and 

2487
02:04:06,481 --> 02:04:06,481
go,
oh,

2488
02:04:06,481 --> 02:04:08,020
I've seen where you went,
or I see why you do.

2489
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:13,170
I see what's happening inside your mind 
or the way you feel or how it relates to

2490
02:04:13,481 --> 02:04:14,020
your life.

2491
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:18,370
This is absent in most discourse on 
television.

2492
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:22,480
It's absent in all talk shows.
It's like what we're talking about,

2493
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:25,110
the oddness of a panel show.
I mean,

2494
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:27,550
they're so bizarre.
It doesn't make any sense.

2495
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,760
None of it.
It's not how human beings interact with 

2496
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:36,361
each other.
Can you imagine if every conversation 

2497
02:04:36,361 --> 02:04:38,281
you had in your life there was an 
audience clapping or we'll wing at 

2498
02:04:38,281 --> 02:04:41,641
everything said you'd mean it creates 
this sort of fake way of communication 

2499
02:04:44,251 --> 02:04:47,010
that has become so commonplace with us.
You just.

2500
02:04:47,011 --> 02:04:50,370
Even the way they sit sitting next to 
each other like this,

2501
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:55,550
like we're not looking at each other.
I would be sitting over here and you'd 

2502
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:55,550
be at the desk and I build,
well,

2503
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:57,450
Hamilton,
funny you bring that up,

2504
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,550
but you know,
look at the crowd.

2505
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:00,330
It's just,
it's,

2506
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:06,020
it's alien.
It's really weird and I think because of

2507
02:05:06,061 --> 02:05:11,061
the fact that people are so addicted to 
their phones and addicted to media and 

2508
02:05:11,061 --> 02:05:13,950
this constant influx of this loop of 
information.

2509
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:18,950
I mean if you watch the news,
they can't just give you the fucking 

2510
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:21,411
news.
You have to get that scroll on the 

2511
02:05:21,411 --> 02:05:21,411
bottom of other shit that you should be 
freaking out about.

2512
02:05:21,411 --> 02:05:23,010
It's like the news itself is not enough.
No.

2513
02:05:23,011 --> 02:05:27,560
You have to know about terrorist attacks
and fucking Isis and new,

2514
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:32,570
some new flu that can't be cured and 
it's all scrolling on the bottom while 

2515
02:05:32,570 --> 02:05:34,890
you're watching other shit.
We was.

2516
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,200
This is not how human beings are 
designed.

2517
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:42,230
We're designed to talk or designed to 
communicate with each other person to 

2518
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:44,040
person.
This is what we're good at.

2519
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:49,430
This is what we've lost,
and the one thing that has probably lead

2520
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:51,990
to more people understanding more about 
each other.

2521
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:56,400
Actual conversations is rare,
which is really weird.

2522
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:59,700
You're,
it's way more common for someone to look

2523
02:05:59,701 --> 02:06:03,510
at their phone for 10 hours a day that 
it is for someone to have a one-on-one,

2524
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:06,360
uninterrupted conversation with someone 
for an hour.

2525
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,720
Those don't exist.
They don't exist with lovers.

2526
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:13,170
That's it.
With lovers and occasionally with if you

2527
02:06:13,171 --> 02:06:18,171
have polite dinner companions that put 
their phone down and just drink a glass 

2528
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:21,960
of wine and talk to you about stuff,
but even then people suck at it.

2529
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,630
It's almost like people forgot how to do
it.

2530
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,480
They talk over each other.
They don't listen to each other.

2531
02:06:27,481 --> 02:06:30,240
When the other person's talking,
they just waiting their turn and talk.

2532
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:35,720
It's a we're.
We're going down weird roads that these 

2533
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:40,191
roads where we're sort of distancing 
ourselves from compassion and 

2534
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:43,920
understanding and real communication.
Absolutely.

2535
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:46,350
I don't know what to do about it either.

2536
02:06:48,990 --> 02:06:51,750
Psychedelics might help.
That's what I'm saying.

2537
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:54,240
That's what I'm saying.
I think they would help.

2538
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:59,540
I think if we had like real centers 
where you could go and just like you 

2539
02:07:00,211 --> 02:07:05,211
could go to a place where you can get a 
licensed therapist to massage you.

2540
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:07,740
You know,
hey,

2541
02:07:07,741 --> 02:07:12,720
I've gotten this back pole and you know,
the only thing that works is deep tissue

2542
02:07:12,721 --> 02:07:14,250
massage.
You go to a place,

2543
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:19,370
they give you a robe,
they played nice music that give you 

2544
02:07:19,370 --> 02:07:22,611
team and they're.
They're setting the set and see the 

2545
02:07:22,611 --> 02:07:22,790
setting and the the,
the,

2546
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,150
the ambience of the room,
it,

2547
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:30,160
it,
it enhances the experience of getting 

2548
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:30,160
the massage.
When you go into the room,

2549
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:32,190
the lights are down.
They might have a candle lit,

2550
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:37,430
you know there's some fucking hot rocks 
in the place and they're playing 

2551
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:41,970
beautiful harp music in the background.
The set and setting is a part of the 

2552
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:46,060
experience of getting a massage.
If we could have something like that and

2553
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:50,880
have these things common for the use of 
psychedelics where you could go to a,

2554
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:53,140
a,
an actual,

2555
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:57,280
some sort of therapist that's trained in
both psychotherapy,

2556
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:02,340
in the use of psychedelics so they could
talk to you and find out if you're 

2557
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:06,121
stable,
ask you questions about your medical 

2558
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:08,941
history,
what kind of medications or you're on 

2559
02:08:08,941 --> 02:08:08,941
it,
how you feeling,

2560
02:08:08,941 --> 02:08:11,330
what are you trying to achieve through 
this and then work you through.

2561
02:08:11,331 --> 02:08:16,331
An experience,
I think this can be enormously 

2562
02:08:16,331 --> 02:08:16,331
beneficial.

2563
02:08:16,331 --> 02:08:18,160
I'm sure it already has been.
I mean,

2564
02:08:18,161 --> 02:08:23,161
that's you.
We keep talking about psychedelic 

2565
02:08:23,161 --> 02:08:23,161
medicine all the time,
but so much of this has been done.

2566
02:08:23,161 --> 02:08:25,810
That's the really crazy thing.
I became used to be a pharmaceutical and

2567
02:08:25,811 --> 02:08:30,811
France.
Although as using lower doses that 

2568
02:08:30,811 --> 02:08:30,811
weren't psychedelic,
there used to be an mdms.

2569
02:08:30,811 --> 02:08:34,870
Are they using it for as like a tonic to
stimulate people?

2570
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:37,520
It was called Lam,
Berean,

2571
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:42,610
eight milligram tablets.
What is an effective dose threshold 

2572
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:46,460
psychoactivity in my experiences,
about 20 milligrams of the hydrochloride

2573
02:08:46,461 --> 02:08:48,930
salt,
but there were microdosing there.

2574
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:52,070
There were many microdosing,
microdosing,

2575
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:54,200
Ibogaine.
They may have used multiple tablets.

2576
02:08:54,201 --> 02:08:58,760
I don't know if anyone is familiar with 
French historical literature relating to

2577
02:08:58,761 --> 02:09:00,110
Ibogaine.
I have a little bit of it,

2578
02:09:00,111 --> 02:09:01,340
but there isn't much.
I mean,

2579
02:09:01,341 --> 02:09:06,341
again,
they used to use a psychedelic called 

2580
02:09:06,341 --> 02:09:06,560
Indo pan as an antidepressant and the 
Soviet Union in the United States,

2581
02:09:06,561 --> 02:09:11,561
there was a drug called Monet's Alpha.
Ethel tryptamine was used as an 

2582
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:11,561
antidepressant.
It's an MDM type,

2583
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:13,100
serotonin releaser.
And then of course,

2584
02:09:13,101 --> 02:09:15,960
the whole history of dpt facilitated,
um,

2585
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:17,750
end of life therapy,
lsd,

2586
02:09:17,751 --> 02:09:19,790
psychotherapy,
and on,

2587
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:24,791
and on it,
everything shoguns group did using two 

2588
02:09:24,791 --> 02:09:26,710
CB MMDA Ibogaine.
Um,

2589
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:30,860
this was along with Claudio Naranjo in 
order to facilitate psychotherapy.

2590
02:09:30,861 --> 02:09:33,350
I mean,
people not only were doing it,

2591
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:36,080
they were exploring all the different 
ways to do it,

2592
02:09:36,081 --> 02:09:39,190
which compounds are best for which 
applications.

2593
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:40,320
Hm.

2594
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:43,480
Do you have any experience with cacao?
Yes.

2595
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:49,170
What is your experience in terms of the 
psychedelic effects or psychoactive 

2596
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:49,170
effects?

2597
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:53,500
Um,
it's mildly stimulating because of the 

2598
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:53,500
theobromine content.

2599
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:56,430
But does it mirror a small dose of Mtma 
or not?

2600
02:09:56,431 --> 02:09:57,550
In my experience,
no,

2601
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:00,000
it was kyle that was talking about that,
right?

2602
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:05,001
Carl Kingsburg,
he was saying that in large doses that 

2603
02:10:05,001 --> 02:10:08,480
rock cow has some sort of a mild mtma 
like effect.

2604
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:13,750
I've heard people say that and people 
will sometimes say that the presence of 

2605
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,260
fin ethylamine in Cacao could account 
for that,

2606
02:10:15,261 --> 02:10:19,140
but it's such a small amount.
Race quantity is less than a milligram.

2607
02:10:19,290 --> 02:10:24,290
And the active dose of Finesse woman is 
hundreds of kilograms or grams in order 

2608
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:27,981
to achieve a psychoactive effect.
So I think the effect that people do 

2609
02:10:27,981 --> 02:10:29,880
experience is probably mediated by 
theobromine,

2610
02:10:29,881 --> 02:10:33,830
which is present in,
in a relatively high quantities.

2611
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:34,750
That's how the,
you know,

2612
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,830
it's named after the genus Theobroma

2613
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:40,420
and theobromine does what,
how does it make you feel?

2614
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,570
It's a,
it's a caffeine type stimulant.

2615
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:45,660
So when people say that chocolate 
contains caffeine,

2616
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:47,910
what they're really referring to 
theobromine.

2617
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:51,000
And is that why it's deadly to dogs?
Yes it is.

2618
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:55,170
Huh?
So it's theobromine that's doing it.

2619
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:56,580
Yup.
Fascinating.

2620
02:10:56,910 --> 02:11:00,660
So it's not actually caffeine.
No caffeine like substance.

2621
02:11:00,661 --> 02:11:05,661
It's less potent than coffee.
And what was your experience like 

2622
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:05,661
physically?
How did you feel when you took this?

2623
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:07,260
Uh,
this Cacao and whatnot?

2624
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:08,220
What,
how,

2625
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:09,330
what,
how large dose?

2626
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:12,660
I mean I used to eat it every day.
What?

2627
02:11:12,670 --> 02:11:17,670
Raw powders?
The powder you did everyday and yogurt 

2628
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:20,550
and I'm just as a health thing.
Yeah,

2629
02:11:20,551 --> 02:11:24,230
as a health thing.
And I liked the flavor of it,

2630
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:27,530
but I have never had an experience 
beyond,

2631
02:11:27,531 --> 02:11:30,320
at most a low level stimulant 
experience.

2632
02:11:30,321 --> 02:11:33,950
And I've also taken pure theobromine and
is stimulating,

2633
02:11:33,951 --> 02:11:36,530
but it requires 500 milligrams to 
achieve an effect.

2634
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:37,550
If I remember correctly,

2635
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,400
um,
what other,

2636
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,480
what about,
um,

2637
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:43,130
you ever fuck with nutmeg?

2638
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:44,950
Nobody.
I mean,

2639
02:11:44,951 --> 02:11:47,110
it's a fascinating area.
Um,

2640
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:48,050
of course,
you know,

2641
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:53,130
prisoners historically did it.
Malcolm x did it and the essential oil 

2642
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:58,151
of nutmeg contains Marista seven,
which is a precursor for the psychedelic

2643
02:11:58,811 --> 02:12:01,390
amphetamine MMDA,
not Mtma,

2644
02:12:01,391 --> 02:12:03,010
but it's methoxy,
MDA,

2645
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:08,400
and as well as lme sin,
which is another psychedelic precursor 

2646
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:11,650
as well as,
um,

2647
02:12:11,710 --> 02:12:13,800
there's,
I think one other maybe even sap role.

2648
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:14,890
Actually,
I think it's saffron.

2649
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:18,700
Lms and Morrison and Shogun had a 
hypothesis.

2650
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:23,790
Again,
Shogun was actually by training a 

2651
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:23,790
biochemist,
not an organic chemist,

2652
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:24,910
although he spent his career doing 
organic chemistry.

2653
02:12:24,911 --> 02:12:28,570
So he was very interested in these ideas
with the body creating psychedelics.

2654
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:33,220
So he thought when you consume nutmeg 
oil that your body is,

2655
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:38,610
is emanating this double bond and 
creating a series of different 

2656
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:40,270
amphetamines and that's what accounts 
for the high.

2657
02:12:40,570 --> 02:12:42,670
But in reality people don't actually 
know.

2658
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:44,200
Wow.
Yeah.

2659
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,920
Hmm.
So what kind of history of use the does 

2660
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:54,280
it have in terms of like people taking 
it for the psychoactive benefits?

2661
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:58,550
I'm sure there is some ancient.
You or I would be,

2662
02:12:58,551 --> 02:13:00,680
I would assume there is some ancient use
of it,

2663
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:01,760
but um,
you know,

2664
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:05,570
it's mostly like a thing for teenagers 
and people in prison these days.

2665
02:13:05,571 --> 02:13:07,400
It's kind of,
it's illegal high.

2666
02:13:07,401 --> 02:13:09,950
It's one of these things that you do 
when you don't have access to,

2667
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:15,210
to anything else and most of the reports
make it sound more like an 

2668
02:13:15,210 --> 02:13:17,000
anticholinergic delirium type 
experience.

2669
02:13:17,001 --> 02:13:22,001
More like taking a lot of drama mean 
then that like a classical psychedelic 

2670
02:13:22,001 --> 02:13:25,931
experience,
but you can use that oil to make a lot 

2671
02:13:25,931 --> 02:13:26,540
of psychedelics in a laboratory.
Wow.

2672
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:30,060
Now,
history of use as well also,

2673
02:13:30,061 --> 02:13:32,010
so fascinating me when you talk about

2674
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:37,010
history of use because um,
there are certain cultures that really 

2675
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:38,070
don't have a written history.
They have oral history.

2676
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:41,430
So it's very difficult to determine when
people started.

2677
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:43,250
What about

2678
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:46,440
pod?
What is the history of use of peo?

2679
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:51,530
Because I remember reading something 
that kind of stunned me that said that 

2680
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:54,520
there's only like a couple hundred years
have known use of pod.

2681
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:55,190
Yeah.
Well,

2682
02:13:55,191 --> 02:14:00,191
okay.
So there's different histories because 

2683
02:14:00,191 --> 02:14:02,030
pot is used,
it grows naturally over a relatively 

2684
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:06,160
broad region.
Stretching from the southern United 

2685
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,100
States into,
I believe mostly northern Mexico.

2686
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:12,370
And so in the United States,
the history is about 100 years old of 

2687
02:14:15,071 --> 02:14:17,410
the native American church is its 
recent.

2688
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:19,240
Um,
but that's crazy.

2689
02:14:19,241 --> 02:14:21,070
So 19,
18,

2690
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,180
something like that.
Yes.

2691
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:24,320
It was a,
uh,

2692
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:27,520
a comanche chief named Quanah Parker,
um,

2693
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:32,650
who spread the pod religion across the 
United States and it caught on because 

2694
02:14:32,811 --> 02:14:35,780
it's fantastic.
Of course it caught on.

2695
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:37,680
I've never experienced it.
What is it like,

2696
02:14:38,180 --> 02:14:39,350
um,
well again,

2697
02:14:39,351 --> 02:14:42,890
it's another one of these plants that 
has masculine of course,

2698
02:14:42,891 --> 02:14:46,490
but then it has these other accessory 
alkaloids that modulate the experience.

2699
02:14:46,491 --> 02:14:51,491
So what's really interesting about pod 
is it contains this chemical called peo 

2700
02:14:51,491 --> 02:14:53,120
teen and Payoti and I have some,
uh,

2701
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:57,820
pharmacy trade journals from like 1890 
or something like that.

2702
02:14:57,860 --> 02:15:02,860
Know maybe it must be later than that.
It must be maybe like 1915 or something 

2703
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:04,000
like that sometime around there.
And they talk about like,

2704
02:15:04,030 --> 02:15:08,500
your pharmacy must have morphine,
cocaine and peo team,

2705
02:15:08,530 --> 02:15:12,310
the three substances every pharmacist 
needs and uh,

2706
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:14,890
and pot.
And was used as a hypnotic.

2707
02:15:14,891 --> 02:15:19,891
It was used to induce sleep,
but there's been no very little research

2708
02:15:20,421 --> 02:15:22,190
on it.
None of the 21st century.

2709
02:15:22,191 --> 02:15:23,570
I mean,
this is like a,

2710
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:25,640
it was once considered a really valuable
medicine.

2711
02:15:25,641 --> 02:15:28,910
The issues that it's a little bit tricky
to synthesize and it has to be extracted

2712
02:15:28,911 --> 02:15:31,230
from this rare cactus Luftwaffe for a 
diffuser.

2713
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:32,660
But,
um,

2714
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:36,560
but that modulates the experience.
You have so many different alkaloids and

2715
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:38,480
um,
and it,

2716
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:42,030
it's very long lasting.
It causes dramatic pupil dilation.

2717
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:47,060
It's extremely nauseated and bomb.
I made an episode about pod in the most 

2718
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:49,410
recent season of my show,
um,

2719
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:54,070
and I vomited so much that my nose 
started bleeding.

2720
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,090
Um,
you know,

2721
02:15:55,091 --> 02:16:00,091
it was some serious vomiting and it's 
physically very,

2722
02:16:00,221 --> 02:16:05,221
very punishing,
more so than almost anything I've ever 

2723
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:07,651
done.
I would in terms of the aftereffects or 

2724
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:07,651
while you're doing it while you're doing
it,

2725
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:11,010
it's a heavy load on the body.
So it's.

2726
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:14,240
People always say this is not 
recreational or whatever,

2727
02:16:14,241 --> 02:16:15,320
but it's truly as NC,
you know,

2728
02:16:15,321 --> 02:16:16,530
this is really,
um,

2729
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:19,340
a punishing experience.
And on top of that,

2730
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:24,520
the native American ceremonies often 
accentuate some of those punishing 

2731
02:16:24,861 --> 02:16:27,230
aspects of it,
like water is conserved.

2732
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:32,500
You don't get to drink as much water as 
you want to emphasize the importance of 

2733
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:34,780
water in Mazda Tech,
Salvia ceremonies,

2734
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:39,781
there's no water at all,
which I think is actually increases the 

2735
02:16:39,781 --> 02:16:42,781
absorption of the leaf into your mouth 
because the natural reaction when you 

2736
02:16:42,781 --> 02:16:44,620
eat something disgusting is to wash it 
down with water.

2737
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:50,280
These are little things that people do 
impulsively without thinking that are 

2738
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:50,280
going to change the nature of the 
experience.

2739
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:52,480
So anyway,
you eat this cactus,

2740
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:56,740
it's incredibly nauseated and bitter.
And then you have maybe a 12 hour,

2741
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:01,900
um,
hallucinatory euphoric state that's very

2742
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:05,200
beautiful and strange.
But you see the cactus raw.

2743
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:06,670
Yeah.
Some people grind it,

2744
02:17:06,671 --> 02:17:11,671
some people cook it.
So you could get that shit at home 

2745
02:17:11,671 --> 02:17:12,170
depot,
you can get San Pedro at home depot.

2746
02:17:12,590 --> 02:17:14,470
No,
no pod is a dumpling cactus.

2747
02:17:14,471 --> 02:17:16,140
It's a very small,
um,

2748
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:21,210
somewhat spherincel cactus that produces
beautiful white and pink flowers.

2749
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And it's incredibly slow growing,
which is why the conservation of Pod is 

2750
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:30,800
an even bigger issue in the conservation
of toads pod.

2751
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:35,820
All these psychedelic plants have major 
conservation issues that need to be 

2752
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:38,641
addressed,
but pod is arguably the biggest of them 

2753
02:17:38,641 --> 02:17:39,520
all because this is a slow growing 
plant.

2754
02:17:39,521 --> 02:17:42,100
If you want to learn patience,
grow pot,

2755
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:43,840
that is how you learn.
I mean,

2756
02:17:43,841 --> 02:17:45,010
this,
this bottle cap,

2757
02:17:45,011 --> 02:17:47,110
I mean,
it takes five years before it's the size

2758
02:17:47,111 --> 02:17:48,670
of a dime if you grow it from seed.

2759
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:52,810
So when you're eating something that's,
you know,

2760
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:58,050
um,
that's as big as the room of a coffee 

2761
02:17:58,050 --> 02:18:02,020
mug or something like that might be 20,
30 years old Jesus Christ.

2762
02:18:02,021 --> 02:18:04,960
So there's a lot of history in these 
plants.

2763
02:18:04,961 --> 02:18:09,961
They call them grandfather pod.
And I think the reason is that by the 

2764
02:18:09,961 --> 02:18:10,570
time that they're ready to be consumed,
they often,

2765
02:18:10,571 --> 02:18:15,571
our grandfathers or grandmothers,
they have produce seeds and have 

2766
02:18:15,821 --> 02:18:19,240
offspring and all of this stuff because 
it takes that long.

2767
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:22,000
Um,
so yes,

2768
02:18:22,001 --> 02:18:27,001
it's very slow growing.
It's not a sustainable practice the way 

2769
02:18:27,431 --> 02:18:32,431
that it's being done.
But there's also even bigger threats to 

2770
02:18:32,431 --> 02:18:33,880
the environment in the form of root 
plowing,

2771
02:18:33,881 --> 02:18:38,881
all the territory to build walmarts and 
subdivisions and different things in 

2772
02:18:38,881 --> 02:18:41,230
south Texas because most of that land is
privately owned and um,

2773
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:47,190
and it's difficult because there's a 
belief in the native American church 

2774
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:48,760
that has to be an outdoor natural grown.

2775
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:53,760
It can't be a greenhouse cultivated 
plant the because part of the potency 

2776
02:18:53,861 --> 02:18:56,080
and the value is from his interaction 
with nature.

2777
02:18:56,230 --> 02:18:59,020
So it's,
it's if it's sustainably harvested,

2778
02:18:59,021 --> 02:19:01,090
where only the crown of the cactus is 
removed,

2779
02:19:01,091 --> 02:19:04,450
but this long carrot like taproot is 
left in the soil.

2780
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:09,451
It can regenerate new heads.
But if people don't have proper 

2781
02:19:09,451 --> 02:19:12,391
harvesting techniques,
it can decimate the population very 

2782
02:19:12,391 --> 02:19:15,601
quickly,
especially because it's not a very 

2783
02:19:15,601 --> 02:19:16,780
potent substance.
Requires many of these ultra,

2784
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:19,390
ultra,
ultra slow growing plants.

2785
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:24,040
Wow.
So what is the natural territory of it?

2786
02:19:24,041 --> 02:19:26,410
How wide is the natural territory of 
these plants?

2787
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:30,710
I can't tell you exactly,
but it's not very large.

2788
02:19:30,711 --> 02:19:34,670
So if it got very popular,
that'd be a real problem yet it probably

2789
02:19:34,671 --> 02:19:35,540
won't.
I mean,

2790
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:40,541
you know,
the people that care most about it 

2791
02:19:40,541 --> 02:19:43,061
outside of the native American church 
are interestingly cactus files and 

2792
02:19:43,061 --> 02:19:47,111
Thailand and Japan who grow it for 
purely aesthetic purposes because it's 

2793
02:19:47,111 --> 02:19:47,300
so beautiful.

2794
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:52,810
They and they would never even consider 
it because to them it's this prized 

2795
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:55,991
ornamental plant that produces amazing 
fruit and flowers and lives seemingly 

2796
02:19:56,361 --> 02:19:58,040
forever.
And if you take care of it,

2797
02:19:58,041 --> 02:20:00,680
it can just look amazing.
So,

2798
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:01,670
um,
those,

2799
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:07,210
there's a huge pod scene in Thailand of 
people that never would dream of 

2800
02:20:07,461 --> 02:20:09,320
consuming it,
that just grow it ornamental.

2801
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:12,380
Wow.
Now San Pedro Cactus,

2802
02:20:12,381 --> 02:20:14,510
does that have psychoactive properties?
Absolutely,

2803
02:20:14,511 --> 02:20:19,511
yes.
And did you have to extract it in a 

2804
02:20:19,511 --> 02:20:19,511
different way?
I'm like,

2805
02:20:19,511 --> 02:20:20,510
God,
it can be consumed raw.

2806
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,710
Um,
the,

2807
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:26,740
with some varieties of San Pedro,
they actually contain comparable 

2808
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:30,310
quantities of masculine to pod and it's 
a much more sustainable source of 

2809
02:20:30,310 --> 02:20:31,430
masculine for that reason.
And Crows,

2810
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:32,810
unlike pod,
it grows very,

2811
02:20:32,811 --> 02:20:37,811
very quickly and um,
and can be propagated by cutting easily 

2812
02:20:37,811 --> 02:20:38,360
and it,
you know,

2813
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:40,740
it's much easier to work with.
Um,

2814
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:46,060
but traditionally if you go to Peru,
they'll take a length of the cactus and 

2815
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,450
they'll cut it like a loaf of bread into
slices.

2816
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:52,690
Then they boil the slices and create a 
sort of low potency aqueous infusion 

2817
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:59,380
that they drink.
And what's interesting about the way 

2818
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:01,961
they do it is that it seems that it's 
almost designed to create a lower 

2819
02:21:01,961 --> 02:21:02,960
potency drink the way they do it.
They drink every night,

2820
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:05,480
the Shamans,
every night of their entire life.

2821
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:08,420
And many people come back and do it 
repeatedly.

2822
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:13,750
And for them it's sort of,
it's like a traditional form of 

2823
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:15,050
microdosing you could say.
It's not about blasting herself into the

2824
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:16,740
cosmos the way people do when they 
smoke.

2825
02:21:16,741 --> 02:21:21,230
DMT.
This is about fortifying your body,

2826
02:21:21,231 --> 02:21:23,330
giving yourself strength,
cleansing yourself,

2827
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:28,370
balancing yourself and other people that
consume it as well.

2828
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:30,710
Not that I saw there.
No.

2829
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,200
Hmm.
Oh,

2830
02:21:32,201 --> 02:21:34,370
but people do.
What people do I have.

2831
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:38,480
And what is the effect?
Is it comparable to the pod effect?

2832
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:41,450
It's comparable,
but it's,

2833
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:43,490
yeah,
it's comparable,

2834
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:48,580
but again,
it gets very hard because of these 

2835
02:21:48,580 --> 02:21:50,890
variations with natural products in 
terms of the potency of the cactus and 

2836
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:54,821
that point in your life and you know,
people will always come up to me and 

2837
02:21:54,821 --> 02:21:54,821
say,
what's the deal with Mtma?

2838
02:21:54,821 --> 02:21:57,560
It used to be like this and now it's 
like this.

2839
02:21:57,561 --> 02:21:59,180
What accounts for that?
And it's like,

2840
02:21:59,181 --> 02:22:04,181
well,
don't underestimate your own changes 

2841
02:22:04,181 --> 02:22:04,181
over time.
When I was 21,

2842
02:22:04,181 --> 02:22:06,500
I could drink alcohol,
not that I did very often,

2843
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:09,080
but I could and not want to kill myself 
the next day.

2844
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:11,960
Now if I try to drink more than three 
drinks,

2845
02:22:11,961 --> 02:22:16,070
I'm going to feel horrible the next day.
Like just emotionally ruined.

2846
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:17,750
And that's me,
not alcohol.

2847
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:23,380
Now you brought up the term a hypnotic 
and which made me reminded,

2848
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:30,570
reminded me of our conversation that we 
had through email about Roseanne Barr.

2849
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:32,540
Oh yeah.
Oh yes,

2850
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:33,720
of course.
Yes.

2851
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:36,630
And about Ambien and about the effects 
of Ambien.

2852
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:38,790
She came on the show.
She still hasn't.

2853
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:44,390
She can't.
She's having a really hard time with 

2854
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:44,580
this.
Um,

2855
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:50,360
she feels terrible about what she said.
She feels like the whole world hates 

2856
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:54,150
her.
She feels like she's lost everything and

2857
02:22:54,151 --> 02:22:58,150
her life is destroyed and she's 
distraught and she,

2858
02:22:58,310 --> 02:23:02,560
she was going to fly out here,
but we had a conversation and we kind of

2859
02:23:02,561 --> 02:23:05,140
decided to be probably better if she 
waited,

2860
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:07,150
just let,
let some of this

2861
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:12,900
pass by.
It's still in the news because they've 

2862
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:13,410
decided to move the show on without her 
there.

2863
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:15,070
They're going to kill her off or 
something.

2864
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:19,860
Yeah.
And she's just devastated and uh,

2865
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:23,320
you know,
she was also devastated health wise.

2866
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:28,740
Physically she's an older woman and not 
that it'd be any different.

2867
02:23:28,870 --> 02:23:33,870
She was an older man.
She's an older person and this grueling 

2868
02:23:33,870 --> 02:23:35,100
schedule of doing a television show was 
horrible on her.

2869
02:23:35,101 --> 02:23:36,870
It just,
it was really,

2870
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:39,780
really tough to do.
She got bronchitis.

2871
02:23:39,781 --> 02:23:44,781
She felt like she was almost dying.
She was completely exhausted and she 

2872
02:23:44,781 --> 02:23:49,611
felt like the schedule of it all just 
was just way too taxing on her 

2873
02:23:49,611 --> 02:23:51,310
physically.
Then on top of that,

2874
02:23:51,311 --> 02:23:54,670
she's on a host of different things.
She's,

2875
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:59,700
I mean,
she'll ever do wind up sitting down and 

2876
02:23:59,700 --> 02:23:59,700
talking on the podcast.
I'll get her to,

2877
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:03,640
to list the various thing she's on,
but she's on various antidepressants.

2878
02:24:03,810 --> 02:24:05,590
She changes them up,
mixes them mob.

2879
02:24:05,591 --> 02:24:07,000
She was one of the things she said to 
me,

2880
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:09,460
she's,
she needs to get her doses readjusted.

2881
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:13,390
She drinks alcohol regularly,
she smokes marijuana regularly.

2882
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:18,540
She's also an Ambien,
regularly takes it every night to go to 

2883
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:21,391
sleep.
And I tried to explain to her the fact 

2884
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:24,340
that you're not getting real sleep when 
you're on that this is not something you

2885
02:24:24,341 --> 02:24:26,560
should take and rely on on a daily 
basis.

2886
02:24:26,561 --> 02:24:28,990
They even tell you to get off of it.
I mean,

2887
02:24:28,991 --> 02:24:29,510
it's,
it's,

2888
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:32,740
and it's difficult to get off of it.
Um,

2889
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:37,860
but people want to dismiss the idea that
she could have said something that's 

2890
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:44,871
completely out of character or done 
something that's completely out of 

2891
02:24:44,871 --> 02:24:47,571
character while under the influence of 
this stuff that it could have 

2892
02:24:47,571 --> 02:24:50,871
contributed to that.
They want to dismiss it because they 

2893
02:24:50,871 --> 02:24:50,871
want a villain they want,
oh no,

2894
02:24:50,871 --> 02:24:51,960
she's bad.
They want this,

2895
02:24:51,961 --> 02:24:56,961
like this childlike simplistic reasoning
and rationalization.

2896
02:24:58,691 --> 02:24:59,470
For what she's done,

2897
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:01,400
right,
and this is,

2898
02:25:01,401 --> 02:25:06,401
you know,
prime example of this sort of 

2899
02:25:06,401 --> 02:25:08,520
schizophrenia nature of the way drugs 
are depicted in our society.

2900
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:13,760
If it's,
if it's something like bath salts or k 

2901
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,680
two,
they're responsible for everything.

2902
02:25:16,681 --> 02:25:21,570
One toke of that stuff and you're eating
your best friend's face under a bridge,

2903
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:26,590
but then in case they have no 
explanation whatsoever,

2904
02:25:26,591 --> 02:25:30,540
no exculpatory value,
they can't be used to explain anything.

2905
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,810
Is it an excuse?
No.

2906
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:34,270
Is it an explanation?
I think yes.

2907
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:39,960
I think that intoxication can explain 
all sorts of inappropriate behavior and 

2908
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:42,400
to pretend otherwise is.
Again,

2909
02:25:42,401 --> 02:25:47,401
dishonest.
I know am Sanofi the pharmaceutical 

2910
02:25:47,401 --> 02:25:50,581
company that manufactures ambien had 
this widely shared tweet saying that 

2911
02:25:50,581 --> 02:25:54,781
racism isn't a side effect of Ambien,
but it's a little bit ridiculous for 

2912
02:25:54,781 --> 02:25:56,460
them to have done that.
You know,

2913
02:25:56,461 --> 02:25:59,260
especially to someone who's mentally ill
because,

2914
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:01,180
you know,
if you look at the medical literature,

2915
02:26:01,181 --> 02:26:06,181
the fact of the matter is that ambient 
is associated with all sorts of absurd 

2916
02:26:06,181 --> 02:26:06,430
behaviors.

2917
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:10,000
Command hallucinations where people stab
themselves,

2918
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:12,490
jump out windows,
people that you know,

2919
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:17,550
butter their cigarettes and smoke them.
People that paint their houses in the 

2920
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,150
middle of the night with no memory 
whatsoever,

2921
02:26:19,151 --> 02:26:22,420
and it's a profoundly,
profoundly disinhibiting drug.

2922
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:23,680
So,
you know,

2923
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:29,010
here,
here's maybe a somewhat analogous 

2924
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:30,841
example from my own life.
I never take ambien on planes for this 

2925
02:26:30,841 --> 02:26:33,541
reason because I'm around strangers.
I don't know what I'm going to say or 

2926
02:26:33,541 --> 02:26:34,450
what I'm going to do,
let alone use twitter,

2927
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:39,630
but I don't.
It's uncomfortable because it's so 

2928
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:39,630
disinhibiting.
I might do something weird.

2929
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:40,000
I don't know.
Take off my shirt.

2930
02:26:40,001 --> 02:26:45,001
I have no idea.
You who's to predict what you're going 

2931
02:26:45,001 --> 02:26:45,010
to do when you have no inhibitions 
whatsoever.

2932
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:49,620
So I remember once I was on the plane to
Berlin and I did take ambien and I start

2933
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:54,670
in this sort of delusional state 
thinking that the cabin crew and the 

2934
02:26:54,910 --> 02:26:59,470
person that's announcing over the 
entercom is saying various Nazi things.

2935
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:04,570
That's like an unfair stereotype that 
all Germans are Nazis that's offensive,

2936
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:09,750
but I had no control over this.
Just because they're German talking in 

2937
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:14,041
German doesn't mean that this is like a 
Nazi airship because you're just 

2938
02:27:14,041 --> 02:27:15,820
completely out of your mind.
Wow.

2939
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:17,120
But again,
I mean,

2940
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:19,120
like another story,
um,

2941
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:22,510
I used to be friends with a girl whose 
dad was a psychiatrist,

2942
02:27:22,511 --> 02:27:25,620
prescribes her immense quantities of 
Ambien and um,

2943
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,870
she would snort it.
There's no reason to start it.

2944
02:27:27,871 --> 02:27:30,160
It's water soluble.
It has a fast onset of action.

2945
02:27:30,161 --> 02:27:32,740
There's no benefit and snorting it,
it's fine orally if you're going to take

2946
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:37,741
it at all.
And there's no reason to take high 

2947
02:27:37,741 --> 02:27:38,911
doses.
It's already a delirium at the 

2948
02:27:38,911 --> 02:27:38,911
therapeutic dose.
You don't need to take more,

2949
02:27:38,911 --> 02:27:40,570
even five milligrams induces delirium.
But,

2950
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:45,840
um,
but I remember I was at some party and 

2951
02:27:46,631 --> 02:27:49,610
someone was saying that they wanted 
ketamine,

2952
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:53,260
did anyone at the party of ketamine and 
just a complete stranger.

2953
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:54,070
And I said,
Oh,

2954
02:27:54,071 --> 02:27:56,530
I actually have a little bit of ketamine
but it's at my apartment,

2955
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:00,630
here are the keys and here's my address 
and just run over to my apartment and,

2956
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:03,550
and help yourself talk to you later.
And uh,

2957
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,500
and then,
um,

2958
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:06,880
I,
I'm one of these people,

2959
02:28:06,881 --> 02:28:09,040
I've never lost my phone,
never lost my keys.

2960
02:28:09,041 --> 02:28:10,630
I don't lose things.
So then I,

2961
02:28:10,631 --> 02:28:11,980
you know,
wake up the next morning,

2962
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:13,510
go to my apartment,
reached into my pocket,

2963
02:28:13,511 --> 02:28:16,450
my keys are gone,
and then it hits me this flash of,

2964
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:21,630
oh my God,
I gave my keys away to a complete 

2965
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:23,150
stranger to go to my apartment and take 
ketamine from me.

2966
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:27,320
What on earth was I thinking?
What?

2967
02:28:27,330 --> 02:28:31,540
Like what level of disinhibition is 
required to do something that insane.

2968
02:28:31,810 --> 02:28:36,810
Luckily I was there.
I had to spend the rest of the day 

2969
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:38,521
tracing,
finding out who that person was getting 

2970
02:28:38,521 --> 02:28:40,471
my keys and these people happen to be 
very courteous people and actually did 

2971
02:28:40,471 --> 02:28:44,031
go to my apartment,
did take the small amount of ketamine 

2972
02:28:44,031 --> 02:28:46,260
that I had and then just lock the door 
after themselves and didn't make a mess.

2973
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:49,140
But again,
I mean this is like,

2974
02:28:49,650 --> 02:28:53,130
this is a profoundly disinhibiting 
substance.

2975
02:28:53,131 --> 02:28:58,131
And also I think the idea that a drug 
couldn't modulate racist activities.

2976
02:28:58,430 --> 02:29:03,430
Interesting as well because there's a 
study that you can look up where they 

2977
02:29:03,430 --> 02:29:06,641
use the Beta blocker,
propranolol and they found that it 

2978
02:29:06,641 --> 02:29:10,151
actually seems to block racial implicit 
racial bias in people in certain tests 

2979
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:14,630
that what they're suggesting is that 
there's an address,

2980
02:29:14,631 --> 02:29:18,410
energetic component to implicit racial 
bias,

2981
02:29:18,411 --> 02:29:23,411
but there's a certain maybe heart rate 
or fear response and once the 

2982
02:29:23,411 --> 02:29:27,280
physiologically blocked you become less 
racist in a sense implicitly.

2983
02:29:28,030 --> 02:29:31,120
It's not a conscious decision.
Conscious racism isn't reduced,

2984
02:29:31,121 --> 02:29:35,770
but an implicit racial bias is.
I mean these are like really complicated

2985
02:29:35,950 --> 02:29:40,950
higher level questions about how drugs 
impact cognitive functioning and um,

2986
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:47,500
and the bottom line I think is be 
careful being certain about anything 

2987
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,980
about what drugs can or can't do.

2988
02:29:50,170 --> 02:29:51,790
What does this Jamie.
Oh,

2989
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:56,050
this is the story.
Blood pressure drug reduces inbuilt.

2990
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:58,780
What does that word in built?
Racism.

2991
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:04,020
Common heart disease drug may have an 
unusual side effect of combating racism.

2992
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:09,560
Wasn't that a fucking.
There was that stupid movie with Jack 

2993
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,670
Nicholson and Helen Hunt is good as it 
gets.

2994
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:15,360
He was a racist and they gave him a 
pill.

2995
02:30:15,570 --> 02:30:18,180
They gave him some medication and it 
reduced racism.

2996
02:30:18,181 --> 02:30:20,400
It stopped him from being racist.
Whoa.

2997
02:30:20,401 --> 02:30:25,401
I completely forgot about.
I remember it because I was angry 

2998
02:30:25,401 --> 02:30:28,520
because a bunch of people from the the.
I was working on television show at the 

2999
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,220
time.
A bunch of people were talking about how

3000
02:30:29,221 --> 02:30:34,221
great a movie it was because it was this
weird dark sort of film and I was like,

3001
02:30:34,651 --> 02:30:36,990
that movie fucking sucked.
It was so depressing.

3002
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:38,250
Here.
This woman,

3003
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:43,460
she's got a.
she's a waitress and Jack Nicholson is 

3004
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:47,691
this old racist asshole and she's 
relying on him for some real reason 

3005
02:30:47,691 --> 02:30:51,030
because you can't find anyone who's nice
to her and and he's racist,

3006
02:30:51,031 --> 02:30:51,650
but the,
the,

3007
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:57,210
the resolve of the film was that he just
was sick and they gave him some 

3008
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:57,660
medication.
He wasn't racing anymore.

3009
02:30:57,661 --> 02:30:58,830
I'm like,
get the fuck out of here.

3010
02:30:58,831 --> 02:31:01,110
That doesn't make any sense.
Meanwhile,

3011
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:01,690
maybe it does.

3012
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:04,550
I mean,
ambient is an amazing,

3013
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:09,610
amazing substance.
I made a piece about it called the 

3014
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:09,610
ambient effect years ago.
I don't know if you're familiar.

3015
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:12,770
They're people who are paralyzed who can
take ambien and start walking again.

3016
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:17,771
It has the power to regenerate regions 
of the to regenerate activity in regions

3017
02:31:17,871 --> 02:31:19,970
of the brain that looked dead on Fmr.
Try

3018
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:25,200
it is a wacky drug.
It's also chemically very similar to 

3019
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,010
five methyl dmt.
It's,

3020
02:31:26,030 --> 02:31:31,030
it's not,
it's not like a benzodiazepine like 

3021
02:31:31,030 --> 02:31:31,170
valium.
It has its own bizarre structure.

3022
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:32,790
I mean,
it's a weird drug.

3023
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:37,230
So when these people are paralyzed by 
the paralyzed,

3024
02:31:37,231 --> 02:31:39,030
like what?
What is wrong with the strokes?

3025
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:41,250
Traumatic brain injury,
various reasons.

3026
02:31:41,251 --> 02:31:44,490
There's a book about it called hope and 
brain damage.

3027
02:31:44,491 --> 02:31:49,491
I believe the title of it is an Ambien 
somehow or another temporarily fixes it.

3028
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:52,650
Yes.
Temper only for the duration of the drug

3029
02:31:52,651 --> 02:31:56,220
effects.
So those people that are in a persistent

3030
02:31:56,221 --> 02:32:01,221
vegetative state,
they take ambien and suddenly they wake 

3031
02:32:01,221 --> 02:32:01,230
up.
What the fuck?

3032
02:32:01,231 --> 02:32:02,070
Yes.
Yeah.

3033
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:07,100
It's pretty.
It's well documented and it's a really 

3034
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:10,520
bizarre effect that is exclusively 
present in ambient and maybe slightly 

3035
02:32:10,671 --> 02:32:12,510
and um,
Baclifin as well.

3036
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:17,530
Yeah.
I thought that the statement that the 

3037
02:32:17,530 --> 02:32:20,031
pharmaceutical company made about a 
racism not being a side effect was kind 

3038
02:32:20,571 --> 02:32:21,090
of cute.

3039
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:24,090
It's kind of witty.
It was a very snarky.

3040
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:26,730
Yes.
But the problem with that shit is,

3041
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:28,860
well,
what are the side effects?

3042
02:32:28,861 --> 02:32:30,750
And then you go into the actual side 
effects and like,

3043
02:32:30,751 --> 02:32:33,120
Holy Shit,
how is this legal?

3044
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:34,560
And then you go into the side effects of
like,

3045
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:38,040
what is this doing to people like,
well here's another one.

3046
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:41,670
It supposedly increases consolidation of
negative memories.

3047
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:43,280
Whoa.
Yeah.

3048
02:32:43,350 --> 02:32:46,440
There's a lot of weird stuff.
Negative memory increases.

3049
02:32:46,441 --> 02:32:51,441
Consolidation of negative memories 
causes a just total hallucinatory 

3050
02:32:51,441 --> 02:32:55,490
insanity at higher doses.
Maybe the most powerful disinhibiting 

3051
02:32:55,490 --> 02:32:59,391
agent I'm aware of and is able to 
restore cognitive and motor functioning 

3052
02:33:00,541 --> 02:33:02,160
and people with traumatic brain 
injuries.

3053
02:33:02,161 --> 02:33:05,280
What a weird drug.
Very weird.

3054
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:10,050
And not not something people should be 
taking every day.

3055
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:12,570
Just not.
It's certainly addictive.

3056
02:33:12,571 --> 02:33:17,571
I mean it binds to,
even though it's not a benzodiazepine 

3057
02:33:17,571 --> 02:33:19,791
itself,
it binds to the benzodiazepine site on 

3058
02:33:19,791 --> 02:33:19,791
the Gaba a receptor.
But yes,

3059
02:33:19,791 --> 02:33:20,580
no,
it's addictive.

3060
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,100
It's super addictive.
So for that reason alone,

3061
02:33:23,101 --> 02:33:28,101
people shouldn't be taking it every day 
because you'll become horrendously 

3062
02:33:28,101 --> 02:33:29,460
dependent on it.
And withdrawal is ruthless.

3063
02:33:29,590 --> 02:33:32,730
The etsy,
the withdrawal is total insomnia.

3064
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:39,390
So most people just go right back to it 
or you know,

3065
02:33:39,391 --> 02:33:44,391
you can then track,
like you can transition onto different 

3066
02:33:44,391 --> 02:33:44,391
types of hypnotics,
like taking an anticholinergic,

3067
02:33:44,391 --> 02:33:48,270
like Benadryl to sleep or cannabinoids 
cannabis,

3068
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:50,120
things like that,
or um,

3069
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,960
you know,
just things that don't buy into the Gaba

3070
02:33:51,961 --> 02:33:54,600
a receptor in order to try to reduce 
tolerance.

3071
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:59,660
There's ways around it.
You're not doomed if you start taking 

3072
02:33:59,660 --> 02:33:59,660
it,
but it's,

3073
02:33:59,660 --> 02:33:59,910
it's certainly,
um,

3074
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:05,090
habit forming and something that's best 
to avoid if you don't require it and it 

3075
02:34:05,090 --> 02:34:06,270
doesn't give you real sleep.
Correct.

3076
02:34:06,271 --> 02:34:06,950
I mean,
you're,

3077
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:10,890
you're missing some part of the sleep 
cycle with Dr Matthew Walker was on,

3078
02:34:10,891 --> 02:34:13,980
here's a sleep specialist and he went 
into depth about it,

3079
02:34:13,981 --> 02:34:17,010
but I really don't remember his exact 
description,

3080
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:21,040
but he was talking about how it bypasses
certain cycles and you're,

3081
02:34:21,041 --> 02:34:23,290
you're not getting a real night's sleep.

3082
02:34:23,930 --> 02:34:26,100
I am not aware of that.
I mean,

3083
02:34:26,230 --> 02:34:28,960
there's,
wouldn't surprise me hugely.

3084
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:31,420
You know,
there's still debate about what the most

3085
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:34,030
restful part of sleep is.
Um,

3086
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:38,740
I think most literature points to 
actually non rem sleep,

3087
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:42,010
slow wave sleep being the most restful 
type.

3088
02:34:42,011 --> 02:34:47,011
And that's actually supported or 
promoted by chemicals like Musk Amal 

3089
02:34:47,011 --> 02:34:48,850
from the m and e to miscarry a mushroom 
that,

3090
02:34:48,910 --> 02:34:53,910
that in,
and there was one pharmaceutical 

3091
02:34:53,910 --> 02:34:56,281
derivative called gearbox at all that I 
did an episode about on the most recent 

3092
02:34:56,281 --> 02:35:00,750
season of my show.
And that really does produce incredibly 

3093
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:01,110
restful sleep that is superior to 
ambient.

3094
02:35:01,111 --> 02:35:03,040
But like ambient,
it was also psychedelic,

3095
02:35:03,041 --> 02:35:06,790
even more psychedelic probably.
So this is an issue.

3096
02:35:06,791 --> 02:35:09,820
It seems it for whatever reason,
a lot of these drugs that really promote

3097
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:15,450
sleep effectively also happened to be 
hallucinogenic and nobody knows exactly 

3098
02:35:15,491 --> 02:35:20,491
why,
but it's been a pharmaceutical barrier 

3099
02:35:20,491 --> 02:35:23,890
because we don't live in a culture that 
allows people to go nuts at night.

3100
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:26,830
Yeah,
no kidding.

3101
02:35:27,610 --> 02:35:31,780
I'm glad you brought up the mud to 
miscarrying because that's another one.

3102
02:35:31,870 --> 02:35:33,490
Um,
that is,

3103
02:35:33,491 --> 02:35:38,491
uh,
almost like a drug of lore more than a 

3104
02:35:39,730 --> 02:35:44,730
drug of application.
You don't really hear too much about 

3105
02:35:44,730 --> 02:35:46,300
people getting real good experiences.
No you don't.

3106
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:51,430
But it's also connected to a sacred 
mushroom and the cross,

3107
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:56,431
the cover of it from John,
mark or allegro has an emmy nominated 

3108
02:35:56,431 --> 02:35:59,311
Mascara.
He thought that the emanated Ms Dot 

3109
02:35:59,311 --> 02:36:02,400
Garcia was probably linked to 
psychedelic states and pre historic 

3110
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:03,810
Christianity.
We,

3111
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:05,020
we don't know.
Right.

3112
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:07,630
Oh,
he's such a salacious wacky guy.

3113
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:09,910
Mazy oh yeah,
absolutely.

3114
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:10,840
I mean,
he,

3115
02:36:10,841 --> 02:36:13,210
he was getting off on it.
He loved it.

3116
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:16,090
He will love getting off on freaking 
people out.

3117
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:17,500
Freaking out.
Christian.

3118
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:22,830
That was a.
You can't underestimate what he was 

3119
02:36:22,830 --> 02:36:25,141
saying.
He was saying all of Christianity is a 

3120
02:36:25,141 --> 02:36:27,841
sex cult that worships a fungal Phallus 
and the semen of that Phallus or the 

3121
02:36:28,361 --> 02:36:29,200
spores.

3122
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:34,320
Yeah.
Then all of Christianity is an ancient 

3123
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:35,980
fertility called.
That's a big claim from a serious Oxford

3124
02:36:35,981 --> 02:36:40,450
educated Dead Sea scrolls scholar who is
respected up until that point.

3125
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:42,820
Yeah.
Who was also an ordained minister.

3126
02:36:43,240 --> 02:36:48,240
Yeah.
I mean there's a great book called 

3127
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:50,791
shroom that argues that this was all,
some kind of cynical attack on the 

3128
02:36:50,791 --> 02:36:50,791
Christian religion and that,
uh,

3129
02:36:50,791 --> 02:36:52,750
he didn't even believe it himself.
I'm.

3130
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:58,140
The issue is that in order to carefully 
examine his claims,

3131
02:36:58,181 --> 02:37:00,700
you need to speak what is it?
Ancient Aramaic or something.

3132
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:02,290
So it's like,
it doesn't,

3133
02:37:02,530 --> 02:37:07,530
I'm not in a position reading his book,
which is all having to do with the 

3134
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:10,660
etymology of these words,
their origins in different languages.

3135
02:37:10,661 --> 02:37:14,650
I just don't know enough about these 
ancient languages to make a,

3136
02:37:14,750 --> 02:37:16,370
an informed assessment

3137
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:18,540
of his claims.
But uh,

3138
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:23,620
which is I think one reason that they've
kind of hung around in this lower for 

3139
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:25,490
such a long time because it's hard for 
people to say with certainty,

3140
02:37:25,810 --> 02:37:27,440
um,
if they're true or not.

3141
02:37:27,441 --> 02:37:32,090
Although I leaned to them for them 
probably not being well supported.

3142
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:39,160
They pause.
Why is that?

3143
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:41,180
Um,
just seems to be wacky.

3144
02:37:41,210 --> 02:37:41,930
Yeah.
Because they're not.

3145
02:37:41,931 --> 02:37:46,931
I haven't seen them integrated into any 
serious work since I'm not that that's 

3146
02:37:47,721 --> 02:37:49,280
necessarily a good argument.
Yes.

3147
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:54,360
To take on a lot of education to be able
to even understand whether or not that 

3148
02:37:56,030 --> 02:37:57,020
debate is

3149
02:37:57,600 --> 02:37:58,800
cogent.
Right,

3150
02:37:59,550 --> 02:38:00,690
right.
It's the same deal.

3151
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:05,780
I encountered this sometimes on really 
fringe aspects of physics and chemistry 

3152
02:38:05,780 --> 02:38:09,531
where someone will make some kind of 
wacky argument about the way atoms bond 

3153
02:38:09,531 --> 02:38:10,140
or something like that.
And it's like,

3154
02:38:10,650 --> 02:38:15,650
it gets hard because you only have like 
a small handful of people that are 

3155
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:16,530
capable of seriously evaluating the 
claims,

3156
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:21,240
able to weigh in and then it doesn't 
really get vetted in a serious way.

3157
02:38:21,241 --> 02:38:23,250
So things just linger around is,
maybe it's true,

3158
02:38:23,251 --> 02:38:25,290
maybe it's not,
but um,

3159
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,500
but the bottom line is that most people 
don't get it a valuable experience from 

3160
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,230
these mushrooms,
but some do,

3161
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:34,140
some people have figured out how to make
it work and the experiences,

3162
02:38:34,141 --> 02:38:34,680
again,
it's,

3163
02:38:34,681 --> 02:38:35,760
you know,
it's its own thing.

3164
02:38:35,761 --> 02:38:40,761
It's a gabaergic delirium to takes you 
into a dreamy drunk zone.

3165
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:43,070
Yeah.
And it's,

3166
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:46,110
it's in many ways a toxin,
right?

3167
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,580
It's toxic in some forums.

3168
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:50,050
Well,
it contains a,

3169
02:38:50,051 --> 02:38:55,040
another chemical in botanic acid that is
potentially very toxic,

3170
02:38:55,041 --> 02:38:56,920
although it hasn't really been examined.
In fact,

3171
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:01,960
it also contains a complex of this 
element vanadium that could potentially 

3172
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:05,501
be toxic as well.
So there are some legitimate toxicity 

3173
02:39:05,501 --> 02:39:06,950
concerns that I think anyone who's 
consuming it should be aware of.

3174
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:08,690
Um,
you know,

3175
02:39:08,691 --> 02:39:11,150
the ideal situation would be isolated 
Moscow mall,

3176
02:39:11,151 --> 02:39:13,280
but it's hard to extract.
Hm.

3177
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:18,540
And but yet it's connected in so much 
artwork and so,

3178
02:39:18,541 --> 02:39:23,541
so much ancient depictions of 
particularly of Christmas cards.

3179
02:39:23,641 --> 02:39:27,180
There's always elves and these little 
laminated miscarried caps.

3180
02:39:27,330 --> 02:39:27,900
Right.
Well,

3181
02:39:27,901 --> 02:39:32,901
drugs aside,
you have to acknowledge that it's a 

3182
02:39:32,901 --> 02:39:33,140
spectacularly beautiful mushrooms if 
you.

3183
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:38,390
I've gotten mushroom hunting all over 
the world and there is no question that 

3184
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:41,850
when you see that mushroom in habitat 
that it's

3185
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:44,760
completely spectacular.
There's nothing else like it.

3186
02:39:44,761 --> 02:39:46,990
It is magical experience.
Just looking at it.

3187
02:39:47,050 --> 02:39:50,200
Yeah.
I ran across it only once in Colorado in

3188
02:39:50,201 --> 02:39:52,440
the woods and it was amazing.
It's like this big.

3189
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:54,370
It was a big one too,
is this big,

3190
02:39:54,371 --> 02:39:59,371
beautiful red with white dots on it.
It's like one of the most gorgeous 

3191
02:39:59,371 --> 02:39:59,620
things you could ever see growing.

3192
02:39:59,810 --> 02:39:59,880
Yeah,

3193
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,190
yeah.
Yeah.

3194
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:04,400
And it's legal.
It's legal to possess again.

3195
02:40:04,401 --> 02:40:09,401
Yes.
It's legal because it's not really do 

3196
02:40:09,401 --> 02:40:11,760
anything enjoyable for most people,
but is it possible that we just are 

3197
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:14,640
doing it wrong and that the,
the information

3198
02:40:14,670 --> 02:40:19,670
has been lost as to how to.
Because a lot of people felt like it 

3199
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:23,331
might've been a part of Soma,
which hasn't really been defined as to 

3200
02:40:23,331 --> 02:40:23,331
what Soma is,

3201
02:40:23,331 --> 02:40:25,800
right?
We had those debates are not really my,

3202
02:40:25,801 --> 02:40:27,180
uh,
my cup of tea,

3203
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,990
right.
It's like just tons of guys pushing this

3204
02:40:30,991 --> 02:40:34,350
or that argument without like a lot of 
evidence one way or the other.

3205
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:39,560
And so I don't know.
And then there's people that argue that 

3206
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:42,261
urine drinking is somehow required to 
concentrate the muskeg mall in one way 

3207
02:40:44,011 --> 02:40:45,210
or another.
Um,

3208
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:46,920
you know,
if you want to learn about it,

3209
02:40:46,921 --> 02:40:51,921
I think the best way to do it is 
actually through this other related 

3210
02:40:51,921 --> 02:40:51,921
drug.
Got Box at all,

3211
02:40:51,921 --> 02:40:51,960
which was,
um,

3212
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:57,180
almost developed by merck as a 
competitor for Ambien.

3213
02:40:57,390 --> 02:41:02,390
And there's some high dose reports of 
gearbox and all that gives you a much 

3214
02:41:02,390 --> 02:41:03,210
clearer example.
And from my own experience as well,

3215
02:41:03,211 --> 02:41:07,230
of what the potential of that class is.
And it's very different.

3216
02:41:07,350 --> 02:41:10,470
It's every bit as powerful as Iowasca or
something like that.

3217
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:15,240
But completely different.
And it's hard to articulate.

3218
02:41:15,241 --> 02:41:20,241
All these things are hard to articulate,
but it's something that's been 

3219
02:41:20,241 --> 02:41:22,221
experienced by relatively few people so 
that you don't even have this a 

3220
02:41:22,221 --> 02:41:23,640
spiritual or metaphorical vocabulary for
it.

3221
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:28,670
The way that I hadn't most powerfully 
was once I was doing a shoot for vice on

3222
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:33,831
Hbo and they told me I had to go to 
Tokyo with less than 24 hours notice and

3223
02:41:34,381 --> 02:41:37,200
that I had to start filming as soon as 
the plane landed,

3224
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:38,970
couldn't go to the hotel room.
So I thought,

3225
02:41:38,971 --> 02:41:40,230
all right,
this is serious.

3226
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:42,510
No messing around.
No time for jet lag.

3227
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:46,190
Like I've got to fall asleep at 10:00
PM that night.

3228
02:41:46,191 --> 02:41:47,810
Wake up at 8:00
AM that morning.

3229
02:41:47,811 --> 02:41:52,811
I've got to be awake all day,
so I'm in a pharmacologically forced 

3230
02:41:52,811 --> 02:41:55,991
this a little bit.
I'm going to take a really high dose of 

3231
02:41:55,991 --> 02:41:58,181
this mosquito old derivative at night to
induce sleep and I'll take adderall 

3232
02:41:58,181 --> 02:41:58,181
during the day.

3233
02:41:58,181 --> 02:42:00,050
That was the plan,
so I took a high dose,

3234
02:42:00,051 --> 02:42:03,650
I believe it was 45 milligrams,
but don't quote me on that.

3235
02:42:03,651 --> 02:42:08,651
Of this musket mule derivative.
It's about the same potency and I'm at 

3236
02:42:08,651 --> 02:42:10,490
the equivalent of what would have been 
maybe 2:00

3237
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:15,490
PM New York time,
which I think was crucial because these 

3238
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:15,490
things are hypnotic.
They induce sleep.

3239
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:19,961
So if you take it during the day,
you're less likely to sleep through the 

3240
02:42:19,961 --> 02:42:22,160
whole experience.
And it was unbelievable.

3241
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:22,910
I mean,
I,

3242
02:42:22,911 --> 02:42:23,550
I,
uh,

3243
02:42:24,050 --> 02:42:28,470
I couldn't fathom the intensity of what 
I experienced.

3244
02:42:28,471 --> 02:42:29,220
It was,
you know,

3245
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:34,490
just this rushing sense of,
of becoming a passive observer in my own

3246
02:42:36,541 --> 02:42:41,541
consciousness and seeing all of my 
thoughts produced by someone else that 

3247
02:42:43,571 --> 02:42:48,571
we're racing at a speed that was so fast
that I found it physically dizzying and 

3248
02:42:48,701 --> 02:42:53,701
had to lay down.
And I felt as if like the acceleration 

3249
02:42:53,701 --> 02:42:57,781
was pushing me toward an ultimate state 
that was sleep and that sleep in death 

3250
02:42:57,781 --> 02:42:59,650
represented the ultimate state of 
consciousness.

3251
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:02,200
Whoa.
So it was,

3252
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:03,070
it was,
and then,

3253
02:43:03,071 --> 02:43:08,071
you know,
then I had to wake up at eight and work 

3254
02:43:08,071 --> 02:43:08,071
the next day and people say,
how'd you sleep?

3255
02:43:08,071 --> 02:43:08,071
And it's like,
well,

3256
02:43:08,071 --> 02:43:08,071
I actually had this,
uh,

3257
02:43:08,410 --> 02:43:13,220
a transformative existential trip 
accidentally.

3258
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:19,550
But you tried it since?
Just purposely for,

3259
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:21,110
I mean a couple of times.
Yeah.

3260
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:23,120
Did you ever recreate that kind of 
experience?

3261
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:24,530
No,
because it was,

3262
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:29,560
it was a bit much I would say,
and I know people that have taken even 

3263
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:30,800
more and it turns into just your entire 
visual field,

3264
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:35,860
a transforming into rotating cubes where
each face of the cube represents a 

3265
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:37,610
different aspect of your life,
your future,

3266
02:43:37,611 --> 02:43:38,900
your past,
your present,

3267
02:43:39,140 --> 02:43:41,990
you know,
really dramatic stuff.

3268
02:43:41,991 --> 02:43:45,290
So I think that potential exists with 
high dose Moscow mule.

3269
02:43:45,291 --> 02:43:49,910
It's hard for people to ingest it 
because of all the other material in the

3270
02:43:49,911 --> 02:43:52,880
mushroom and the disgustingness of 
consuming it.

3271
02:43:53,130 --> 02:43:58,130
So is it possible that we've just much 
like people have sort of a altered many 

3272
02:44:00,971 --> 02:44:05,971
different things like we and tomatoes 
and what have you that at one point in 

3273
02:44:06,021 --> 02:44:08,060
time the mushrooms somehow different?

3274
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:10,510
Oh yeah.
Well yes,

3275
02:44:10,511 --> 02:44:11,740
absolutely.
Yeah.

3276
02:44:11,741 --> 02:44:14,920
I mean the,
the evolutionary chemical history of all

3277
02:44:14,921 --> 02:44:19,921
these different plants is a fascinating 
subject that's pretty much lost to 

3278
02:44:19,921 --> 02:44:19,921
history.
You know,

3279
02:44:19,921 --> 02:44:24,210
there's no like,
archeological alkaloid analysis that I'm

3280
02:44:24,211 --> 02:44:29,211
aware of,
but it would be so fascinating to know 

3281
02:44:29,211 --> 02:44:29,460
because all of these natural products 
evolve,

3282
02:44:29,461 --> 02:44:33,600
just like the plants that contain them.
What were the intermediate materials?

3283
02:44:33,601 --> 02:44:38,601
What drugs have gone extinct have,
did our ancestors drive certain 

3284
02:44:38,601 --> 02:44:43,581
psychoactive plants to extinction?
There's a plant called psyllium that 

3285
02:44:43,581 --> 02:44:44,100
some people have argued that may have 
happened with those,

3286
02:44:44,101 --> 02:44:45,910
a fennel derivative,
um,

3287
02:44:46,350 --> 02:44:49,320
or like a fennel related plant.
But,

3288
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:50,400
um,
yeah,

3289
02:44:50,401 --> 02:44:51,600
I mean it's,
it's really,

3290
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:53,520
and it,
we've seen it with cannabis,

3291
02:44:53,521 --> 02:44:58,521
you know,
the black market encouraged everyone to 

3292
02:44:58,521 --> 02:45:00,880
produce thc dominant strains because it 
was the most potent,

3293
02:45:00,881 --> 02:45:02,680
most stoning,
most bang for your buck.

3294
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:07,830
Now,
now we have the ability to change the 

3295
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:10,441
evolutionary direction of the plant and 
to encourage the production of CBN or 

3296
02:45:10,441 --> 02:45:14,911
CBG or Hcv or cbd or whatever.
Hm.

3297
02:45:15,730 --> 02:45:16,540
So

3298
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:22,420
when you talk about a plant like the pod
cactus that grows so incredibly slow and

3299
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:26,310
you know,
if,

3300
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:30,590
if that became something that was highly
sought after,

3301
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:32,510
very,
very valuable,

3302
02:45:32,810 --> 02:45:35,210
it could conceivably be wiped out.
Yes.

3303
02:45:35,270 --> 02:45:36,290
Yeah.
Especially something really.

3304
02:45:36,291 --> 02:45:40,300
So I'm so there could have been 
substances like that,

3305
02:45:40,301 --> 02:45:45,200
that we're very geographically local,
that very small area that are just gone.

3306
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:47,380
Yeah.
It's just a thought.

3307
02:45:47,381 --> 02:45:52,381
I just had totally done evidence based,
but wouldn't it be crazy if a lot of the

3308
02:45:53,621 --> 02:45:55,160
reason that a lot of these,
um,

3309
02:45:56,390 --> 02:46:01,390
psychoactive plants that are present 
today tend to be less addictive is 

3310
02:46:01,390 --> 02:46:04,841
because all the addictive ones were 
harvested to extinction thousands of 

3311
02:46:04,841 --> 02:46:06,050
years ago.
Maybe something like that.

3312
02:46:06,051 --> 02:46:11,051
I mean,
these things do happen if you didn't 

3313
02:46:11,051 --> 02:46:13,471
have know.
We really wouldn't have any way of 

3314
02:46:13,471 --> 02:46:13,471
knowing,
but if there fossilized plants,

3315
02:46:13,471 --> 02:46:13,790
right,
right.

3316
02:46:13,791 --> 02:46:17,040
It certainly didn't happen with coca,
which contains cocaine or cat.

3317
02:46:17,060 --> 02:46:19,330
So it probably didn't happen that way,
but you know,

3318
02:46:19,331 --> 02:46:21,100
you just don't know.
Yeah.

3319
02:46:21,101 --> 02:46:24,010
And I had read some theories that it's

3320
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:28,910
conceivable that the emoney to miscarry 
a very seasonably uh,

3321
02:46:28,911 --> 02:46:32,330
so you have to figure out like when is 
the right time to harvest?

3322
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:35,420
Because there are some plans.
Although of course fungus isn't really a

3323
02:46:35,421 --> 02:46:37,490
plant,
it's kind of the opposite of a plan that

3324
02:46:37,491 --> 02:46:38,690
way.
And ingest oxygen,

3325
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:41,630
it takes in carbon,
it takes an oxygen.

3326
02:46:41,631 --> 02:46:44,510
And breathe out carbon dioxide like a,
like an animal does,

3327
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:49,700
but that it's possible that these things
vary seasonably,

3328
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:54,730
that you have to catch them within a 
window of time and that they also vary 

3329
02:46:54,890 --> 02:46:59,890
geographically.
Like some places they might be more 

3330
02:46:59,890 --> 02:46:59,890
potent,
like,

3331
02:46:59,890 --> 02:47:00,410
you know,
Cuban cigars,

3332
02:47:00,411 --> 02:47:02,690
grown on specific land,
have a distinct,

3333
02:47:02,710 --> 02:47:05,590
probably more a more potent taste to 
them.

3334
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:07,120
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

3335
02:47:07,121 --> 02:47:12,121
Because the biosynthetic precursors for 
all of these natural products come from 

3336
02:47:12,121 --> 02:47:12,121
the soil.
Typically,

3337
02:47:12,121 --> 02:47:13,930
you know,
amino acids and things like that,

3338
02:47:13,931 --> 02:47:18,250
and it's all going to change.
There was an amazing experiment that was

3339
02:47:18,251 --> 02:47:23,251
done where they started doping the 
substrate of psilocybin containing 

3340
02:47:23,251 --> 02:47:25,030
mushrooms with other tryptamines,
so they used,

3341
02:47:25,031 --> 02:47:30,031
instead of the DDT and dip tea,
put it in the substrate and they found 

3342
02:47:30,031 --> 02:47:34,741
that the mushroom would take that 
completely synthetic chemical that does 

3343
02:47:34,741 --> 02:47:37,801
not occur in nature.
It would then four hydroxylase indole 

3344
02:47:37,801 --> 02:47:42,151
ring just like it were a silicon 
derivative and create natural product 

3345
02:47:42,151 --> 02:47:42,580
derivatives of these synthetic 
materials.

3346
02:47:42,581 --> 02:47:47,581
Creating these semi-synthetic hybrids 
between men and mushroom creations.

3347
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,760
Jesus.
Yeah.

3348
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,770
Yeah.
I mean this is like why the synthetic,

3349
02:47:52,771 --> 02:47:55,680
natural dichotomy doesn't make sense.
Everything's evolving,

3350
02:47:55,681 --> 02:47:58,560
it's a constant interplay between human 
and plants and fungus,

3351
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:00,660
you know,
after we're all gone,

3352
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:05,870
all of our plastic bottles are going to 
be consumed by some bacterium that 

3353
02:48:06,571 --> 02:48:10,150
evolves to degrade all of these,
you know,

3354
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:15,380
polymers and that will create natural 
products from them and will those 

3355
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:16,510
natural products,
natural products,

3356
02:48:16,511 --> 02:48:19,000
because they were derived from the 
substrate that we created,

3357
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:24,160
you know,
it turns into like a very complicated 

3358
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:24,220
issue,
which is why I don't believe in the idea

3359
02:48:24,221 --> 02:48:25,210
of natural and synthetic.

3360
02:48:25,210 --> 02:48:28,510
Everything is simultaneously natural and
simultaneously synthetic.

3361
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:30,370
Well,
everything comes from Earth.

3362
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:35,430
Yes.
So even the most unnatural things that 

3363
02:48:35,430 --> 02:48:36,070
human beings are created are in 
essential natural creations.

3364
02:48:36,071 --> 02:48:39,670
Like a b creates a beehive of beehives 
and natural creation.

3365
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:41,810
Right?
Yeah.

3366
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:44,580
It's a mind fuck.
So to get back to emoney,

3367
02:48:44,581 --> 02:48:45,300
to miscarry,
uh,

3368
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:50,460
do,
do you know of anyone who's affectively 

3369
02:48:50,460 --> 02:48:52,170
regularly used it as a psychedelic?
Yes,

3370
02:48:52,230 --> 02:48:57,230
I've met but not people who I wacky 
people.

3371
02:48:59,570 --> 02:49:01,130
Yeah,
I would imagine.

3372
02:49:01,131 --> 02:49:01,810
Yeah.
Not.

3373
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:03,020
Yeah.
People where it's like,

3374
02:49:03,021 --> 02:49:04,980
oh,
that guy's a professor and he uses Amany

3375
02:49:04,981 --> 02:49:07,040
to every night to sleep.
He's doing really?

3376
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:08,310
But,
but yes,

3377
02:49:08,311 --> 02:49:09,360
wacky people,

3378
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:11,320
there's so much lower,
again,

3379
02:49:11,321 --> 02:49:14,200
a attached to it specifically because 
the Christian,

3380
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:17,310
I mean the books by allegro,
we're,

3381
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:18,340
we're big,
right?

3382
02:49:18,341 --> 02:49:22,870
One of them was the Dead Sea Scrolls in 
the Christian myth and it was one of his

3383
02:49:22,871 --> 02:49:27,871
books and that was the second book that 
he published after the sacred mushroom 

3384
02:49:27,871 --> 02:49:31,921
in the cross.
I think he did that because they took 

3385
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:31,921
the sacred mushroom and the cross off 
the market.

3386
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:33,550
Right.
Like what did the Catholic Church by out

3387
02:49:33,551 --> 02:49:36,220
the rights for that?
Or was that a myth as well?

3388
02:49:36,310 --> 02:49:38,530
I can't remember.
It was something along those lines,

3389
02:49:38,531 --> 02:49:43,531
but Yon Irvin republished it fairly 
recently with the blessings of the 

3390
02:49:43,781 --> 02:49:46,060
allegro family,
but the,

3391
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:49,950
the,
just the whole connection to Santa Claus

3392
02:49:50,220 --> 02:49:52,950
and the whole connection to Christmas 
with that mushroom,

3393
02:49:52,951 --> 02:49:55,080
it's,
there's so much attached to that.

3394
02:49:55,081 --> 02:49:58,560
Mushroom people want that mushroom to be
Jesus.

3395
02:49:58,600 --> 02:49:59,810
That's the one,
you know,

3396
02:49:59,910 --> 02:50:02,970
that's the way it's the prettiest.
It's like it grows.

3397
02:50:02,971 --> 02:50:06,000
It's got a Michael Riser relationship 
with coniferous trees.

3398
02:50:06,001 --> 02:50:11,001
So you find it underneath pine trees,
just like the shiny presence underneath 

3399
02:50:11,491 --> 02:50:16,491
the Christmas tree.
So people get so excited about that 

3400
02:50:16,491 --> 02:50:16,491
mushroom.

3401
02:50:16,491 --> 02:50:20,080
Yes they do,
but yet no one gets off on it except 

3402
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:20,080
wacky people.
Yeah.

3403
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:22,310
It's a complicated situation and you 
know,

3404
02:50:22,580 --> 02:50:26,330
just because something's convenient 
isn't a good reason to say that it's the

3405
02:50:26,331 --> 02:50:31,331
truth.
There are other psychoactive mushrooms 

3406
02:50:31,331 --> 02:50:34,000
that may have been used in the past.
They're ones that we've discovered 

3407
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:34,000
recently.
There's a species called Rodo,

3408
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,390
Columbia Maculotta,
as far as I know,

3409
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:38,300
that there's no information about humans
consuming this mushroom,

3410
02:50:38,301 --> 02:50:42,350
but it contains this Salvinorin,
a type kappa opioid agonist.

3411
02:50:42,380 --> 02:50:45,110
This could be a completely different 
type of psychedelic mushroom.

3412
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:50,350
No information on it exists.
Maybe someone used it somewhere in the 

3413
02:50:50,350 --> 02:50:50,350
past.
I don't know.

3414
02:50:50,350 --> 02:50:50,350
Whoa.

3415
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:52,310
Well,
isn't there?

3416
02:50:52,311 --> 02:50:57,311
There are some psychedelic substances 
that have been discovered that have no 

3417
02:50:57,311 --> 02:50:59,800
history of human use.
Like isn't Hawaiian baby.

3418
02:50:59,801 --> 02:51:00,880
Woodrow says,
I,

3419
02:51:01,070 --> 02:51:03,850
you say it doesn't have lsd like 
properties,

3420
02:51:03,851 --> 02:51:05,200
but no history of human use.

3421
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:07,820
Um,
that's a complicated question.

3422
02:51:07,821 --> 02:51:12,821
Yeah.
There's maybe not with Hawaiian baby 

3423
02:51:12,821 --> 02:51:12,821
woodrow is,
but with morning glory seeds,

3424
02:51:12,821 --> 02:51:15,230
there does seem to be some mezo American
history,

3425
02:51:15,231 --> 02:51:18,170
although it's not as well founded

3426
02:51:18,230 --> 02:51:20,480
and morning glory seeds.
We'll put you on the moon,

3427
02:51:20,481 --> 02:51:20,840
right?

3428
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:22,000
Well,
they,

3429
02:51:22,001 --> 02:51:24,730
yeah,
they contain Lsa and um,

3430
02:51:25,270 --> 02:51:30,270
again,
Lsa is actually Albert Hoffman did as 

3431
02:51:30,270 --> 02:51:32,820
the inventor of Lsd did it and 
experiment where he injected himself 

3432
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:34,900
with small quantities of Lsa,
but there aren't many evaluations of the

3433
02:51:34,901 --> 02:51:39,901
pure material.
So the exact nature of the different 

3434
02:51:39,901 --> 02:51:44,521
components in those seeds remains a 
little bit mysterious as far as I'm 

3435
02:51:44,521 --> 02:51:48,331
concerned.
Some people will suggest that it's the 

3436
02:51:48,331 --> 02:51:48,331
strongest,
naturally occurring psychedelic.

3437
02:51:48,331 --> 02:51:50,830
Other people will say that it's not even
psychedelic at all,

3438
02:51:50,831 --> 02:51:55,120
that it's just a hypnotic.
It just has a sort of sedating quality.

3439
02:51:55,240 --> 02:51:59,150
I've used Hawaiian baby wardrobes many,
many years ago and um,

3440
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:04,260
it's certainly psychoactive,
whether I'd call it classically 

3441
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:06,580
psychedelic is a complicated issue.
It's of like a dreamy,

3442
02:52:06,580 --> 02:52:10,150
unpleasant delirium.
Hm.

3443
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:17,240
Um,
any other ones that we could go to that 

3444
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:18,730
are weird.
Watch my show.

3445
02:52:18,731 --> 02:52:20,590
I think you'd really like it.
I'm sure I'd like it.

3446
02:52:20,591 --> 02:52:21,910
I like all your stuff.
Okay.

3447
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:24,790
Because it goes into lots of weird.
I just don't have enough time.

3448
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:28,120
There's too many things that are cool 
now.

3449
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:33,180
Yeah.
That's one of the problems with a 

3450
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,490
Netflix and hbo and Youtube and just too
much cool stuff,

3451
02:52:39,050 --> 02:52:41,330
but this will be cool.
I will definitely watch it.

3452
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:42,460
Okay.
Uh,

3453
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:43,550
that was three hours,
man.

3454
02:52:43,640 --> 02:52:44,900
It just flew by.
Well,

3455
02:52:44,990 --> 02:52:46,160
not crazy.
That is crazy.

3456
02:52:46,161 --> 02:52:48,530
We got have time more over here.
So,

3457
02:52:48,531 --> 02:52:49,340
uh,
listen,

3458
02:52:49,430 --> 02:52:51,530
this is way better than the first time 
we did it.

3459
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:57,690
We were here I think.
Got a lot of cool information now and I 

3460
02:52:57,690 --> 02:52:57,690
really appreciate you coming back,
man.

3461
02:52:57,690 --> 02:53:00,230
Thanks for having me do this again,
but not in seven years to quicker.

3462
02:53:00,290 --> 02:53:01,430
Yes,
I hope for sure.

3463
02:53:01,431 --> 02:53:04,370
Thank you.
And on twitter and Instagram,

3464
02:53:04,371 --> 02:53:08,600
it's Hamilton Morris.
And your show is Hamilton's Pharmacopia.

3465
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:13,630
It's.
Is it available online because people 

3466
02:53:13,630 --> 02:53:13,630
watch it online?
Yes,

3467
02:53:13,630 --> 02:53:17,351
it's on Hulu and streaming on Amazon and
streaming on itunes and it's on vice 

3468
02:53:17,351 --> 02:53:19,060
land as well.
So yeah,

3469
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:20,540
easy to find.
Thanks man.

3470
02:53:20,570 --> 02:53:21,800
That was awesome.
Appreciate it.

3471
02:53:21,801 --> 02:53:22,040
Thank you.

3472
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:36,680
Hmm.
