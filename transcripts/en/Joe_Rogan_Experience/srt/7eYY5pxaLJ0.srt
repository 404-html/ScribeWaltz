1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,020
The Joe Rogan experience I do believe
has a lot of benefits to it and I started

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,460
because I had major injuries and I didn't
want to actually take the pain pills I

3
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,780
was being prescribed for my surgeries,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,870
so that's why I started investigating
weed and marijuana and I would help that

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:13,670
to calm me down.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,730
I want her to talk to you about that
because that's another issue that I think

7
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:20,540
is really important because I keep
hearing about fighters that are having

8
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,650
problems with pain pills.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,310
I think a hundred percent people
are going to be back to back.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,290
Major fucking surgeries lined up
under my Brooklyn job or client ankle.

11
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,124
Tore up my knee.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,240
I had my neck surgery.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,430
I had like a couple of good ones
will my hand a couple of times.

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,150
So I've had multiple surgeries so one
of the things they started getting major

15
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,970
injuries and then getting surgeries and
I didn't want to take the pain pills.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,970
Although I did take some of them and I
like when I broke my jaw I was taking a

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,570
liquid,

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,680
some kind of liquid pain pill.

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,543
I don't know what it was,

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,290
but that's what started
my venture into wheat,

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
so it was just to get through
the night so I could sleep,

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,770
but it does fuck in my memory man,

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,310
like I was having like the next day I
have an issue like holding combinations

24
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,860
for these guys and stuff and just
not remembering dates and stuff.

25
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,480
So it did fuck with me personally.

26
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:59,480
I call it my memory and I don't think
it's for everybody because I'm very,

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,940
very high strong and try to get shit done
all not trying to get shit done on it

28
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,010
all the time.

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,550
So I think if somebody else has already
killed predisposed to be a slight bit

30
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:08,120
lazy,

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,970
this is not for you
100 percent either way.

32
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,130
It's not for everyone makes
him differently though.

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,180
He can enjoy time.

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,033
Yeah,

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,730
sometimes.

36
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,170
Yeah.

37
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,250
It's like a reverse effect.

38
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:21,320
Like most people get stolen
the sit on the couch,

39
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,870
they'll get hungry and not want
to go start doing combos and shit.

40
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,943
This guy's shadow.

41
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:26,930
You

42
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,291
know what?

43
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,810
I figured things out about
my body when I'm high,

44
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,010
I,

45
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,060
I figured out certain
stretches that I need,

46
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,160
like I feel like,

47
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,191
you know what,

48
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,150
I'm tight right here,

49
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:35,570
like I've,

50
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,620
I've figured shit out.

51
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,810
And then as you're feeling your body more,

52
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,261
I be like,

53
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:39,711
you know what,

54
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,090
I got to incorporate that more.

55
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,650
And then like certain techniques,

56
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,670
like kicking techniques,

57
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,910
like I've gone over them high and
I like feel the weight transfer,

58
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:47,744
better speech,

59
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,230
speaking to Haydn,

60
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,060
that shit.

61
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,893
Listen to this.

62
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,200
There was a dude in
China that got arrested.

63
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,831
He,

64
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:55,160
uh,

65
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,110
he went to jail and because
he convinced a girl that she,

66
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,880
her vagina was haunted and that he had
to get rid of the ghost with his penis.

67
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,310
So they arrested him for this.

68
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,350
They,

69
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,860
they arrested him after he
claimed that he get rid of it.

70
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,040
The paranormal enthusiasts allegedly
charged $3,250 to perform the sexism.

71
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,251
What a brilliant man.

72
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:22,701
Come on,

73
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,030
man.

74
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,200
That dude is a pimp.

75
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,270
And you're hating your hating on that guy.

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,820
That the though.

77
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,860
That's a fucker.

78
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,720
You talk a woman,

79
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,020
there's a ghost in a monkey.

80
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,230
You're a fucking genius

81
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,010
and she's got to give him money.

82
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,250
It's a brilliant even fuck up,

83
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,620
but give them really to blend you
with this girl looked like this.

84
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,820
Got To be a picture of this dummy.

85
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,980
Not so far.

86
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,630
I don't really want to see a picture.

87
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,543
He said,

88
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,083
poor guy.

89
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,270
His name was Wang.

90
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Jie on one brilliant Huang h u a n g,

91
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,811
G.

92
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,620
I was in grammar school dog.

93
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:02,670
He was that little Chinese
dude in the back that got.

94
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,600
There'll be through fucking paperclip.

95
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,290
Said,

96
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,441
look,

97
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,670
he's a gangster now.

98
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,650
He's getting his dick
suck and getting paid.

99
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,730
Oh,

100
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,960
there really is funny man.

101
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,950
That is classic.

102
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,120
That's classic type Shit.

103
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,900
Explained the ghost in her vagina were
preventing her boss from falling in love

104
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
with her.

105
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,060
Oh my God.

106
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
Check this.

107
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,370
So she must've come to him and said,

108
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,320
I want my boss to fall in love with me.

109
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,191
And so.

110
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,870
So she was a conniver man.

111
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:33,871
So he convinced her because the ghosts
in her vagina were preventing her boss

112
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,490
from falling in love with her.

113
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,390
Holy Shit goes that he can
easily catch with his penis.

114
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,050
Did you fucking arrest that guy?

115
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,150
Come on man,

116
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,620
because they don't have high five there.

117
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,060
That's rude.

118
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,290
Arresting this guy for that is rude that
you should be able to go to go to court

119
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:53,940
and say,

120
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,101
well,

121
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,760
your honor,

122
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,050
what I told her was that her vagina was
haunted and the only way she's going to

123
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:04,051
be able to steal her boss away from his
wife is if she let me fuck her and catch

124
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,350
the goes with my Dick.

125
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,550
Get the fuck out of my court.

126
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,400
You'd be like,

127
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,710
get your lunchbox and get the fuck out.

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
You want to sue him for what you.

129
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,110
You thought that was true?

130
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,781
You thought really?

131
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,690
Who's going to get the the
ghost out with his Dick?

132
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,030
Get the fuck out.

133
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,620
You call the cops and tell them this shit.

134
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,563
Straight face.

135
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,321
Listen,

136
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:25,930
I got arrested.

137
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,760
A Guy,

138
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
he stuck his dick in my fucking ghost
in the fucking totally lied to me and I

139
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,600
guess it's the money.

140
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,190
It was the 3000,

141
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,024
250 bucks.

142
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,190
No problem right there.

143
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,610
But meanwhile,

144
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,660
how can they prove it?

145
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,090
She probably wrote a check.

146
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,081
I can improve it.

147
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,690
How can they prove that he
didn't get the ghost out?

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,153
Smell it.

149
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,413
ECTOPLASM.

150
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,133
Smell it.

151
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,873
Smell.

152
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,260
If it smells like it can
be rigged game though.

153
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:58,020
She waits right to you.

154
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,300
Starting.

155
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,420
She farts are in your face.

156
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,493
No,

157
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
it's a fucking crazy
world out there though.

158
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,970
You can talk people into anything.

159
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,751
I'll never forget.

160
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,250
I forgot.

161
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,550
I found out about Nirvana.

162
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,220
I was out where this dude's house
that I used to buy stolen radios from.

163
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,260
There's this one dude.

164
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,110
If you needed a radio back then
when I didn't understand Karma,

165
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,750
you know you need to radio from your car.

166
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,610
You can get one from this
kid who always had radios.

167
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,090
Then he would just somehow or another
get and you didn't ask any questions,

168
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,020
but you knew they were stolen.

169
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,750
Were over his house and he was into music.

170
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,350
This kid,

171
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,370
it was just a bad kid,

172
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,240
you know,

173
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,780
whatever.

174
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,830
Bad suburban kid.

175
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,933
Not too bad.

176
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,350
We went over his house and he goes,

177
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,700
this is going to change me music.

178
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,721
And so what is it?

179
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:35,901
He goes,

180
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,100
it's called fucking Nirvana.

181
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,320
And he starts playing it and he goes,

182
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,640
all those hairbands,

183
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,780
those guys are fucked.

184
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,340
And he played this shit.

185
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:43,731
I was like,

186
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:44,121
wow.

187
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,230
Like you just nailed it.

188
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,600
Like this kid nailed it in his,

189
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,430
in his bedroom in Newton,

190
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,390
Massachusetts.

191
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,990
Like right when the nevermind came out.

192
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,603
This kid nailed it.

193
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,800
He just was an emphasis of thief.

194
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,181
He was like,

195
00:05:59,181 --> 00:05:59,590
this is,

196
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,600
this is going to change.

197
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,130
This goes,

198
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,910
guys are fucked.

199
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,280
It was that obvious
though was stat obvious.

200
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,460
Danny boy played it for me
first and we were both like,

201
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,720
yeah,

202
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,910
they draws drunk.

203
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,360
There's only been a few times.

204
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:15,360
And like musical history when someone
hits some new levels of something we had

205
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,340
never seen it before.

206
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,170
And when Nirvana came out that was like,

207
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,900
Whoa,

208
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,250
whoa.

209
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,210
Undeniable talent is
undeniable uniqueness.

210
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,570
The power of their songs.

211
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,311
Song after song.

212
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:25,910
Different.

213
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,540
Honest though.

214
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,900
Yeah.

215
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,111
Oh,

216
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,944
totally honest.

217
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,950
Raw.

218
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,340
And like at this insane heroin way.

219
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,320
Insane heroin.

220
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,050
Honesty spawned by the punk movement.

221
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,990
Is that what is some chains chains?

222
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,550
They were,

223
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,383
they were,

224
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,290
they were more on the metal side to me.

225
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,320
But like they were definitely
of that grunge metal movement,

226
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,440
like soundgarden rocked
out a little harder.

227
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,520
You know that song,

228
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,480
them bones,

229
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,630
Jesus Christ that makes you feel like
you're dying when you're listening to it

230
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,133
shows a beach.

231
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,930
There was a dude who is sad.

232
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,710
He that motherfucker
understood that he was dying.

233
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,940
When he wrote that song,

234
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,310
he understood that he was on that
path when he wrote that song.

235
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,010
I don't think lane rope tows.

236
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,993
He just sang it.

237
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,310
I think Jerry Cantrell
wrote all that stuff.

238
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,533
Wow.

239
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,310
I'm pretty sure whatever.

240
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,720
There may be a few that I'm wrong on,

241
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:19,490
but at the bulk and the tempera form that
what I'm saying is like the way layne

242
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:22,820
staley hit notes like it made you like,

243
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,860
it made you feel that you were dying.

244
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,000
Like that song going to
end up a big old pile.

245
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,120
Them bones like that screaming
was like Jesus Christ.

246
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,070
I remember the first time
I saw a man in the box,

247
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:34,821
like on MTV.

248
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,211
It was like,

249
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,044
what the hell is that?

250
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,040
God Damn.

251
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,030
Those guys were intense.

252
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,113
It was crazy.

253
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,850
And that kind of.

254
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,070
I had a night with that
dude and another guy,

255
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,023
layne staley.

256
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:45,700
Yeah,

257
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,220
I did.

258
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,680
It was good to know.

259
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,514
We just

260
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,700
this promoter in Philly,

261
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,330
this,

262
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,051
this place,

263
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,700
I believe it was the electric factory,

264
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,510
like thousand Cedar Club,

265
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,344
something like that.

266
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,810
He booked it twice in one night.

267
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,561
He did two shows.

268
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:00,861
He didn't.

269
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,240
Allison changed show early,

270
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,770
kicked everybody out.

271
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,360
Then did the house paint show holy
shit out to place twice in one night.

272
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,381
But we all,

273
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,210
because we were all at the same hotel,

274
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,860
so like we saw these guys.

275
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,960
We were coming back from hotel me
and Dj Alito and they were like,

276
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,490
yeah.

277
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:15,770
We're like,

278
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,000
Hey,

279
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,300
what's up?

280
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,031
We're going to go up to the room,

281
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,170
smoke one party a little bit.

282
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:18,460
They were like,

283
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,770
all right.

284
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,603
We came up,

285
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,503
him and his buddy,

286
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,570
they came up and they sat at the table
and we're rolling joints and we're

287
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,540
talking all this shit and like me and
lethal and just rolling all joint after

288
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:26,811
joint,

289
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,930
throwing them on the table and then we
stopped and we go to light one and both

290
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,780
the dudes are sitting there just
completely knotted out cold.

291
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,590
Wow.

292
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,330
Cigarette's burned into their fingers.

293
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:35,540
I can.

294
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:35,961
We were like,

295
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:36,920
what the fuck was.

296
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,090
We weren't really hit.

297
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,990
We were kind of naive,

298
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,381
you know what I mean?

299
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,214
We were like,

300
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,390
didn't realize they were on
heroin by that time we had,

301
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,131
but it was like,

302
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:45,350
you know,

303
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,870
the whole side.

304
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,703
And they were just like,

305
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,430
wow,

306
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,610
looking sniffing or smoking shit out of a

307
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,270
foil like Pine Hall.

308
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,123
No,

309
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,320
we haven't done that before.

310
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,980
We really joyous man.

311
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,490
You know,

312
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,550
he didn't even realize they were doing.

313
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,520
It was like it was done.

314
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,090
They were only in our
presence for the matter,

315
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,060
like 15 minutes.

316
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,650
Oh Shit.

317
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,040
Itunes or recording to server,

318
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,150
get the fuck outta here.

319
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:41,720
Server.
