1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,680
Want to wait for the
green side before I point.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,553
Okay,

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:10,570
boom.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:10,930
Good.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,170
Okay.

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,200
We had some technical difficulties.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:13,950
Let's try it again.

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,150
Okay.

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,740
So anyway,

10
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,100
brother,

11
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,790
welcome.

12
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,810
Thanks for coming here.

13
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:17,111
Thanks.

14
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:17,351
Thanks.

15
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,000
So what we were saying before,

16
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,860
we actually said this already,

17
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:22,630
but let's say it again because
the people didn't hear it.

18
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:22,980
You,

19
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,990
you were one of the pioneers
of standup comedy in Brazil.

20
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,650
Yeah,

21
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,431
he was a,

22
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,400
I started with like four or five guys.

23
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,680
We started doing it like 16,

24
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:35,640
17 years ago and uh,

25
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,150
nobody knew about stand up.

26
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,420
It was something that I found out when
I came here to live and play basketball.

27
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,540
I had a scholarship to play basketball
and I watched Jim Gaffigan oh wow.

28
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,320
And Brian Regan.

29
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:47,800
Ah,

30
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
I know those guys.

31
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,300
And I thought it was so weird
because those guys were like,

32
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,530
that's,

33
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,520
I was questioning his,

34
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,850
does he call his name?

35
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:02,851
Brian Regan does heat is actually him
because we used to have characters and

36
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,420
impersonators.

37
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,730
So he was kind of weird.

38
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:07,391
But at the same time,

39
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:11,350
it was interesting because I'm not
a guy who those characters and I do

40
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,510
observations and I ride.

41
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,680
It was a journalism degree in journalism.

42
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,250
So it was interesting for me to see
those guys doing comedy and I thought we

43
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,690
could do the same in my country.

44
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,110
It's so crazy that it took that
long for it to get to Brazil.

45
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,480
You would think that
because everything else,

46
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:25,661
I mean,

47
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,870
you guys have movies and you know,

48
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,121
uh,

49
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,290
I mean city of God,

50
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,430
you have action movies.

51
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,264
You're always,

52
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,010
you have so much that's so similar.

53
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:36,350
The fact that standup comedy
made it there is so unusual to a,

54
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,720
it took a long time.

55
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,623
A was,

56
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,730
I don't know why,

57
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:44,550
but the image of a comedian speaking
like with a blazer or a suit or something

58
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,403
was Jerry Seinfeld,

59
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,200
very American,

60
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,034
you know,

61
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,210
and those jokes,

62
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:51,850
did they actually connect
them much with us?

63
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,060
Like,

64
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,340
Oh,

65
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,230
I have those buckets.

66
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,850
And it was something that we
have bigger problems than,

67
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,431
oh,

68
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,420
I just kind of a pocket.

69
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,690
I pulled my band.

70
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,523
I was like,

71
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,030
he was,

72
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,160
it was something that I could,

73
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,000
we couldn't connect them much,

74
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,410
but when we,

75
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,550
when we saw there was another people
doing other stuff and that was like this

76
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,340
huge role that we could actually explore,

77
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,710
that was when it become
interesting for us.

78
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,150
So comedy in Brazil,

79
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,890
they would basically be like a,

80
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,870
like say if I was a Brazilian comedian,

81
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,770
I would come up with a
fake name if you would.

82
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,200
And I would do a character.

83
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll wig wig,

84
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,200
I'll wear a certain outfit,

85
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,070
outfit like a very over the top screaming.

86
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,904
And uh,

87
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,020
in that steel steel exists in Brazil.

88
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,380
This is like a popular fourth
of the people stand up.

89
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,510
I'm not saying that it's for everyone.

90
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,460
Now I have my Netflix Bash,

91
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,120
shall we be?

92
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,070
It's becoming huge because,

93
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,851
uh,

94
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,850
we have some other options
right now with the Internet.

95
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:49,661
Everything changed.

96
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:50,920
The game changed completely.

97
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,754
So we have,

98
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,450
uh,

99
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,540
what is good has his own space right now.

100
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,360
It's not only what the TV ones,

101
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,300
she used to watch it.

102
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,320
So the changed a little for,

103
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,420
for all of us.

104
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,800
So how did you start out?

105
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,801
Did you start out by going to music
clubs or he was actually standing there,

106
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,930
a BDSM club.

107
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,750
Sadomasochist really?

108
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,210
I remember that there was like pictures
of Cox in the back and leg of a giant.

109
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,010
It was a huge vaginas and we have it.

110
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,050
And we had that show and he was,

111
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,610
it wasn't good,

112
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,830
but is it was an experience for all
of us to go on stage and try to,

113
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,610
to,

114
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,610
to show them our opinions and our jokes
and some irony and sarcasm we wish,

115
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,700
which was something that
people wasn't watching,

116
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,270
eh,

117
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,230
but then it becomes,

118
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,670
he becomes something huge.

119
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,180
We got chances to go to
TV and everything else.

120
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,080
But at first it was difficult because
people could not understand is he a

121
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,914
character?

122
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,330
Is he playing your part?

123
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,370
So that's why I had,

124
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,670
and I still have a lot of problems with
the law because like I did a rape joke,

125
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,240
which I'm not proud of.

126
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,860
I'm saying it's not something that,

127
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,550
oh,

128
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,550
well I'm so over the top.

129
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,540
I love it in the line.

130
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,210
And,

131
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,500
but uh,

132
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,131
he was like,

133
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:12,580
does he,

134
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,020
does this guy wants people to be rated?

135
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,581
What is,

136
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,480
what is he thinking?

137
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,314
What is,

138
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,220
because with all those jokes was taken
out of context and put it on newspapers

139
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,320
kind of killed,

140
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,000
uh,

141
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
he kind of killed the,

142
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,410
my desire to the committee
of her dad as well.

143
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,950
Really?

144
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,281
Yeah,

145
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:27,611
it was,

146
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,820
it was difficult because
he was like journalists,

147
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
journalists in the audience
waiting for me to say some Shit,

148
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,450
put out of context and
then guide like a fucking,

149
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,620
like billions of clicks on their
website because joke I did,

150
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,821
that's how we,

151
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,010
the controversy was starting over that.

152
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,390
And I don't know if the same thing here.

153
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,210
So they knew that this was a new thing.

154
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,780
They,

155
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,220
and then so they would come to see it
and then what would they criticizing it

156
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,570
before this he was,

157
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,441
he was huge.

158
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,400
Everybody loved it.

159
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,360
Then of course,

160
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,140
but when,

161
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,590
when,

162
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:02,831
when,

163
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,730
when man,

164
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,850
when we started to have money and a TV
shows and we kind of ran away out of the

165
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,580
underground,

166
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,380
I was doing shows at midnight,

167
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,670
like packing at three,

168
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,680
300 seat theater.

169
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,000
And midnight in Brazil.

170
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,350
That was my thing.

171
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,110
Underground is some Powell
in the middle of nowhere.

172
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,420
But then people have this guy style into,

173
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,710
let me give him a chance.

174
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,570
So they put me on TV and I don't know
where I was on TV doing the same thing.

175
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,350
Wow.

176
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,350
So the country was not that prepare
for what I was doing at the time.

177
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,350
What kind of laws do you have in Brazil
in terms of like the language of you're

178
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,640
allowed to use on television?

179
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,140
You know,

180
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,973
the,

181
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm not saying there's like a government
censorship about what you can say,

182
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,920
what you cannot say.

183
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,720
But uh,

184
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,800
sponsors and,

185
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,070
and even TV stations and the media is
very sensitive about everything because

186
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,090
it's still a poor country.

187
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,100
I still a bazooka to
a third world country.

188
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,330
So we are,

189
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,871
we are like,

190
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,410
we have a lot of people that
don't understand the though,

191
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,400
oh this is comedy.

192
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:10,601
What,

193
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:10,721
what,

194
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:10,971
what's,

195
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,661
what's comedy?

196
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:15,590
So it was my duty to explain a little bit.

197
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:15,871
Wow.

198
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:20,810
Well what was standup and kind
of for open a road for all of us.

199
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,920
That's how I felt.

200
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
So you and you said three,

201
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,281
three or four guys.

202
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:25,370
It's,

203
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,660
so who are these other guys?

204
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,380
They're still doing comedy in Brazil.

205
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:28,820
Yeah,

206
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,571
they still doing.

207
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,350
They still huge.

208
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,183
What are their names?

209
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,820
Uh,

210
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,260
Marcel Mansfield.

211
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,400
The illusion.

212
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Chile or scared or feel you?

213
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,400
There was a small group of guys that
we started doing Brazilian Portuguese.

214
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,630
Such a beautiful language.

215
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,791
I love it.

216
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,130
I love,

217
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,170
it's like a song.

218
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,531
It's like,

219
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,480
it's [inaudible].

220
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,820
I've been doing Jujitsu for 23 years,

221
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:49,630
so it's like,

222
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,340
to me that sound is like,

223
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:52,420
it's such a cool sound.

224
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:52,951
What does,

225
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:55,260
what does Brazilians say
in Jersey says though?

226
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:58,080
Is there a word or something that they
are still repeating that you know?

227
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,551
Well,

228
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:58,881
I mean,

229
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,470
you know Paul Ha Paul,

230
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,540
which is come is that fucker come,

231
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,120
which wouldn't come but sometimes ah,

232
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,503
Aha though.

233
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,130
Sometimes you say it like damn,

234
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,270
but it's come,

235
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,103
it's COPCO.

236
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,140
It's funny cause like
that's like the word Shit.

237
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,760
Like shit could be like,

238
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,620
you could look at something,

239
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,060
go shit nailed.

240
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:19,894
That's good.

241
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,660
But it's shit can also be bad.

242
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,460
Yeah.

243
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,730
You know,

244
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,670
like fuck too.

245
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,740
Like fuck could be good
or fuck could be bad.

246
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,420
Like you could stub your toe and go fuck.

247
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,590
Or You could,

248
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,750
you could see a girl with
a beautiful body and go,

249
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,280
fuck yeah,

250
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,680
but Paul has the same fee had so crazy,

251
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,523
but it's because,

252
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,480
oh,

253
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,350
it's good.

254
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,580
It's like a big buff,

255
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,890
but then you're getting a choke boy.

256
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,863
Huh?

257
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,760
I got it.

258
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,131
I got it.

259
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:47,964
It's the same thing.

260
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,921
It's exactly the same.

261
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:49,671
That's so funny.

262
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:49,970
Man.

263
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,290
Language is difficult,

264
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,270
man to speak in English.

265
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,351
I was,

266
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:54,531
uh,

267
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:54,981
I wasn't,

268
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:55,814
uh,

269
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,953
you know,

270
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,300
I was thinking about it,

271
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,223
Eh,

272
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,370
black people has to stop using the
n word in rap songs because be,

273
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,760
it becomes a trap for immunity.

274
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:05,594
Karaoke.

275
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,260
I was singing karaoke
and the end of the song,

276
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,130
this guy came up to me,

277
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:10,964
I was like,

278
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,070
don't drop the n word man.

279
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,960
But he was in the song,

280
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,250
so what should I do?

281
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,540
Not seem to more.

282
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,270
Right.

283
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,550
It's so that the light
language is something that is,

284
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm still like learning.

285
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,294
There is,

286
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,200
it's difficult,

287
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:24,560
man.

288
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,831
Well,

289
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,670
it's very tricky.

290
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,750
I mean it's obviously in America there's
this sort of a acknowledgement that

291
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,870
black people were slaves for so long
they are allowed to do more things and in

292
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,580
particular how to use that word.

293
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,140
Okay.

294
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,970
There's no other word like in terms of uh,

295
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,833
like a,

296
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,610
like a bad word about an ethnicity no.

297
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,270
That people use for them.

298
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:49,870
So like,

299
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,310
like a Puerto Rican person would never
call himself a spic and like a good,

300
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:55,144
like what's up?

301
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,660
Like to another Puerto Rican,

302
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,300
it's v The n word is a very unique word.

303
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,140
Like there's no word really
cannot say in any situation.

304
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,940
I could say it if I'm explaining it
like this guy called that guy a nigger.

305
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,893
I can say that.

306
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,520
But even saying that people,

307
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,050
some people wouldn't do that.

308
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm not,

309
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,330
I would never call someone that.

310
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,660
Okay.

311
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,430
But I will use it if I,

312
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,431
if I'm quoting someone or
if I'm explaining the word
itself because to run away

313
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,030
from the joke is even hotter because he'll
be our knowledging that that's up for

314
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,093
bidding war.

315
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,193
So yeah,

316
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,990
Chris Rock had one of the
greatest bits of all time.

317
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,470
Okay.

318
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,470
That there are black people
and there are niggers.

319
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,520
This was his joke,

320
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,000
but even for me to say
that that was a joke,

321
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:46,530
and to say it that way is dangerous and
it's one of the greatest comedy routines

322
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:47,730
in the history of standup.

323
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,541
That's crazy.

324
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:48,721
Yeah.

325
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,150
But a white person could never quote that,

326
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:51,450
Joe,

327
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,040
you can't do the joke.

328
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,530
Like if you tried to do
it a joke to your friend,

329
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:56,180
like you'd have to go can,

330
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,013
we can make it.

331
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,920
I'm going to be looking around.

332
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,360
Chris rock is so funny.

333
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,530
Let me tell you the bit like,

334
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,750
you'd have to be really careful.

335
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:02,910
I mean,

336
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,580
there's no way you could do
the whole joke on a podcast.

337
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,331
It's just,

338
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,170
you say the word,

339
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,681
the n word.

340
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,180
Too many times people get mad at you.

341
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,080
That's crazy,

342
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:10,914
man.

343
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,791
You know,

344
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,080
racism is crazy.

345
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,940
The fact that there's still racism,

346
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,990
that's what's crazy.

347
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,700
The word is just sort of a like a,

348
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,040
it's m,

349
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,200
it's symptomatic.

350
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,650
It's like there's a,

351
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,400
there's a thing there that connects
it to the feeling of racism,

352
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,950
even if you're not using
it in a racist context.

353
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,341
Yes.

354
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,300
So for me,

355
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:30,631
I'm a,

356
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,341
I'm a,

357
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,011
I'm a foreigner,

358
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:32,780
so,

359
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,480
uh,

360
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I was never so aware of racists.

361
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,430
Like I am now living in this country.

362
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:38,581
Yeah.

363
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,450
Brazil's,

364
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:39,901
no,

365
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,180
racism is very mild,

366
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,260
very different.

367
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,670
That is racism.

368
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,250
I cannot say that there is
not racism of our studies,

369
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,360
but here it's like,

370
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,620
uh,

371
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,090
when there's an election they even say
how the white folded and how the black

372
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:54,924
folded.

373
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,780
That's kind of weird because
for me that's racism.

374
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,290
Yoda,

375
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,240
like dividing people more racist and it's
clear on TV and sometimes they'll even

376
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,710
stop thinking about it.

377
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,540
It's like it's bought off the,

378
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:06,711
the,

379
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:06,831
the,

380
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,620
the whole thing.

381
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,801
Well,

382
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,400
it's because the black community doesn't
feel like they're represented and they

383
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,150
felt like they were represented finally
when Obama became president because we

384
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:15,481
finally,

385
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,440
we had a black president.

386
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,280
But other than that,

387
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,061
you know,

388
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,440
there's a real distinction.

389
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,610
Like with Obama,

390
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,260
it was like almost universal.

391
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,820
He was going to get air quotes,

392
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,810
the black vote,

393
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,561
you know.

394
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,460
But with Trump,

395
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,180
I mean it's,

396
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,230
or with anybody else,

397
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,580
it's very tricky.

398
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,030
It's very,

399
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,990
it's a very different thing.

400
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,800
They want to make sure that
their community is being
represented and that their

401
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,970
needs are being represented.

402
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:40,170
I completely understand and I agreed that
there's someone knowledgement to make

403
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,433
the history,

404
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,740
but at the same time I'm knowledging uh,

405
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,810
may divide kind of divides
you a little bit as well.

406
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,260
Yes,

407
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,741
it does.

408
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:52,790
And it's also used as a weapon
by some people that you know,

409
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,800
or are not,

410
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,540
they're not being honest.

411
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,620
They're just using it as a tool to
divide people or to force their agenda

412
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:01,810
through or,

413
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,130
you know,

414
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,610
again,

415
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,410
the real problem is not the words.

416
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,550
The real problem is not,

417
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,830
the real problem is actual real racism.

418
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,970
That's the real problem.

419
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,230
It still exists.

420
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,010
It exists less than it did a hundred
years ago and far less than it did 200

421
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:15,810
years ago.

422
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,490
And a hundred years from now it'll
probably be almost nonexistent.

423
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,990
But it's a real problem.

424
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,890
People are tribal.

425
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,600
They differentiate by town.

426
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,830
People differentiate by what
part of the country you're from.

427
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:29,800
And they certainly differentiate by nation
and they differentiate by the origin

428
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:30,700
of your ancestors.

429
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,000
It's,

430
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,910
it's really stupid is what it is.

431
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,300
Unless you're just celebrating the
differences and how interesting.

432
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:37,571
You know,

433
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:41,170
there's different food and different music
and different culture and literature,

434
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,520
but the,

435
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,300
you know,

436
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,841
actual,

437
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:44,950
real racism.

438
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,170
The fact that it's
still exists in 2000 and

439
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,430
it is crazy.

440
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:48,761
I got,

441
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,420
uh,

442
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,960
uh,

443
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,610
and that is the racism Brazil was,

444
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm not saying that there's not racism,

445
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,030
more mild was there.

446
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,550
Interracial relationships
are much more common.

447
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,950
If you see like a black,

448
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,030
a black guy with a white woman,

449
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,580
it's not a nobody that
was going to say shit.

450
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,361
It's normal.

451
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,380
It's not something that people
will go by pointing or something.

452
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,350
I don't think so.

453
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,090
But there's parts of
this country where it's,

454
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,080
it's a real problem.

455
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,340
There's parts of this country where
there's real racism on a black man with a

456
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,820
white woman is in danger and now they
have to be careful if they go into the

457
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:19,601
wrong bar.

458
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,640
They have to be careful if
they're going to the wrong place.

459
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,863
It's fucking crazy.

460
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,530
That's crazy.

461
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,020
Yeah,

462
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,670
it is crazy.

463
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,121
That is a,

464
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:25,670
some kind of,

465
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,503
uh,

466
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,540
it's not,

467
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,170
uh,

468
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,660
is not 100% of the time that
I feel comfortable here.

469
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,240
There's a lot of situations that I have,

470
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,140
I feel that I can say the wrong
thing because I don't want,

471
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,770
cause you don't understand the day.

472
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,230
Did you learn English?

473
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,030
I played basketball here.

474
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh,

475
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,460
so you learn to eat in order to play?

476
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,950
He was,

477
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,300
yeah.

478
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,680
I will you at the time,

479
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,990
was he swills 1999.

480
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,910
I was 23 at a time of 42.

481
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,931
So,

482
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,590
uh,

483
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,550
it was 1999.

484
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:59,230
I play basketball here and I learned the
English and that's when I got a first

485
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,300
time I saw stand up.

486
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,241
I was like,

487
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:01,830
fuck,

488
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,650
that's so easy.

489
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,341
Wow.

490
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:04,570
That was 1999.

491
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,580
So when you brought it over to Brazil,

492
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,720
when you brought over stand up,

493
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,060
did you guys get together and say,

494
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,810
hey,

495
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,610
let's try to do this over here.

496
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:13,480
Where can we do it?

497
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,560
Uh,

498
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,170
W I had three friends that knew about it.

499
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,270
It's just going to fuck a cult.

500
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,410
A secret cult of people
who knew about stand up.

501
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,051
And,

502
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:23,231
uh,

503
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,681
we were like,

504
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:24,580
let's try it.

505
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,510
But the only,

506
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:30,400
the only email that we have was
Seinfeld at the end of every episode.

507
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,930
That was the,

508
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,130
that was the thing for us.

509
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,720
That's the only reference.

510
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,200
I still remember that the first veto
that were like talking about what we were

511
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,034
doing,

512
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,641
we were like,

513
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:39,821
oh,

514
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,130
so this is standup.

515
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,510
Uh,

516
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:41,650
no,

517
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:41,891
we'll do,

518
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,260
do you,

519
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,860
did you ever see every episode
of Seinfeld at the end?

520
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:46,180
He does like under routine.

521
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,451
Oh,

522
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:48,280
this is what they're going to
do on the theater right now.

523
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,920
So that's when we wanted to do it.

524
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
And uh,

525
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,230
and it took some time
because we started in 2002,

526
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,520
2003 and youtube just came on 2005.

527
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,770
But when youtube came,

528
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:08,771
that was like a lot of people posting
stand up and little like 30 minutes

529
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:09,231
comedy,

530
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:10,400
central specials.

531
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,270
And then we could see and that,

532
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,210
and he was difficult at first because
of everything that I was writing,

533
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,280
I could see people doing on TV.

534
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,450
My jokes,

535
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,490
it was hard for me to explain to people,

536
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,740
this is my joke.

537
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Like stole your jokes was not even like
stealing because they didn't just joke.

538
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Right.

539
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,700
Right.

540
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,580
It was just a joke.

541
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,840
How can I explain to people,

542
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:33,350
okay,

543
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,400
this is what I wrote.

544
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,610
I'm not going to do jokes that other
people wrote a this is it's mine.

545
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,700
Yeah.

546
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,100
People thought I was a little crazy.

547
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,311
Oh,

548
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:44,060
that's funny.

549
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,540
Wow.

550
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,011
Because,

551
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:45,710
um,

552
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,071
you know,

553
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:50,600
I don't know if you have this anecdotes
that everybody saves you have here in

554
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,290
America.

555
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:51,980
Okay.

556
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,910
We have standup where people write
their own stuff and we have anecdotes.

557
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,450
Sure.

558
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,490
And that's what we had like
little books with that.

559
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,440
And so when I say a joke,

560
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,660
people think that I was
doing from those books.

561
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,051
Yeah.

562
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,540
There's standup comedy and
then there's jokes like that.

563
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,121
People tell,

564
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,490
well we call them street jokes.

565
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:08,240
Three jokes.

566
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,620
Okay.

567
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,220
Would like to Jews walk into a bar.

568
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,183
That's,

569
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,930
those,

570
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,200
those jokes are so interesting because
I don't know anybody who's ever written

571
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,034
one of those jokes.

572
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,521
I don't,

573
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,001
I don't,

574
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:17,300
but,

575
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,290
but if you think about it,

576
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,280
that is a good time.

577
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,230
It's something that every time that I see,

578
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,440
like one of those good joke,

579
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,380
a good street joke,

580
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,011
I was like fuck,

581
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,270
I want it to be a fucking,

582
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,070
I want to meet to create that way.

583
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,401
Yeah.

584
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,210
But it's,

585
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,800
it's interesting cause there's so many
of them and no one knows anyone who wrote

586
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:34,540
them.

587
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,860
Those,

588
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,960
that was one guy in Brasilia was doing
those three chokes and he created like

589
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,720
10% of what he interesting.

590
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,800
But for him was like,

591
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,800
this is what I created.

592
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,310
Denied the 90% that I didn't create.

593
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,020
It's kind of in the same chunk.

594
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:52,430
I don't now when Seinfeld airs in Brazil,

595
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,250
I assume that it's translated
to Portuguese is dubbed.

596
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,143
It's done.

597
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,610
And when it's dubbed as a dubbed,

598
00:16:58,611 --> 00:16:59,750
well does it make sense?

599
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,403
No,

600
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:01,910
no,

601
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,151
no.

602
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,790
He does the jokes
translated standup wise now.

603
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,060
Now the series of works now,

604
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,160
now he got much better dubbing.

605
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,063
Got Much better.

606
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,720
Oh really?

607
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,650
But it's crazy.

608
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,210
We have subtitles as well.

609
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:18,560
Like my Netflix special has
subtitles here in America,

610
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,730
so subtitles for English.

611
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,991
Oh Wow.

612
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:22,160
So you do it in Portuguese.

613
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,680
Do you do much standup in English?

614
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,470
Having to send them here
for her for eight months,

615
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:31,620
like all the clubs and being three
Improv and a factory in and a,

616
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,020
but here I do it in English.

617
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,880
I don't even what I do on stage now
it's something that I wrote leaving here

618
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,230
like 80% and 20% I translated
for my acting Portuguese.

619
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,030
Wow.

620
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,240
And some of those jokes
don't work when I translate.

621
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,160
And it's always a surprise.

622
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,711
Yeah.

623
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:50,341
Wow.

624
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,151
Is a surprise.

625
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,410
Is the culture so different,

626
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:52,790
right.

627
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,530
It's like what people think is
funny and what they find ironic.

628
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,660
But Joe,

629
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,320
uh,

630
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,860
a joke is a joke man.

631
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,330
Yeah.

632
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,750
If he,

633
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,810
if he has a tiny,

634
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:01,151
if he,

635
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:05,760
if I now am able to do at the
same pace that I do in Portuguese,

636
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,800
I feel comfortable doing in English.

637
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,190
So I feel the same thing and it's easier
for me because I actually write jokes.

638
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,480
I have some friends that just like has
some crowd work and interact with the

639
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:22,740
audience and there's a lot
of physical comedy in it.

640
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,500
So to translate that to
English is difficult.

641
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,393
Yeah.

642
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,900
I write jokes so if I
translate it in a right way,

643
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,160
if he had,

644
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,900
if people understand the context,

645
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,110
if people understand that I'm talking
about like the pregnancy off my wife and

646
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:44,111
marriage and I dunno being single and
everything or maybe that he can work now.

647
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:45,961
When you,

648
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,840
what was it like the first time
you did stand up in America?

649
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,130
The first time in English,

650
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,450
I actually have a clip on Youtube
that the laugh factory bolstered.

651
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,420
Oh Wow.

652
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,350
He was,

653
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,090
he was very surprising.

654
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,420
It was very surprising because some
jokes that I didn't think was that funny

655
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:08,811
worked and the ones that I was actually
pretty sure that we work didn't work and

656
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:12,020
now it's so frustrating.

657
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,830
Completely lost men.

658
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:14,664
It was like,

659
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,530
is this is going to be a huge
role for me and I have been doing,

660
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
this is what I'm,

661
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,420
this is why I'm here to
stand up in English now.

662
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,910
What now stand up since it's been,

663
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:27,091
you know,

664
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:28,500
you said 16 years or so,

665
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,890
seniors in,

666
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,723
in Brazil.

667
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,690
Is it accepted now as it a
normal part of the culture?

668
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,080
Yeah.

669
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,180
Have they had comedy clubs open up yet.

670
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,320
I have Mike on the club members.

671
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Where is it is in some follow
comedians is a 300 seat place.

672
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,270
Just like the Improv.

673
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:50,271
Wow is a great place I have in Brazil
and there's enough local co comedy.

674
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.

675
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,720
Fill it up.

676
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,650
That's incredible.

677
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,580
It does not what I have like like
on a Saturday I have three pack,

678
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,590
chose 10 and midnight back shows
like I'm getting sound Paulo's huge,

679
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,691
huge,

680
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:04,320
huge city.

681
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,850
There's like 15 million people.

682
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:06,660
It's simple.

683
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,070
That's wow.

684
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,820
That's 15 million people live in simple.

685
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,570
It's so quick.

686
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,520
Only Portuguese.

687
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,413
Yeah.

688
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,040
There's no extent up in English in Brazil.

689
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:14,860
None.

690
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,660
Cause unfortunately that's not that many
people that speaks English in Brazil.

691
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,081
Yeah.

692
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,920
I know they were trying to organize shows
like jade was trying to get people to

693
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,930
come to Brazil to stand up and I was like,

694
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,943
good luck with that.

695
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,430
That just seems like there's,

696
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,080
it doesn't seem like
there's enough people.

697
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,670
Jade opened for me in Portuguese in Brazil
and she helps me a little bit at the

698
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:36,504
beginning here,

699
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,060
a opening San Clubs and
then getting me some gigs.

700
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:39,990
She's a very good friend.

701
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,591
And,

702
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,070
uh,

703
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,380
if for her it was a little
difficult in Portuguese.

704
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,041
Oh,

705
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,780
to translate English to Portuguese

706
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,590
forced because what you guys,

707
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,650
there's a coacher that there's
a standup culture here.

708
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,780
If you're this freaky in
a little crazy and he pee,

709
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,260
that's something that does not
translate to another country.

710
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,760
You have to actually write jokes.

711
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,230
Yeah.

712
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah.

713
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,041
And uh,

714
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,670
and for her it was a little
difficult because she,

715
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,400
she has this way of doing it,

716
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,730
like interacting in that she's like
any few mess up award in Portuguese.

717
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,610
It's in English.

718
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,840
If you mess up a word in English,

719
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,950
it's kind of funny.

720
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:21,131
Oh,

721
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:21,970
he's a foreigner.

722
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,201
Except you.

723
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,580
There's this likability.

724
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,800
But if I mess up or any Portuguese,

725
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,970
you're a prick.

726
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,930
You don't speak Portuguese.

727
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,010
I speak English.

728
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,540
It sounds bad.

729
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,680
And I see,

730
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:35,951
yeah,

731
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,641
that makes sense.

732
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,230
Because America is such a melting pot.

733
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,970
There's so many different
languages over here that someone,

734
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,841
well that's,

735
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,051
you know,

736
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,340
like I read something the other day,

737
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,710
like if you see someone and
they speak broken English,

738
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,340
uh,

739
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,091
don't make fun of them.

740
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:47,410
That means they speak two languages.

741
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,244
Yes,

742
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,060
yes.

743
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,820
And you don't,

744
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,560
of course most of us don't in
Portuguese is similar to Spanish.

745
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,870
So people who speaks
Portuguese speak Spanish.

746
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:57,330
So I kind of was between languages.

747
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,000
That's,

748
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,833
that's,

749
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,500
that's,

750
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,100
that's a lot.

751
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,780
Well that helped Fabrizio over doom in
Mexico because he's so fluent in Spanish

752
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,471
that,

753
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:05,681
you know,

754
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,940
when he was over there fighting,

755
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,420
you know,

756
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,081
they were like,

757
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:08,711
Holy Shit,

758
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,470
this guy speaks perfect Spanish.

759
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,490
She's from the same city that I am.

760
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:14,110
We should Paul Agnes here in the south.

761
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,960
So we kind of have some Spanish,

762
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:17,950
uh,

763
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,500
in the CD is close to two Argentina.

764
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,071
Oh,

765
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:21,904
I see.

766
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,410
It's kind of,

767
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,170
uh,

768
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,050
is our thing there.

769
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,671
Oh,

770
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:24,941
okay.

771
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:25,570
Cool.

772
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,570
So now when you were doing stand up and
you started to get in some trouble for

773
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,880
bits,

774
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,580
a lot of trouble,

775
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,413
there's a lot of trouble.

776
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,333
How much trouble?

777
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,641
Yeah,

778
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:37,211
a lot of money.

779
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,470
I spent a lot of money really,

780
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,400
as long as I lost a lot of sauces,

781
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,970
I lost a lot of lessons because of jokes.

782
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,470
Really.

783
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,303
Lawsuits.

784
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,000
So like who was suing you?

785
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,660
Uh,

786
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,460
the people who fell offended.

787
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,630
So people in the audience,

788
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:50,680
artists.

789
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,810
When I make fun of a celebrity,

790
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:53,644
they would sue you.

791
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,190
They can,

792
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,090
they can sue you and they can get
money out of really all the TV shows.

793
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:58,841
They can get up.

794
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,760
Politicians who sued you?

795
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:01,841
You know,

796
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,650
I got this,

797
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,400
uh,

798
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,300
this last,

799
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,210
so they really put me in trouble.

800
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,680
It was because of a singer.

801
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,281
It was,

802
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:13,030
she was a singer and a kind
of a almost kill my career.

803
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,140
You actually did.

804
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:14,891
That's why I'm here.

805
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,640
So no,

806
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,010
Eh,

807
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,341
yeah.

808
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:22,690
I got into a huge lawsuit and
it looks dumb when you explain,

809
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,811
oh,

810
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,680
it's just a singer.

811
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,740
But he became all this talk about freedom
of speech and what comedians can say

812
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,600
and what they cannot say.

813
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,060
Are you allowed to fewer fandom.

814
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,800
And now there's like law
schools talks about this,

815
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,300
the lawsuit that I had,

816
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,760
law school discussions,

817
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,030
discussions because of,

818
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,631
yeah,

819
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,040
because I made fun.

820
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,580
He was a shitty joke.

821
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,350
That's the problem.

822
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,370
You know,

823
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,300
he's not because of the losses.

824
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I want to be sued by the good ones
because I don't want to be known by a bad

825
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:56,421
joke.

826
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:56,661
Right,

827
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:56,830
right.

828
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,090
No,

829
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,621
of course.

830
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,100
Yeah.

831
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,140
It's just like I was saying
this and he's just like,

832
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:00,790
you were meeting,

833
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,440
uh,

834
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,970
Eddy Miller.

835
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,940
If you one of the greatest comedians ever,

836
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,371
they think,

837
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:04,910
oh,

838
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,200
there's doctor Doolittle.

839
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,640
You don't have that right now.

840
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,720
This is the same thing with me.

841
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,400
That joke was a shitty joke.

842
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,430
And she was like bragging on TV and
she was like doing a story on TV.

843
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,400
And I was the host of this huge TV show,

844
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,050
like the daily show,

845
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,510
the daily show meeting,

846
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,170
the view.

847
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,070
It was something like that.

848
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,330
And uh,

849
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,840
and in the middle of the thing,

850
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,470
she was shows there
and my friend asked me,

851
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:29,661
oh,

852
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,390
she's pregnant and do you
think she's still hot?

853
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:32,901
And I said,

854
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:37,901
she so hot that I would fuck her
in her baby and a shitty joke,

855
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,620
but that was live.

856
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:40,880
It was like right on time.

857
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,040
Everybody laughed and
there was no problem.

858
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,000
But next week it was this huge
thing because she was like,

859
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,140
her husband was very
influential show and uh,

860
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,140
her husband was managing run now do,

861
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,280
which was one of the
biggest soccer player ever.

862
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,110
So there was this whole thing,

863
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:05,111
the TV show lost sponsors and they want
to suspend me from the TV show because

864
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,460
the of a joke that I did,

865
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,020
she didn't tell them.

866
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,470
They didn't tell me to apologize at first,

867
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,520
but he suspended me.

868
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,990
So I quit the show.

869
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,581
They didn't know.

870
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,810
So you just apologize.

871
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:22,811
And I decided not to apologize because
I felt that after like 10 years,

872
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:25,010
don't stand there or 12
years doing stand up.

873
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:28,940
It was important for me to like
put my feet on the ground and say,

874
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:29,774
you know,

875
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,090
if we step back right now,

876
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,290
what am I,

877
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,590
what am I going to do in like a two years?

878
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:40,220
This is important for all of
us is important for comedy.

879
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,030
So I lost lasel to loss movies a lot.

880
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:44,960
So what did they,

881
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,890
what did they rule in the lawsuit?

882
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,050
Like what was the ruling?

883
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,990
I have friend that her honor.

884
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,380
Honor's,

885
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,641
yeah,

886
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:51,540
it was something like that.

887
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,380
She was like,

888
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,213
uh,

889
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,313
uh,

890
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,370
people can sue you.

891
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,490
The suing is part of the democracy.

892
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,690
It's okay to sue you,

893
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,720
but to lot lose a lawsuit
is that's the problem.

894
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,870
I lost like $150,000 or the sheet
but in Brazil was 350,000 high.

895
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,730
So if you're a lawyer and
you get $10,000 a month,

896
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,280
you get 10,000 leads a month.

897
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,651
So He's,

898
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,790
you don't translate money.

899
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So I lost a lot of money but the thing
has gotten me a huge headache and uh,

900
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,761
he was,

901
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:23,040
he was,

902
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,873
he was bad.

903
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,450
He was bad just from that
one just for that one.

904
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,710
But you saw other lawsuits
because of digital,

905
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,420
like a rape joke and uh,

906
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,570
I got like this women movement,

907
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:36,680
like trying to break,

908
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,630
break into my bar and break my,

909
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,120
the door of my comedy
club and there was like,

910
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,060
that was a,

911
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,190
but the discussion

912
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,470
was more important than
the problem itself.

913
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:51,471
I kind of find it was the discussion
about freedom of speech in that was,

914
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,650
that was huge.

915
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,930
What is freedom of speech like in Brazil?

916
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:55,890
Is it the same brick?

917
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,660
I mean obviously we have
the first amendment.

918
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,523
You have the first.

919
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,910
Do you have something that we don't,

920
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,200
we don't have that.

921
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,411
They don't,

922
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,460
they don't have that in Canada.

923
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,270
We don't have that.

924
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,040
I had Mike Ward on in Canada.

925
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,903
Do you know his story?

926
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,050
I know he's the guy who,

927
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,660
he made a joke about a sick boy.

928
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,350
The boy was still alive years later.

929
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,111
I thought it was.

930
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:17,130
And you know it was just a bad joke about
this guy still being alive and can he

931
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:17,964
get his money back?

932
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,780
Cause like,

933
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,740
cause they donated money.

934
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,410
It's,

935
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,510
it's fucked up joke but it's supposed
to be a fucked up joke and he's doing it

936
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,210
in a nightclub situation
where people are drinking,

937
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,330
you say things that are inappropriate
and that's the art form.

938
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,990
He got sued and he's still in
the process of it right now.

939
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,560
And there's another case in Vancouver
where these women were heckling,

940
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,030
they were yelling things out during the
show and then the comedian went on stage

941
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:45,990
and be rated the women and the
women's sued and won because a,

942
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:49,740
they were lesbians and he made some
lesbian jokes about them at their own

943
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:50,191
expense.

944
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:53,910
And so then they took him to court
and they won and they won what?

945
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,850
They want some judgment
where he had to pay them.

946
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,270
I want to change me.

947
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,921
How much was it?

948
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:01,650
I want to say it was somewhere
in the neighborhood of $30,000.

949
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,233
$30,000.

950
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,250
And for this gentleman,

951
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,180
this comedian,

952
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,451
uh,

953
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,560
I think that was a lot of money.

954
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,220
I don't know.

955
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,200
40 to $42,000.

956
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:10,380
Yeah.

957
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,500
That's a lot of fucking money
for an opening comedian.

958
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:13,790
I mean,

959
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,360
he wasn't a famous guy.

960
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,991
So you know,

961
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:18,480
that might be two years worth for him.

962
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,931
Who knows?

963
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:19,160
You know,

964
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,450
of course,

965
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,040
of course.

966
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,341
Yeah.

967
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,080
I lost a lot of money.

968
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,780
So Canada,

969
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,650
similar count.

970
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:25,980
Canada does not have freedom of speech
the same way the United States does.

971
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,720
Yeah.

972
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,150
That,

973
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,320
that's why,

974
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,250
uh,

975
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,360
I feel what I do comedy here and I feel
that people get uncomfortable about a

976
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,194
joke or two.

977
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,580
That's when I get stressed.

978
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,280
It's like you have the fee
that of saying those things.

979
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:38,940
Yes.

980
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,000
I have this joke that I say
it's about the n word as well.

981
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,010
I might have said maybe
I have to change my,

982
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,110
but I have this job that I do
is like when I arrived here,

983
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,560
uh,

984
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,400
someone said to me,

985
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:50,730
you know,

986
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,890
don't use the n word or people
are going to kick her ass.

987
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,050
But they never told me
what the n word was.

988
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,570
So for the past six months,

989
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:02,571
I have been avoiding all wars with the
letter n and the other big guy came up to

990
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:03,111
me and said,

991
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:03,990
can I fuck your ass?

992
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:04,824
And I was like,

993
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,833
maybe

994
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,030
when I say this jug is
like I have to set up,

995
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,800
it's crazy because when I first
did it was like a fucking thing.

996
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,180
Everybody got an uncomfortable.

997
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,043
Yeah.

998
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,730
But now I sat up as a misunderstanding
because I'm a foreigner.

999
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,540
Yes and no.

1000
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,770
I'm free to do everything.

1001
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:26,250
Yes.

1002
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,083
Yes.

1003
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,923
So I kind of,

1004
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,430
I found a way of doing it.

1005
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,460
He found a way in.

1006
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,150
Yeah.

1007
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,983
So that's,

1008
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,400
it's crazy.

1009
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,550
And I watched you a lot and
I see a lot of people here.

1010
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,721
I saw the other guy,

1011
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:40,554
this guy,

1012
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,620
this guy did an interview with you and
he did this show in a college and uh,

1013
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,720
he did a joke and people took
him out of State Nimesh Patel.

1014
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,530
Yeah.

1015
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.

1016
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,641
That's crazy.

1017
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,190
Because you built the freedom to do that.

1018
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,580
Yes.

1019
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,520
And now you're discussing if you can,

1020
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,070
or youthful cannot solely
in colleges though,

1021
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,680
when children today,

1022
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,030
and I want to call them children,

1023
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,580
they do not understand the danger
in suppressing free speech.

1024
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,980
And so they think that what they're
doing is by suppressing free speech and

1025
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,780
changing the way people communicate.

1026
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,720
What they're doing is making
the world a better place.

1027
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,331
They think they're,

1028
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:23,290
they're signaling the virtue and making
the world a better place at the same

1029
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:23,920
time.

1030
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,830
But it's just ignorant.

1031
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:26,500
So just don't understand that you can't,

1032
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:26,681
you,

1033
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:27,700
you can't necessarily,

1034
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,380
you can't control people.

1035
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,490
And to think that by just getting
upset and silencing someone,

1036
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:36,190
I'm removing them from the stage
at that ends the conversation.

1037
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:36,820
It doesn't,

1038
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,380
it reinforces their position.

1039
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,101
It says,

1040
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:39,401
okay,

1041
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:39,641
look,

1042
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:43,720
I was right about you fucking snowflakes
and you little babies like you,

1043
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,720
you can't even understand why when
things are uncomfortable that it doesn't

1044
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,070
necessarily mean it's negative.

1045
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,390
And that like you're like try
to put yourself in someone's
position and see what

1046
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:52,900
he's saying.

1047
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,860
And in the Meshes Kit,

1048
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,743
this case,

1049
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,080
it's actually kinda funny,

1050
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:56,471
first of all,

1051
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,840
he's very open minded guy,

1052
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,010
very progressive.

1053
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,341
He's,

1054
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,920
he's not in any way a racist.

1055
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,950
And his joke was that people
say that being gay is a choice.

1056
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,161
And he said,

1057
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,130
I know it's not a choice because I
have a friend who's black and gay.

1058
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,410
There's no way he would
choose both of those things.

1059
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,370
And it was just double up
this just him being funny.

1060
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,950
It's a funny joke and they,

1061
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:21,040
they will like cut,

1062
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,020
get the fuck off the stage.

1063
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:23,801
Like what?

1064
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:24,251
Come on man.

1065
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:25,240
You don't think that's funny.

1066
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,620
And it's also coming from an Indian
man who I'm sure is experienced racism.

1067
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,371
So the,

1068
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:35,371
the whole thing is it's very fascinating
to see young kids who are growing up in

1069
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,140
this PC culture bubble and you don't,

1070
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:40,900
and sometimes people say on this
podcast that we talk about it too much.

1071
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,441
It may be there.

1072
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,274
Correct.

1073
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,160
Maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're
listening to your cubicle and you hear

1074
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,420
me talking too much about this,

1075
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,870
but it's because it's an issue that's
very dear to my heart cause I understand

1076
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,430
the dangers of not being
able to communicate freely
and I also and understand

1077
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:00,640
what happens when if you
suppress free communication,

1078
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,020
the people that you're suppressing,

1079
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:06,610
they're going to get more and more angry
and radical and it just makes their

1080
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:11,611
position that they feel more justified
in there in perhaps even people who are

1081
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:16,840
racists could perhaps be more racist or
people who are angry about gay people

1082
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,050
will become more angry about it if
you suppress their ability to express

1083
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:20,440
himself.

1084
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,440
That's when borns those little
movements and neo Nazi movements,

1085
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,570
a little groups and then
little blips on the web,

1086
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,100
the deep web when discussion.

1087
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,240
It's like when you in,

1088
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,900
when it's for beating I think is you
kind of forgive them the power that they

1089
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:32,734
didn't have.

1090
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,431
I think so.

1091
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,550
And I think this is something that we
were really just getting to understand.

1092
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,090
Now,

1093
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,331
you know,

1094
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:37,631
I have,

1095
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,480
I've had a few conversations about this
recently with the head of Twitter and

1096
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,321
with a,

1097
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,330
an independent journalist
Tim pool last week.

1098
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:47,420
And I think what people were just
starting to kind of understand,

1099
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,770
even though everyone's
uncomfortable about this,

1100
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:51,650
is we're still trying to figure this out.

1101
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,740
Social media is only 10 plus years old.

1102
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:58,100
This is an incredibly new experience
for us and I don't think everybody knows

1103
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,210
exactly how to proceed.

1104
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,930
And this idea that you could just band
people and they just banned people for

1105
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,291
life.

1106
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,060
If they say something that
makes people uncomfortable,

1107
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,740
if they say an opinion
you don't agree with,

1108
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,850
banned them for life.

1109
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,890
And we're saying we're
experiencing that right now.

1110
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,700
And,

1111
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,450
uh,

1112
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,210
we're trying to figure
out what to do and how to,

1113
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,810
how to fix this and how to mitigate
it without endorsing people,

1114
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,880
harassing people and divorcing people.

1115
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,450
Uh,

1116
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,721
you know,

1117
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:23,450
threatening people and giving out their
address and their phone number and

1118
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,284
things along those lines.

1119
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,041
So it's,

1120
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,540
it's a process that we're,

1121
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,650
we're all going through right now.

1122
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,730
It is a learning process for the,

1123
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:30,071
the,

1124
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:30,840
the,

1125
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,551
the whole country.

1126
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:36,551
But the thing that a noise
annoys me a little bit is that I,

1127
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,520
I leave it in another country and I see
how things are difficult and how much

1128
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,070
time I spent explaining to
people what I was doing.

1129
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,301
And for you guys,

1130
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,260
it's like I was having the same problems
that Lenny Bruce was having like a long

1131
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,050
time ago.

1132
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,883
Yes.

1133
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,540
You guys built that to
have that discussion.

1134
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,374
It's like,

1135
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,860
it is important because
that's the way the ward uh,

1136
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,843
evolved.

1137
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,110
But at the same time,

1138
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:04,490
he fuels old.

1139
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,920
It feels old because you
understand the history of it.

1140
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,520
In America it feels old because a,

1141
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,110
you already have that
discussion a long time ago.

1142
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:12,860
You know,

1143
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,790
you couldn't keep having this conversation
when you think that you'll finally,

1144
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,190
if you free to say whatever you want now,

1145
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,960
there's people trying to hold you back.

1146
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:21,800
It's crazy.

1147
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,401
Well,

1148
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:24,800
it's not really effective.

1149
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,431
See there's,

1150
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,780
there's people that are angry about it.

1151
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:26,961
I mean,

1152
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,330
there is on social media,

1153
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,300
there's certainly people that
are being effective with it,

1154
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,170
but in standup comedy it's,

1155
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,820
there's blow back and push back.

1156
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:39,710
But it's not very effective.

1157
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,850
Like for the top guys,

1158
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:44,120
for guys like Dave
Chappelle and Bill Burr,

1159
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:44,331
it's,

1160
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:48,200
it actually makes their standup better
because people are so tired of all this

1161
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:48,830
shit.

1162
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,630
They're so tired of PC culture.

1163
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:54,740
They're so tired of being told what they
should and shouldn't think is funny and

1164
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,720
what is acceptable and not acceptable.

1165
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,531
And you know,

1166
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:57,920
there's,

1167
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,170
there's a lot of weird
shit going on right now.

1168
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,670
Did you ever have problem with that?

1169
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,591
Oh yeah.

1170
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,830
Did someone ever leave your
show because of a joke?

1171
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:05,360
Who did it?

1172
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,100
Oh fuck,

1173
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,960
what was the subject?

1174
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:07,151
I'm like,

1175
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:07,431
God,

1176
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:09,980
I don't even remember him so many times.

1177
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,780
It's happened so many times.

1178
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:12,740
Yeah.

1179
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,180
I mean people just get angry.

1180
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,890
They get angry and you're allowed to,

1181
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,060
you mean it's fun?

1182
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:18,770
It's,

1183
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,520
look,

1184
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,380
everybody has their own
sensibilities and the problem,

1185
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:25,820
one of the problems with standup comedy
is if you go to a club to see music,

1186
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:27,890
you know what kind of
music going to go see?

1187
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:29,000
You want to go see salsa,

1188
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,020
they have a salsa club,

1189
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,370
you want to go see jazz,

1190
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,100
you want to go see rock and roll
or you want to go to a rap show.

1191
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,210
You know what you're,

1192
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,320
you're going to see.

1193
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,890
But if you go to see comedy,

1194
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
you could see fucking Barry
Manilow followed by guns
and roses fall by run DMC.

1195
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,400
I mean it's,

1196
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:44,820
it's,

1197
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,653
it's,

1198
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,960
unless you're going to
see a specific comedian,

1199
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:50,820
like you're going to see Jim Gaffigan,

1200
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,730
you don't necessarily know what
the fuck you're going to see.

1201
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,670
You go to the comedy store on sunset,

1202
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,080
you're going to see if you get there at
nine o'clock and stay til two o'clock in

1203
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:01,251
the Morn,

1204
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,990
you're going to see 10 15
different fucking comedians.

1205
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,790
And they're all different.

1206
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,541
And you know,

1207
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,530
some of them are men,

1208
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,500
some of them are women and some of them
are gay and some of them were black.

1209
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,410
And they all have different points of
view and some of them you're going to

1210
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:14,850
think of the best and
some of them you think,

1211
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,121
oh,

1212
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,200
when is this guy getting offstage?

1213
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,371
I mean that's just,

1214
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,204
that's just part of it.

1215
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,163
But for us,

1216
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,770
what's really important about
that is that when I worked there,

1217
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:23,060
I,

1218
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,250
I know that it's not my crowd.

1219
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,720
There are everyone's crowd.

1220
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,991
See,

1221
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:29,070
if I go to do a show,

1222
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:31,740
if I do a show somewhere
and San Diego say,

1223
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,940
and I advertise it,

1224
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,601
the people that come,

1225
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,180
they bought a ticket
to see meets your cro.

1226
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,551
Yes,

1227
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,720
but if I go to the comedy store,

1228
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,810
they might be there to see Neil
Brennan or Chris Delea or whoever

1229
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:40,961
chew your crowd.

1230
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:41,590
Joe.

1231
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,940
Some of them are the comedy store.

1232
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,930
They steal your crowd.

1233
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,561
They steal,

1234
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:45,041
they steal.

1235
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,060
We went there to watch you.

1236
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:46,894
They know who you are.

1237
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,290
If you go to maybe the middle of Utah,

1238
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,480
they are not going to know like was great.

1239
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,590
You'd be surprised.

1240
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:54,100
Yeah.

1241
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,510
Wiseguys comic grasp.

1242
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:56,680
Shout out to Salt Lake City.

1243
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,460
Oh yeah.

1244
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,690
I lived in Nebraska,

1245
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:01,230
so I couldn't imagine
someone lived in Nebraska.

1246
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,060
That's what I,

1247
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,810
they gave me a scholarship to
play basketball and Jesus Christ.

1248
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,550
It wasn't that good.

1249
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,630
I got to NCAA division two school.

1250
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,700
Those he was,

1251
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,720
he was crazy because I had a
chance to meet the American people.

1252
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,320
It's not that people who
leaves in [inaudible] New York,

1253
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,101
that's different.

1254
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:26,101
I remember farmers farmers and I was like
hanging around with black guys because

1255
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,430
there was my people that was,

1256
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:28,540
I was a foreigner.

1257
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,900
We were minorities and they
were playing basketball with me.

1258
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,900
So I fell [inaudible] it's a completely
different experience living in Nebraska.

1259
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:37,781
He was,

1260
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:38,081
he was,

1261
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:38,710
he was awesome.

1262
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,543
How'd you get out?

1263
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,670
Uh,

1264
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,581
did you walk?

1265
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:42,610
I actually,

1266
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,083
no,

1267
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,760
I got injured.

1268
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,843
Uh,

1269
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,460
I got into a fight man,

1270
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:49,450
and I broke my joy,

1271
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,284
my cheekbone.

1272
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,040
No Way.

1273
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,470
A fight playing basketball on the court.

1274
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,460
He was still fight a lot.

1275
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:55,294
I was fucking,

1276
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,513
I didn't,

1277
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,041
I don't know.

1278
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,270
I'm not proud of that age.

1279
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,770
But I used to fight a lot.

1280
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,360
I like to fight,

1281
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,610
but I never knew how,

1282
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,503
how do it,

1283
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,110
which is crazy cause you're Brazilian.

1284
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:05,590
Yeah.

1285
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,900
And you know where,

1286
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,740
but when an alley Tudos started,

1287
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,860
it's where it Brazilian jujitsu started.

1288
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,570
I always wold fights,

1289
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,140
but the one that I lost,

1290
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:19,141
I broke my cheekbone and my jaw and I
had to do surgery here and the surgery

1291
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:21,460
went bad.

1292
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,240
Oh No.

1293
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,901
Because,

1294
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:23,734
uh,

1295
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,430
it's crazy.

1296
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,241
That's the specific,

1297
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:30,241
but they don't have a doctor who does
mouth and bones at the same time.

1298
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,730
They have a neck and mouth
doctor and the a dentist,

1299
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,440
they don't have the one who does both.

1300
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,320
This is the doctor that,

1301
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,950
that time or at that place.

1302
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,380
So the surgery went wrong.

1303
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:47,440
I had to go back to Brazil and
I had to do the surgery again.

1304
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,130
Oh No.

1305
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,821
And uh,

1306
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,200
and I decided not to come back.

1307
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,030
So this is how,

1308
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,000
this is why this moment
for me is very important.

1309
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,081
Uh,

1310
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:57,430
I never thought that I had,

1311
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,780
my dream was to play basketball.

1312
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,940
That's what I was dedicating my life,

1313
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:01,860
uh,

1314
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,290
for.

1315
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,070
And uh,

1316
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,400
I never thought that I will
have a second chance in America.

1317
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:07,250
And this is,

1318
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,500
that's it.

1319
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:08,920
That's the,

1320
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,940
my second chance,

1321
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,110
and I can mess this up.

1322
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:16,120
So what made you come from Brazil
to America for standup comedy?

1323
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,350
It was all the lawsuits.

1324
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,940
He was a little bit of the lawsuits.

1325
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,380
I'm not saying that it was not,

1326
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:21,190
but my friend,

1327
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,700
it's like if you want to play basketball,

1328
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,110
do you want to play in the NBA?

1329
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,710
Right?

1330
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,600
If you want to play soccer,

1331
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:30,070
you want to go to Barcelona.

1332
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,180
Uh,

1333
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,200
standups is here,

1334
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:32,501
man.

1335
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,570
That's the place that you get a B.

1336
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,800
And we never had a Brazilian
standup comedian in,

1337
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:39,270
in,

1338
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,103
in here,

1339
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,730
just like jade are the
ones who were born here,

1340
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:46,870
but not the ones who actually was like
doing standup in Brazil and coming here.

1341
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,130
I think it was important for me,

1342
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,540
for all my colleagues and all my,

1343
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,290
all the comedians in Brazil as
well to start something here.

1344
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,930
He has been a very good experience.

1345
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:56,764
A little hard.

1346
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,610
Yeah.

1347
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,290
But it has been a lot of,

1348
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,100
a lot of fun as well.

1349
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,600
Now are you working over here?

1350
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:04,210
Did you save up money and you live it
off your money for you still have my

1351
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:05,080
comedy club there.

1352
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:05,590
I saved,

1353
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,131
I saved some,

1354
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:06,880
I got some money.

1355
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,170
Yeah.

1356
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:07,600
Yeah,

1357
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,830
I lost some of those losses.

1358
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,420
I kept some job.

1359
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,380
Fuck.

1360
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,510
But I'm saying you're not
working here necessarily.

1361
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm just like going and doing standup.

1362
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,930
I'm focusing on standup.

1363
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,930
I have my agent and I have management
and everything is happening.

1364
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:22,570
I,

1365
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,690
last year I did JFL I'm handling it.

1366
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,010
I'm handling your some clubs right now
because in those places that has like a

1367
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,270
huge Brazilian community.

1368
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,840
Okay.

1369
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm doing an English,

1370
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,360
but I'm a throw a little
Portuguese in there with them.

1371
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,553
Yeah.

1372
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,970
So that's,

1373
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:39,810
that's new man.

1374
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,653
It's,

1375
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,060
I did everything that I
wanted to do in Brazil.

1376
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,010
I did a talk show,

1377
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,080
I did movies,

1378
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,760
I did in my old series.

1379
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,210
I directed a movie director,

1380
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,240
the Cedars and I thought
it was like I'm 42,

1381
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,270
it's time for me to try something new.

1382
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,580
That's why I came here and
I'm using my son about that.

1383
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,070
That's the bad part.

1384
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:00,820
But that's okay.

1385
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,271
Yeah,

1386
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,040
we were talking about that before.

1387
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,933
That is a,

1388
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,390
that's a crazy situation
is a very emotional,

1389
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,760
bringing my kids there.

1390
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:09,971
And,

1391
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:10,270
uh,

1392
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,340
last time that I was
leaving and he was like,

1393
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,980
you find the most important in your life.

1394
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,830
Why are you searching for
something so far away?

1395
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,450
And I thought,

1396
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,080
and I told him,

1397
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,890
this is important,

1398
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,330
this is very important for me,

1399
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,680
but it is selfish.

1400
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,370
This is something that I wanted to do
and for my career was important because I

1401
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:30,304
didn't,

1402
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,050
I don't,

1403
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,950
I lost a lot in my country.

1404
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,710
Well,

1405
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,130
with the lawsuits in the last TV shows,

1406
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:36,980
I lost a lot.

1407
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,210
I lost money.

1408
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,550
I thought was a little dangerous
for me to keep doing it over there.

1409
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,170
And I got a death threat.

1410
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,970
There was that made me a little dinner
and I didn't actually went public to talk

1411
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,080
about the death threat.

1412
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,000
And as the death threat over,

1413
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:50,991
he was,

1414
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,800
because one of my last suits,

1415
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,050
I cannot be that specific
because it was an open.

1416
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,020
So if I say exactly who he was,

1417
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,400
now be sued again,

1418
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,060
right.

1419
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,800
Because,

1420
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,160
uh,

1421
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,770
you know,

1422
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,101
yeah,

1423
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:04,920
I'm sort of gate,

1424
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,753
I'll be,

1425
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,470
uh,

1426
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,050
offending someone's order because I,

1427
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,110
but I knew what happened and I felt I
didn't feel safe there for a little bit.

1428
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,910
I'm not saying that a runaway,

1429
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,540
but I can't seem smart to come over here
and spend some time and build something

1430
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,080
and uh,

1431
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,520
and maybe be here.

1432
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,000
It was,

1433
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
it was hard for me that I could get
hurt because of the nature of my job.

1434
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,610
Now when you're over here and
you're trying to do standup,

1435
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:34,761
do you,

1436
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,540
are you,

1437
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,550
do you structure your act out?

1438
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,400
Do you have like how do you do it?

1439
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,530
Do you write it out on
paper or on a computer?

1440
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:44,660
Do you put it up on this thing over here?

1441
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Put it on your phone every year and then
I keep rehearsing and I go on stage and

1442
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:52,250
a half to two and I say it,

1443
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,241
that's what I do.

1444
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:56,000
I memorize everything
that I'm going to say.

1445
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,850
Not Everything but a,

1446
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,380
it gets natural.

1447
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,670
It's the way you do it.

1448
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,090
Yeah.

1449
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,210
Just memorize everything that I'm going
to write because if I mess up a word or

1450
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:05,451
two,

1451
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:10,370
I can kill a joke and I want
everything to work flawlessly.

1452
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,380
So that's why I memorize.

1453
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,030
It looks natural,

1454
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:15,410
but I memorize everything.

1455
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:19,190
But it's very hard for me to interact
with the audience because every time

1456
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:20,240
there's someone like hack,

1457
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,830
call me all jokes,

1458
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,750
all jokes comes in Portuguese in my head

1459
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,870
and I have to translate.

1460
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:27,141
Right,

1461
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:27,381
right,

1462
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:27,710
right,

1463
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,041
right.

1464
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,360
At the time and I lose time.

1465
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,650
He's very frustrating.

1466
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,633
Oh yeah.

1467
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,680
And I even say this on stage,

1468
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,400
like I was doing a show
the other day and this guy,

1469
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:35,871
he just scream,

1470
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:36,500
you suck.

1471
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,830
It was like a batch or was a bar
show and what I say to order when it,

1472
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,090
when I am stressed out,

1473
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,100
I just mess up words
and now always happened.

1474
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,001
And he was like,

1475
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:44,271
you said,

1476
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:45,950
I wanted to say go fuck yourself.

1477
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:46,281
And I said,

1478
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,670
gonna fuck myself.

1479
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,700
Look at me like fuck yourself.

1480
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,910
It's very hard to interact with you.

1481
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,180
Also,

1482
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,910
most tiny man is difficult
to do it in another language.

1483
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:00,020
It's not my natural thing.

1484
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,400
So everything's on your phone.

1485
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,860
You don't write it on a
computer or a notebook.

1486
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:04,910
You write on a computer?

1487
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,893
Yeah.

1488
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,071
Yeah.

1489
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:11,000
I ran into computer because I can
write and it's easier to type.

1490
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,470
It's first of all,

1491
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:13,370
it's a bigger right.

1492
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:16,910
You're looking at a big 15 inch screen
and I can type without looking at my

1493
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:20,480
fingers and so when I have ideas I can
get them out really quick and I don't

1494
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:21,314
have to say them.

1495
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,700
I just look at it on the screen and then
I'll write many versions of it and then

1496
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:29,570
I go over it and I smoke a little
weed and then start editing,

1497
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,960
twisting it around.

1498
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,600
That's the first word.

1499
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,560
What I basically do is I get it to a point
where I know that I have something to

1500
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:38,160
talk about.

1501
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,850
I know I have a framework and I know
where there's some punchlines and then I

1502
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,730
write it out on paper so that
when I write it down on paper,

1503
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,350
I can see it better in my head.

1504
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,400
I remember it better.

1505
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,860
Then I bring it to the stage,

1506
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,950
but I don't have a rigid structure.

1507
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:56,700
I loose with it because I want to
be able to feel it in the moment,

1508
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:57,750
whether or not this is good.

1509
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,410
Perfect.

1510
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:58,681
You know?

1511
00:44:58,681 --> 00:44:59,910
So when I go onstage,

1512
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,601
I was like,

1513
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,390
say if I'm doing a joke about a coffee,

1514
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,543
whatever,

1515
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,281
I I'll,

1516
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:05,761
I'll go,

1517
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:06,594
you know,

1518
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,280
I drink too much fucking coffee.

1519
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:10,620
I've got a real problem and here's
how I know I have a problem.

1520
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,050
And then I'll go into it and then I'll
start talking about all the different

1521
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:15,940
EHRs and then I'll listen to
the recording and I'll go,

1522
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:16,710
that part sucks.

1523
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,950
I got to fix this part and this part
is stupid and this part is sloppy.

1524
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,240
But that part got a laugh.

1525
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:21,931
Okay.

1526
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:22,591
But you know what?

1527
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:24,690
It'd be even funnier if I said it clearer.

1528
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,640
Like maybe I need to say it this way,

1529
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,241
you know?

1530
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,200
And then I'll just,

1531
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,050
and then it's this constant
process of writing,

1532
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,430
writing it out,

1533
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,110
going on stage,

1534
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,100
live recording,

1535
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:35,760
all sets,

1536
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,130
listening to the recording
and then writing again.

1537
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,240
Do you,

1538
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,870
uh,

1539
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,820
when you listen to those sets,

1540
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,980
do you keep the funny ones or is there
sometime they should do like a funny

1541
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:47,221
joke,

1542
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,180
but you don't like it?

1543
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,150
Does that happen to some type of thing?

1544
00:45:50,151 --> 00:45:50,390
Yeah,

1545
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,620
yeah.

1546
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,453
Yeah.

1547
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:51,970
I don't,

1548
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,240
it's,

1549
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,840
it's,

1550
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,020
it's fuel ship.

1551
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:54,970
Cheap.

1552
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:55,390
Cheap.

1553
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:55,630
Yeah.

1554
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,280
Yeah.

1555
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,330
But he was funny.

1556
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:57,960
You're like,

1557
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,741
you've got to laugh,

1558
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:00,060
but it's not good.

1559
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,481
Yeah.

1560
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:01,111
That's sure.

1561
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:01,381
Yeah.

1562
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:01,951
Absolutely.

1563
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:02,070
Yeah.

1564
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,570
You've got to be careful that you don't,

1565
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,190
he don't want to be a hack,

1566
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,731
you know?

1567
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:06,161
That's what,

1568
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:07,410
that's what a hack is.

1569
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:12,411
Someone who tells like obvious stupid
jokes that only make dumb people laugh or

1570
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:13,621
someone who does.

1571
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:15,240
I'm tired.

1572
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,100
Beaten down material.

1573
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,780
Like the jokes that you know,

1574
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:20,100
that other people have done already.

1575
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,070
You know,

1576
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,080
you to know that you just
would know based on your,

1577
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:25,441
okay.

1578
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:25,621
Like,

1579
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:27,600
here's a perfect example that Stephen Fry,

1580
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:27,721
do.

1581
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:27,901
You know,

1582
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:28,734
Stephen Fry says,

1583
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,041
yes,

1584
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:29,874
this is a famous comedian.

1585
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,650
He used this recently.

1586
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,491
He said,

1587
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:32,760
uh,

1588
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,600
something about,

1589
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:33,900
uh,

1590
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,320
I would,

1591
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,980
I would love to come back to
life as a drug sniffing dog.

1592
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:38,851
You know,

1593
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:41,160
could you imagine being a drug
sniffing dog at the airport?

1594
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,180
Just smelling everything.

1595
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,100
Ah,

1596
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,530
AH,

1597
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,220
getting high.

1598
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:49,220
Like he was saying about how that
is such an obvious stupid joke.

1599
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:50,910
It's so many people have done that.

1600
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:56,270
And that's a joke where man I bet
probably hundreds of comedians are doing,

1601
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,240
don't joke about that.

1602
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,220
It's just like an obvious premise.

1603
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,570
And you know,

1604
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:04,050
like you were saying earlier
that sometimes people
would say jokes that you've

1605
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,910
said and you,

1606
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:06,151
you're,

1607
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,140
you have a hard time explaining.

1608
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:08,280
That's my joke.

1609
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,910
And to them it's just an anecdote or
then it's just something funny that they

1610
00:47:11,911 --> 00:47:12,540
heard.

1611
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,540
Sometimes people go on stage and their
act consists of really obvious premises

1612
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,580
that they have probably already
heard someone covered before.

1613
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:21,270
That's a hack.

1614
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,571
Yeah.

1615
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:23,490
That's why it's difficult.

1616
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,120
Uh,

1617
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,890
there's a huge challenge for me
because I have been doing for 17 years,

1618
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,010
but in another country,

1619
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,020
so you guys,

1620
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,370
you guys,

1621
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,420
there's a huge role that
you guys already followed.

1622
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,090
So if you hear something about that's old,

1623
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,160
maybe for me it's not right.

1624
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,050
And I don't want to be that guy in,

1625
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,720
in what I realize is that people
don't point that out to you.

1626
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,081
Well,

1627
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:51,040
you could ask people.

1628
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:51,690
Yeah,

1629
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:51,941
yeah.

1630
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,200
If you're friends with comics,

1631
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,070
like okay,

1632
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:54,730
you could ask.

1633
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,150
Okay.

1634
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,980
And they'll tell you.

1635
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,590
Yeah.

1636
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:56,831
Yeah.

1637
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:57,491
That's why,

1638
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:58,150
uh,

1639
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,960
like a the other day this guy was doing
a joke and I kind of thought about,

1640
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:02,230
uh,

1641
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,000
uh,

1642
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,520
uh,

1643
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,070
taglines,

1644
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,591
a tagline.

1645
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,424
Yeah.

1646
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,510
And he got uncomfortable for me,

1647
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:08,960
like telling he all of this,

1648
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:09,821
what about this?

1649
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:10,301
And feels was like,

1650
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:11,134
yeah,

1651
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,003
it will,

1652
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:12,881
it's difficult,

1653
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:14,060
man to connect with comedians.

1654
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,690
It's not that easy because
they all have huge problems.

1655
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,331
They all have.

1656
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:19,164
And Man,

1657
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,710
I was like in a group of guys,

1658
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,990
one was like ex drug addict and the,

1659
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,170
the ones was a drunk and they had
like huge problems and I was like,

1660
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:27,670
I have friends.

1661
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,143
I don't

1662
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:32,920
go,

1663
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,191
man.

1664
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:33,760
Yeah.

1665
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,571
You got to be like,

1666
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:34,811
Oh,

1667
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:39,460
you've got a jeep and you've got a
fucking goal into the bottom to search for

1668
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,330
something good.

1669
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,010
And I understand this process,

1670
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:42,970
but at the same time,

1671
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,540
do I really have to go through
all that to come with them?

1672
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,380
Something Great.

1673
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,711
No,

1674
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:49,540
you don't get ideas.

1675
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:50,800
And this crystal,

1676
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,470
Leah actually has a bit about
that I don't want to do as bit,

1677
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:57,310
but it's basically a bit about how good
his childhood was and how close he is

1678
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:57,941
with his family.

1679
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:01,180
And everybody thinks that you have to
have a fucked up childhood to be Canadian.

1680
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,250
Eh,

1681
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:02,891
it's not true.

1682
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:03,850
You just have to be funny.

1683
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,680
People are funny for different reasons.

1684
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:07,690
Some people are funny because
they always enjoy standup.

1685
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,321
I mean if you,

1686
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,770
if you grow up in joining standup comedy
and then become a standup comedian,

1687
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,880
there's nothing wrong with that.

1688
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,860
You don't have to be a drug addict.

1689
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,023
Do you?

1690
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,010
And I,

1691
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,040
and I'm not going to be because I tried,

1692
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:20,850
uh,

1693
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:21,683
Marie,

1694
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,113
yeah.

1695
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:29,250
Once two years ago and I stayed hide
for 14 days straight of God's man.

1696
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,110
Did you eat it 14 days.

1697
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:35,170
And I dunno if smoke
it wasn't a vaporizer.

1698
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:35,520
Is that,

1699
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,830
yeah,

1700
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,291
vaporize.

1701
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:36,941
Vaporize it.

1702
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:37,774
Yeah.

1703
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:42,440
And I say hi for 14 days and
I thought it doesn't right.

1704
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,270
It doesn't.

1705
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:43,931
I wasn't high.

1706
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:44,650
Right.

1707
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,630
Well I really wasn't the second day,

1708
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,464
right like it,

1709
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,110
but I thought it was like
disconnected from reality.

1710
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,440
Well sometimes that does happen and I
know a story about a guy who is a straight

1711
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:59,080
laced guy who took some marijuana edibles
so that he could get to sleep and he

1712
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,940
had a real problem.

1713
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Like he got suicidal and freaked out
and became just irrationally anxious.

1714
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:12,570
He had crippling anxiety and some time
for some time for weeks and he's a

1715
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:15,790
confident guy and a very handsome,

1716
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,320
big muscular guy.

1717
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:20,350
Like he just like you would never
imagine this guy have any antianxiety.

1718
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,180
I think some people have just the
chemistry of different individuals.

1719
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,070
I wasn't bar for that and that's
what the doctor told me because

1720
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,180
I went to the psychiatrist.

1721
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,141
Wow,

1722
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:30,974
you went to sleep.

1723
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,110
I swear to God,

1724
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,460
I'm dead week.

1725
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,990
That week I went to the psych guy
through smell and I told him no,

1726
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:43,280
I smoked that thing like 14
days ago and I still high in.

1727
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,680
He looked at me and he gave me some,

1728
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,440
some cycle one,

1729
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,170
he gave me some pills and I was like,

1730
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:51,500
Oh,

1731
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,200
if you stay high until tomorrow,

1732
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,110
take these pills.

1733
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,580
Because what he told me,

1734
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:00,581
it's something that I didn't know that
he can be a trigger if you're has some

1735
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:04,610
tendencies of his
schizophrenia and a psychopath,

1736
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:05,900
or if you have,

1737
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,280
which was not my case.

1738
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,870
And He's told this is very rare,

1739
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:09,740
but it can happen,

1740
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,090
which is not your case.

1741
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:11,400
And I,

1742
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,400
it was happy because of the up and the
next day I was okay and I felt okay and I

1743
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,520
did and took the pills and it was crazy,

1744
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,010
man.

1745
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,020
Fuck crazy.

1746
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:21,830
And I remember that I,

1747
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,450
I decided to record it,

1748
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:24,500
but I was like,

1749
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:24,950
okay,

1750
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,640
let me,

1751
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,920
let me record what I'm thinking.

1752
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,990
At least let's get some
good experience out of it.

1753
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,690
And I remembered that it
started to record and I said,

1754
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,360
now I'm going to record
everything that I'm thinking.

1755
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:37,160
And when I look at the cell phone,

1756
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,120
it was 45 minutes,

1757
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,750
45 minutes of talking.

1758
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,910
And I didn't even realize I just said
that I'm going to record now and there was

1759
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:47,390
45 minutes and when I listen
to like 15 days after that,

1760
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,350
I was like,

1761
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,011
I'm so crazy.

1762
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:49,844
I'm so crazy.

1763
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,403
Crazy.

1764
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,753
I'm gonna die.

1765
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,340
I'm never going to understand that.

1766
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,430
My son's talking.

1767
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:55,651
Oh,

1768
00:51:55,651 --> 00:51:57,380
there's my son talking to me right now.

1769
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,730
Wow.

1770
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,160
That was one hit of available.

1771
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:00,950
No,

1772
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,760
it was more than one a budget hit.

1773
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,830
It was a bunch.

1774
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:04,220
Oh,

1775
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,120
you're too tall.

1776
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:05,721
You're big.

1777
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,240
You're like a 250 pounds.

1778
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:10,100
So fucking use it a lot.

1779
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,341
Oh,

1780
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,290
so they were saying keep
hitting it because you're tall.

1781
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,550
Because I wasn't feeling it.

1782
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,690
Oh No.

1783
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:15,800
But when I felt it,

1784
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,030
I felt for 14

1785
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:18,940
people.

1786
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,640
That's one of the big problems
with people when they first try,

1787
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,610
they tried too much.

1788
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,141
That's what happened.

1789
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:24,291
Yeah.

1790
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,640
Someone just says take another hit.

1791
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,630
It is a happy man.

1792
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,201
I tell people,

1793
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:29,330
if you thinking about trying
marijuana going there a little bit,

1794
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:30,703
that's it.

1795
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:31,491
I don't feel anything.

1796
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:32,150
Shut the fuck up.

1797
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,983
Leave it alone.

1798
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,560
It'll.

1799
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,210
You'll eventually feel
something that's done for,

1800
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:35,680
yeah,

1801
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,513
it's leave it alone.

1802
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,401
That's crazy,

1803
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:37,760
man.

1804
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,630
There's so many people selling
weeds and stuff in there.

1805
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,650
This is not even cool anymore.

1806
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:43,903
Weed's not cool.

1807
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,233
I don't know.

1808
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:47,180
It's like people are suffering.

1809
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,140
When I do shows,

1810
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,430
there's a lot of people
talk about why this book,

1811
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:50,870
this and his mouth that he was like,

1812
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:51,681
man,

1813
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,670
it's legal now.

1814
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:54,790
Juice.

1815
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,510
It's not dangerous and I think it's good.

1816
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,111
He has to be.

1817
00:52:57,111 --> 00:52:57,560
There you go.

1818
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:57,820
Yeah.

1819
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,940
Well it definitely should be.

1820
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,580
It doesn't affect me that way for me.

1821
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:03,050
I've been smoking in a long time.

1822
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:03,884
It's pretty easy.

1823
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,520
I just chills me out.

1824
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,200
Makes me,

1825
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,400
it actually makes me nicer.

1826
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,100
It makes me like a more calm person.

1827
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:10,940
Does that makes more,

1828
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:12,710
more sensitive to other people's feelings?

1829
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,480
Did you ever smoke because you fell that
short intervals or like stressed the

1830
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:17,830
house and no,

1831
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:18,910
I'm going to treat,

1832
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,030
I'm not going to perform well in this
meeting or something and he just smoking.

1833
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,451
No,

1834
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,950
it doesn't work like that for me.

1835
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,190
Like if I'm stressed

1836
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,660
out and I work out,

1837
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,611
if I'm stressed out,

1838
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:28,890
that's,

1839
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,840
that's my best for alleviating that.

1840
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,150
Marijuana is good for me for thinking,

1841
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,110
for contemplating and going
over things and it's not,

1842
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,940
it's not good for me for stress.

1843
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:39,660
Like for street.

1844
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,970
What if I feel like
tense tension I work out.

1845
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:43,590
That's,

1846
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,790
that's what gets it out of me.

1847
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,070
I always wanted to ask you one thing.

1848
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,290
Uh,

1849
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,520
it's completely different subjects.

1850
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:51,354
Can I ask,

1851
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,293
uh,

1852
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,880
when you're doing interviews at the end,

1853
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:55,723
those fights,

1854
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,410
did you ever feel threatened
somehow know what looks like wait,

1855
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,260
at least once I'm s no,

1856
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:01,441
no,

1857
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:01,561
no,

1858
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:02,040
no.

1859
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,040
One thing that I hope the
fighters realizes that what
I'm trying to do is only

1860
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,990
get them to express themselves.

1861
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,400
I want them to shine.

1862
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,380
I really genuinely want them.

1863
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,020
They won this big fight I want,

1864
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,650
I want them to express themselves.

1865
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,590
I want them to maybe
maximize their marketing,

1866
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,040
their marketability and just like
tell the world how they feel.

1867
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:28,250
Like that's a credibly unusual experience
to win a big fight in the cage on

1868
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,320
paper view in front of millions of people.

1869
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,810
My goal is only to try to get them to
communicate the better and to let them

1870
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:38,940
know that I'm there to support them.

1871
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,440
That's all I'm ever trying to do.

1872
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:40,980
Or if it,

1873
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,430
you know.

1874
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,263
Yeah.

1875
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,500
Like I was saying before,

1876
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:44,730
before we started talking to,

1877
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,560
I have a lot of fight at friends and MMA.

1878
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,680
Sweetest guys.

1879
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,700
People consider what they do for a living.

1880
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,300
It's crazy.

1881
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,111
So crazy.

1882
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:52,690
Yeah.

1883
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,210
Damn young from that lay.

1884
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:54,780
Yeah.

1885
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,580
Ninja Shogun.

1886
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:56,910
They'll,

1887
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,271
oh,

1888
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:58,740
how's Ninja doing these days,

1889
00:54:58,741 --> 00:54:59,371
man?

1890
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,440
Add less time to talk to him.

1891
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:02,761
He got some,

1892
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:03,600
he got some,

1893
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,380
uh,

1894
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,420
I don't know if it was
because of the fighting.

1895
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,830
I cannot say that,

1896
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,090
but the,

1897
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,550
he's speech sheets a little slow.

1898
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,920
It is already hard to understand.

1899
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:14,820
Even Shogun,

1900
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:15,931
they have this,

1901
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:17,790
what they called the whole nace,

1902
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,590
which is the way of speaking.

1903
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,450
They come from at this state,

1904
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,970
which is very hard to understand
what they say from queer timber.

1905
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:24,160
Right?

1906
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,660
Yeah.

1907
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,860
Could achieve by people.

1908
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:26,600
We don't poker chips.

1909
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,530
Sometimes when we speak to too fast,

1910
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:29,640
you don't understand that much.

1911
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:30,980
But a Nisha,

1912
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,130
I think he got some,

1913
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:34,800
some injuries and the scars in his head.

1914
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:38,370
I think he got some surgeries and
I think he had surgery on her.

1915
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,360
She was fine at the time.

1916
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:44,070
People are kicking people in soccer
kicking and he was one of the best.

1917
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,720
He was good.

1918
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:44,910
Yeah,

1919
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,780
he was an animal.

1920
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,280
He was really young too.

1921
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,160
And at the end he was like
getting knocked out with slaps.

1922
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,520
That's the scariest thing is
when you see their chin go,

1923
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,800
when their ability to take a po.

1924
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,663
What's craziest?

1925
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,980
Shogun seems to be making a resurgence.

1926
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,023
It's crazy.

1927
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,320
He amazing.

1928
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:05,640
He w I w I will you still be very
good friends with one of his coaches.

1929
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,300
And after the fight would
Henderson the first one,

1930
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:10,320
which was like a grand,

1931
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,050
remembered that fucking chaos.

1932
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:12,990
That was a chaos.

1933
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:15,240
And I was talking to him and he was like,

1934
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,500
you don't even imagine how
talent that this guy is.

1935
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,330
But uh,

1936
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,320
he kind of focus,

1937
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,830
if he was focused,

1938
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:26,320
he would kick his ass in
life fucking tour minutes.

1939
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,430
So he just,

1940
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,300
that's the way they do it in the shoe box.

1941
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,190
They like to fight.

1942
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,230
They like to fucking just go at it.

1943
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,870
He m and Cyborg and of underlay and
understand are sort of the same thing the

1944
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:43,220
way they do.

1945
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,170
It's just like,

1946
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:48,900
let's go to war and sometimes
the game changed in,

1947
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,320
but shoguns like learning,

1948
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:50,951
you can see the,

1949
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,290
he's like improving
Steven proofing and like,

1950
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,520
I think this is like 36,

1951
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:54,851
34.

1952
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:55,541
His last fight,

1953
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:56,800
he looks sensation Aman.

1954
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,970
I mean he looked like a
fucking killer is crazy.

1955
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,970
He can take a shot again now.

1956
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:01,511
It's weird.

1957
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:02,170
It's like,

1958
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,130
I mean he got knocked out by a few
different guys and he's lost some fights,

1959
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:06,941
some tough fights,

1960
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:09,640
but his last fight he looked
as good as he's looking years.

1961
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,330
It's,

1962
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,220
it's sad for me when I see like,

1963
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,113
uh,

1964
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,870
I don't know why he's always with
Brazina's but when I see like an old,

1965
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,200
an old fighter getting
his ass beat too quick.

1966
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,710
Yup.

1967
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,480
I remember his fight with Sonnen.

1968
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,290
That was,

1969
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,250
that was,

1970
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:24,611
yeah,

1971
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,360
well he got caught.

1972
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,500
He got caught in a guillotine.

1973
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,333
But it's fast.

1974
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,250
The guy pre framed for like six months.

1975
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:31,770
And that's very frustrating.

1976
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,400
Remember when rice,

1977
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:35,860
he went back to five with
Hugues down was like,

1978
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:36,843
yeah,

1979
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,280
well Matt Hughes was in his prime then,

1980
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:39,611
you know,

1981
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:42,760
and he was so strong and
the boys just wasn't,

1982
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,760
he wasn't physically capable to do it.

1983
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,040
Right.

1984
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,330
He didn't look the same,

1985
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:46,781
you know,

1986
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:51,090
it just didn't look like he was
physically capable the same way in.

1987
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,180
And you know Matt,

1988
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,200
he was his fucking talent.

1989
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,460
Unbelievably talented.

1990
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:55,030
And when he,

1991
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,210
when he got on top of hoisting,

1992
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,011
it was smashing him.

1993
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,340
I was like,

1994
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,480
oh yeah,

1995
00:57:58,481 --> 00:57:59,291
that's hard to watch.

1996
00:57:59,291 --> 00:57:59,960
How to watch.

1997
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,690
Yeah,

1998
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,230
but that's the life.

1999
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,090
I mean that is the life they chose.

2000
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:04,960
You know,

2001
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,381
a chocolate.

2002
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,770
Dell just got knocked out by Tito Ortiz
and that was hard to watch because you

2003
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:10,170
could tell he just can't take a punch.

2004
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,040
And I wasn't that five that
went in there to wash it.

2005
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:12,431
It was,

2006
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,031
it was bad.

2007
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:13,480
It was,

2008
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:13,871
it wasn't,

2009
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:15,580
it wasn't moving right either.

2010
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,910
The thing about when fighters
take a lot of knockout losses,

2011
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:23,911
one of the things it's very becomes a
parent is there balance looks off and

2012
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,470
their movement doesn't look the same.

2013
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,090
Like their neurology,

2014
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:28,331
their,

2015
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:28,720
they don't,

2016
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,620
their body doesn't move as you can look
the same but it doesn't react the same

2017
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:33,454
way.

2018
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,740
I mean even Anderson when
he lost his style bender,

2019
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:40,300
I think style bender would have been a
tough fight for him at any point in his

2020
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:40,610
career.

2021
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,970
Cause style bender is just fantastic,

2022
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:43,960
super technical.

2023
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,730
But Anderson looked like he was a
step behind the Anderson of old,

2024
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,240
like the Anderson that knocked
out Vituro the Anderson that,

2025
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:52,781
you know,

2026
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:54,190
you go back to the early days,

2027
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:58,000
Anderson that knocked out Chael
Sonnen and Anderson was a fucking,

2028
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,430
he was just an assassin.

2029
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:01,690
He was so good.

2030
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:03,340
He just knew what to do and when to do it.

2031
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,630
And when the style bender fight,

2032
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,670
he just looked like he was
a little off little office.

2033
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,980
But he's also 46 I see.

2034
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:09,190
No,

2035
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,880
he's,

2036
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,830
I think he's won one year older than me.

2037
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,630
He's 43 he's only 42 yeah,

2038
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:13,901
we did.

2039
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:14,051
We did,

2040
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,010
we did a show together.

2041
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,370
Uh,

2042
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,960
we do a show this show on Netflix
called the ultimate beastmaster,

2043
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,310
which a Brazilian

2044
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,520
Netflix we know is a,

2045
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,740
is here as well.

2046
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,450
Terry crews did an American,

2047
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:26,841
we do,

2048
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:31,841
we do like all hosts from
different countries and we
meet and it's like American

2049
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:34,380
Ninja Warrior for Netflix.

2050
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:34,561
Oh,

2051
00:59:34,561 --> 00:59:35,120
okay.

2052
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,290
And they have like host from different
countries and we have the Brazilians and

2053
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,080
the Italians and the French guys.

2054
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:42,670
And,

2055
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,960
and I did his show with Andrew.

2056
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:44,960
So he's a sweet guy.

2057
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:45,794
He's a great guy,

2058
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,753
great guy.

2059
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,420
He's a great,

2060
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,880
yeah,

2061
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,710
I mean he's one of the all time greats.

2062
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,160
I mean,

2063
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,350
I had the honor of calling
a lot of his fights

2064
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,480
in his crazy because,

2065
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:53,811
yeah.

2066
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:54,710
And it's crazy.

2067
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,550
Uh,

2068
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,570
when you're talking about the God,

2069
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:57,530
the guy's getting older.

2070
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,361
I remember I taught,

2071
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,500
I taught with Minataro.

2072
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,100
Uh,

2073
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,140
he was like three or
four and it was like two,

2074
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,890
two,

2075
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,930
two fights after he actually retired.

2076
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:06,501
And I asked him,

2077
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:06,740
why,

2078
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,580
why you keep doing it,

2079
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,540
you don't have to,

2080
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,373
you don't,

2081
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,480
you don't have to prove
anything to another one.

2082
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,680
And what he said to me,

2083
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:13,970
I think was so fair.

2084
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:14,804
He was like,

2085
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,710
I fought when this thing
wasn't giving me any money.

2086
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,400
Right?

2087
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,270
So just give,

2088
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,420
let me lose the fight or two and get some
money at the end of my career because

2089
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:26,750
I deserve that.

2090
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,041
He wasn't like,

2091
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,960
of course he was going there to win,

2092
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:35,260
but it's like I want to take the risk
because I was fighting in Japan getting on

2093
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:39,140
an old $5,000 and now that the game,

2094
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,540
it's like bringing you so much money,

2095
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,490
I'm going to retire.

2096
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,333
Let me just do

2097
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:44,321
well.

2098
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:45,970
Minataro not,

2099
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:51,270
not only was he a pioneer and one of
the great MMA heavyweights of all time,

2100
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:55,870
but he's so important for MMA because he
showed that heavyweights can fight off

2101
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:58,840
their back and then heavyweights
can win by triangle.

2102
01:00:58,841 --> 01:01:02,440
Like when he triangled Mark Coleman and
was tapping guys with arm bars when he

2103
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:03,660
beat Bob Saget,

2104
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,990
Bob Sapp on his fucking crazy that that
is one of the greatest MMA fights in the

2105
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:08,950
history of the sport.

2106
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,630
375 pound Bob Sapp Minataro
only probably way two 30.

2107
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,460
And he wound up tapping with an arm bar.

2108
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,650
It was fucking crazy.

2109
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,580
And after get spiked on his head,

2110
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,980
which still apparently
fucks with him to his day,

2111
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:23,110
his neck was fucked up
permanent because of that.

2112
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,500
Yes.

2113
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,333
I didn't know that.

2114
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:28,180
375 pound guy who doesn't
even look like a human,

2115
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:28,870
he looked like a,

2116
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:29,710
like a comic book,

2117
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,910
either smashes him on his
head and metatarsal recovered.

2118
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:36,500
And I mean he was one of the
toughest guys of all time,

2119
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,900
but she was run by a truck
when he wasn't in jail.

2120
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,960
That's that scarring.

2121
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,190
So it's run by crazy.

2122
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:43,660
Yeah,

2123
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,320
that's crazy.

2124
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,250
I mean he's um,

2125
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,760
he's one of the most important
figures in the history of the sport.

2126
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,290
And then I think Fabrisio took it to
another level cause for breezy over doom

2127
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:57,280
probably has the best guard in the
history of the sport is the history of the

2128
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,180
heavyweight division.

2129
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,571
I mean,

2130
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:02,110
when he caught fade or when he had him
in his triangle and he had them locked up

2131
01:02:02,111 --> 01:02:02,381
like that,

2132
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:04,420
you don't get away with that guy like you,

2133
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,130
you might get out of some people's guard,

2134
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,270
not Fabrizio.

2135
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:08,890
That motherfucker locks people up.

2136
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,361
And I got to thinking,

2137
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:10,481
man,

2138
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:11,440
I'm here just because of

2139
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:14,770
my respect for him.

2140
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:15,000
You know,

2141
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,300
when he reached out to me it was like,

2142
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:16,690
okay,

2143
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,240
I'll get your friend on 100% thank you
thing and now he is a great guy and

2144
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,230
that's what I will,

2145
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,850
that's why I asked you if,

2146
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:24,510
uh,

2147
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,590
if you kind of feel threatened because
when people get there in the fight,

2148
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,450
you don't know what it
was going to happen.

2149
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,690
And when your goal over
there to talk with one,

2150
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:35,410
you can say a wrong
thing at the wrong man.

2151
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:35,970
I don't know.

2152
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,500
Or maybe you can make mistakes.

2153
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,290
Sure.

2154
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:38,700
So my,

2155
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,760
my intention is always to
just to make them look good.

2156
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,870
That's all I'm trying to do.

2157
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,290
I'm trying to do is just get
them to express themselves and,

2158
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:46,581
and,

2159
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:46,890
and,

2160
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,250
and also put some emotion to
how great their performance was.

2161
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,850
Perfect.

2162
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,181
Perfect.

2163
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:51,870
Yeah,

2164
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:52,860
but it's a weird job,

2165
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:53,041
you know,

2166
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,180
to also be a comedian,

2167
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,260
you know,

2168
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:00,000
it's a strange combination of
do they go watch you sometimes.

2169
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:00,451
Sometimes.

2170
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:00,650
Yeah.

2171
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,040
Yeah,

2172
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:01,580
yeah,

2173
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:01,930
yeah.

2174
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,763
Who is good.

2175
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:03,803
That's very good.

2176
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:04,740
And uh,

2177
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,970
for me now it's like,

2178
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,940
uh,

2179
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,950
I'm here to try this comment a theme.

2180
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,530
And so you're getting up in Los
Angeles and a traveling anywhere,

2181
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:12,651
right?

2182
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:13,191
Yeah.

2183
01:03:13,191 --> 01:03:13,381
Yeah.

2184
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:15,840
I have a Gig on Rhode Island.

2185
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,853
Rhode Island.

2186
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:17,620
What,

2187
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,453
Portuguese people?

2188
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,440
Yeah,

2189
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,940
I have a Gig Dad.

2190
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:21,691
Uh,

2191
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:25,890
I did the Gotham comedy club
lasts less than two weeks ago.

2192
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:27,190
I had climbed the clubs,

2193
01:03:27,191 --> 01:03:30,190
so it's hard to get a lot of
Brazilians and come to see you.

2194
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,190
They want you to speak Portuguese.

2195
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,570
They do in,

2196
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,520
some of them don't speak English.

2197
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,480
Really?

2198
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,110
There's like always like two or three
at the thought that was in Portuguese.

2199
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:42,120
But that was so good to see you.

2200
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,143
But

2201
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,570
everything is sad.

2202
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,590
Right.

2203
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,940
So that happened.

2204
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:49,290
But it's,

2205
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:54,430
it's hard maybe because I have to build
an audience here and it's gonna take

2206
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:55,974
some time.

2207
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,270
Do you do a podcast?

2208
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,081
I don't.

2209
01:03:58,081 --> 01:03:59,390
You should write should.

2210
01:03:59,430 --> 01:03:59,760
Yeah,

2211
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,593
definitely.

2212
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,170
Definitely.

2213
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:01,980
It's a good,

2214
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,940
I think every comedian,

2215
01:04:02,941 --> 01:04:05,010
like every comedian has an Instagram page.

2216
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,290
Every comedian officers
should have a podcast.

2217
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,850
It's very simple to do.

2218
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,040
It's not something that
we do that much in Brazil.

2219
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:11,873
So Ah,

2220
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,670
maybe it could be the
pioneer of that to recast.

2221
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,031
Yeah.

2222
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,830
I mean you're the pioneer for standup.

2223
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,930
Youtube is something huge in Brazil.

2224
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,950
Well that's a great way to start because
with all you need is a Webcam and you

2225
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:24,930
can start your podcast just on youtube.

2226
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,521
Do My,

2227
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,121
I have my,

2228
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:27,600
my,

2229
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,110
my,

2230
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,870
my channel Youtube got
like 2 million subscribers.

2231
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,620
Like on Twitter I have 12
million people following.

2232
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,300
It's a lot,

2233
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:36,540
man.

2234
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,240
That's a lot 12 meeting
people following me,

2235
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,770
my Brazilian Instagram,

2236
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:42,540
I got like 1.5 million people.

2237
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,374
People,

2238
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,220
people are very active in
social media in Brazil.

2239
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,980
It is good.

2240
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,980
It's something that is from our nature
to connect with people in Brazil.

2241
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,180
So that's why social media huge.

2242
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,490
Any was a,

2243
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:59,220
it was like an alternative
for the traditional media.

2244
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,370
What is this the most
influential person on Twitter?

2245
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:03,810
Look at you motherfucker.

2246
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,010
I got a story on the New York Times.

2247
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:08,940
That's crazy.

2248
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:12,720
New York Times magazine saying you're
the most influential person on Twitter.

2249
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:13,554
That's incredible.

2250
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:13,950
Now what?

2251
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:14,221
Why?

2252
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:17,070
Why are they saying you're
the most influential would,

2253
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,030
what were you doing that
was influencing people?

2254
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,150
I have no idea.

2255
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,940
I was surprised.

2256
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:28,830
Monday I woke up and it was story on
the New York Times saying that I was the

2257
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,820
most inflammation profile,

2258
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:35,850
Twitter and in second place the Dalai
Lama take this one Dalai Lama or my third.

2259
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,600
I was the first one.

2260
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:41,040
So these,

2261
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,900
they did like a huge story about me.

2262
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:43,730
Wow.

2263
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:44,563
And a credible,

2264
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,480
it was man.

2265
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,340
Peter was something huge in Brazil.

2266
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,580
What is the difference between the way
people use Twitter in Brazil and America?

2267
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,533
Is there a difference?

2268
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:52,291
No.

2269
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,400
For for me,

2270
01:05:53,401 --> 01:05:55,410
I just use Twitter for jokes.

2271
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,210
That's what I did for quite some time.

2272
01:05:57,211 --> 01:06:02,211
It was a Twitter lost a lot of his
strength in Brazil because people like to

2273
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:06,860
connect members or salts.

2274
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,150
Facebook is huge and Instagram is huge.

2275
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:11,250
So you have your family over there,

2276
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:12,120
you have uh,

2277
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,520
you have have everything.

2278
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:15,090
Hey,

2279
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:20,090
you have your people but you feel talking
to you for just like scrape Twitter

2280
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,110
feels like you're screaming in.

2281
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,460
Someone is going to listen.

2282
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,880
It's not like on Facebook that people
follows you and then if he likes you,

2283
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,080
your post is going to be like in the,

2284
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,300
in the top of his page.

2285
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:33,720
Twitter,

2286
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,100
there's just something that is there.

2287
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:37,950
So it lost a lot of power in Brazil.

2288
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,940
But one thing that is happening right now
is our new president and we have a new

2289
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:45,930
president now that is a right wing guy
who was just a lacked and then he got

2290
01:06:45,931 --> 01:06:46,764
stabbed.

2291
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,933
He was like,

2292
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,110
when did he get stabbed?

2293
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:52,350
There was like two months ago
during the process of the election,

2294
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:54,420
holy shit got stabbed in the gut.

2295
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,620
Like oh yeah,

2296
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,001
you do see that.

2297
01:06:57,001 --> 01:06:57,870
And that was crazy.

2298
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:58,790
I didn't hear about that.

2299
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,480
And he is like a very white rain.

2300
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:05,481
He warned the election and he is trying
to do with Twitter with Trump did where

2301
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:10,710
he's doing and here like run instead
of going to press conferences and

2302
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,590
everything who just go on
Twitter and see what he wants.

2303
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,483
Wow.

2304
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:14,861
Yeah.

2305
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:19,320
Twitter is a unique in the way people
just use it to insult people and still

2306
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,130
angry.

2307
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,250
It's so angry.

2308
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,330
Like if you just,

2309
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,720
only if you didn't know anything about
people and you just looked on Twitter and

2310
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,120
just like saw how you like when people
must be fighting in the streets,

2311
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,310
it must be just a bloodbath out there.

2312
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,210
If you really thought that
people interacted in the
real world the way they do

2313
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:38,044
on Twitter,

2314
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,100
you would think that everywhere is just
weapons and clubs and picking shouldn't

2315
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,410
running people over with
cars wishing everyone dies.

2316
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,310
But I think man,

2317
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:49,150
there's a difference and I think we
have to acknowledge that there's a

2318
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:52,480
difference between your behavior
on the web and outside of them

2319
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,310
for sure.

2320
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,060
And sometimes you don't realize that,

2321
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,830
oh the ward is bothering,

2322
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:01,060
everybody is sensitive and everything
else if you go outside is not that much.

2323
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:01,640
It's the same.

2324
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,270
The same.

2325
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,080
It was always,

2326
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,470
it's

2327
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,980
a distorted lens that you
could see humans through.

2328
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,200
It's not how people
really are and it's also,

2329
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,650
it's not a healthy way to communicate
because you don't worry about what the

2330
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:14,510
person thinks about what you're saying.

2331
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:18,710
You're things that you don't necessarily
even really mean because you're trying

2332
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:20,060
to be inflammatory,

2333
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,520
you know?

2334
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,350
[inaudible] I mean that's a lot of it.

2335
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,940
A lot of is just screaming,

2336
01:08:25,941 --> 01:08:29,190
screaming for attention
and insulting people and,

2337
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:30,800
and then you look at people's pages.

2338
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:32,390
That's the most disturbing thing to me.

2339
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,040
When someone say something Shitty to me,

2340
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:37,340
I'll go to their page and I see they're
just saying shitty things all day long.

2341
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:39,140
Like kind of life is this man,

2342
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,970
so fucking terrible life.

2343
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,210
What I'm doing right now,

2344
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:45,510
I have this series that I'd
want Instagram where I just,

2345
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:50,700
I get like the Guy Kersey me or saying
some shit about me and I just show his

2346
01:08:50,701 --> 01:08:52,860
face and it's enough.

2347
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:54,880
And it's funny because it's,

2348
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,370
it's funny to see who is actually,

2349
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,290
who hates me.

2350
01:08:59,040 --> 01:08:59,611
Then a,

2351
01:08:59,611 --> 01:09:00,440
I called this,

2352
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:04,200
the people who hates me and then I put
work in road and then all his like his

2353
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:06,140
face because stunned than they are.

2354
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,290
It's enough for you to see,

2355
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,460
oh that's fucking,

2356
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,640
you don't have to take things too serious
because if you take a look of their

2357
01:09:11,641 --> 01:09:12,630
lives it's,

2358
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,150
you can see why they are so mad.

2359
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,750
Yeah.

2360
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,171
There's,

2361
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:18,270
there's a lot of that is a
lot of angry and they'll,

2362
01:09:18,271 --> 01:09:19,980
most of them have private accounts.

2363
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,420
Like you can't look at their pictures.

2364
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,433
They're hiding,

2365
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:24,030
they're hiding who they are.

2366
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,640
They just talk shit in the comments.

2367
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:26,640
That should an bro.

2368
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,001
Yeah.

2369
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:27,840
That's weak shit.

2370
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,670
[inaudible] that shit.

2371
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:33,810
So giving people a chance to
like just real blind shots,

2372
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:35,403
this crazy.

2373
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,440
I think that that the
being anonymous on the web,

2374
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:37,860
it's a good,

2375
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,970
it's a good thing because it allows
you to be free at the same time.

2376
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,960
Whistle blowers for people
like proporting crimes,

2377
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:46,441
reporting,

2378
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:47,850
corruption of course report,

2379
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:48,131
you know,

2380
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:48,601
like that.

2381
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,860
For that it's critical.

2382
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:50,601
That is,

2383
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:51,110
there is a,

2384
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,943
uh,

2385
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:54,620
there is a way to do it and
they'll expose yourself.

2386
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,660
But at the same time he creates that.

2387
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:57,081
But it's,

2388
01:09:57,081 --> 01:09:57,381
you know,

2389
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:58,550
it's the sign up for the new era,

2390
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:59,170
Bro.

2391
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,540
Just a new thing that
we all have to navigate.

2392
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,880
Is it just a new thing?

2393
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:06,330
And it's like we were talking
about earlier with social
media being so recent in

2394
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,021
human history,

2395
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:11,070
there's never been anything where you
could just talk to the whole world and do

2396
01:10:11,071 --> 01:10:13,740
it from your phone while
you're sitting at a red light.

2397
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:14,640
You could say something.

2398
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,200
There's a story about this woman.

2399
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:16,631
What was her name?

2400
01:10:16,631 --> 01:10:20,700
Justine Sacco was at the woman's
name who said something racist.

2401
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:21,534
I went to a plane.

2402
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,280
Yes,

2403
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,010
yes.

2404
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,843
She said,

2405
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,350
I'm going to Africa.

2406
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,940
Hope I don't get aids.

2407
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,811
Just kidding.

2408
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:28,410
I'm white.

2409
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,243
Lol.

2410
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,580
So she was fucked up on
Ambien and she was a,

2411
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:33,930
or a Xanax or ambien.

2412
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:34,681
I forget what it was.

2413
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:34,951
She was,

2414
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:38,820
she was on some sort of
psych medication and uh,

2415
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:42,210
something that affects
your brain and drank too.

2416
01:10:42,211 --> 01:10:43,400
She had a couple of drinks,

2417
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:48,430
just thought she was being funny and then
wakes up 16 hours later in Africa and

2418
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:49,470
her life is over.

2419
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:50,343
That's crazy.

2420
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,413
Fucking crazy.

2421
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,280
And it was just one of those days where
there was like a slow news cycle and

2422
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,200
people just jumped on that tweet.

2423
01:10:58,201 --> 01:11:02,580
And the thing about it too is that they
don't want you to recover from something

2424
01:11:02,581 --> 01:11:03,150
like that.

2425
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,170
They want that's,

2426
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,940
that's you for the rest of your life.

2427
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,803
That's what I felt.

2428
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:07,921
That's what I felt.

2429
01:11:07,921 --> 01:11:08,910
I'm the baby fucker.

2430
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:09,883
Yeah.

2431
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,350
Yeah.

2432
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,183
That's,

2433
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,120
yeah.

2434
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,130
So everything that say right now is like,

2435
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,650
what is it?

2436
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,730
You like fucking babies
and never fucked a baby.

2437
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,730
I don't think they are attractive.

2438
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:23,310
I don't feel attracted at all.

2439
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,790
Do you foresee a time ever where
you will go back to Brazil?

2440
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,121
No,

2441
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:27,661
I do.

2442
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:32,220
I do go back to what I mean go
back to do standup and I uh,

2443
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:38,630
I don't see damn man the challenges here
when the freedom that I think I have

2444
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,990
here and maybe I don't,

2445
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,760
maybe I will face this,

2446
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,121
this,

2447
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:43,050
this whole thing,

2448
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,730
the same thing when I get
famous or when I went,

2449
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:46,750
when I get,

2450
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,100
no,

2451
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:47,281
no,

2452
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:47,790
you won't.

2453
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,930
It's way easier here.

2454
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,833
You from what?

2455
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,510
From what you're explaining to me,

2456
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,800
but look at Lou Louis or is a different
case because it's not what he said on

2457
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:58,500
stage and you know,

2458
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,393
I mean it's,

2459
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,970
he got you caught up in the
wave of the me too movement too.

2460
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,690
Whereas if this same exact
instance happened in the past,

2461
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:07,351
it's not the same thing.

2462
01:12:07,351 --> 01:12:07,481
Yeah,

2463
01:12:07,481 --> 01:12:08,670
it was a bit of comparison.

2464
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:13,940
But I got like Daniel Tosh did the
rape joke and that was over in like,

2465
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:15,390
like that.

2466
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,410
And do you know what,

2467
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,580
what happened there with a joke?

2468
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:18,481
No,

2469
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:18,931
he was looking,

2470
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,400
provides them with the
audience or something.

2471
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,290
He was improvising with the audience.

2472
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,400
Here's the deal.

2473
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,120
Um,

2474
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,410
he was at the laugh factory.

2475
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:26,790
He wasn't supposed to be there.

2476
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,121
Don,

2477
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:28,980
my rera who is his friend,

2478
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:29,581
said,

2479
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:29,821
hey,

2480
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:32,010
why don't you go up and do some standup
because I don't have any materials.

2481
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:33,000
Just go up and fuck around.

2482
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:33,800
Just sit.

2483
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,710
They'll be happy to see you.

2484
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:34,921
He goes,

2485
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:35,300
okay.

2486
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,133
So he goes on stage.

2487
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:36,360
He goes,

2488
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,380
I don't have any material.

2489
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,131
So,

2490
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:38,311
uh,

2491
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:39,330
what do you guys want to talk about?

2492
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:41,850
And some guy yells out rape and he goes,

2493
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:42,140
what?

2494
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:42,510
What?

2495
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,370
What's funny about it?

2496
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,750
Like he's like making fun of the guy.

2497
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:46,690
Like what are you talking about?

2498
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,790
What's funny about rape?

2499
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,271
He's like,

2500
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:48,840
there's nothing.

2501
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,460
He goes like,

2502
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:49,540
well,

2503
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,251
what's funny about rip?

2504
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:51,240
The humiliation,

2505
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,074
the violence?

2506
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,490
And some woman yells out,

2507
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,410
actually there's nothing funny about rape.

2508
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,513
So he goes,

2509
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,810
when are you finding five guys or,

2510
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,080
so he's just feeling Daniel Tosh.

2511
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:05,880
So it probably would have been just one
of those moments in a live crowd filled

2512
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:06,601
with drunk people.

2513
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:10,140
But she wrote a blog about
where she was the victim.

2514
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,260
She wrote this huge blog about
him calling for her to get raped,

2515
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:15,040
which is not exactly what he did.

2516
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,680
It's in the context of being heckled.

2517
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:23,700
You understand what it is and he kind of
had to have some sort of an apology for

2518
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:23,821
it,

2519
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:27,930
but then all these other people jumped
in and then it became a moment where

2520
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:31,320
people could show that they don't support
rape or they don't support what we

2521
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:32,460
call rape culture.

2522
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,570
The usual has a platform.

2523
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:34,410
Yes,

2524
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:34,980
yes.

2525
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:35,820
That's what happened.

2526
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,160
And that's what happened with me as well.

2527
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,860
People don't want to
analyze context anymore.

2528
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:41,641
Exactly.

2529
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:43,620
And we are very,

2530
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,160
uh,

2531
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,030
we are available.

2532
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:45,570
We will the,

2533
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:46,590
we as Comedians,

2534
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,371
we are talking,

2535
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:48,330
we are ourselves.

2536
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:49,620
We are not playing a character.

2537
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,910
So if you take,

2538
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,560
if I take your jokes,

2539
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:53,423
Joe,

2540
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,310
out of context from your special Netflix,

2541
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,340
I can get some,

2542
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:57,610
some clicks if a boy,

2543
01:13:57,611 --> 01:13:58,000
yeah,

2544
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,190
I'm sure if I wanted,

2545
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:03,840
but I think people are getting tired of
it and now they understand the process.

2546
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,880
But what I felt was the beginning of that,

2547
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,050
especially in your country where you
don't have a long history of stand up.

2548
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:10,870
Yeah.

2549
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,370
So that's why I lost

2550
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,220
money and uh,

2551
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,210
that's why I lost a lot of money.

2552
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,890
You're the motherfucking
Lenny Bruce or Brazil.

2553
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:18,200
Yeah,

2554
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,033
man.

2555
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,913
You know,

2556
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,280
someone will give me the
deck granted in a future,

2557
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,270
but now,

2558
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,120
now you want to be now off Ian America.

2559
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,441
No,

2560
01:14:28,441 --> 01:14:28,691
no,

2561
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:28,821
no.

2562
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:29,680
Not only that,

2563
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:30,760
but that's way,

2564
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:31,653
uh,

2565
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,070
what,

2566
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:35,830
what people said to me in
what I felt was that I was,

2567
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:41,430
a lot of people said I was using this
freedom of speech argument to offend

2568
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:42,360
people.

2569
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:42,750
Right?

2570
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:42,910
We,

2571
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:46,120
you hear that in America too
and we've just not the case.

2572
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:50,800
But then he's mad at off freedom
of speech because we had a law in,

2573
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:51,550
uh,

2574
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:56,550
in Brazil a long time ago where
people are like trying to uh,

2575
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,660
regulate,

2576
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,470
uh,

2577
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:00,970
comments on the web.

2578
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:01,730
Oh,

2579
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,230
if I feel offended I can
ask someone to delete that.

2580
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:09,530
Sold the golf with the government
was trying to regulate that and a,

2581
01:15:09,531 --> 01:15:11,050
and the law was approved.

2582
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,000
So like after you wasn't approved but
that the law was like changing after the

2583
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:16,834
voting.

2584
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,350
But when he becomes at the end,

2585
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,480
the government was like,

2586
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,490
when he was getting the
time with the voting,

2587
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,780
the governor was like,

2588
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,201
okay,

2589
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:24,400
what about he fight?

2590
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,590
Take some tweets as well.

2591
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,490
That offend me.

2592
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:30,700
So the government tried to
get into the weight of things.

2593
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:32,260
So it is a matter of freedom of speech.

2594
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,460
When this is going to end,

2595
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,170
it becomes with a joke,

2596
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,270
but maybe can end with the
government shutting you up.

2597
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,050
Yes.

2598
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,760
I have a friend in Venezuela,

2599
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,020
a comedian friend.

2600
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,840
His name is Nacho.

2601
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:47,530
He was,

2602
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:49,900
he was kicked out of the country
because of some jokes he did.

2603
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:50,620
Whoa.

2604
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,101
He's Ken.

2605
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:54,420
Go back his living in
Miami right now because he,

2606
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,470
if he goes back to Venezuela right now,

2607
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,720
the government is going
to pull Camille own jail.

2608
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,441
Maybe kill him.

2609
01:15:59,441 --> 01:16:00,274
I don't know.

2610
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:00,911
Wow.

2611
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:01,890
What was his jokes about?

2612
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:02,111
Yeah.

2613
01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:04,060
I don't know what his joke was about,

2614
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:05,500
but he was making fun of the government.

2615
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,920
But then like one year after that he
makes some jokes about people with down

2616
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:12,790
syndrome and then the
golfer and felt that he,

2617
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:13,850
he uh,

2618
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,900
when he has to go to jail
because of the Dow Syndrome,

2619
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:17,230
Joe,

2620
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:21,730
they were using that thing to
take him out of the streets.

2621
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,980
So it's Dasia result there,

2622
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:24,221
man.

2623
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:26,890
It's not that easy to do
comedy outside of America.

2624
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,210
You built that freedom.

2625
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:28,851
Yeah.

2626
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:30,290
You hear about it all the time.

2627
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:34,610
People in other countries that
say jokes and they get in trouble.

2628
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,493
Uh,

2629
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,460
like there was something in Thailand,

2630
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:38,301
there was some,

2631
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:41,740
someone made a joke about the king
and they locked him in jail and it's,

2632
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:42,980
it's very danger.

2633
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,590
Does a lot of countries
where it's very dangerous,

2634
01:16:45,591 --> 01:16:47,510
very dangerous to speak
out against the government.

2635
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:48,681
Yeah.

2636
01:16:48,681 --> 01:16:48,921
We're,

2637
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:49,731
we're really,

2638
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:50,690
really fortunate here.

2639
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,160
So like for you,

2640
01:16:52,161 --> 01:16:56,630
when you see Americans complaining about
freedom of speech over here and not,

2641
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:58,250
not being able to say whatever you want,

2642
01:16:58,251 --> 01:16:58,941
it's kind of a joke,

2643
01:16:58,941 --> 01:16:59,250
right?

2644
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,083
Yes.

2645
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:01,670
That's exactly what I feel.

2646
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:02,631
It's just like,

2647
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:03,470
if you want to be an asshole,

2648
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,790
just deal with the consequences.

2649
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:06,243
Yes.

2650
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:07,911
That's what I feel.

2651
01:17:07,911 --> 01:17:08,744
I'm going to hustle.

2652
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,340
But when someone stopped
you on the street,

2653
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:11,420
so you're a piece of shit,

2654
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:11,811
I was like,

2655
01:17:11,811 --> 01:17:12,644
yeah,

2656
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,011
right.

2657
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:13,880
But that's okay.

2658
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,990
That's end there.

2659
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,590
I am a piece of shit and that's
where it has to and you know,

2660
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,020
don't take it personal.

2661
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,601
That's what I,

2662
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:23,540
I feel that is,

2663
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:28,220
is difficult to do a
comedy out there in here.

2664
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:30,830
You have this freedom of
doing it then I think is,

2665
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,053
is beautiful.

2666
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,081
It's beautiful.

2667
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,280
It's something that you guys built.

2668
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,480
Do you think that it's going to change
in Brazil and then maybe the standup

2669
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:40,240
comedy could actually see,

2670
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,830
because one of the things that happened
in America is that Lenny Bruce,

2671
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,620
because he didn't just tell jokes,

2672
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:48,410
he actually talked about
social issues on stage.

2673
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:52,430
It actually expanded people's ideas of
what these social issues are and how

2674
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:53,264
critical they are.

2675
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,090
It changed culture and
a lot of ways and jokes.

2676
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,200
One of the things about standup comedy
that does help to change culture is safe.

2677
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,470
You have an opinion and I have an opinion.

2678
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,780
If your opinion is different than mine,

2679
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:06,680
um,

2680
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,550
you say something,

2681
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:07,821
I'm like,

2682
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:08,750
well I don't agree with that.

2683
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:09,584
I think this,

2684
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,860
but if you say something
and you make me laugh,

2685
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,450
even if I don't agree with it,

2686
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,970
it sneaks in my head
like you have a point.

2687
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,820
If your point is so good
that it makes me laugh,

2688
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,080
even if I don't agree with it,

2689
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:21,980
like God damn it,

2690
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:22,814
he got it.

2691
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:23,893
He got in there.

2692
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:24,651
So you get,

2693
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:28,400
you can propagate ideas inside
someone's consciousness.

2694
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:28,730
You can,

2695
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:29,780
you could sneak them in.

2696
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,690
We have a few people doing it in Brazil.

2697
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,260
Some,

2698
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:33,610
uh,

2699
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:33,950
in the,

2700
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:38,780
I used to have this TV show called CQC
and we used to do comedy in Congress.

2701
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,990
We used to go in interview
congressmen and make fun of them.

2702
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,801
And,

2703
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:42,950
uh,

2704
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,860
we got kicked out of the
congress anyway again.

2705
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:46,740
Then people brought,

2706
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,590
brought us back to the congress.

2707
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,210
But he all,

2708
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,480
you all reached a point when
it's about money and if the end,

2709
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:59,000
if someone is not willing to
put money in your product,

2710
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:03,680
you don't do it in money is connected
to politics and politics and brands and

2711
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,510
the TV stations.

2712
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,820
For you to have a TV station in Brazil,

2713
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:09,710
you need a authorization
by the government.

2714
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:15,140
So you're not death completely
free to do what you want to do it.

2715
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,640
But uh,

2716
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:20,810
but you have some people doing it
and comedy's getting is getting big.

2717
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,640
Standup is getting huge in Brazil.

2718
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:24,080
You use connected to youtube.

2719
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,100
I have a lot of big comedians
doing like huge theaters.

2720
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,710
I used to do like 5,000
seats theaters in Brazil.

2721
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:31,610
So it's,

2722
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,713
it's becoming,

2723
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,280
it's becoming an option.

2724
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:35,211
Wow.

2725
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:36,410
5,000 seat theaters.

2726
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:36,890
Yeah.

2727
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:37,723
Wow,

2728
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,120
man,

2729
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,050
you'll do it here.

2730
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,640
It's 5,000 to do it all the time.

2731
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:41,483
It's just like,

2732
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,160
wow,

2733
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,490
she's doing like 10,000 too.

2734
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,900
But what I'm saying is it's crazy
that you started out doing like a

2735
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:49,190
sadomasochist club.

2736
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:49,640
Yes.

2737
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,440
And then you go to a 5,000 seat theater.

2738
01:19:51,441 --> 01:19:52,340
That's pretty amazing.

2739
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,200
That's what I built with some friends
and I feel that I'm proud of that,

2740
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,810
to open this,

2741
01:19:58,830 --> 01:19:59,221
this,

2742
01:19:59,221 --> 01:19:59,570
uh,

2743
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:04,400
this discussion and this chance because
I have a lot of people doing it right

2744
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:04,611
now,

2745
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:05,870
getting money out of it.

2746
01:20:05,871 --> 01:20:06,651
My comedy club,

2747
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,440
we bay,

2748
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:07,980
well

2749
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,813
Comedians,

2750
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,360
every time they go off stage,

2751
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,470
this little lake here,

2752
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,480
they got like 10 books.

2753
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:13,500
Yeah.

2754
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,460
But it's okay.

2755
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,340
We consider that as a business,

2756
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,271
uh,

2757
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:21,180
over that and that's that
serious and this is awesome.

2758
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,170
That's fantastic.

2759
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:23,520
It's so cool that you started that.

2760
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,091
I mean,

2761
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:27,540
that's gotta be really a good feeling
to know that all these people that are

2762
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:30,030
doing it now that are
professional comedians like you,

2763
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,640
you took the first steps.

2764
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:32,430
Yeah.

2765
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,031
I feel proud,

2766
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:33,240
man.

2767
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,180
That was a lot of people that try that.

2768
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:37,680
I probably have all of them
watching this right now.

2769
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:42,950
I don't know anyone who has ever done
it in one language and then made it over

2770
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:44,610
in America afterwards.

2771
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:45,690
I'm trying to think.

2772
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,550
I can't think of any,

2773
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,200
I don't think anybody in English.

2774
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:49,530
Uh,

2775
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:50,363
oh yeah,

2776
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,200
I don't,

2777
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,350
I can't think of anybody that started out
in another country and then made it an

2778
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:55,800
American.

2779
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,480
What is the name of the Russian guy?

2780
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:59,730
They always do the [inaudible]
still doing the comedy store.

2781
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:01,350
They used to say Yaakov.

2782
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,990
SMIRNOFF.

2783
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,340
Yeah.

2784
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,090
Great Guy.

2785
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:03,870
He,

2786
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,190
I think he's Russian.

2787
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:05,791
Yes,

2788
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:06,541
he's rushing,

2789
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:08,670
but I think he's been over
here most of his life.

2790
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,210
Uh,

2791
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,160
I don't think he started in Russia.

2792
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,350
I think his whole idea in Russia,

2793
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:13,951
they say,

2794
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:14,400
yeah,

2795
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,001
this whole thing.

2796
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:15,181
Yeah.

2797
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,740
So he was doing like a character?

2798
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:16,941
No,

2799
01:21:16,941 --> 01:21:17,001
no,

2800
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:17,130
no.

2801
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,791
He speaks,

2802
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:18,001
I mean,

2803
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:19,470
he definitely speaks Russian.

2804
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:19,890
Okay.

2805
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,870
And he definitely is from Russia,

2806
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,740
but uh,

2807
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,330
he definitely plays it up too.

2808
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,380
And He,

2809
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:25,591
you know,

2810
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:26,401
he's been over here forever.

2811
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:31,401
He has his own theater in what does
that place where those old folks live?

2812
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,400
Branson,

2813
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:32,821
Branson,

2814
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:33,654
Missouri.

2815
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:33,991
Yeah.

2816
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:35,130
It's like one of those weird,

2817
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:36,990
like super religious places.

2818
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,260
Yeah.

2819
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,093
Yeah.

2820
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,470
It's a strange area.

2821
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:42,060
It's a star.

2822
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,080
Very strange.

2823
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:43,914
Like,

2824
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:46,590
like you talk to people
about it and Branson,

2825
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:47,341
Missouri and people go,

2826
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:48,570
you're like,

2827
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:48,751
it's,

2828
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,940
it's not a place where like
Dave Chappelle goes to play.

2829
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,380
Do you go through those places?

2830
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:52,591
No,

2831
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:53,424
I do not.

2832
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:53,840
No,

2833
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,660
I do not.

2834
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,310
There's only so many places I go,

2835
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:57,840
I don't have any time to,

2836
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:58,470
I don't want to,

2837
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,980
you know,

2838
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,180
I'm not trying to run uphill.

2839
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,253
No.

2840
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:02,460
If you don't get it.

2841
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:02,590
Ah,

2842
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,270
that's all right.

2843
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,230
I'll go to Chicago.

2844
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:04,620
Okay.

2845
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,310
You know,

2846
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,100
I'll go somewhere where
people can get to it.

2847
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:07,591
Yeah.

2848
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,424
This just,

2849
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,420
I don't have time or not.

2850
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:11,250
What I'd concentrate on now.

2851
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:11,670
I mean,

2852
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,680
the ground's already been broken.

2853
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,221
Right.

2854
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,540
I'm not breaking any new ground.

2855
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,190
All I'm trying to do is write good stuff.

2856
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,821
Right.

2857
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:18,481
Good material,

2858
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:19,231
do good work,

2859
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:21,000
and I'm just trying to make people happy.

2860
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,050
I'm trying to make them laugh.

2861
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,890
That's all I'm trying to do.

2862
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,700
I just try to,

2863
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,940
when they go and they get a babysitter
and they come to a comedy club,

2864
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:28,380
I want to do my best.

2865
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,700
That's all I want to do.

2866
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:30,960
So that's all I think about.

2867
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:33,300
Do you still have a gavel?

2868
01:22:33,301 --> 01:22:36,930
A lot of like movie offers
and I get offers for stuff,

2869
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:37,764
but I don't act.

2870
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,150
I don't do it anymore.

2871
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,290
I tried it a little bit.

2872
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,370
It's just not my thing.

2873
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,080
It just takes time.

2874
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,130
It's not necessary.

2875
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:45,330
And all my friends that do it,

2876
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:45,481
you know,

2877
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:48,000
like my friend Brian just call me
from a movie set the other day.

2878
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:48,660
He goes,

2879
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:48,931
he goes,

2880
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:49,561
you're so right.

2881
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:50,394
Fuck this.

2882
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:50,761
He goes,

2883
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:52,610
I'm sitting in my trailer for 16 hours.

2884
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:52,921
He's like,

2885
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:54,120
I fucking hate this shit.

2886
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,410
I don't want to do this.

2887
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:57,840
I just got another offer for
another movie that's not that good.

2888
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:58,950
And I don't want to do that either.

2889
01:22:59,570 --> 01:22:59,790
You know,

2890
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,121
you could,

2891
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:04,260
you could do a movie and put so much
effort and time and do it and no one will

2892
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:04,960
see it.

2893
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,410
Like maybe it'll be opposite some fucking
big Avengers movie and nobody goes to

2894
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:08,921
see your movie.

2895
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:11,080
And it's out of the movie
theater and you're like,

2896
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:11,830
shit,

2897
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,410
I spent so much time doing that.

2898
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,111
No one cares.

2899
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:14,830
No one cares.

2900
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,790
The thing about movies too,

2901
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:18,130
that's interesting is
there so many of them.

2902
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,530
It's not like you're ever
going to see all the movies.

2903
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,890
There's so many movies and
every week there's new movies.

2904
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,500
If you really stop and think
about how fucking insane that is,

2905
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:30,070
there must be thousands and
thousands and thousands of movies.

2906
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:31,930
You can't possibly see the mall.

2907
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,820
Like if you just want to be entertained,

2908
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,520
like you could see movies
to the end of time.

2909
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:39,760
You could just sit in front of your
fucking Netflix and just to your eyes fall

2910
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:41,080
out of your head watching movies.

2911
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:41,710
It's crazy.

2912
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,930
It's almost no need to
make more movies were good,

2913
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,410
painless,

2914
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:44,990
crazy.

2915
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,660
Yeah,

2916
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:48,400
and it's crazy because movies are
getting bigger and bigger and bigger and

2917
01:23:48,401 --> 01:23:52,690
bigger because they have to bring you
something that takes you out of your

2918
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:53,524
house.

2919
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,790
People don't go to the movie
to watch Adam Sandler anymore.

2920
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,310
Then you want a fucking superhero
kicking your face in communion or neck.

2921
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,343
That's what they want.

2922
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,480
They won't fucking huge stuff.

2923
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,050
Yeah,

2924
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:05,561
there's that.

2925
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:08,860
But then people do need
comedies like Kevin Hart movies.

2926
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:10,300
They still sell really well.

2927
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,490
Like people still want
to see something funny,

2928
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:12,971
you know,

2929
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:13,630
that's,

2930
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,620
people still need,

2931
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,710
it's one of the things about standup
and one of the things about funny movies

2932
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:20,860
too is that people need a
break from the grind of life.

2933
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,200
Life is a horrible grind,

2934
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:23,441
you know,

2935
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:24,910
it's fucking hard man.

2936
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:29,350
It's hard to pay your bills and get up
every morning to a job you don't want to

2937
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:32,230
get up to and maybe not even
into being married anymore.

2938
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,150
And you've got to fucking
trudge through that.

2939
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,990
Cause maybe you have a children and you
decided that it's better to stay for

2940
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:41,900
your children and you're fucking living
in hell and your neighbors are current

2941
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:44,260
and the dog won't stop barking and,

2942
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,490
and then you just need something.

2943
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,750
Just something to give me something.

2944
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,560
Give me something funny,

2945
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:47,951
my friend.

2946
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:50,700
That's why I'm so optimistic
in life is like what,

2947
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,890
what a chance I have of pursuing my dream.

2948
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,490
Yeah.

2949
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:58,300
And doing comedy and making
people laugh and having fun.

2950
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:03,301
And I'll have to sit in a fucking fucking
share for eight hours a day and a new

2951
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:04,710
way,

2952
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:05,560
a job that I like.

2953
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:07,150
Because if you like to be an accountant,

2954
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,133
that's okay.

2955
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,710
Yeah.

2956
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,480
Be happy being an accountant.

2957
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:10,960
Sure.

2958
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,620
But uh,

2959
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,270
he w he was never for me.

2960
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:13,870
Yeah.

2961
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:14,703
It was never for me.

2962
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:15,250
No,

2963
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,410
it was never for me either
or any comedian that I know,

2964
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,830
everyone that I know was like doing
something and living in hell until they

2965
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:24,460
decided to be a comedian or the
thought of doing something else.

2966
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:25,361
But you know,

2967
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:26,080
that's,

2968
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,400
that's the path of life,

2969
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:27,671
right.

2970
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:28,840
The path of life is,

2971
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,060
for some people what we do would be hell.

2972
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:31,691
You know,

2973
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:36,190
for some people that are introverts or
that they don't like attention or they

2974
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,960
don't like public speaking and they don't,

2975
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:39,700
they're not necessarily funny.

2976
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,200
What we do as hell.

2977
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,210
If you're wearing a funny person,

2978
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,450
you don't know how to make people laugh
and you have to go on stage and make

2979
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:47,560
people laugh every night.

2980
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:51,880
That's your job and you have to try hard
or there's some sort of pain involved.

2981
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,103
Fuck,

2982
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,110
that'd be hell.

2983
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,500
Did you see?

2984
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:54,970
That was,

2985
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:55,661
that was me.

2986
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:57,410
The last few shows that I did in Brazil,

2987
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,380
I felt I felt heavy,

2988
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:00,190
heavy.

2989
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:01,510
If everyone's watching you,

2990
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,081
I fell.

2991
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:03,710
I fell that the energy,

2992
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,300
I still have very lawyer
artists and I'm fine law.

2993
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,980
They love me and I love them.

2994
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:11,180
We still have that connection,

2995
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,940
but I felt exposed,

2996
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,280
not exposed and that's when you,

2997
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,230
this is after the baby fuck Joe.

2998
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:18,980
Yeah.

2999
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,080
If after me becoming a baby fucker,

3000
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,471
but at the time,

3001
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,071
that was funny.

3002
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:25,850
Right when you said it.

3003
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,390
Everybody laughed.

3004
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,470
They laugh a lot.

3005
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,160
Yeah.

3006
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,030
That was not the case.

3007
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:33,440
My funny to take this joke out of
context and put it in the newspaper,

3008
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,551
even me,

3009
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:35,271
when I read that,

3010
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:35,721
I was like,

3011
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:38,360
this guy is fucking smashed up.

3012
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:41,870
The rape joke that I did
when I ran on a newspaper,

3013
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:42,890
that was the rape joke.

3014
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:43,731
Oh Man,

3015
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:44,960
do you really want me to go that?

3016
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,020
We referenced it 20 times.

3017
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:47,811
He was bad.

3018
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:49,170
He was something like a,

3019
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,480
I was watching on TV and I don't,

3020
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:54,320
I'm not proud of that.

3021
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:54,531
Okay.

3022
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:55,850
But I was watching on TV,

3023
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,200
this woman then she was saying
that she was raped and uh,

3024
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,111
it was bad.

3025
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:01,400
It was a very bad experience.

3026
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:01,491
You,

3027
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:02,850
she was crying but the camera was,

3028
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,190
wasn't showing her face.

3029
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:05,840
It was just showing her mouth.

3030
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,210
And she has a huge mustache,

3031
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,120
like a huge mustache,

3032
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,630
like a fucking lot of hair.

3033
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,410
And I made this joke a ball.

3034
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,283
Well this guy,

3035
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:14,870
he wasn't,

3036
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:15,680
he wasn't,

3037
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,150
uh,

3038
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:16,983
this was,

3039
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,120
this was kind of a gift
because she didn't,

3040
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,380
she wouldn't have another
opportunity or something.

3041
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:21,681
It was,

3042
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:22,514
it wasn't good.

3043
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,750
But I did once,

3044
01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:28,751
I was just testing the joke I was doing
at one o'clock at night in my comedy

3045
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:30,140
club.

3046
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,880
It was like 20 people in the audience.

3047
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:32,780
So you're just fucking around.

3048
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,040
I was just fucking around there.

3049
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,340
Well,

3050
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,050
it was what I saw on TV.

3051
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:38,090
So they were waiting for you
to do something like that.

3052
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,740
And it was like this journalist was,

3053
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,570
was there and he was doing a story
for the rolling stone and I was doing,

3054
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,240
it was a story about
me and then the cover,

3055
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:48,110
and it wasn't in the cover,

3056
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:48,391
but the,

3057
01:27:48,391 --> 01:27:48,491
the,

3058
01:27:48,491 --> 01:27:51,740
the picture on the cornerstone
was me dressed as Jesus,

3059
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:55,190
like bleeding with a crown in all my head.

3060
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,870
And that was the,

3061
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:57,440
in the,

3062
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,170
in the text was this rape joke.

3063
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,063
It was draped joke.

3064
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:01,971
I didn't even ride.

3065
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:03,870
The thing was just like
talking with Yardi,

3066
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,420
but when that's,

3067
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,070
that was taken out of context,

3068
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,020
he was hard for me to explain to them,

3069
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:09,740
okay,

3070
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,590
this is was me fucking
around with like 20 people.

3071
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:18,180
The people couldn't see the
difference between me doing any,

3072
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,380
wasn't a good yoga at all.

3073
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,840
It's not as something that I'm proud of,

3074
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:24,140
but when you're on a stage
on your test and some thanks,

3075
01:28:24,141 --> 01:28:25,340
just shit comes up.

3076
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,160
And I was testing boundaries as well.

3077
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:30,650
I think it was my duty to test some stuff.

3078
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,090
Uh,

3079
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:35,330
there's things that you say where you're
not thinking them out because your ad

3080
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:38,480
living in the moment and they come out
and even you disagree with them as you're

3081
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,314
saying.

3082
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,140
But this is part of the
process of creating material,

3083
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,330
especially if there's
20 people in the crowd.

3084
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:45,164
It's late at night.

3085
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,510
Like what you do things just to see,

3086
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:48,770
you go down doors,

3087
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:49,820
you open doors,

3088
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,510
you don't know what's in there and
sometimes you'll say something and then

3089
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:57,050
you'll have the fucking perfect
line and it comes out of nowhere.

3090
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,960
And the only way you find out is
if you take a chance doing it.

3091
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,810
Yeah.

3092
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,100
That's why I think it's

3093
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,791
so fair.

3094
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:07,791
And I was having a discussion with two
great big comedians about the Louis sad

3095
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,940
that he did recently.

3096
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,550
And I think you already talked about this,

3097
01:29:14,551 --> 01:29:15,384
but uh,

3098
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,760
the guy was testing stuff.

3099
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,480
Yeah.

3100
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,360
So how can you judge if
the work is not done?

3101
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,620
It's not even close to done.

3102
01:29:22,621 --> 01:29:22,981
He probably,

3103
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:25,890
maybe it did that bit once before if that,

3104
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,280
you know.

3105
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,420
And the judgment was like,

3106
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,000
oh he has to address
what happened when him,

3107
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,490
I'm pretty sure he'll
wheel but not on that sat.

3108
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,370
Maybe he didn't address on
that set that not his special.

3109
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,200
When he has her special,

3110
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:39,090
that's when he framed the thing,

3111
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,160
okay that's my work.

3112
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,200
But if he's just testing stuff,

3113
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:44,700
you cannot judge by that.

3114
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:48,330
The problem is now everybody wants to
judge everything he does and they want to

3115
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,650
find him and watch him.

3116
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:54,120
And so now he has to institute this a
cell phone policy and all the comedy clubs

3117
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:54,600
he works out.

3118
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,080
We have to take your phone and put it
in a bag so that no one can get ahold of

3119
01:29:58,081 --> 01:29:58,321
it.

3120
01:29:58,321 --> 01:29:58,981
It's just a,

3121
01:29:58,981 --> 01:29:59,970
it's a real problem.

3122
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:01,440
He's got a real problem.

3123
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:05,850
And it's also a real problem for
creating comedy because if people don't

3124
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:08,580
understand that this is
what comedy is about,

3125
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:13,581
that comedy is about improvisation and
then boiling it down to what's good and

3126
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,070
then figuring out what's the
best way to express an idea.

3127
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,920
Cause sometimes you have an idea and
you'd know there's something there,

3128
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:20,970
but you don't know how to say it.

3129
01:30:20,971 --> 01:30:21,691
So you just check,

3130
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:23,580
take a chance on one way and then you go,

3131
01:30:23,581 --> 01:30:23,890
oh,

3132
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:24,960
that's the offensive.

3133
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:25,794
That's disgusting.

3134
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,360
But there's gotta be a way to do it.

3135
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,910
Let me find a better way to do.

3136
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:29,670
Of course.

3137
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:29,821
Yeah,

3138
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:31,530
there's many bits that I did.

3139
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:31,920
Um,

3140
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,251
like,

3141
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:32,700
uh,

3142
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:36,420
not my last special but the special
before where when I first started them,

3143
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:38,130
they were not doing well at all.

3144
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,330
They were not doing well at all.

3145
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:41,340
I had to figure out a
way to make them funny.

3146
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:42,750
Why didn't you CCED on them?

3147
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,580
Because I knew there was something there.

3148
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:46,040
I knew it was something there.

3149
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,670
Like for instance,

3150
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:50,010
I have this one bit on women,

3151
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:50,370
uh,

3152
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:53,730
and inventions and that women
don't invent a lot of things.

3153
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,930
And I took all long time for me
to figure out how to do that.

3154
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:01,920
And the best way to do that was to talk
about all the great things about women

3155
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:02,754
first.

3156
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,811
So I just had to,

3157
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:05,010
I had a talk about,

3158
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:05,541
you know,

3159
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:08,790
like the concept that
women are supposed to work,

3160
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,630
that we should,

3161
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,360
that women are supposed to
work as well as raise children,

3162
01:31:12,361 --> 01:31:14,650
which is fucking crazy
because raising children,

3163
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:17,700
and I'm not saying that every woman
should raise children and that they

3164
01:31:17,701 --> 01:31:18,480
shouldn't have a career.

3165
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,313
But if you,

3166
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,720
if you think that it's
easy to raise children,

3167
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:22,950
you're out of your fucking mind.

3168
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:26,310
It's one of the most difficult things in
the world to just to have the patients

3169
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,540
you're dealing with this little people,

3170
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:28,530
you have to teach them things,

3171
01:31:28,531 --> 01:31:29,160
you have to re,

3172
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,460
you have to give them love and
constant attention and it's very,

3173
01:31:32,461 --> 01:31:33,630
very time consuming.

3174
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:34,530
It's difficult or,

3175
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,160
and these women are making
people in their fucking bodies.

3176
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,440
It's the most incredible thing
that anyone's ever created.

3177
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,550
Humans,

3178
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:41,940
you make,

3179
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,830
you make humans in your body.

3180
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:44,131
I mean,

3181
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:44,964
that's insane.

3182
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,760
And I would go through this
whole thing and then I'd say,

3183
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,140
so ladies,

3184
01:31:49,141 --> 01:31:49,651
I love you.

3185
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:50,431
I think you're amazing,

3186
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:51,720
but let's be honest,

3187
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,040
you don't invent a lot of shit.

3188
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,600
And then I got into this whole thing
about women inventions and then I just

3189
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:59,950
talked about all the great
inventions women make.

3190
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,611
Okay.

3191
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,620
You sat at a different

3192
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:04,290
figure out how to do it.

3193
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,990
It took a while to figure out how to do
it where the women thought it was funny

3194
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,540
where I gave them enough honest,

3195
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:15,460
legitimate credit and said funny things
about them that are positive first so

3196
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:17,410
then they feel free to laugh.

3197
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,060
Yes,

3198
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,720
cause I'm not a dick.

3199
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,160
I just have a point that
women don't have a lot of shit

3200
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:27,790
outside of say I don't invent anything
that I had to get really clear about that

3201
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:28,600
and let's be clear,

3202
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,710
we're not talking about us.

3203
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:30,281
I go,

3204
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:30,521
look,

3205
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:31,510
I'm a fucking moron.

3206
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:32,350
I'm never invented shit.

3207
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:34,390
And I'm guessing you're
probably pretty dumb too,

3208
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:36,730
which is why you are here
listening to me talk.

3209
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:37,601
I was like,

3210
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:38,560
we're not talking about us.

3211
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:42,460
We're talking about inventors and so
I was trying to remove people from the

3212
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:45,370
tribal male versus female dynamic.

3213
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:50,370
Just to talk about the fact
that in history there have
not been like relatively

3214
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,600
a lot of women inventors.

3215
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:53,320
Got It.

3216
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,600
And so then they fell
and then they laughed.

3217
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,680
Then it was funny.

3218
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:57,101
It was like,

3219
01:32:57,101 --> 01:32:58,060
it worked out great.

3220
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,670
It was like closing bit is
the same thing with this.

3221
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:01,090
Uh,

3222
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:05,290
the joke that translated from
Portuguese to English and uh,

3223
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:09,160
I didn't have any problem doing this in
Portuguese because we don't have that

3224
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:11,140
much talking about race and stuff.

3225
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,090
He was not that one the n word,

3226
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,490
but he was a joke that I used to do that.

3227
01:33:15,491 --> 01:33:16,000
I was like,

3228
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,590
I saw this guy with a tee shirt,

3229
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:20,350
a written a hundred percent black.

3230
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:24,190
I was going to sprout off his face or run
because I find that to the palm of his

3231
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:28,150
hand and said 99% he smiled.

3232
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,950
That's said 98% that was
the joke that I was doing.

3233
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,720
And I had this joke here,

3234
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:34,554
but I just don't late it.

3235
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,410
It's like this little,

3236
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:35,840
right?

3237
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:36,090
Yeah,

3238
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:36,610
yeah.

3239
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:36,940
Do.

3240
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:39,790
So this is a case of jug
that I trust that it works.

3241
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:40,240
Yeah,

3242
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:40,751
because it's,

3243
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:41,021
well,

3244
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:42,630
rethink has a good punchline.

3245
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,540
It's everything,

3246
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,900
but people feel very uncomfortable who?

3247
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,520
Not The black people.

3248
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,320
The people that sit around.

3249
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:51,154
The black guy.

3250
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:52,220
That was,

3251
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:52,701
that was,

3252
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:53,050
that was,

3253
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:55,920
I thought it was funny
because it wasn't the human,

3254
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:56,920
he was like laughing.

3255
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,680
I think it's funny because
all of those people,

3256
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:02,830
they didn't feel that they were
entitled to laugh around you.

3257
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:05,653
Just kind of fun.

3258
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,750
He was a uncomfortable,

3259
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,450
but when I sat up as you know what,

3260
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,950
you talk about race too much and
we don't have that in Brazil,

3261
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:17,920
so sometimes there's
some misunderstandings.

3262
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:23,410
So when I put myself in that
position then I'm just just a mistake

3263
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,230
and I don't speak English.

3264
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,550
That's easy.

3265
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,750
That's what I get to.

3266
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:29,680
Yeah.

3267
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,940
That's what I eat when I,

3268
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:31,803
when I,

3269
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,960
when I'm free to do the same thing that
your did you set up in a different way?

3270
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:35,890
Well that's,

3271
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:38,890
that's a really interesting angle too
that really only someone from another

3272
01:34:38,891 --> 01:34:41,800
country can pursue this
angle that like you have,

3273
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,500
the America is a different
culture than you're used to,

3274
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:46,930
so that's probably so many differences.

3275
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:47,321
Oh yeah.

3276
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:48,790
He does a lot of differences.

3277
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:49,840
Freaking Kardashians.

3278
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:51,700
I don't know how you
guys squash that shit.

3279
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,140
It's just like he's like for
cheeks fucking hanging around.

3280
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:56,770
Then we are like,

3281
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:58,670
I [inaudible]

3282
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:00,290
has nothing to it.

3283
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:02,990
The celebrity thing here fucking that's,

3284
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,220
that's amazing.

3285
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:08,560
Do you have Instagram celebrities
and youtube celebrities in Brazil?

3286
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,973
Same kind of thing.

3287
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:10,700
Yeah.

3288
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:10,910
You,

3289
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:11,271
yeah,

3290
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:14,870
we do have a lot of them and people
playing video games and kids.

3291
01:35:14,871 --> 01:35:18,170
My kid watch plead people
playing video games.

3292
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:18,710
Yes.

3293
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,490
The same thing.

3294
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:20,330
It's huge over here.

3295
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:20,751
Yeah.

3296
01:35:20,751 --> 01:35:23,930
I know people make millions of
dollars playing video games.

3297
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:27,400
Crazy like parents tell
their kids don't be a loser.

3298
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:29,990
Play video games like wait a minute,

3299
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:30,621
what are you talking about?

3300
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:32,990
These kids are making millions
of dollars and what is a loser?

3301
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:37,991
You work all fucking year for 50 grand
and this guy is making $500,000 a week

3302
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:41,510
planned youtube playing fucking videos.

3303
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:42,981
Twitter.

3304
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:46,970
It's fucking crazy and youtube gives
give you much more money than he does in

3305
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:47,804
Brazil.

3306
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,120
But we have the same
speech of like I have my,

3307
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:54,020
this youtube channel called Isla Jabara
was in Brazil and we are having a lot of

3308
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:54,854
problems with,

3309
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:58,700
we are to getting not monetizing
our videos is the same thing.

3310
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,583
Oh yeah.

3311
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:04,340
We are suffering to the same problems
that they don't know exactly what to do

3312
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:08,480
because advertisers are very wary about
certain content and so they have these

3313
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:12,980
deals with these advertisers and so
they're trying to suppress content because

3314
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:14,180
they don't want to minimize,

3315
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:15,980
they don't want to lose revenue.

3316
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:19,040
So what they're trying to do
is make advertisers happy,

3317
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:21,620
but then the content creators
feel like they're being censored.

3318
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,540
I mean they are being censored,

3319
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:25,790
but they have to understand
what's happening here like this,

3320
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,150
this,

3321
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:27,470
all this stuff costs money.

3322
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,930
Do you get some of your
readers all the time?

3323
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:30,921
All the time.

3324
01:36:30,921 --> 01:36:31,710
Fuck man,

3325
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:31,910
that's,

3326
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:32,030
yeah,

3327
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,050
they get demonetized.

3328
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:34,460
They get demonetized.

3329
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:36,170
If we talk about specific subjects,

3330
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,460
all subjects as well.

3331
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:37,820
Yup.

3332
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,220
Yup.

3333
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:38,350
Well,

3334
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:39,500
not even showing images,

3335
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:41,090
just talking about the subjects,

3336
01:36:41,091 --> 01:36:41,960
just subjects.

3337
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:44,690
And we've talked about them and we've,

3338
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:46,310
we've complained about it a little,

3339
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,031
but basically,

3340
01:36:47,031 --> 01:36:47,211
I mean,

3341
01:36:47,211 --> 01:36:47,680
Jamie,

3342
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,930
we kind of take this attitude
was nothing we could do.

3343
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,430
We just kind of keep on trucking.

3344
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,740
You could just keep doing it.

3345
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,170
Yeah.

3346
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,210
Because you're building
much more than just,

3347
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:56,451
yeah.

3348
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:58,970
That money is not your main,

3349
01:36:58,971 --> 01:36:59,721
it's something,

3350
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:00,400
it's money.

3351
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:00,710
It,

3352
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,543
you know,

3353
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:04,850
it could be thousands of dollars for
each one that they don't monetize.

3354
01:37:04,851 --> 01:37:06,440
But that's not how I,

3355
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,180
I don't think about it that way.

3356
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:09,080
I think about it like,

3357
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,261
well,

3358
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:10,094
what's important,

3359
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:13,890
what's important is to just
say what's on your mind and uh,

3360
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,833
whatever.

3361
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:15,051
I mean,

3362
01:37:15,051 --> 01:37:19,110
I'm not going to change just so that
I get more youtube ad money dead.

3363
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,500
That would ruin whatever I'm doing.

3364
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,670
So I think they're going to work
it out in a better way eventually.

3365
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,640
But there's also a thing
called a youtube red.

3366
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,170
And with youtube red,

3367
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:31,880
even if things get demonetized,

3368
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:35,360
the people that are paying for
youtube see you pay for you to read.

3369
01:37:35,361 --> 01:37:37,910
So you never get any advertisers and the,

3370
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,480
you still like if you got a
certain amount of people that are,

3371
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:44,360
I think 50% of our revenue
comes from youtube,

3372
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:45,194
red

3373
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,550
to various video to video time watched,

3374
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:50,420
kind of cumulative.

3375
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:51,710
So there's,

3376
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:54,530
there's a lot of people are saying,

3377
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:54,741
look,

3378
01:37:54,741 --> 01:37:57,360
I'd rather pay x amount of
dollars per month and don't,

3379
01:37:57,361 --> 01:37:58,320
don't put any ads.

3380
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,690
And so I think we're moving towards that,

3381
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,190
that sort of,

3382
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,110
that model.

3383
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,650
But I understand the process as well.

3384
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:07,350
That is brands and
they're paying the bills.

3385
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:07,581
You know,

3386
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:09,780
that Google is not a ton free,

3387
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,673
isn't the free,

3388
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,431
it's all,

3389
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:11,851
all of it.

3390
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:13,650
It's expensive and they're
trying to make money too.

3391
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:17,640
So like the only reason for them to allow
someone like you or I to put a video

3392
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,290
up as they want to be
able to profit from it,

3393
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:20,330
send me to,

3394
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:22,450
they're not providing a
service just because they're,

3395
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,700
they're good people.

3396
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,050
They're trying to make money.

3397
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:25,680
So yeah.

3398
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,680
But the thing which is a just easier for
us is that our revenue comes from shows

3399
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:32,730
and we can do a lot of different stuff,

3400
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:33,230
but they're stupid.

3401
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:35,670
They actually get their
money from you too.

3402
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,300
Yes.

3403
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:37,710
That's the one that are getting hurt.

3404
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,920
Well in the United States the real issue
is a conservative speakers cause all

3405
01:38:43,021 --> 01:38:44,130
these tech companies,

3406
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:46,440
whether it's youtube or
Facebook or what have you,

3407
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:48,000
they all lean left.

3408
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,470
They're all very left wing.

3409
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:54,330
So right wing people feel like they
get censored off of all these platforms

3410
01:38:54,331 --> 01:38:56,850
before other ones maybe less on Facebook.

3411
01:38:56,851 --> 01:38:57,061
Right.

3412
01:38:57,061 --> 01:38:57,990
Because Facebook,

3413
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:58,410
they,

3414
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:02,010
they actually make money off of
people paying attention to shit.

3415
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,080
So the more people argue about stuff,

3416
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:06,900
probably the more more
eyes they get the money.

3417
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:09,750
Did they get the most of their
money is people paying you,

3418
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,320
paying you Facebook to
promote their content?

3419
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,633
Like yeah.

3420
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,000
And Facebook doesn't,

3421
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,530
you don't make money off of Facebook.

3422
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:16,651
Right.

3423
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:20,320
Is there anybody making money off
of Facebook blog posts or yeah,

3424
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:23,250
these people want that
is monetizing videos,

3425
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:23,770
videos.

3426
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:24,571
It's very recent,

3427
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:25,620
but not like writing.

3428
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:29,100
Like say if you wrote an essay and they
wouldn't pay for that specifically,

3429
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,040
but that's where like there's a lot of,

3430
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:36,750
a lot of people like to comment on things
and argue about things and so if you

3431
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:40,440
have something controversial on Facebook
that's probably value in that because

3432
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,730
you're going to get more eyeballs.

3433
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:42,570
Right.

3434
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,640
There's a lot of value in controversy.

3435
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:46,560
It's just like what kind of controversy?

3436
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,120
So for Youtube,

3437
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:53,121
the big thing is they
like if you have like uh,

3438
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,500
well specifically Twitter,

3439
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,370
Twitter's been,

3440
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,070
they've had big issues with it.

3441
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,031
Instagram,

3442
01:40:00,031 --> 01:40:01,560
not so much with conservative people.

3443
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:02,130
Right.

3444
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,180
You don't hear that as much?

3445
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,051
I don't think so.

3446
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:04,710
No.

3447
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:05,940
It's more of a Twitter,

3448
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,950
youtube thing and it's conservatives feel
like they're being pushed out because

3449
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:16,350
almost overwhelmingly all the
tech companies are liberal.

3450
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:20,700
They're all very left wing
and very pro gay rights,

3451
01:40:20,701 --> 01:40:21,540
Trans Rights.

3452
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:22,081
Like there's a,

3453
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:26,460
there's an example of this one woman
who's a feminist who said that a woman is

3454
01:40:26,461 --> 01:40:28,380
not a man or a man is not a woman.

3455
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:33,420
So like a trans woman who used to
be a man and turn into a woman.

3456
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:36,270
Her take is a man is never a woman.

3457
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:37,143
Okay.

3458
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,300
And so they told that
you got to remove this.

3459
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:42,780
She removed it and then apparently took
a screenshot of it and posted it up

3460
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:43,230
again.

3461
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:43,621
She was like,

3462
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:43,891
okay,

3463
01:40:43,891 --> 01:40:44,521
I'll delete that.

3464
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:46,110
And she took a screenshot
and then posted it again,

3465
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:46,201
like,

3466
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:47,034
fuck you.

3467
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:50,040
And so then they banned there for
life and now she's suing that woman.

3468
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:50,820
Megan,

3469
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,653
what is her name?

3470
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:52,590
Um,

3471
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:53,423
I forget her.

3472
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:57,600
I got it right here because someone just
sent me something to Sam Harris just

3473
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:58,630
sent me something about it today.

3474
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,740
Um,

3475
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,060
her name is,

3476
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:02,020
uh,

3477
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,460
uh,

3478
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,293
Megan Murphy.

3479
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:07,120
So she's a feminist and she's just like,

3480
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:07,301
look,

3481
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:08,560
you can't just become a woman.

3482
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,280
Fuck off.

3483
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:09,700
Nope.

3484
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:10,331
And so they're like,

3485
01:41:10,331 --> 01:41:11,141
you're banned for life.

3486
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:11,801
And then everybody's like,

3487
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:11,921
well,

3488
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:12,401
you're crazy.

3489
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:13,061
You can't banner,

3490
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:13,900
which she's got an opinion.

3491
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,550
How come she can't have that opinion?

3492
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:18,520
Like if that's a biological opinion,

3493
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:19,810
I mean it might be controversial,

3494
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:20,591
it might be rude,

3495
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:21,371
it might be insensitive,

3496
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:22,450
but it's the same process.

3497
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:25,660
Joe Is the same thing that I lived in
Brazil is like it's the sponsor doesn't

3498
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:26,710
want you to say that.

3499
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,060
How can you argue it?

3500
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,150
I don't think that's a sponsor issue
because this is Twitter because I don't

3501
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:32,050
think that's a sponsor.

3502
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,170
Sure.

3503
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:35,430
I think this is a left weaning
corporation was decided bald.

3504
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:35,740
Okay.

3505
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:39,280
They've decided to censor certain type
of speech that they think is offensive

3506
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:44,140
and she was apparently saying it to
the person who was a trans person.

3507
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:46,330
Like a a man is never a woman.

3508
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:48,820
And by saying that to the Trans Person,

3509
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:50,920
they're saying that and it
was like targeted harassment.

3510
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:55,000
But don't you think that the end of the
process edis about money because you

3511
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:56,740
think tweeter care that much.

3512
01:41:56,741 --> 01:41:57,281
I saw the,

3513
01:41:57,281 --> 01:42:01,000
the Twitter guy here for me to
look that he cared about Bush,

3514
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:01,271
about,

3515
01:42:01,271 --> 01:42:02,104
about uh,

3516
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:06,490
a bold the speech side of things
because there are companies,

3517
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:10,750
sole date they have to pay their bills
and they have to bring sponsors and even

3518
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:14,370
brands that are more left
sided hearing this country.

3519
01:42:14,371 --> 01:42:16,120
So cause that's where it's sensitive,

3520
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:16,351
right?

3521
01:42:16,351 --> 01:42:17,140
Cause that's where you can,

3522
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,340
you can get boycotted there.

3523
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,470
I think there's definitely something
to what you're saying that,

3524
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:21,320
but I think also,

3525
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:21,910
well yeah,

3526
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:25,240
if you're a CEO of a major corporation
like Twitter or something like that,

3527
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:26,870
you are responsible to stockholders.

3528
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,440
You're responsible to all the
people that work on the board,

3529
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,293
the your truck,

3530
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:30,820
your,

3531
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,170
if you want to stay CEO,

3532
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,660
you got to continue to make
more and more money every year.

3533
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,460
You got to bring more
people to the platform,

3534
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:40,120
make the platform more popular and
make more money and in their eyes,

3535
01:42:40,121 --> 01:42:43,540
the way to do that and to maximize
that is to limit harassment,

3536
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,441
limit things to this.

3537
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:46,510
These are our social decisions,

3538
01:42:46,511 --> 01:42:47,021
but they're also,

3539
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:50,200
business strategies are two different
things together at the same time.

3540
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:51,251
Yeah.

3541
01:42:51,251 --> 01:42:52,030
So it's uh,

3542
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,260
it's fucking complex.

3543
01:42:53,261 --> 01:42:54,040
Manky yeah.

3544
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,450
And they don't know what
the fuck they're doing.

3545
01:42:55,451 --> 01:42:56,810
This is uncharted territory.

3546
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,130
No,

3547
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,870
there's never been a
thing like Twitter before.

3548
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,460
There's never been a thing
like Facebook before.

3549
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:03,730
We're complete uncharted
territory in 2019,

3550
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:04,660
but it's amazing,

3551
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:04,901
man.

3552
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:09,901
It is amazing to see people like you
and me creating our own channels.

3553
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:12,550
We are our old ndcs.

3554
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:13,210
Oh yeah.

3555
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:15,670
So we don't have to
depend on that that much.

3556
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:16,320
You just,

3557
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,350
you'll feel free.

3558
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,840
That's when creativity comes up.

3559
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:21,220
That's one.

3560
01:43:21,221 --> 01:43:22,960
People are start to be creative.

3561
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:26,830
That's when new stuff that's
so it becomes a threat as well.

3562
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:27,161
Well,

3563
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:29,350
when you stop and think
about the sheer impact,

3564
01:43:29,351 --> 01:43:29,820
like what?

3565
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:33,820
What was the number that our channel
Gut in terms of minutes watched?

3566
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,810
What was that number?

3567
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:39,300
Looked for shit for the year.

3568
01:43:39,301 --> 01:43:43,620
For last year it was 16.1
billion minutes watched.

3569
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:49,520
That's more than every human on
the planet watching it a minute.

3570
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:51,970
Think of isn't it crazy?

3571
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,720
Way More.

3572
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:57,720
That's more than double every human
on the planet watching for a minute.

3573
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,230
Fuck yeah.

3574
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:01,500
I guess it has some fans,

3575
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:02,510
but there's not even that.

3576
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:04,310
It's just that's the impact.

3577
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,440
The impact of that is insane.

3578
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,610
You know,

3579
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:08,930
negative and positive,

3580
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:09,920
pro and con,

3581
01:44:09,921 --> 01:44:10,431
all of it.

3582
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:11,264
The whole thing.

3583
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,111
It's like the,

3584
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:17,090
the amount of content that gets put out
there and the amount of interactions and

3585
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,340
the amount of debate that
comes from that content.

3586
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:20,174
It's just,

3587
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,140
it doesn't make any sense.

3588
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:21,711
And for me,

3589
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:23,120
the only thing I could
do is just walk away.

3590
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:24,260
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

3591
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:26,500
I just throw it out there and
get the fuck away from it.

3592
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:27,730
You don't read anything,

3593
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,911
read Shit.

3594
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:29,331
I couldn't.

3595
01:44:29,331 --> 01:44:29,800
You can go,

3596
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,350
oh no.

3597
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:31,910
You get caught up in all of it.

3598
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:32,360
You get,

3599
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,000
you would get caught up in the
negative or maybe even worse,

3600
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,070
caught up in the positive
people kiss your ass.

3601
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:37,940
You start believing it.

3602
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:38,810
So I just put,

3603
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:42,950
I try to be humble and if there's
an overwhelming negative reaction,

3604
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,791
I hear about it.

3605
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:46,200
Having to try to adjust
and address it and,

3606
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:48,100
and respect the,

3607
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:52,040
I'm in this unique position where I
do have this weird sort of a platform.

3608
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:53,600
I'll start with talking about the,

3609
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:58,550
that you thought that you were in
that informed to do the Twitter guy.

3610
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:58,701
Yeah.

3611
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:01,250
That's why I brought Tim Poolan
because Tim's a good guy.

3612
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:01,851
He's a good friend.

3613
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:03,260
Isabelle and math came in Brazil.

3614
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:05,950
She went there to cover our protests.

3615
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:06,680
Oh really?

3616
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,160
Yeah.

3617
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:07,281
No,

3618
01:45:07,281 --> 01:45:09,050
he's on legitimate investigative,

3619
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:12,920
independent journalist and a
real honorable guy and honest,

3620
01:45:12,921 --> 01:45:14,810
intelligent and well informed.

3621
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:17,840
So I knew he was the perfect guy and
we're going to do some other things.

3622
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:18,260
He and I,

3623
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:20,260
we got something that's going
to blow people away when,

3624
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,141
when that happens.

3625
01:45:21,141 --> 01:45:21,661
That was good.

3626
01:45:21,661 --> 01:45:22,060
Yeah,

3627
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:22,540
it's this,

3628
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,630
he sent me a message yesterday.

3629
01:45:23,631 --> 01:45:25,040
Oh side that you're going into a row goes.

3630
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:25,431
I was like,

3631
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:25,891
yeah,

3632
01:45:25,891 --> 01:45:26,300
yeah,

3633
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:26,481
yeah.

3634
01:45:26,481 --> 01:45:27,560
I can't talk about it right now,

3635
01:45:27,561 --> 01:45:31,400
but we've got something cooking that
might have changed to the those teams.

3636
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:32,130
Real.

3637
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:33,740
I still don't have to do some things.

3638
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,470
There's some things he
focused on her kids,

3639
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:38,840
well,

3640
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,800
they're in school right now.

3641
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:40,873
See the thing is,

3642
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,960
this happens whether in school and
then comedy happens whether asleep.

3643
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:45,530
So I have it down to a science.

3644
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:46,220
Yeah.

3645
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,760
So what it is is they go to school.

3646
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,230
Okay.

3647
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:50,150
I get up with them to AA there.

3648
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:53,380
I take them to school and my wife takes
him to school and then I go either work

3649
01:45:53,381 --> 01:45:53,960
out either.

3650
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,870
I do yoga or lift weights or
Jujitsu or whatever in the morning.

3651
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,070
Then I come here,

3652
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,020
I'm done in the afternoon.

3653
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:02,720
Then I hang out with them
until it's time to eat.

3654
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:05,780
We eat dinner and then
after dinner they go to bed.

3655
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,070
They go to bed like eight o'clock.

3656
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:11,210
I don't do a set until 10 so I leave
the house after that and then you know,

3657
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:13,430
I can go there and my wife
was happy to get rid of me,

3658
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,660
come to the comedy store,

3659
01:46:15,661 --> 01:46:16,960
hanging out and then I,

3660
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,200
so it works.

3661
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:20,600
I got it down to a science I want to,

3662
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:22,400
that's the life that I want to.

3663
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:27,050
Oh fortunately my wife left while
you were talking about that.

3664
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:28,160
If you want to talk about that.

3665
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:28,740
I do.

3666
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:31,460
I don't care cause it's
kind of a crazy story.

3667
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,850
I actually say this little stages,

3668
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:33,650
the line that flicks.

3669
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:34,483
Oh really?

3670
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:35,180
Yeah.

3671
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,730
And my wife left before a cult.

3672
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:39,500
She joined a cult.

3673
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:41,570
He was crazy.

3674
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,493
He will ask,

3675
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:43,640
you will ask man.

3676
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,230
But it's like one of
those self help culture.

3677
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,083
Yes.

3678
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,360
But it is a cult.

3679
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:48,590
There's a lot of cults.

3680
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,890
It's dangerous.

3681
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:54,810
When one person starts telling another
person how you must live your life,

3682
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,190
these are the principles.

3683
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:57,240
This is what you have to do.

3684
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:58,740
You have to leave your family.

3685
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:00,330
You have to quit your job.

3686
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,830
You have to change the way you dress.

3687
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:03,150
You have to change the way you talk.

3688
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:04,410
You have to do this and do that.

3689
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:09,480
When someone tells you that and they
get a mass group of people to do things

3690
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,080
like that,

3691
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:14,490
it becomes very dangerous
sometimes is not that direct.

3692
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,470
Sometimes it's just like,

3693
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:17,280
okay.

3694
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:17,581
Uh,

3695
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:22,581
what was difficult is that her cult
was teaching her that you got to love

3696
01:47:23,161 --> 01:47:24,360
everybody the same,

3697
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,090
which is awesome if you think about it.

3698
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,020
Jesus did that.

3699
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:29,480
I think it was the only one who did that.

3700
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:31,530
Jesus was the only one who was like,

3701
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:32,364
I don't care.

3702
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:34,170
I'm not going to have kids.

3703
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:34,490
Right?

3704
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,090
I'm going to think this
prostitute over here.

3705
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:36,953
And that's okay.

3706
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:37,843
That was his life.

3707
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,903
And uh,

3708
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,410
for my,

3709
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,250
uh,

3710
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:41,590
she,

3711
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,151
when she got,

3712
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,470
when you'll learn that you,

3713
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:44,611
when you were learned at,

3714
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:46,380
you have to love everybody the same.

3715
01:47:46,381 --> 01:47:51,381
Why are you going to focus just one man
in a marriage and you have to go home

3716
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:53,634
and uh,

3717
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,600
you kind of fall,

3718
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,250
leave your life to yourself.

3719
01:47:56,940 --> 01:48:01,450
Or maybe she didn't love me anymore
and I'm fucking blaming the on baby.

3720
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:03,130
That would be the two as what happened.

3721
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,850
Some people are very easily influenced,

3722
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,560
you know that that is a real,

3723
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,400
the real issue.

3724
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:11,370
And I worry about that sometimes when
I talk to people cause like some people

3725
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:11,551
say,

3726
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:12,330
hey man,

3727
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:12,811
well they say,

3728
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:13,021
hey,

3729
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:13,830
you changed my life.

3730
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:14,071
I'm like,

3731
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:14,791
listen motherfucker,

3732
01:48:14,791 --> 01:48:15,624
I didn't change shit.

3733
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,553
You changed your life.

3734
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:16,891
I go,

3735
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:17,724
I don't even know yet.

3736
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:18,990
I did not change your life.

3737
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:19,950
Don't listen to me.

3738
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:22,320
All I'm doing is talking
to a bunch of people.

3739
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,330
All of these people
have something to offer.

3740
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,440
Everyone has something to offer,

3741
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:26,274
but it's not me.

3742
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,660
I'm an antenna.

3743
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,410
Okay,

3744
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:28,740
I'm,

3745
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:28,990
I'm,

3746
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:29,340
I'm,

3747
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:29,580
I'm,

3748
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,000
I'm in a,

3749
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,250
if I'm saying something that
resonates with you and it helps you,

3750
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,310
I'm very happy but don't listen to me.

3751
01:48:35,311 --> 01:48:37,810
Like I know everything I think is
awesome that you're doing that.

3752
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:42,780
But because you know the power that is
half and how you could actually influence

3753
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,190
a being flinched in their lives,

3754
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:46,080
in the band.

3755
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,980
Very careful of people that do tell you
that they have the answers and they're

3756
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:53,310
the one and they're the smart ones and
you need to listen to them because that

3757
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:58,200
those people are fucking dangerous
because they can get you to do things that

3758
01:48:58,201 --> 01:48:59,250
are irreversible.

3759
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,780
They can get you to leave your family,

3760
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:01,620
they can get you to,

3761
01:49:01,621 --> 01:49:01,981
you know,

3762
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:05,850
to join this fucking commune and
give up all your worldly belongings.

3763
01:49:05,851 --> 01:49:08,040
And you realize years later
where they're fucking crazy.

3764
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:09,031
Like that wild,

3765
01:49:09,031 --> 01:49:11,540
wild country documentary that
we were talking about us crazy.

3766
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,991
They didn't really,

3767
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:16,620
I mean these people were the Hollywood
fucking executives and producers,

3768
01:49:16,621 --> 01:49:19,260
millionaires know people
that look like on paper,

3769
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:22,860
they have their life in order and they
want to go and where the red clothes and

3770
01:49:22,861 --> 01:49:23,830
the beads and,

3771
01:49:23,831 --> 01:49:24,081
and,

3772
01:49:24,081 --> 01:49:25,920
and be a part of this fucking movement.

3773
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:27,540
People need a reason to leave.

3774
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:30,810
People need explanation for
things that they cannot explain.

3775
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:36,150
And when there's someone that had no
thinks that they know the answers,

3776
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:37,320
they can,

3777
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:37,470
uh,

3778
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,330
they can lie because it's the easiest.

3779
01:49:39,331 --> 01:49:43,230
It's now going to have someone that
is going to save if it's true or not.

3780
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:44,040
Yeah.

3781
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,920
That's also the danger of a platform
and that's the danger of something like

3782
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,860
even this podcast,

3783
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:49,600
the danger of any platform.

3784
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:53,920
Anytime we have one person that's talking
in front of a microphone and everyone

3785
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:54,760
else is listening,

3786
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:55,720
it's a,

3787
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,200
it's,

3788
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:01,200
it's a weird position to be in and you
hear this person through your ear phones

3789
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:04,870
or through your computer screen
and you start thinking that,

3790
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:08,350
that they're making sense and that
they're right because there's no one to

3791
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,030
counter what they're
saying in front of them.

3792
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:11,710
There's no one with opposing opinions.

3793
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:13,930
There's no one and you,

3794
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:14,390
you,

3795
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:15,220
you can get written,

3796
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:18,400
they can get wrapped up in this
position of being a leader as well.

3797
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:21,580
People get intoxicated by being a leader,

3798
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:22,181
you know,

3799
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:22,630
being a,

3800
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:22,991
I mean I,

3801
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:25,330
I've seen it with people
that just teach martial arts.

3802
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:29,410
A lot of martial arts classes turn
into like very cult like places.

3803
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:30,311
I noticed that,

3804
01:50:30,311 --> 01:50:35,311
especially before the UFC came around
because everyone really legitimately

3805
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:38,200
believe that their martial arts instructor
could kill everyone on the planet.

3806
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:42,140
Everyone really believed that and they'll
like the eighties and the nineties and

3807
01:50:42,141 --> 01:50:42,610
rice,

3808
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:45,270
they should them that it
was not through voice,

3809
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:48,730
always crazy change the fucking world.

3810
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,451
He really did.

3811
01:50:49,451 --> 01:50:52,900
He changed the whole world and he changed
our perception of what martial arts

3812
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:54,610
are and what's effective and what's not.

3813
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,661
But before that,

3814
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:55,871
I mean,

3815
01:50:55,871 --> 01:50:57,670
I grew up in a taekwondo school,

3816
01:50:57,671 --> 01:51:00,700
which was very disciplined in
everything everyone was sir,

3817
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,511
like a,

3818
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:04,840
you would call everyone Mr.
Smith or you know Mr O'malley,

3819
01:51:04,841 --> 01:51:05,171
everyone.

3820
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:06,004
Mr. Kim.

3821
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:07,151
Yes sir.

3822
01:51:07,151 --> 01:51:08,230
If someone said something to me,

3823
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:09,190
I would always say yes sir.

3824
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:09,880
Yes sir.

3825
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,050
And it was always bowing.

3826
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,140
It was very strict and very disciplined.

3827
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,810
And I came from a very good school,

3828
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:19,450
but I was around a lot of
schools that weren't good.

3829
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:22,360
I saw a lot of very cult like behavior.

3830
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:27,130
There was a lot of men who would take
advantage sexually of their students and

3831
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:27,521
they would,

3832
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:27,850
you know,

3833
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:31,150
they would do weird shit to their students
and they would be almost like running

3834
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:32,230
a little sex cult.

3835
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:34,670
It was a lot of were
talking about your stroke or

3836
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:38,020
karate school across schools.

3837
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:39,400
Kung Fu schools.

3838
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:40,000
That's crazy.

3839
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,350
We all knew about that.

3840
01:51:41,351 --> 01:51:43,090
And some of them wound up going to jail.

3841
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:43,720
I knew,

3842
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:44,980
I knew guys that went to jail.

3843
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:46,240
They went to jail for rape.

3844
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,230
Yeah.

3845
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:47,741
And they,

3846
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:49,330
there was people that like,

3847
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:54,040
they were in these positions of power
where their students looked at them like a

3848
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:56,350
god and they took advantage of it.

3849
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:57,790
And this is,

3850
01:51:57,791 --> 01:51:58,390
uh,

3851
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,860
this is the same thing.

3852
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,900
It's the same thing as what
we're talking about here.

3853
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,080
When one person has too much
power and influence in a platform,

3854
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:08,500
one of the beautiful things about
your Jitsu is it's in formality.

3855
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:09,460
Like when,

3856
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,320
like my instructor John Jacques Machado,

3857
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,420
he's the friendliest,

3858
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:14,890
nicest guy.

3859
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,540
He's a world champion.

3860
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:16,961
I mean,

3861
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:18,700
he's super respected by all,

3862
01:52:18,701 --> 01:52:19,451
but when you meet him,

3863
01:52:19,451 --> 01:52:19,721
he's like,

3864
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:20,501
hey,

3865
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:21,281
how are you?

3866
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:25,950
It's all hugs and claps and he
doesn't ever pretend to be any of the,

3867
01:52:25,951 --> 01:52:28,120
any roles with everybody
trains with everyone.

3868
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:33,370
So it's like the in formality and the
brothership and Camaraderie and the family

3869
01:52:33,371 --> 01:52:37,570
environment that is fostered by Brazilian
Jujitsu is a very unique in martial

3870
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:42,280
arts and that I think is very important
because the respect comes from their,

3871
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:44,560
their ability and from leading by example,

3872
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:49,770
it come from some fake position of being
some master of the death touch in some

3873
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,060
all knowing person who at
the top of the mountain.

3874
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,880
We all thought our instructor
could kill everyone on the planet.

3875
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,863
We really did.

3876
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:58,520
And when the UFC came along,

3877
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:02,030
for a lot of people that was a just a
bucket of cold water thrown in your face.

3878
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:02,864
Like,

3879
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:04,430
Whoa,

3880
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:06,050
that little skinny guy just choked out.

3881
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,540
All those big giant people
like what the fuck man.

3882
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:09,600
So

3883
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:09,811
I mean,

3884
01:53:09,811 --> 01:53:13,860
they weren't doing that for a long
time in Brazil and beaches and going to

3885
01:53:13,861 --> 01:53:16,130
houses and they're going
to gyms and just kicking

3886
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:17,070
people's faces.

3887
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:18,060
I fucking,

3888
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:18,893
I don't care.

3889
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:19,951
Yeah.

3890
01:53:19,951 --> 01:53:20,161
I mean,

3891
01:53:20,161 --> 01:53:20,371
look,

3892
01:53:20,371 --> 01:53:22,170
they changed what martial arts are.

3893
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:23,004
They really did.

3894
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:26,130
They boiled it down to what's
most effective and they,

3895
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:31,280
they took ground fighting and they turned
it into this perfect sort of blend of

3896
01:53:32,461 --> 01:53:37,080
leverage and technique and knowledge
and repetition and training and,

3897
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:38,280
and they just,

3898
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:42,840
they revolutionized joint
manipulation and strangling people.

3899
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:44,190
They revolutionized it.

3900
01:53:44,191 --> 01:53:45,021
They changed it to two.

3901
01:53:45,021 --> 01:53:46,410
It's a totally different thing.

3902
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:49,590
There was always submissions in judo.

3903
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,120
There was always catch wrestling,

3904
01:53:51,121 --> 01:53:53,250
which not a lot of great submissions
that are still to this day,

3905
01:53:53,251 --> 01:53:55,380
but to put it all together like,

3906
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,310
like Leo did and Carlos
and all the Gracie clan.

3907
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:00,240
I mean,

3908
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:05,040
what Brazil did for martial
arts is probably one of
the single most significant

3909
01:54:05,041 --> 01:54:09,150
things that's happened in the thousands
of years of people fighting each other.

3910
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,643
Pretty amazing,

3911
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,330
pretty amazing.

3912
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:13,141
But at the same time,

3913
01:54:13,141 --> 01:54:14,640
that was those guys who shoot your box,

3914
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:16,700
just fucking eat and I
shit out of each other.

3915
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:17,820
I then this shit out of each other.

3916
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,850
There was an article that I read
recently where a vendor Larry was talking

3917
01:54:20,851 --> 01:54:21,211
about,

3918
01:54:21,211 --> 01:54:22,044
um,

3919
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:23,183
the,

3920
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:23,621
he always,

3921
01:54:23,621 --> 01:54:25,650
he's having difficulty
now because you know,

3922
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,510
he's had so many wars.

3923
01:54:27,511 --> 01:54:31,800
He fought for so many years and that he
went to some sort of a conference on a

3924
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:36,630
concussions and CTE and he
had 13 of the 15 symptoms.

3925
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:37,650
Wow.

3926
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:38,483
Yeah.

3927
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:39,120
Yeah.

3928
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:39,990
And he was talking about,

3929
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:41,430
I forgets things is,

3930
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,750
he's impulsive,

3931
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:44,510
all these different symptoms yet.

3932
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:46,200
And then the very next thing he said is,

3933
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,880
but I want to fight Vito Belfort.

3934
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,420
He's make it fun.

3935
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,540
The lace crazy.

3936
01:54:53,541 --> 01:54:56,840
He went to my dog show and he's crazy.

3937
01:54:57,410 --> 01:55:01,850
He decided not to go like two minutes
before he goes and has changed his mind

3938
01:55:01,851 --> 01:55:02,930
and he's sweet,

3939
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,793
but at the same time,

3940
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:05,270
his right wing now,

3941
01:55:05,271 --> 01:55:06,104
he was just,

3942
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,030
he tried to go,

3943
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:09,350
he became a politician.

3944
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:09,950
Really.

3945
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:11,150
He went to be a lack that,

3946
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:11,720
but no,

3947
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:12,560
nobody voted.

3948
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:14,630
And who just liked him?

3949
01:55:14,631 --> 01:55:14,991
People didn't,

3950
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,360
no one can you see on like
Congress or so that's good.

3951
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:19,120
Brazil gets it in America.

3952
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:19,841
It's dangerous.

3953
01:55:19,841 --> 01:55:22,910
It happens in Brazil to have celebrities.

3954
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,573
One of our,

3955
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:26,180
one of our,

3956
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:27,013
uh,

3957
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,770
one of our most famous congressman's,

3958
01:55:29,771 --> 01:55:31,040
it was a big brother.

3959
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:32,510
Oh No,

3960
01:55:32,511 --> 01:55:35,510
that was a big brother and big
brother shows so ridiculous.

3961
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:37,610
He has the worst way
to become a celebrity.

3962
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,820
One of the most watched shows in Brazil.

3963
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:41,900
That's crazy.

3964
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,130
I know people that much he had to do.

3965
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:45,710
They don't know anymore.

3966
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,150
They still think so for sure.

3967
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:51,150
The crazy thing was Amarosa
Amarosa who was one of the big,

3968
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:51,851
she was a,

3969
01:55:51,851 --> 01:55:56,520
a big stash was the White House brand
is before that she was on fear factor.

3970
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:58,710
I when I was the host,

3971
01:55:58,711 --> 01:56:01,890
I didn't know I had a fucking
altercation with her on fear factor.

3972
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,791
Not a bad one,

3973
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:04,350
but she keeps me being drunk.

3974
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,341
She was like,

3975
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:07,110
cause I was asking her questions
like that doesn't make sense.

3976
01:56:07,111 --> 01:56:07,531
She was choked.

3977
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:08,011
You're drunk.

3978
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:08,251
I'm like,

3979
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:10,710
I'm not drunk or you
can't just say I'm drunk.

3980
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,920
She wasn't even thinking of
this fear before the apprentice.

3981
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:14,191
No,

3982
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:17,340
she was on something else
first before the apprentice.

3983
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:18,863
I think that was it.

3984
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:21,940
Was she on the apprentice
and then fear factor come on.

3985
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:25,000
Was fear factor before the
apprentice the same time.

3986
01:56:25,001 --> 01:56:27,450
Just before she got famous
for being on the apprentice.

3987
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:29,040
She was on like the second season maybe.

3988
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:29,740
Yeah,

3989
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,300
I really did.

3990
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:34,260
I think she was on another show
first and then the apprentice,

3991
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,050
she went to another reality
show after dip brand is,

3992
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:39,030
I don't know who I remember that.

3993
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:39,630
Yeah,

3994
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:39,931
I bought,

3995
01:56:39,931 --> 01:56:43,980
the crazy thing is she went from the
White House to big brother because she was

3996
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:45,780
actually on the first
season of the apprentice.

3997
01:56:45,850 --> 01:56:46,770
Oh,

3998
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:47,613
what year was that?

3999
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,060
Uh,

4000
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,890
so she was on celebrity fear factor.

4001
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:55,480
We had a three to four.

4002
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:55,771
Three.

4003
01:56:55,771 --> 01:56:56,101
Okay.

4004
01:56:56,101 --> 01:56:58,650
So she must've been on
fear factor like 2005.

4005
01:56:59,320 --> 01:56:59,820
Eh,

4006
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:00,653
she's nice though.

4007
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:01,493
She's just,

4008
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:03,210
but she was just told me I was drunk.

4009
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:03,511
I was like,

4010
01:57:03,511 --> 01:57:04,050
what?

4011
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,220
She wasn't elected.

4012
01:57:05,221 --> 01:57:06,054
Right.

4013
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,580
She wasn't like she
was appointed by Trump,

4014
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,930
but Trump gave,

4015
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,130
so here's what's fucked up.

4016
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:12,420
Here's what's really,

4017
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,130
I was reading an article about the,

4018
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:19,131
what the problems with what she did when
she was in the situation room and these

4019
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:21,510
secured White House rooms.

4020
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,120
She had her fucking phone recording.

4021
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:28,200
So she's sitting there recording
shit in the middle of these,

4022
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:32,370
these like totally secure rooms.

4023
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,740
She's like,

4024
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:34,650
Trump is talking,

4025
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:35,430
she's got her phone there.

4026
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,970
Hmm.

4027
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:36,803
Interesting.

4028
01:57:37,230 --> 01:57:39,200
And she's recording everything
on her fucking fault.

4029
01:57:39,201 --> 01:57:43,350
And she has like hours and hours of
footage of record recordings rather,

4030
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,270
which you're not supposed to do.

4031
01:57:45,271 --> 01:57:50,271
It's like you can literally Russians
and Chinese and the Iranians and all the

4032
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:55,260
anybody that wants to tune in
could hack into her fucking phone,

4033
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:59,880
turn the microphone on and
this is absolute proven
technology and they're using

4034
01:57:59,881 --> 01:58:02,580
that to listen in the middle
of the situation room.

4035
01:58:02,581 --> 01:58:05,550
So if there's some sort of top
secret shit that's going on,

4036
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:09,970
some foreign entity could be listening
in through her phone while she's

4037
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:10,650
recording.

4038
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,910
I don't think they see the ignorant.

4039
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:12,840
I think they need all of that.

4040
01:58:12,841 --> 01:58:14,520
There's just called Trump
and ask what happened?

4041
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:16,990
They'll tell you if like what happened.

4042
01:58:16,991 --> 01:58:17,641
I'm like,

4043
01:58:17,641 --> 01:58:18,474
okay.

4044
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:19,500
But I mean he's,

4045
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:21,660
he allowed her this,

4046
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:22,471
you know,

4047
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:23,850
I don't know if she's unstable,

4048
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,450
but she seems a little unstable to,

4049
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:29,490
that's a such a very
dangerous thing to do.

4050
01:58:29,491 --> 01:58:33,000
You're not even supposed to bring your
fucking phone in those rooms and for her

4051
01:58:33,001 --> 01:58:33,990
to be recording,

4052
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:35,220
recording everything.

4053
01:58:35,221 --> 01:58:35,730
That's crazy.

4054
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,170
This is so crazy,

4055
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:41,380
but so selfish to like if
you are acting in the best,

4056
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,480
you're in a position when
you work for the White House,

4057
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,800
you're working for Donald Trump.

4058
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:46,720
He is the president of the United States,

4059
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:51,070
the biggest super power in the fucking
world and you're just recording things.

4060
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,473
God,

4061
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:54,970
I know that you want to serve yourself.

4062
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:56,470
I know you want to help yourself out,

4063
01:58:56,471 --> 01:58:57,640
but God,

4064
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:59,110
that seems so crazy.

4065
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,040
I mean if you were trumping,

4066
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:04,360
you hired her and you found out she was
recording everything in the situation

4067
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:04,481
room,

4068
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:05,314
you must be like,

4069
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:07,240
oh,

4070
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:11,950
like in conferences with like they're
talking about important policy and she's

4071
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:15,880
got a phone recording and anybody can
be listening and if you think about it

4072
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:18,590
like it's crazy for him to,

4073
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:23,380
to give her some some credibility
because she wasn't apprentice.

4074
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:23,641
He liked,

4075
01:59:23,641 --> 01:59:24,341
I didn't think about it.

4076
01:59:24,341 --> 01:59:24,581
Okay.

4077
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:27,370
The president of the United States is
the guys that was running a premise.

4078
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:29,920
He liked her.

4079
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,130
Maybe I'll look.

4080
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:32,470
She's very articulate.

4081
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:33,790
She's good looking woman.

4082
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:35,110
She knows how to speak well.

4083
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:37,060
She's got a lot of confidence and power.

4084
01:59:37,061 --> 01:59:38,800
He probably figured she'd
be a great politician.

4085
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:39,581
Perfect.

4086
01:59:39,581 --> 01:59:40,600
I'm a great politician.

4087
01:59:40,601 --> 01:59:41,051
He's probably like,

4088
01:59:41,051 --> 01:59:42,100
I'm the fucking president.

4089
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:42,970
I'll make her,

4090
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:46,060
she'll say she's going to be my
left hand lady or right hand lady.

4091
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,530
And it's not that it that difficult,

4092
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:50,830
but at least in Brazil is not that
difficult for our famous people to get

4093
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:55,090
elected in the one day where I was running
for a congressman because there's so

4094
01:59:55,091 --> 02:00:00,091
many options and if you are known
and you'll get like 1% of the voting,

4095
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:01,300
you're already elected.

4096
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:06,690
But if you go run for like a mayor or
governor or glove and there are some,

4097
02:00:06,891 --> 02:00:10,030
he becomes a little trickier because
there's like five options and now you're

4098
02:00:10,031 --> 02:00:11,740
running against real politics,

4099
02:00:11,741 --> 02:00:13,630
real politicians who actually have a plan.

4100
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:16,090
So we feel running out
guys like 200 people.

4101
02:00:16,091 --> 02:00:18,340
You can shine Oviedo
because you're famous.

4102
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,333
Yeah.

4103
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:21,360
We're starting to see a
little bit more than America.

4104
02:00:21,370 --> 02:00:22,330
Like Cynthia Nixon.

4105
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:26,530
She was on sex in the city and then she
ran for which he ran for governor in New

4106
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:26,900
York,

4107
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:27,190
right?

4108
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:27,651
Oh yeah.

4109
02:00:27,651 --> 02:00:27,971
Go for it.

4110
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:28,241
Yeah.

4111
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:28,630
So this,

4112
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:32,320
there's a few that few that are starting
to branch off into politics now.

4113
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:33,750
It's,

4114
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:34,240
I mean,

4115
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:36,190
did it happen before Ronald
Reagan because he was like,

4116
02:00:36,191 --> 02:00:36,301
yeah,

4117
02:00:36,301 --> 02:00:36,970
he's famous.

4118
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:38,020
He's the most famous,

4119
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:38,321
he,

4120
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:39,850
I think he was a movie star.

4121
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,750
He was a big bang,

4122
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:41,050
right?

4123
02:00:41,050 --> 02:00:41,291
Yeah.

4124
02:00:41,291 --> 02:00:43,420
He was the first guy back to the future.

4125
02:00:43,421 --> 02:00:44,400
You mean like Ronald Reagan,

4126
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:45,570
the movie star and like,

4127
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:46,423
yeah.

4128
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:47,921
Yeah.

4129
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:48,611
That was a,

4130
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:49,421
that was the first.

4131
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:49,931
He was the first,

4132
02:00:49,931 --> 02:00:52,990
he was also the first that
introduced the option or his,

4133
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,430
his cabinet was the first.

4134
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:57,670
They got the people that his,

4135
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:00,970
his team got the people
from the religious right.

4136
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:01,804
Involved.

4137
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:06,870
Religion was not really a big part of
voting before Ronald Reagan and Ronald

4138
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:06,911
Reagan.

4139
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:10,090
And though that sort
of kind of Republican,

4140
02:01:10,091 --> 02:01:12,880
they got all these event gelical
Christians and evangelicals.

4141
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:13,541
Yeah.

4142
02:01:13,541 --> 02:01:14,120
And the same thing,

4143
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:14,953
Brazil,

4144
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:17,650
what is going on with Brazil
now with your president?

4145
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,613
Yeah,

4146
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:22,020
there's a huge connection between
politics and the church right now.

4147
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:23,980
The genetical and it
wasn't that way before.

4148
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,120
He was a little bit,

4149
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:29,170
he was always something because
Brazil is a very evangelical country.

4150
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:29,710
Right.

4151
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:30,880
I don't really feel have a wash.

4152
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:32,650
Luckily we were watching
it the middle of the night,

4153
02:01:32,651 --> 02:01:35,170
they do turn on your TV and
there's this guy talking to,

4154
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:36,004
he was like,

4155
02:01:36,190 --> 02:01:36,401
oh,

4156
02:01:36,401 --> 02:01:39,680
there's a demon that is
running over my soul.

4157
02:01:39,681 --> 02:01:40,130
And there's

4158
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:45,130
like those TV shows called stop suffering
by the Sofrito is more like for those

4159
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:48,970
of the [inaudible].

4160
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:50,600
This church is everywhere.

4161
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:51,400
So EDC,

4162
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,090
Joel Olsteen in America,

4163
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,330
he's a big time of evangelical Christian.

4164
02:01:56,331 --> 02:01:58,190
He sells out these giant arenas,

4165
02:01:58,191 --> 02:01:59,440
like 50,000 pizzas.

4166
02:01:59,441 --> 02:01:59,980
Come to see him.

4167
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:00,380
Yes,

4168
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:00,831
yes.

4169
02:02:00,831 --> 02:02:01,340
Yeah.

4170
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:02,420
But he's very,

4171
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:03,170
uh,

4172
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:03,531
it's,

4173
02:02:03,531 --> 02:02:04,130
it's,

4174
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:07,100
it's huge in Brazil and they have like,

4175
02:02:07,101 --> 02:02:07,371
I don't know,

4176
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:10,100
40% of the people is
evangelical in Brazil.

4177
02:02:10,101 --> 02:02:11,420
I don't have the numbers right now,

4178
02:02:11,421 --> 02:02:12,410
but the church,

4179
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:13,251
the religious,

4180
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:14,420
something huge over there.

4181
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,980
So,

4182
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:16,880
uh,

4183
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:17,990
he was something,

4184
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:22,610
that's why we didn't evolve in
a lot of different discussions.

4185
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,090
Like talking about abortion
is now legal in Brazil.

4186
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:27,020
Not Legal at all.

4187
02:02:27,021 --> 02:02:27,151
No,

4188
02:02:27,151 --> 02:02:27,870
they got all.

4189
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:28,360
Wow.

4190
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:29,480
Just if you're raped,

4191
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:30,671
Jesse,

4192
02:02:30,671 --> 02:02:35,671
if you raped or if your kid
has like a deformity deformity,

4193
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:39,290
then you can have an abortion.

4194
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:40,460
The woman's life is threatened.

4195
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:41,293
He had a bird.

4196
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:43,040
That's the only cases.

4197
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:45,470
And that discussion was never,

4198
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:48,140
never happened because
everybody's religious.

4199
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:50,270
If you do like a,

4200
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:53,630
how do you say when you go public
and you ask something to the people,

4201
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:54,420
like,

4202
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,490
do you have this here?

4203
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:58,850
It's just like you have a kind of a test.

4204
02:02:58,880 --> 02:02:59,840
We have this in Brazil.

4205
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:00,421
Uh,

4206
02:03:00,421 --> 02:03:02,030
I don't know how to say this in English,

4207
02:03:02,031 --> 02:03:02,864
but test.

4208
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,081
Yeah,

4209
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:03,914
it's just a test.

4210
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:06,560
Are you against abortion or pole?

4211
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:07,640
A pole pole.

4212
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:07,911
Okay.

4213
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:08,750
Like an opinion poll.

4214
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:10,780
My second language.

4215
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:12,650
So sometimes me miss a word or two.

4216
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:14,570
I said that's my only language.

4217
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:18,500
So if you do a poll in Brazil,

4218
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:20,410
people would be against abortion.

4219
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:25,010
Like he's the legalization of abortion
and against drugs like sex and drugs and

4220
02:03:25,011 --> 02:03:25,281
everything.

4221
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:26,090
I what about um,

4222
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:27,200
morning after pill?

4223
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,641
Uh,

4224
02:03:28,641 --> 02:03:29,240
now it is.

4225
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:30,260
You can take that.

4226
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:31,123
You can't take that.

4227
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,473
I Dunno.

4228
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:33,501
I Dunno.

4229
02:03:33,501 --> 02:03:34,100
I Dunno.

4230
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:34,933
I Dunno.

4231
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:36,380
I bought some,

4232
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:41,030
so I did it in pharmacy.

4233
02:03:41,031 --> 02:03:42,260
So it's okay.

4234
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:43,460
I think the,

4235
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:44,293
I dunno,

4236
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:45,290
I dunno,

4237
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:45,921
but you can,

4238
02:03:45,921 --> 02:03:47,400
a abortion is not legal members,

4239
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,900
right.

4240
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:52,010
So we are not having that discussion
because now the precedence is connected to

4241
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:52,844
the church.

4242
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:55,160
Our ex-president called Lula,

4243
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:56,780
he's in jail right now.

4244
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:58,340
He's in jail,

4245
02:03:58,420 --> 02:03:58,940
was in jail.

4246
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:02,690
He was involved in the huge
corruption scandal scandal.

4247
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:07,040
And he was like our hope
cause he was a poor guy.

4248
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:11,270
So he was a government that
actually help the poor in Brazil.

4249
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:12,770
What happened with him?

4250
02:04:12,771 --> 02:04:13,220
What was,

4251
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,750
he was involved the,

4252
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:15,584
he,

4253
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:19,250
he had connections with different
companies and different,

4254
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,113
uh,

4255
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:20,990
uh,

4256
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:25,390
industries was giving him money and
they have this thing called Casha.

4257
02:04:25,391 --> 02:04:28,400
Dubois is when you're doing your campaign,

4258
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:33,320
you need to say how much money you're
getting from all those different brands

4259
02:04:33,321 --> 02:04:34,154
and everything.

4260
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:36,340
So there's thing called [inaudible],

4261
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:37,580
which is you money.

4262
02:04:37,581 --> 02:04:38,610
It was spend the money.

4263
02:04:38,630 --> 02:04:41,880
There's never went on any
banks or anything like that.

4264
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:43,770
So it's kind of a u high,

4265
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:45,970
that money that will had,

4266
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,220
that happens a lot in Brazil.

4267
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:48,750
I don't know how to say this in English,

4268
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:52,440
but it's something that you hide the
money that you're getting for a company,

4269
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,940
but if you get elected,

4270
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:55,950
you kind of forgive them favors.

4271
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,030
You'll help them to get like
a involved in a construct,

4272
02:05:00,031 --> 02:05:01,310
in a huge construction.

4273
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,550
They are going to build a stadium.

4274
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:03,840
Then you help them somehow.

4275
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,490
That was what happened in,

4276
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:06,121
in Brazil.

4277
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:06,990
So he's in jail now.

4278
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:09,180
He's in jail and then he,

4279
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:12,930
he elected a woman in Brazil
and she was impeached.

4280
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:14,213
Oh.

4281
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:18,150
And now we have this right
wing guy called Bull Sonato.

4282
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:23,180
He's our new president and a a very
right wing and connected to the army and

4283
02:05:24,481 --> 02:05:25,710
connected to the church.

4284
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:30,000
So there's a lot of discussions and
abortion and drugs and everything that we

4285
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:31,590
are not going to have Susie popular.

4286
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:32,090
He's,

4287
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:32,450
he's,

4288
02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:33,283
yeah.

4289
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:38,460
Is he popular and also like
hated emails on a lot as well.

4290
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:39,294
Yeah,

4291
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:39,931
of course.

4292
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:41,490
There's the left hate the guy.

4293
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:43,830
It does things that he's sad.

4294
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:44,490
He was like,

4295
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:46,050
he was kind of crazy.

4296
02:05:46,051 --> 02:05:47,370
But you're not people.

4297
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,050
People love you.

4298
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:49,230
And how long has he been the president of?

4299
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:50,340
He was going to be for 40 years,

4300
02:05:50,341 --> 02:05:51,180
so he was just selected.

4301
02:05:51,181 --> 02:05:52,470
He started January.

4302
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:53,200
Okay.

4303
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,033
Just started,

4304
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:54,391
you know,

4305
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:56,490
we don't know what this
is going to lead us,

4306
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:00,780
but the thing is at the same time he's
more liberal because the left in Brazil,

4307
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:05,310
all this talk about feeding off speech
and everything else was in our left was

4308
02:06:05,311 --> 02:06:06,210
running the country.

4309
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:11,420
Now we got this guy and he is more Libero
and even talking about the way he's

4310
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:13,300
going to run the country,

4311
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:16,740
the economy and politics and
speech and everything else.

4312
02:06:16,741 --> 02:06:19,590
So there's a little hope
in their areas as well.

4313
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:24,890
So it's kind of tricky because it's a
danger in one area and it's kind of a hope

4314
02:06:25,751 --> 02:06:26,584
in another one.

4315
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:28,290
I wish I was saying this in Portuguese.

4316
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:29,430
It will be so much easier,

4317
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:30,160
you know,

4318
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:33,240
even imagine can understand
cause it's like an understanding.

4319
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:35,230
Well listen brother,

4320
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:35,710
um,

4321
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:36,730
let's do a show together,

4322
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,920

4323
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:38,500
Listen,

4324
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,060
I'm doing a lot of shows at the Improv,

4325
02:06:40,061 --> 02:06:40,841
the comedy store.

4326
02:06:40,841 --> 02:06:42,250
I'll have you on one of
the things from my friend.

4327
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:43,490
I was going to be what I want to see.

4328
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:45,450
Little show it to you.

4329
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:46,301
That's cool.

4330
02:06:46,301 --> 02:06:49,870
And I just want to say thank you for
everything you've done for standing up in

4331
02:06:49,871 --> 02:06:50,231
Brazil.

4332
02:06:50,231 --> 02:06:51,250
I think that's amazing.

4333
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,030
Thanks.

4334
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:52,840
Thanks for doing this.

4335
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:53,170
Thank you,

4336
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:53,390
