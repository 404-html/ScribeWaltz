1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,220
Tell me when we're up.
We're up.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,270
I got to post it on twitter.
So Tom,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,430
I went to the doctor.
What were we talking about before?

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,431
We started talking about like rappers 
killing each other and I don't want to 

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,030
stop the subject real quick because when
you know,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,320
when that happened,
when I'm,

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,400
when the nineties,
you know,

8
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,070
when they started shooting each other 
and coming out with gangster rap,

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,310
there's never been anything like that 
because you mentioned like the beach 

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,310
boys,
you know,

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,250
and they fucking hated Elvis.
They want to shoot them,

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,400
should take bitches pitches.
And there was the first time where guys 

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,740
were ever able to brag about everything 
about their money,

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,110
about their,
their sexual conquest.

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,230
It's like didn't ever been,
you know,

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,280
like Eddie Bravo was talking about that 
song the other day.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,350
She swallowed it.
It's not a good song.

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,430
It,
it's.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,540
I mean,
I don't like it,

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,490
you know,
it's okay.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,710
Mc Ren had had a decent verse on it.
Yes.

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,430
Mc Ren Ren was amazing.
What happened to that store?

23
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,680
I have no idea.
Yeah,

24
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,660
I think he's working on the new Nwa 
movie right now.

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,650
If I move it,
yeah,

26
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,810
they're redoing the whole Nwa.
They're doing it in Wwi.

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,690
Moving using like family members is 
going to play aids.

28
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,990
Cast that part.
Oh,

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,580
Tommy with the plugins there.
Who's good?

30
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:16,650
Okay.

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,330
Play aids.
Oh Shit.

32
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,940
No you didn't.
I think it was Morgan Freeman.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,960
Morgan Freeman.
That's fucking incredible.

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,300
Jesus Christ.
Give me that power that he had.

35
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,870
I can nail this shit.
Do you think Jerry Curl will ever come 

36
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,870
back?
It's too much work.

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,320
Too much better.
The fuck.

38
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:39,180
Head a head like he was like a poster 
child for the Jerry Curl.

39
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,760
Yeah.
Ice Cube had a really fucking Nice Jheri

40
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,340
curls.
Good.

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,450
If you're going to get a jerry curl,
that's who you should take this picture 

42
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,980
and your salon and say,
make me look like Chris Rock's movie.

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,420
What was the move with the c four where 
they spray Jericho juice.

44
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,460
They're here all the time.
What was Jerry curl juice?

45
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,020
What is it?
Just oil is the oil.

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670
What was that?
Coming to America.

47
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,270
What was that?
Soul glow glow.

48
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,460
Get off off the chair and there's like a
stain on that to be true.

49
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:15,841
Right?
Every become Palme d'or look at the 

50
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:15,841
hairstyles,
man.

51
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,450
Hairstyles are are insane,
but that's one of the weirdest ones 

52
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,111
ever.
You had to put all that shit in your 

53
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,461
hair and make it greasy and drippy the 
fuck it ruins your clothes at the Afro 

54
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,610
style.
Like the statement,

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,880
right.
Then member fades and high top fade 

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,850
high.
They can get away with anything.

57
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,130
I remember when I was giving black 
girls,

58
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:38,131
they have straight hair,
they have white girl's hair and you're 

59
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,131
like,
how'd you get that?

60
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,131
Shut up.
Oh yeah.

61
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,800
Yeah.
Black dudes can't pull it off.

62
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,270
You know what?
I was really jealous.

63
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,950
I in like middle school and high school 
was when black has had like a designs in

64
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,951
their hair,
like the headlight lines and she'll be 

65
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:50,170
written bolts and shit.

66
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,230
Yeah.
And I'm going to do that and like you 

67
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,230
cannot,
you will look like a fucking ass.

68
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,090
There's a fighter who is a black guy 
from some,

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,330
some k,
one guy,

70
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,510
but he carves like designs,
like tribal designs and his hair before 

71
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,410
he fights.
It looks bad.

72
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,950
That's the thing.
You get away with it,

73
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,340
but do you think a black guy could get 
away with wearing like a white guy's 

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,340
hair like a black girl does?
No.

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,980
Oh No,
no,

76
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,100
no.
You mentioned black dudes.

77
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,650
If that was the next thing they all 
started having Bon Jovi,

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,280
bon jovi hair weaves or what if it was 
just like,

79
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,920
like what if they use part of it like a 
good boy come like Ted.

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,160
Ted Haggard just were like cool about.
And you'll be like,

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,850
what's going on?

82
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,620
Man?
Is it strange though?

83
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,730
But becomes popular and unpopular.
You know,

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,950
like a girls are allowed to have.
Everything can be fake.

85
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,650
You can have fake tits.
Fake hair.

86
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,540
Nobody gives a shit as long as you look 
good.

87
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,500
You look good.
Good.

88
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay.
Let's go.

89
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,800
You know,
no guy is like really?

90
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,450
Not Me guys are.
Don't get me wrong,

91
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,710
but it's acceptable for you to be.
Oh,

92
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,270
pretty inauthentic.
We are held to such a lower standard.

93
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,790
Another thing that we get like for most 
guys,

94
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,740
like if you,
if you bay,

95
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,060
you shower,
you bathe regularly and you basically,

96
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,061
you know,
change clues that's considered like 

97
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,450
carry yourself.
You don't have to wear makeup or 

98
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:15,450
anything,
isn't it?

99
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,420
Could you imagine though if you found 
out the dude was wearing blue contacts 

100
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,980
because we'd be like,
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

101
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:23,080
I almost bought some fake contacts the 
other day just because that stone but it

102
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,450
wasn't,
it was the ones where you can.

103
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,360
There's like ones that you can get like 
cat eyes,

104
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,100
like completely black and I just want to
have a pair for,

105
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,220
for no for no reason at all.
Do you remember Michael Jackson's 

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,340
thriller when he had the cat eyes?
Yeah,

107
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,550
I guess it was pretty cheap.
They were like $89 bucks and you just 

108
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,860
put them in your.
It's not like the end of the movie.

109
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,660
He looks Ilearn,
thriller.

110
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

111
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,470
He turns back and then the law was a 
fucking great music video that was,

112
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,340
that was prevalent.
That was an actual event that was like a

113
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,110
world news.
Oh yeah,

114
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,970
yeah.
It was huge.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
That's what we had far less channels 
too.

116
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,140
I can't imagine what the numbers were on
just that video.

117
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,210
They must've been.
It must be astronomical.

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Yeah.
They must've been 13 minutes and that 

119
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,001
was like,
that was so cool seeing that and for me 

120
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,370
it was a werewolf,
so I was even more excited.

121
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,790
A cool one.
A really.

122
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,740
That was Rick Baker that did that,
I believe.

123
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,470
I believe it was the same guy that did 
the monitor girl from London.

124
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,010
He did star Wars Shit.
The coordinated dancing.

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,250
All the dancing was coolest shit.
Where's the message behind that?

126
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,620
You know,
little weird fucking video and moving.

127
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,630
I remember people were saying it was 
titanic.

128
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,670
I remember that.
There was a bunch of protests about it.

129
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,930
Oh yeah.
We're upset.

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,330
What a fucking fascinated.
Just the best thing ever.

131
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,760
When you get a controversy like that,
when people.

132
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,770
When someone says this might be say 
tannic.

133
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,690
That was when they were like,
guys fucking.

134
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,150
Yes.
Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston.

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Probably the two most talented people 
that died and everybody saw it coming.

136
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,690
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

137
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,710
When we talk about like really uniquely 
talented people that everybody's like,

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,740
man,
you know,

139
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,790
how long is this going to last?

140
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,350
How long can you,
do you remember that?

141
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,470
Um,
the Bobbi Brown show being Bobby Brown?

142
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Yeah.
When they were on the shelf screaming 

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:08,800
and yelling at each other,
like,

144
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:08,800
oh my God,
I remember when they talked,

145
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:08,800
they were at,
they were at a dinner,

146
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,230
Bob,
they're fucked up,

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,800
not like buzzing,
like fucking up racks.

148
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,560
And they were at a hotel and they were,
they had ordered like a feast and I mean

149
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
it was,
it was crazy like how much food was on 

150
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,401
this table and they were both just 
fucking completely out of their minds 

151
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,450
proliferated and laughing.
And then I forget what I forget who said

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,460
like,
remember when I was at had tech was 

153
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,460
taking that shit and you had to come 
over with help me pull it up my ass.

154
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,110
And it was like,
yeah,

155
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,200
yeah,
I think it was the,

156
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,390
he was the one time she had to shit 
stuck inside of her and he reached up 

157
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,500
and he's like,
Hey,

158
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,350
I pulled that book out and she was like,
I'll take a dump right now.

159
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,690
I'm going to drop it on the one like 
that was the senior,

160
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,300
like I'm gonna drop it on the one.
Yes dude.

161
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,870
Yes.
Funny

162
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,130
how come

163
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,510
my ass?
Yeah.

164
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,060
Wow.
Taking a dump.

165
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,710
You put your hand in my ass.
Do you remember what they interviewed 

166
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,470
her?
There was an interview where the guy was

167
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,770
trying to get to what the fuck was up 
and he's like,

168
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,770
is it cocaine?
Is it alcohol?

169
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,870
And she's like,
at times,

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,530
at times,
at times,

171
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,950
all of them,
like at times all of them.

172
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,240
And he's like,
you know,

173
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,620
have you ever,
have you ever smoked crack?

174
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,700
And she was like,
crack is whack,

175
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,270
whack.
I think that was the Diane Sawyer that 

176
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,270
she said that.
And he also said,

177
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,230
it's rumored that you spent $750,000
one year on drugs.

178
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,300
And she said,
I wish

179
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,410
I will.
She said,

180
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:45,130
I wish it was this like down at ship 
right now.

181
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,910
Are you kidding me?
Shit.

182
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,850
That'd be a good year.
But it was 700.

183
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,250
It was this strange ranges.

184
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,830
Interview men to listen to a person who 
you know when you grew up,

185
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,660
you know the body guard.
I remember her with Kevin Costner.

186
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,470
She is.
She was such a talent talent.

187
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,230
It's such a superstar.
Oh,

188
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:10,231
amazing.
If you watch like how will I know like 

189
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:10,231
the video.
I mean,

190
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:13,891
you see she's so beautiful.
Have you ever heard when they late her 

191
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,240
lyrics?
No.

192
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,840
It's got food.
Her seat.

193
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,460
I don't know if you can play that.
I think we can play that.

194
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,760
Not at all.
Probably not.

195
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,050
Not like you will look a little sample 
of it or something.

196
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,330
I don't know.
Let's try her range.

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,550
The range and her voice is just 
ridiculous.

198
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,670
It's really stunning to listen to it.
Just look up.

199
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,820
How will I know?
Whitney Houston isolated lyrics.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Love it.
Used to freak type with one hand.

201
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Don't know what the fuck you're doing.
A bunch of chicken scratch on that 

202
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:47,821
screen.
Brian's going to confuse the fuck out of

203
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,240
people is a way to,
um,

204
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,910
take that video of your ustream and put 
it on mine.

205
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,730
I don't know.
I could find out.

206
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,380
But you definitely do vimeo.

207
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,710
Yeah.
Uh,

208
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,200
people are mad at you,
Brian.

209
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,340
This is another old brian moment.
They get excited.

210
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,340
People Liking when you fuck up.
Do you notice that?

211
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,590
Yeah,
they love it.

212
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,680
What is that about?
Um,

213
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
makes it seem more real.
It's not edited.

214
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,090
It's Raul or.
Yeah.

215
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,970
People like a little conflict.
This is a dude who just sent me 19.

216
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,410
Tell Brian to shut the fuck ups in a 
row.

217
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,650
Okay.
That guy's blocked.

218
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh Shit.
That didn't come.

219
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,750
Wait,
here's one.

220
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,350
It's a,
it's a strange thing to listen to man,

221
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,030
because you know,
there's no.

222
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,690
You can give me a million years when all
the coaches in the world,

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,360
they listen to that.
Listen to this shit.

224
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,410
Control.

225
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,710
God.
Damn.

226
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:00,370
She was good.
She was.

227
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,850
Fuck.
That's a once in a lifetime voice man.

228
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,370
That is a perfect voice.
Yeah.

229
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,850
So the perfect voice and it's like a 
bodyguard days hot.

230
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,970
It's hot as fuck.
That was the first time ever there was a

231
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:17,810
hot girl that a hot man was falling in 
love with,

232
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,590
you know that she's black and then they 
did a major movie about it.

233
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,440
Have they ever done that before?
Where the hot black girl and the man get

234
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:29,441
together if man,
nobody apparently even complained now 

235
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,530
the main storyline,
you know,

236
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,810
like that would have to be the story.
She was such a fucking gigantic star as 

237
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,840
a singer that they were like seeing a 
movie with him.

238
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,560
Who Cares?
Just fucking rolled the cameras.

239
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,790
Say whatever you want.
We'll tie it all together.

240
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,590
You're working with Kevin Costner.
He'll carry you along.

241
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,930
She could act to act as easy as fuck 
man.

242
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,230
Acting and shit.
I mean there's this high level acting 

243
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,021
obviously that none of us can do,
but the regular acting like the 

244
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:56,021
bodyguard.
Yeah.

245
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:56,450
You could do that hard,
man.

246
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,380
What'd you say?

247
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,910
8 million.
My Buddy Mike Star was in that movie 

248
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,941
too.
He got beat up by Kevin Costner and 

249
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:06,941
yeah,
my buddy Mike Star did a.

250
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:08,530
We did a TV show a long time ago called 
the hardball together.

251
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,860
It's stupid.
Baseball show that,

252
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,540
yeah,
it's terrible show,

253
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:16,541
but it was a.
I made a bunch of good friends with 

254
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:16,541
Mike.
Star was one of them.

255
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,781
He got beat up in a bunch of movies.
You got beat up in a Steven Seagal 

256
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:20,200
movie.
Got Real mad at Steven Seagal.

257
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,430
Was hitting him really hard.
Really?

258
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,550
Yeah.
He had a wound up actually having to put

259
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,610
like a chest protector on because the 
guy was not really supposed to hit them.

260
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,590
You know,
it was supposed to like fake hit him.

261
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:31,850
It's for fucking movie.
You know,

262
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:35,350
you're already seeing steven lightest.
Chest up a bomb.

263
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,850
Hit Him with that fucking wing.
Chung punching shit.

264
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,760
The Steve.
Really either.

265
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,700
He just does it,
man.

266
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,140
He was known for doing that.
You know,

267
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,350
he's,
you know,

268
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,390
he's trying to make a fucking bad ass 
movie and unfortunately when you try and

269
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,640
make a bad ass movie sometimes you got 
to sacrifice.

270
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,810
Yeah.
I'm going to kick you in the chat right 

271
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:54,810
now,
man.

272
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:54,810
Fucking stomped on occasion.
That's what

273
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,270
he.
I mean that was his attitude.

274
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,180
He probably had a line after he kicked 
it,

275
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,900
which made it so much where it's like 
you get kicked in the.

276
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:05,660
He's like,
that's what time it is or some shit.

277
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,190
Mother fucker did that happen.
Like the guy that was in the movie that 

278
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,100
always has the witty one liner after he 
kicked you in the balls now man,

279
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,420
that became.
I mean I was that.

280
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,380
I think that became huge through 
clinics.

281
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:20,860
Would I think he'd be the guy.
I mean,

282
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,430
you know what I mean?
We're like,

283
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,040
we're the bad ass thing happens and then
you'd go in not closed.

284
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,060
You pushing on the bad ass face and he's
like,

285
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,630
ask your mother what she thinks.
She says the Clint Eastwood every which 

286
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,921
way,
but loose movies were the first time 

287
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:40,200
that they really like combined like 
action and comedy together with a dude 

288
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,610
who wasn't a comedy guy,
but it works.

289
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,350
Works,
man.

290
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,800
It works.
Grail siloed.

291
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,710
Better be funny.
Fucking dude.

292
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:52,711
Come on man.
Every which way but loose was awesome 

293
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:52,711
and that was back when Clint Eastwood 
was stuck with that one chick.

294
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:53,790
What's her name?
Sondra Locke.

295
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,500
I don't remember if did a million movies
with this freak,

296
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I guess you know,
that was just this girl and they did a 

297
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:02,520
bunch of movies together,
but as soon as they broke up,

298
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,850
mad shit got ugly.
Really?

299
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,740
Yeah.
He got her like some development deal,

300
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,230
get the fuck away from home and you 
know,

301
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,870
and she accused him of blocking every 
one of her projects.

302
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,250
Don't want to do anything.
I wouldn't fuck with Clinton.

303
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,970
She was suing the shit out of him.
It was just gross man.

304
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:20,971
It was just when,
when people like divorce and they do it 

305
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:24,331
publicly like that,
you lose so much respect for the more 

306
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,450
vocal member of the two.

307
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,800
And that was one of the case with the 
thing with her.

308
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,770
I automatically assume,
oh this bitch is crazy.

309
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,140
We're going to go.
She never really worked again.

310
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,640
You know,
Sondra Locke disappeared.

311
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,560
She was in a ton of movies with Clint 
Eastwood,

312
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,930
but that was about it.
After that,

313
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,950
you know,
she thought it was because he 

314
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:42,950
blackballed there.
But most people,

315
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,060
I think a lot of us probably as people 
thought she was gross,

316
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,340
like you know what's going?
What do you do in a clip?

317
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,300
Yeah man.
That he can't,

318
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,560
he can't fuck over that movie.
Royalty.

319
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,580
Good.
The bad and the ugly.

320
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,870
Come on.
You leave him alone.

321
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,920
You know,
what'd you do?

322
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,700
I can't imagine the stories that he has.
Oh my God.

323
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,140
And I remember even when we played like 
the old,

324
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,370
like racist.
What was that?

325
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,090
Was it?
No,

326
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,660
I know what you mean.

327
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

328
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,820
What was,
was made on account Mustang recently 

329
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,720
realized man to Reno that I think that 
was it.

330
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,120
I lived next door to like,
uh,

331
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,740
among family or something.
Right.

332
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,800
So there's all these like,
and he's like,

333
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:21,040
it's an old time,
he's like,

334
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,090
get your yellow ass off my loans,
like crazy shit.

335
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,340
And they asked him about like political 
correctness and he was like,

336
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,690
I don't know what this shit is all 
about.

337
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,010
He was like,
back in my day,

338
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,510
like we would shoot a movie and a grip 
was from China.

339
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:37,660
He was the Chinaman and like that's just
who you are.

340
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,760
And like,
we would just laugh about it,

341
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:44,761
like we could tell jokes to people about
their race and people wouldn't freak 

342
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:44,920
out.
Like if people were given them,

343
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:45,910
you know,
a lot of Shit,

344
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,840
right?
Yeah.

345
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:51,841
People are super sensitive.
You're not even supposed to joke around 

346
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:51,990
about this unless you are,
have a,

347
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,550
uh,
a nationality or a minor or rather a,

348
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,250
um,
uh,

349
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,700
what's the word I'm looking for them?
Not Minor,

350
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,350
like a minority or a minority ethnic.
You'll come from it in my mind of a 

351
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,200
minority and then stop at minor.
That's how tired I am.

352
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,650
I think that for a lot of people that 
give minorities,

353
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,570
you know,
whether you're black people can make fun

354
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:13,370
of white people all day long,
but you,

355
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,830
you're walking a fine line where we make
fun of black.

356
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Yeah.
I've seen you do some great black jokes 

357
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,320
and I see people go,
oh shit.

358
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,410
See pl like the clench.
I'm going to go,

359
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,140
oh shit.
Because people worry.

360
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:29,900
People worry when a white guy makes fun 
of black people,

361
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,990
it gets to be a real black.
People can make fun of white people.

362
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,350
I've seen white people laugh at the 
lamest shit.

363
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,640
They'll at the end.
It's just like,

364
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:40,340
it's like a guilty last.
It's this weird.

365
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,190
They do that,
that fake white guy and voice.

366
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,560
It's like a rip off of the Richard Pryor
White Guy Voice.

367
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,110
We're Richard Pryor was like,
it was a really unique thing.

368
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,050
We'd say,
you know,

369
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,070
say you know,
you can't fuck with white people and be 

370
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,070
like,
hey man,

371
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,140
your momma.
My mom's a great old gal,

372
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,100
you know,
and he,

373
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,370
he developed that sort of white guy 
voice and everybody's sort of stole it.

374
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,590
They stole it and a lot of it are 
terrible.

375
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,670
Yeah.
It's Kinda like,

376
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,860
come on man,
why don't talk like that.

377
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
That's not how they talk.
And they get,

378
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:06,860
a lot of them.
Give a horrible example.

379
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,940
It's silly man.
You could Ip,

380
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,740
but you can tell white people.
It's weird.

381
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,240
It's a weird,
a Gimme,

382
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,830
you know?
So for a lot of black guys,

383
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,930
like especially when they're first 
starting out in up,

384
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,820
that's the first thing they go to.

385
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,890
Yeah,
it isn't that one of those things that 

386
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:24,890
you see and you go,
oh,

387
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:24,890
he's going there.
Yeah,

388
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:24,890
yeah,
of course.

389
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Unless you see it done like supremely.
Well,

390
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,340
like there's,
there has to be like a super good 

391
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,340
example for you to be like.
Yeah.

392
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,660
And if the observation is really student
when you're like that,

393
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,820
that's some insight.
Yeah.

394
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:42,821
Dude,
you're picking apart something new or 

395
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:42,821
you're doing it and like you're doing a 
version of it that I haven't heard,

396
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,210
but everything else has been done,
you know,

397
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,580
so like will there always being 
minorities?

398
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,730
Do you think there's ever going to be a 
point where we're all just gray,

399
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,770
like a turn that would take that and 
color that's happening?

400
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,550
Like race is becoming more really more 
mixed across the board,

401
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,900
do you think so?
Oh definitely.

402
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Why?
Why are people attracted to blonde 

403
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:04,920
girls?

404
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Done.
But we talked about this.

405
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,760
You know what I'm not attracted to as 
blonde eyelashes and blond eyebrows.

406
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm not attracted to blonde girls.
I'm attracted to blonde girls to do shit

407
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:15,950
with her eyelashes and eyebrows.
I liked blondes the most.

408
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,810
Men.
Any funny though?

409
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,790
That's a weird or girls who don't do 
that,

410
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,590
like girls who have naturally brown 
eyebrows.

411
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,870
Yeah,
and that's why they usually I gravitate.

412
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,900
A lot of them don't really know.
What I don't like at all though is like 

413
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,690
bleached.
Oh yeah.

414
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,120
That,
that's not to be natural.

415
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,240
I like all kinds of blind.
I think a lot of times when you would 

416
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,890
take a girl that's like brown hair,
some weird color brown,

417
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,900
he make her blonde.
She's always hot or if she's like nice 

418
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,330
bleached blonde,
you know what's really freaking me out?

419
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:49,331
Man.
Amount of people that are putting shit 

420
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:49,331
in their face.

421
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:49,350
Amount of people that are probably like 
fillers in their face.

422
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,610
Yeah,
like the implants.

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,070
It's becoming.
They're not even cheek implants.

424
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,980
That's what I thought they were too.
I thought like,

425
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,680
remember when Mickey work did that 
Mickey work losses.

426
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,980
Fucking marbles.
Remember that in the nineties I guess he

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,050
had implants.
Did he get implants?

428
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,600
Yes,
he did.

429
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,870
And got them removed.
Now he had chicken plants and he looked 

430
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:09,870
bizarre.
Well,

431
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,720
I think what happened was that's when he
was boxing and when he.

432
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,990
He had a pretty intense like segment of 
his life where he just boxed and he 

433
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,840
boxed professionally.
He got his fucking brains rattled too.

434
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,890
He looks like it too,
and I think that changed him as a 

435
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:27,890
person.
You know?

436
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,790
I think it made him this wacky 
eccentric,

437
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,550
like remember Gary Busey,
he was a regular dude.

438
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,400
Crashes motorcycle becomes this wacky 
eccentric.

439
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,220
Totally crazy.
Yeah.

440
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,940
He used to be this really brilliant 
actor,

441
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,820
really talented actor like Mr Joshua.
Remember that?

442
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,040
And fucking.
What was that movie?

443
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,490
He's an exciting guy.
What movie was that?

444
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,350
We burned himself.
Yeah.

445
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,810
I forget Bruce Willis movie.
I know it was pulp fiction.

446
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,320
No,
no,

447
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,610
fuck no,
it wasn't that Gary Busey.

448
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,510
Yeah.
Gary Busey.

449
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,170
He's not in pulp fiction and he's not.
God Damn it.

450
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,040
I hate when.
I don't know.

451
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,040
I think rourke is from.
I think it's from liberty city.

452
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,430
Miami,
to my point was lethal weapon.

453
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,140
Was that what it was?
Yeah.

454
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah.
Gary Busey was in.

455
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,660
Was it lethal weapon?
I think so.

456
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,550
One of them was.
Yeah,

457
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,780
it was lethal weapon.
Hold on,

458
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,320
let's take a break.
Yeah,

459
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,950
I think that was a good fucking mood.
The creighton there.

460
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,190
Yeah.

461
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,150
Yeah.
Gary Busey was lethal weapon.

462
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah,
that's what it was a.

463
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,760
was I saying he was a regular dude and 
head trauma transformed them,

464
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,020
you know,
and I think that that's also what 

465
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,020
happened to Mickey Rourke,
you know,

466
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,480
he's a regular dude and he got so crazy 
that he'd decided to be a good idea to 

467
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,770
put,
put like plastic things inside it's 

468
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:42,770
cheeks to make his cheeks and like 
nobody would know.

469
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,210
You ever seen the photos?
Yeah.

470
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,280
And he had him removed and now he's just
got this weird thing where it's just 

471
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,680
any,
anyone that fucks with their face,

472
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:53,650
it's going to look weird.
Like,

473
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,330
I don't know if Paul Paul Mccartney,
because I got my grandma's his face.

474
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:02,331
There was a lot going on there.
I think a lot of those dudes are just 

475
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,720
botox and Botox and freeze their face 
and they can't move.

476
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,250
Like,
like if you get mad at something,

477
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:10,251
you can't move your forehead and just 
way better to be able to do that and 

478
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:10,251
look old.

479
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,580
It's so silly.
It's just you don't look better,

480
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,140
you just look weird.
You look weird.

481
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,700
Your face doesn't move while you're 
washing your face.

482
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,870
Moving these girls on these,
uh,

483
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,920
beverly hills housewives shows,
there's a lot of these women have 

484
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,070
fillers in their face and then on top of
that they have botox so they have these 

485
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,521
shiny faces that are like puffed up and 
they don't move and they looked like 

486
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:28,521
masks.
Yeah,

487
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:33,060
I was high as fuck once and I was in the
green room with Joey Diaz.

488
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Joe.
He turns on the TV and it was a Joan 

489
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,620
rivers and I just freaked out.
Just freaked out.

490
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,690
I was because I was like,
oh,

491
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,720
so baked.
And it hit me like I looked at it and 

492
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,500
that really hit me what she's done.
And you know,

493
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,270
you just want to go.
Just tell her to stop.

494
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,350
Just tell her.
Stop doing that.

495
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,330
Yeah.
Just tell her and she's doing it.

496
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,510
She doesn't make you look better.
It doesn't make you look better.

497
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,910
I look crazy.
I know,

498
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,760
I know.
It's the weirdest thing ever.

499
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,980
That frozen.
So puffy face,

500
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,030
you know,
it's like they're,

501
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,450
they're injecting things into their face
because when you get older,

502
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:09,451
the first one,
first things that happens to your face 

503
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:09,451
starts to lose body fat.
That's why you get like sorta sunk,

504
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,390
gain,
wrinkly,

505
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,740
lose.
So they,

506
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,140
they're injecting things in their puff 
it up.

507
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,430
Oh,
it's crazy.

508
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:16,720
Look.
And she looks wild.

509
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,540
Then she'd look,
it's a monster face.

510
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,700
It's a monster.
When I see these women,

511
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,220
I call the monster faces because you see
them all the time and it's like,

512
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,380
it really is just a mistake.
You know,

513
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,620
it's a mistake,
you shouldn't do it.

514
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,810
It's out of such a fear of what would it
look like?

515
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,180
I'll react.
They don't want to look old,

516
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,360
so they'd rather look crazy.
But it's also you convince yourself that

517
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,380
you could fix something.
Like,

518
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:43,381
I got hair transplants and I totally 
wish I'd never done it because I have 

519
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:43,381
this stupid scar in the back of my head 
now.

520
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:47,971
Otherwise I would shave my head,
but I got it because I was convinced 

521
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:48,190
that I could fix something.
Like my hair was falling out.

522
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:53,191
I was like,
how do I fix this certain way to fix 

523
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:53,191
this research,
ways to fix this.

524
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:53,191
You talked to the doctor,
I can fix it and he,

525
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,070
oh,
he can fix it.

526
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:54,520
Like,
okay,

527
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,720
I'll just get it fixed,
but it doesn't fix it.

528
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,710
It fixes it temporarily,
but all the other hair falls out of it.

529
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,700
The way I described it,
I said,

530
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:04,450
it's like you're taking a bunch of 
healthy people and you're moving them to

531
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,050
a neighborhood where everyone's dying.

532
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah.
So they take care of from the back of 

533
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120
your head.
They move it to the top of your head and

534
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,610
then all of its neighbors just fucking 
wilt.

535
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,910
Cowan has the exact same thing he was 
talking about on the podcast and he was 

536
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,050
saying that they.
They can pretty much get rid of a lot of

537
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,570
the scar nowadays.
Yeah,

538
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,350
they can.
Yeah.

539
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,860
Yeah.
I'm actually having treatments.

540
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,200
They shoot things in your scar.
It makes it smaller.

541
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,690
Cortisone or something.
What the fuck?

542
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:32,100
It is something but it botox.
It's not.

543
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,110
It's not like bad.
Like I've seen guys who have bad ones 

544
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,110
minds really thin.
It's a very thin car,

545
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,680
but it's long.
I've seen dudes have big fat wide.

546
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:42,940
One is skin stretches out some change.
Do you think that should have like a lot

547
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:46,240
of bling drag.
You have a giant Jesus on the cross.

548
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
It.
It'd be a conversation piece.

549
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,490
It'd be nice diamonds and no one will 
even know they'll go,

550
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,880
what's going on with your head?
Nothing.

551
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,010
Whatever.
Get like get an eagle.

552
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,140
Medallion something big eagle.
Three d,

553
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,790
maybe an eagle in the back of my head 
Bro.

554
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,880
That American bad ass.
Now you're thinking with like like it's 

555
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,630
claws will have like the American flag 
in it.

556
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,940
Did you find it?
Maybe these colors don't run.

557
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,010
Did you find it weird that capes never 
caught on?

558
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:14,011
Like it seems like we should have funded
totally fucked up that it never came 

559
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,420
back.
We didn't wear capes in the fifties like

560
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:24,460
I think maybe back in the 17 hundreds 
and castle times.

561
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,110
I think we think of that because of 
Dracula.

562
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,660
Right?
But does that what they really want?

563
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:31,360
I think it was cold as fuck back then 
and they hadn't really figured out.

564
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:35,730
Jackets,
jacket,

565
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,780
jacket,
giant thing that they would throw over 

566
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,541
them,
like a blanket that you run out of the 

567
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,831
house with if you have.
If you wear a cape now you better be 

568
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:44,510
able to back it up with shit.
That's a cool.

569
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,130
What if it had tons

570
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,520
of pockets for cell phones and money and
while it was like a book bag.

571
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,760
That was a kate.
I just think you better be cool too.

572
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,830
If I want to.
I want you to be a really cool dude.

573
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,920
You got to be a bad motherfucker for 
real.

574
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,320
When you walk away you're like,
yeah,

575
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,920
just take over that stupid shit that I 
saw today at the store where this guy,

576
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,670
grown guy probably rh had a fucking 
wallet chain,

577
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:12,671
but on it had like stuffed animals.
I think there are different kinds of 

578
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,660
pokemon texted and he had a fucking a 
raccoon tail and I'm like,

579
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,540
you are a raccoon tail stupid fake tales
that people are aware wearing.

580
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,670
That's a sad man.
How old is this guy?

581
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,140
Is Thirty,
35.

582
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,910
40.
Wow.

583
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:27,911
Oh my goodness.
I just wanted a cape is better than the 

584
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:28,040
Cape.
Is a more powerful statement.

585
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,390
Definitely the host of fear factor in 
Mexico had a Cape Real.

586
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

587
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,910
When we were doing fear factor there,
they spun off a bunch of other fear 

588
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,170
factors and one of them they did in 
Mexico.

589
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,400
I don't even know if they fucking.
It's just like official.

590
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,450
This really ranked it,
but they would copy our ideas and they 

591
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,861
would do them with no safety at all.
Like we had one where we had these 

592
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:51,650
people where they are to get a.
They had a rescue,

593
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:56,651
a dummy out of a burning building and we
put them in these crazy fire suits with 

594
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:00,251
a helmet on.
And we had dude standing by with fire 

595
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:00,470
extinguishers when the.
They did it on the Mexican show.

596
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,570
They wore shorts.
Wow.

597
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,470
They were just people in shorts running 
through a fucking house.

598
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,400
It was burning.
That's.

599
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,100
No.
Yeah,

600
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,940
it was ridiculous.

601
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,880
It was probably a regular house to.
Ours is a fake house that the,

602
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:13,930
uh,
fire department uses for training and it

603
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,970
doesn't burn down was covering murder,
drug deal that our country,

604
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:25,121
again,
our country and our culture is so 

605
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,400
engrossed with in lawsuits and that 
operates on them and the fear of them 

606
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,400
that,
you know,

607
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,510
that actually makes things way safer.
You think about it,

608
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,130
there's countries,
not necessarily Mexico,

609
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,300
but there's countries in the world were 
like,

610
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,330
that is never an issue.
Fall down.

611
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,470
They're like,
that's cool.

612
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,280
We want safety,
we want to be able to do things safe and

613
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,100
we want to be able to sue people that 
don't look out for our safety.

614
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,550
But ultimately somewhere along the line 
we're becoming a bunch of pussies with 

615
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,500
the lawsuit thing is people look at it 
as a lottery.

616
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,060
It's so ridiculous.
I mean,

617
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:58,061
there's people that have legitimate 
concerns and legitimate gentleman 

618
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:58,061
claims.

619
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:58,061
No,
there definitely are.

620
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,630
But then there's,
you read about just these,

621
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,750
you know,
it's absolutely insane things that you 

622
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:04,750
pin on somebody else for things that you
did.

623
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,820
Like everything is somebody else's 
responsibility.

624
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:12,821
You know,
about the lady that spilled the 

625
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:12,821
McDonald's coffee on.
Ridiculous.

626
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,450
I think the overturn that,
overturn that,

627
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,490
and that's not even that,
to hear some of the ones that are,

628
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
pick the ones that people win and the 
amounts for.

629
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,850
Why are you paying this person?
Have you heard about the Monsanto 

630
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,540
lawsuit?
Speaking of the guilty of chemical 

631
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,170
poisoning people in France,
they chemically poisoned the French 

632
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,170
farmer.
Wow.

633
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,170
That's going to be a big suit.
Yeah.

634
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,940
Yeah.
They,

635
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,630
they were found guilty.
Really?

636
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

637
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:41,951
I don't know the exact story apparently 
is the first such claim to ever reach 

638
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:44,000
French court and um,
Monsanto A.

639
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,690
apparently they have some fucking 
pesticide.

640
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,130
There's another thing they found out 
that 93 percent of pregnant women,

641
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,600
they've,
that they tested,

642
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,140
they found this pesticide that exists in
Monsanto.

643
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:57,720
Genetically modified crops.
Yeah.

644
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,040
Yeah.
Man,

645
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,500
you know,
our politicians sold us down a river.

646
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,610
They,
they let all this shit go on because 

647
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,110
this is a giant company that makes a ton
of money and the way they make a ton of 

648
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,111
money is they patent plants.
They genetically engineer them so that 

649
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,330
it's uniquely theirs.
And then they can decide where they sell

650
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:20,331
it.
They decide what price they have for it 

651
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:20,580
and you can't do anything about it and 
you have to buy new stuff every year and

652
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,820
buy.
If it cross pollinates with the 

653
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,681
neighbor,
they can sue the neighbor for copyright 

654
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:27,930
infringement.
It's completely crazy.

655
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:31,710
They've figured out a way to copyright 
life and they've actually tried to do it

656
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,110
with pig parts and Monsanto's crazy.

657
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,760
I mean they've tried to do with a bunch 
of different shit,

658
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
but this should have never been able to 
get to this position.

659
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,140
The this is the best evidence that the 
United States needs the best evidence.

660
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Something like Monsanto,
the best evidence that our current 

661
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,530
political system is completely corrupt 
because if you were really looking out 

662
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,711
for people,
there's no fucking way you would let a 

663
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:55,620
company make a bunch of Shit.
Take plants,

664
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,810
patent them,
then sue people because the [inaudible],

665
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,450
the,
the,

666
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,360
the air carries their pollen.
They cross pollinate neighbors,

667
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,280
plants and then this neighbor just,
you know,

668
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,800
where the fuck he got that shit from you
assholes.

669
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,290
You know,
you gotta get to sue them and you're 

670
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,010
going to take to court and it was India 
in India,

671
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:19,011
there's a whole bang fucking giant group
of farmers that have been killing 

672
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:21,250
themselves because they,
they,

673
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:25,170
they get indebted to Monsanto and they 
can't afford to pay their bills.

674
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,450
They're Monsanto's like gangsters,
but that's like mine.

675
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,140
Yeah,
they will.

676
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,420
They will shut you down if you don't 
play ball.

677
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Yeah.
Well this is crazy because you got to 

678
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,001
think about how much political poll that
they have and the fact that they still 

679
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,010
lost in court that,
that says a lot.

680
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,730
You know,
I think people are rising up and they're

681
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:46,731
getting tired of this bullshit.
It's ridiculous what these people have 

682
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:48,450
allowed to take place and it doesn't 
have to continue along the same lines.

683
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:53,451
You know,
what we really need is healthy food we 

684
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:56,811
don't need is a bunch of fucking crazy 
shit where companies come along and 

685
00:28:56,811 --> 00:29:00,000
genetically modified crops and then they
take those crops and then they sell them

686
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:05,001
to people with no evidence whatsoever 
about the longterm implications of this,

687
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,370
the exposure to some of these chemicals 
and what this.

688
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,100
What is this going to do to the 
environment you're playing with God,

689
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:11,560
man,
you're,

690
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:16,561
you're doing really crazy shit when you 
start altering life and then entering 

691
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:16,561
that.

692
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:16,860
Let me.
This isn't as simple as,

693
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,510
you know,
a packaging,

694
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,810
a new kind of soap,
you know,

695
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,830
you're doing,
you're doing something pretty fucking 

696
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:24,830
crazy.
Yeah.

697
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:24,830
That people are going to.
It's going to be in their system,

698
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,350
but there's not that much.
Yeah.

699
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,790
There's not that much evidence like it's
like,

700
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,710
or they're not that much of a history of
genetically modified foods.

701
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,880
I mean we need like 10,
20,

702
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:37,881
30 years to really analyze what the fuck
does the environment people and what's 

703
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:38,960
the chain reaction?
You know what's,

704
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,980
what does the wings of the butterfly do 
from the modified food to how's it 

705
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,940
affect the ecosystem that it all of a 
sudden it,

706
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,750
it takes over.
You know,

707
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,310
it's,
it's weird man.

708
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,470
It's weird when you start fucking with 
life.

709
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,160
You know,
I talked to this dude was talking about,

710
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,420
I was just listening to the opiod,
anthony showing what's his face was on 

711
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,630
Nicholas cage and he was talking about 
the black rhinos going extinct this year

712
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,670
and I was telling us do this and he was 
like,

713
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,560
well we could just bring it back,
you know,

714
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,690
if we were just fucking bring back the 
black rhino.

715
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,010
Oh,
you mean like you can't,

716
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,520
they do that.
Can't they do that?

717
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,810
They're talking about doing that right 
now with Willie Mamis.

718
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah.
But then it becomes the question of,

719
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,600
okay,
do we need rhinos though,

720
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,490
man,
that's just to have a couple like at 

721
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,610
zoos I think would be awesome.
Did you see there's a video in Siberia 

722
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,020
of a bear walking across a stream with 
efficient his mouth and they.

723
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,180
It's really blurry and so people were 
like,

724
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:39,210
it's a woolly mammoth in Siberia,
and then other people are going or a 

725
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,831
bear with efficient.
How can the woolly mammoth has a blue 

726
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:44,530
nose?
Stupid fucks.

727
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,320
Like maybe there's a woolly mammoth.
There's,

728
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,200
there's a whole industry devoted to 
falsely seeing stuff.

729
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,010
You know,
there's like,

730
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:54,100
there's all these shows like full our 
programs.

731
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,410
This is.
We're going to talk about the shit that 

732
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,201
we saw.
Just people telling you saw some shit 

733
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:01,201
and you're like,
that's fucking bullshit,

734
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:01,201
man.

735
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:02,290
You didn't see anything.
You know what?

736
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,350
I really learned that when I did that 
game show in my head show,

737
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,170
I did this show for CBS and what the 
show was.

738
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:13,171
It was a game show with hidden cameras 
and the way it worked was we would.

739
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,060
I was the host.
I don't have a dude with a little 

740
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,290
earpiece and I would send them out to a 
place and the cameras were already in 

741
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:22,290
place.
Hidden cameras were in place.

742
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:22,480
I go,
all right,

743
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,110
dude,
you're ready.

744
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:23,560
He goes,
yeah.

745
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,730
I go,
here's the deal.

746
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,380
You're a reporter and you are there for 
the biggest story of your life.

747
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,410
There was a Ufo over Hollywood and all 
these people saw it,

748
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,480
but by the time you got your camera 
there and got it set up,

749
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,870
all the people went away.
So what you gotTa do is you've got to 

750
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,970
find someone to get on camera with you 
and,

751
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,340
and talk about their Ufo experience and 
you got to say,

752
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,340
you got to get them to say that they 
were abducted and probed.

753
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,490
Oh,
in the guy's like,

754
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:55,240
okay,
okay.

755
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:55,840
Okay.
All right.

756
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,300
Here we go.
And it was immediate.

757
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,130
It was immediate.
It was like no one said no.

758
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,970
He goes,
listen man,

759
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,860
I'm a reporter for the snap.
Here's the deal.

760
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:07,861
There was just a Ufo sighting.
Do you think I could get you to come on 

761
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:08,060
camera and say that you sought?
Oh yeah,

762
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:08,440
yeah,
yeah.

763
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,420
And then people would just start 
talking.

764
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,380
They were like,
well,

765
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:14,020
it was bright silver and it was sort of 
spinning over the,

766
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,520
uh,
over the hemisphere.

767
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,640
And uh,
what happened was they just give just 

768
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,490
lately like detailed accounts.
It's like at this point people been so 

769
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,261
poisoned like pop culture and by the 
idea of Ufo so they can just recall 

770
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,190
because they just have this like,
yeah,

771
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:34,630
frozen fake idea in their head from 100 
movies and they can get just,

772
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,430
Oh yeah,
I remember what happened in that movie I

773
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:41,431
just yet.
Or there was lights and lights are 

774
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:41,431
detail.
They've

775
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:41,431
seen it.
I've seen it 100 times.

776
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,010
It was amazing.
They just,

777
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,570
they just lied.
They lied.

778
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,690
Not only did they lie,
they lied and were willing to sign a 

779
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,070
waiver saying that they lied and that we
were going to show it on TV.

780
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,560
Credible.
It was nuts.

781
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,600
People love those shit about stories 
because they love to be the one to 

782
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,350
report everybody.
There's a fascination with like,

783
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,990
you wouldn't know what happened.
Yeah,

784
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and you get the report and then every.
Because everybody focuses on you and 

785
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,000
they're like,
what happened?

786
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,410
And so if you're willing to give them 
the goods,

787
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,840
people are willing to listen and you get
like a.

788
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,210
You know,
you get a charge out of out of being the

789
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:19,211
one that told everybody they love it.
Anybody like it's amazing that they're 

790
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:20,900
willing to just make it up just for 
that,

791
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:21,620
for that feeling.

792
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,830
I think people,
there's a lot of people that lived lives

793
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,270
of such shit.
Their lives suck so bad that they almost

794
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:34,271
believe what they're saying when they 
tell you some story about seeing 

795
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:34,271
bigfoot.
Sure.

796
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:38,140
You know,
it was probably a bear and it was 20 

797
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,940
years ago and they were scared and it 
was dusk and it was like more.

798
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:44,941
If he made eye contact with me,
I'll tell you this right now to the day 

799
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,940
I die,
I swear on my,

800
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,210
the eyes of my children.
That was a sasquatch and they fucking 

801
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:51,220
believe it,
man.

802
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,800
By the time 20 years have passed and 
they've added all kinds of shit.

803
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,500
Man.
That member even told him.

804
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,550
I told him,
you have your memories that you have 

805
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,090
from like anything more than like five 
years ago.

806
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:03,380
What?
What is that really?

807
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,310
Do you really mean?
Might remember some really intense shit.

808
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,630
Yeah,
barely.

809
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,620
Barely.
Yeah,

810
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,250
but barely.
I mean,

811
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:15,251
you could recall data and information,
but how much of that memory can you 

812
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:15,830
really pull out?
I remember making up a story as a kid.

813
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,800
I remember making up a story as a kid 
and spending it,

814
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:23,801
the people until the point where it was 
like I would just tell people in detail 

815
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:27,290
for like years from like fifth grade to 
like and then one day I was like,

816
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,760
I'm fucked.
I'm like,

817
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,520
I just completely made this up.
I told the story to people about it 

818
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,660
because we lived in Minneapolis for 
like,

819
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,910
how cold is it getting Minneapolis?
And I was like,

820
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,090
December 20,
fourth of 1989.

821
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,380
It was 74 below zero.
I'm like,

822
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,510
yeah.
And I was like,

823
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,480
it was so cold.
My teacher's ears pros and they fell off

824
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,170
and they're like,
shut up.

825
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,220
I was standing at a bus stop.
We're outside of sacred heart bus came 

826
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,720
up.
She didn't have a hat on.

827
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,760
We'd never.
It was like the coolest thing ever.

828
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,000
And she went to touch her left ear and 
it fell off.

829
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:00,530
It was frozen.
And then when she went to grab her,

830
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:05,531
right,
it fell off in her hand and her ears 

831
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:05,531
fell off.
I saw it the fuck out of here.

832
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm like,
yeah,

833
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,070
that's what happened is real.

834
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,450
Like one day I was just like telling 
somebody,

835
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:12,560
no,
that doesn't sound right.

836
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm like,
yeah,

837
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:17,861
I think I made this shit up.
Like you forgot what I made it up 

838
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,140
because I made it up for that feeling.
But when,

839
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,050
you know,
when you first discovered the feeling,

840
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,170
even 10 years old and you tell someone 
some wild shit and they'd go,

841
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,070
what?
You're like,

842
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,240
oh,
that feels kind of good.

843
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,540
And so like it was like a 10 year old 
version of that that I told when I was 

844
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:35,600
10,
11,

845
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,250
12.
And then when I'm like 14,

846
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,270
15,
I was like,

847
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I don't think I saw this ad.
I think I was 10 years old and I told 

848
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,131
you that my teacher's ears fall off.
Do you think that's what happened with 

849
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:49,131
Oj?
That.

850
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:50,550
Oh,
that his story,

851
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,100
it was just became almost like 
indiscernible,

852
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,530
like maybe this is real.
I don't know what happened.

853
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:59,160
Um,
and I think that is such a crazy reality

854
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,170
that we have,
that we had that figure in our lifetime 

855
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,750
that is a spectacular climb and fall.
There's almost,

856
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,760
that's almost unparalleled when you 
really think about it to be a heisman 

857
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,170
trophy winning,
like unblock top,

858
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,110
top tier world class athlete and 
celebrity.

859
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,000
That parlayed into this awesome TV movie
career.

860
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,160
I mean he was at rental car.
I was like,

861
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,170
dude,
that is,

862
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,030
that's it.
Like that's basically,

863
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,750
that's the top of the mountain when it 
comes to an athlete's career.

864
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,010
Yeah,
transitioning into,

865
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,570
that's,
that's a model to follow.

866
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,670
Like it had to do it.
And then for that to be the guy fucking 

867
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,010
just butchered people.
He says crazy.

868
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,270
Cut them up over some pussy and then 
stole wanting to steal back his shit.

869
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,860
That's my shit man.
Let it go son.

870
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,210
And now he's locked up for another.
Like he,

871
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,470
he,
he beat the craziest,

872
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,260
like the crime that we all know.
It's so crazy.

873
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,530
He'd beat that charge and went back for 
some dumb shit.

874
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,650
Some dumb beyond dumb shit on taking his
memorabilia back with the station.

875
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,850
Was that what it was?
The palace station.

876
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,630
I station man first on the UFC.
That was one.

877
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,910
That was my first Las Vegas Gig.
Really?

878
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,950
You played the power station?
The power station.

879
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,910
Wow.
That's locals,

880
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:22,911
right?
Those are locals and people from out of 

881
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:23,670
town that don't know any better.

882
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,200
Yeah.
That's the place to where like you,

883
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,770
uh,
or people actually don't like to gamble,

884
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,810
like to go to those places.
They just liked to gamble because they 

885
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:32,810
have better odds.
Yeah,

886
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:32,810
that's true.
Yeah.

887
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,250
Because if you go to like the Bellagio 
or is one of the big casinos,

888
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:37,680
mgm grand or something like that,
they kind of,

889
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,940
I think,
you know,

890
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:40,410
they're probably better at getting your 
money.

891
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah,
that Shit's mostly bullshit.

892
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,170
It seems like it's just,
Oh,

893
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,820
we're here.
Let's go spend some money.

894
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,440
Quick,
man.

895
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,180
It's weird.
It's weird.

896
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,960
I've seen people lose hundreds of 
thousands of dollars watched.

897
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,210
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

898
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,780
What's coming to Vegas?
I've been going to vegas doing UFC since

899
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:58,890
2000.
One,

900
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,920
2002.
That's when I started going to watch 

901
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,470
2001.
I started going right after nine slash 

902
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,470
11.
I saw Tito Ortiz took on Vladimir Matt,

903
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,190
you shouldn't go.
That was right after September 11.

904
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,260
You called that?
No,

905
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,480
no,
no.

906
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,920
I was uh,
I wasn't in the audience.

907
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,630
So realauction yeah.
Didn't,

908
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,200
didn't work for them back then.
I was just,

909
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,760
I was just a fan and a.
So from then you know,

910
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,580
to,
to 2012.

911
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,970
I've seen some people throw some crazy 
money away,

912
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:28,290
man.
Just a weird place when you have one 

913
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,400
area where all the rules are different.
One area,

914
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,490
one area,
one area we could fucking drink whenever

915
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:37,491
you want one spot.
We've got this spot and you can just 

916
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:37,491
fucking 6:00
in the morning and have a drink.

917
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:38,890
You don't ever have to leave your hotel.
Dude.

918
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,560
We got a giant hotel where you can 
wander around.

919
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,130
We have world class food here in every 
way you can gamble.

920
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,860
If they had a strip club in the major 
hotels,

921
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,980
it would really be the perfect place.
A trip club and a pool hall.

922
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,870
I become never have to.
You never have to go anywhere.

923
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,150
The Strip club would be that.
That'd be like $100,000,000

924
00:38:56,151 --> 00:38:58,260
a year revenue generated,
probably would,

925
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,130
you know,
it'd be too much,

926
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,950
too much,
too dark to deck and make people leave,

927
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,390
you know,
make people go somewhere.

928
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,690
But there's places they have in Vegas,
they're like the biggest strip clubs in 

929
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,340
the world.
Did you know her enormous that like,

930
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,590
you know,
Macau,

931
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,360
China.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

932
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,150
It's a place in China.
Yeah.

933
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,660
No,
that's theirs.

934
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,700
That's their vegas.
That's their gambling,

935
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,690
uh,
that,

936
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,740
that place that China use place does 
something like three or four times the,

937
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:26,410
uh,
the,

938
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,760
the money that Vegas does,
like it blows it away.

939
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,980
Is it because of volume or because they 
gamble more?

940
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Uh,
I would think it's a combination of two 

941
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Chinese gamble hard,
dude.

942
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,610
I didn't know they,
they build the places in Vegas.

943
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,910
A lot of them build it just to the 
standard.

944
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:43,490
Yeah.
Two for the child.

945
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,350
For agent sway.
Yeah.

946
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:46,090
And this,
uh,

947
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,210
the numbers of the floors are important.
Yeah.

948
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,920
The way it's set up as important and 
there's things that aren't lucky.

949
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,420
They make sure that they do it in 
accordance with what,

950
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,770
what Chinese people think is lucky.
Mgm,

951
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,850
mgm used to be.
Remember what the entrance of the mgm 

952
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,051
was when it opened.
What was the main entrance was a lion's 

953
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:04,051
mouth.
You were walking in it.

954
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:04,690
Bad luck for them.
Right.

955
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:05,920
And the Asians were like,
no thanks.

956
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,030
And they're like,
hold on a second,

957
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,290
we're going to take that shit down right
now.

958
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,080
They got the line right.
That's right.

959
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,970
That's right.
They don't want to walk through a lion's

960
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:13,870
mouth.
Yeah.

961
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,720
Well that's because in their country and
get eaten by a tiger,

962
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,960
you know,
they just took that line out of the mgm,

963
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,880
you know,
the law and that was living in there.

964
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,820
It's the most depressing thing.
Terrifying.

965
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,980
And they attacked the trainer there 
once.

966
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,970
Oh really?
Yeah.

967
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,690
Yeah.
There's a,

968
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:30,970
there's video of it.
Lion attacks trainer at MGM.

969
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,220
Yeah.
It's pretty fucked up and Polish it up.

970
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,020
See if I can find it.
Yeah,

971
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:37,420
they're the.
I think my favorite is the shark tank at

972
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,800
Mandalay Bay.
That's amazing.

973
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:42,780
Most bad ass attraction.
That's a dope ass aquarium setup.

974
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,310
Yeah,
they have a huge tank filled with sharks

975
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:50,311
and they have these cool ass jellyfish 
and the jellyfish are all like under 

976
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:52,120
these psychedelic neon lights and 
they're floating around.

977
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,030
That's a bad ass fish tank is a crazy 
video.

978
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,600
It's a bizarre video.
The MGM,

979
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,660
the guys are in the tank with the lot.
Put your hand down so I can see the mgm 

980
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,021
guys are in the tank with giant male 
lions man and for whatever reason the 

981
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:10,780
lines is just like pitch here.

982
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,150
He gets up.
I don't know what happens.

983
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,240
He just finds the guy week,
you know,

984
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,620
he just.
I bet they're just annoyed man.

985
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,770
They're trapped in this fucking box with
these little pink bitches that think 

986
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,771
that they could survive.
Like why do you think you could stand 

987
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:28,321
next to a lion?
I don't care if you raise that thing 

988
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:28,321
with a bottle.
Look at the size that look at.

989
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:28,800
He just decides that Jack,
the dude like,

990
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,860
look at that man.
Just decides a fuck that dude up for no 

991
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,030
reason that a female jumps in and even 
if their plan,

992
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,800
even if he's playing,
it's like whatever,

993
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,700
man.
Look at him,

994
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:41,150
he's just goes after that guy for no 
reason and that guy was like,

995
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,350
oh shit.
And the other guy,

996
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,300
for whatever reason,
he's listening to the other guy,

997
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,570
so the other guy gets in between the two
of them and the lion chases him.

998
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,750
The guy almost gets jacked.
Wow.

999
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,140
How scary.
It must have been two people took that 

1000
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,840
shit with their cell phones.
Look at the size of his fucking head and

1001
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:00,440
all that crazy hair around them.
What are nutty animal man?

1002
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,660
That's crazy.
I did not hear about this.

1003
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,250
Well,
nobody died,

1004
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,940
but it was a freak moment and you know 
if they have that hair around their neck

1005
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,560
just so that other lions can't kill 
them.

1006
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,710
I thought it was interesting with the 
girl line kind of like was like,

1007
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,210
Hey,
stop what you're biting a human like did

1008
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:19,820
you notice that?
She kind of jumped bond had been like,

1009
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:22,160
can I bite him to shit?
Got Crazy.

1010
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,620
If some blood came out and she might 
have fucked him up too,

1011
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,140
because they're the hunters,
the females at one hunters.

1012
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,990
Have you been following this whole thing
with the judge?

1013
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,550
Nappy tanoe that got fired Fox business 
fast.

1014
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,630
That's crazy and the whole is.
I didn't know anything about the Israeli

1015
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,900
connection that people pull that pull 
that video up.

1016
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Okay.
So we can listen to it because it's not 

1017
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:46,920
long and it's a shocking judge.
Judge Nepal Tano.

1018
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,940
He had a show on Fox business where he 
would really be like super honest about 

1019
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:54,510
stuff and you know,
really have a,

1020
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,560
an astute,
a breakdown of how our political system 

1021
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,031
really functions and how are the 
American public has been lied to from 

1022
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:07,070
the beginning and the way he did it is 
by posing a bunch of questions.

1023
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,220
What if this,
what if that would've been the way he 

1024
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,220
does it?
Man,

1025
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,220
it's,
it's,

1026
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,480
it's a different video that I was.
Listen to this.

1027
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,710
Now that that's a different video,
what you're talking about a,

1028
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:20,060
I'll find that this was the video that 
got them fired,

1029
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:20,900
fired.

1030
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,600
He got fired the other day for this 
broadcast.

1031
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,230
Well,
no,

1032
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,540
that's,
that's he.

1033
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,150
The other video was on that as well.
I see the one that you just pulled up,

1034
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:34,151
but in the other video was being touted 
as something that got them fired as 

1035
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:37,091
well.
Apparently they were gonna fire them no 

1036
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:37,091
matter what,
and this was his,

1037
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:40,360
his go out,
but listen to what he says that 

1038
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,180
validates an establishment that never 
meaningfully changes.

1039
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,360
What if that establishment doesn't want 
that doesn't have the consent of the 

1040
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,081
governed.
What if the two party system was 

1041
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:51,410
actually a mechanism used to live at so 
called public opinion?

1042
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,410
What if that were more than two sides to
every issue,

1043
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,380
but the two parties wanted to box you 
into a corner,

1044
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:02,470
one of their corners.
What if there's no such thing as public 

1045
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,090
opinion because every thinking person 
has opinions that are uniquely his own,

1046
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,420
what have what we call public opinion 
was just a manufactured narrative that 

1047
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,520
makes it easier to convince people that 
if their views are different,

1048
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,820
that there's something wrong with that 
or there's something wrong with them.

1049
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:22,390
What if the whole purpose of the 
Democratic and Republican parties was 

1050
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,080
not to expand voters choices but to 
limit them?

1051
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,560
What if the widely perceived differences
between the two parties was just an 

1052
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,951
illusion?
What if the heart of the government 

1053
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:32,951
policy the same

1054
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:37,280
no matter who's in the White House?
What if the heart of government policy 

1055
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,070
remains the same?
No matter what the people want?

1056
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,300
What if those vaunted differences 
between Democrat and Republican?

1057
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,550
We're actually just minor disagreements.
What if both parties just want power and

1058
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:52,551
are willing to have young people fight 
meaningless wars in order to enhance 

1059
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:56,331
that power?
What if both parties continue to fight 

1060
00:44:56,331 --> 00:44:59,061
the war on drugs just to give 
bureaucrats on cops bigger budgets and 

1061
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:03,891
more jobs?
What have government policies didn't 

1062
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:06,660
change when government leaders did?
What if no matter who won an election,

1063
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,020
government stayed the same?
What if government was really a 

1064
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,111
revolving door for political hacks?
Then and exploiting the people once 

1065
00:45:15,111 --> 00:45:18,270
they're in charge of both parties 
supported welfare,

1066
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:19,120
war,
death,

1067
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
they allowed some big government.
What if the rhetoric they candidates 

1068
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,400
displayed on the campaign trail was 
jumped after electoral victory?

1069
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,930
What if Barack Obama campaign as an 
antiwar pro civil liberties candidate 

1070
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,860
and then wage senseless wars while 
assaulting your rights that the 

1071
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,401
constitution is supposed to protect?
What if George W dot Bush campaign on a 

1072
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:44,721
platform of non intervention and small 
government and then wage they foreign 

1073
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:48,540
policy of muscular military intervention
and a domestic policy,

1074
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:53,541
a vast government borrowing and growth?
What if Bill Clinton declared that the 

1075
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:58,041
era of big government was over,
but actually just convince Republicans 

1076
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:02,691
like Newt Gingrich,
that they can get what they want at a 

1077
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,050
big government to what if the 
Republicans went along with it?

1078
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,130
What if Ronald Reagan spent six years 
running for president,

1079
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:13,370
promising to shrink the government,
but then the government grew while he 

1080
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,061
was in the lighthouse?
What if not withstanding Reagan's ideas 

1081
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:18,030
and cheerfulness and libertarian 
rhetoric,

1082
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,880
there really was no Reagan revolution at
all.

1083
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,550
What if all this is happening again?

1084
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,980
What if Rick Santorum is being embraced 
by voters who want small government even

1085
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:32,730
though Senator Santorum voted for the 
Patriot Act for an expansion of Medicare

1086
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,730
and for raising the debt ceiling by 
trillions of dollars?

1087
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,350
What if Mitt Romney is being embraced by
voters who want anyone but Barack Obama,

1088
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,710
but they don't realize that Mitt Romney 
might as well be Barack Obama on 

1089
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,491
everything from warfare to welfare?
What if Ron Paul is being ignored by the

1090
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:54,621
media,
not because as it claims he's 

1091
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:57,230
unappealing or unelectable,
but because he doesn't fit into the 

1092
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,101
premanufactured public opinion mold used
by the establishment to pigeon hole the 

1093
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:06,621
electorate and create the so called 
narrative that drives media coverage of 

1094
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:10,821
elections.
What if the biggest difference between 

1095
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:11,490
most candidates was not substance but 
style?

1096
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,520
What if those stylistic differences were
packaged,

1097
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:19,521
the substantive ones to reinforce the 
illusion of a difference between 

1098
00:47:19,521 --> 00:47:23,631
Democrats and Republicans would've met 
won Mitt Romney wins and ends up 

1099
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,330
continuing most of the same policies 
that Barack Obama promoted.

1100
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,990
What if Barack Obama's to or merely 
extensions of those from George W dot 

1101
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,860
Bush?
What if a government that manipulated us

1102
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,950
could be fired?
What if a government that lacked the 

1103
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,130
true and knowing consent of the governed
could be dismissed?

1104
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Now he's getting crazy,
but if it were possible to have a real 

1105
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,800
game changer,
what if we need a Ron Pole to preserve 

1106
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,640
and protect our freedoms from the 
government?

1107
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:56,641
That's what he got fired for.
What if we can make elections matter 

1108
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:57,610
again?
What if we could do something about this

1109
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,570
from the arc defending freedom every 
night of the week.

1110
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,680
So depressing that we're really in a 
situation where this is the situation 

1111
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,260
now where we're really stuck here.
We're really,

1112
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,590
this is where we're at 2012 is.
That is absolutely right.

1113
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,270
I don't know if that was his final 
broadcast,

1114
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:17,610
but it was a very powerful one and that 
is powerful stuff.

1115
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,740
The other one that he talks about,
he makes connections on nine slash 11 

1116
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,470
with Israeli.
Like how it's like,

1117
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,280
it's really weird to actually watch it.
What was their reason?

1118
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,320
What did they announce was the reason 
for firing him?

1119
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,660
I don't think they did.
I think,

1120
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:33,280
uh,
you know,

1121
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:38,281
the look,
people get fired for all sorts of 

1122
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:41,521
different things all the time.
I'm not necessarily sure that he got 

1123
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:41,521
fired because of that,
you know,

1124
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:43,800
but that's definitely something he went 
pretty fucking.

1125
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,270
Was this guy getting farther out?
Yeah,

1126
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:46,780
yeah,
yeah.

1127
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:47,710
It was pretty popular.

1128
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,710
It should be even more popular now with 
the things that he said they're gonna 

1129
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:52,710
they're going to take off on the 
Internet,

1130
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,130
you know,
that that video is going to take off the

1131
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:59,131
Internet already is right.
What is it with the hits on it right 

1132
00:48:59,131 --> 00:48:59,330
now?
Four hundred and $44,000.

1133
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,050
And by the way,
there's a gang of those is not just that

1134
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:02,760
one.
Yeah,

1135
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:07,770
there's a gang of those that are out 
there that's not just one person put it 

1136
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:07,770
up on Youtube.
Yeah,

1137
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,300
it's fucking powerful shit man.
He is absolutely right to.

1138
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,520
I mean how would,
how do you fire the government though?

1139
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:13,980
Let's look,
you know,

1140
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,930
something's going to happen though.
Something's happening.

1141
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,960
You know,
and I think governments recognizing it 

1142
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960
as well,
you know,

1143
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960
this is going to be an adjustment is 
going to be some.

1144
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,040
There has to be because otherwise it's a
dictatorship.

1145
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,400
You know,
at a certain point in time when you're 

1146
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:29,830
really not doing the will of the people 
at all and you're really are suppressing

1147
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:32,530
the people and you really are taking 
away liberties.

1148
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:34,900
You really trying to turn us into a 
fucking crazy dictatorship.

1149
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,820
Really.
Not much different than that.

1150
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,880
I don't know if anybody used this shit 
without being cynical after you after 

1151
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,811
Obama,
after or just after you turn a certain 

1152
00:49:45,811 --> 00:49:45,811
age.
Like I feel like it's all.

1153
00:49:45,811 --> 00:49:49,240
I really do feel like it doesn't matter.
Like whoever you vote for,

1154
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,340
that nothing is really going to be 
different.

1155
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,490
No one has ever really like,
you know,

1156
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,830
you start hearing the.
When the speeches started coming about,

1157
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:58,840
we're tying to change Hollywood.
I'm not even.

1158
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,930
I'm not A.
I'm a Washington outsider.

1159
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,310
I'm about to go in there.
We're gonna change it up now.

1160
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,780
That's the always the one where you're 
like,

1161
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:05,530
that's not going to happen.

1162
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,770
Then after a certain age,
you realize it's not gonna happen.

1163
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,990
You've realized they're not telling me 
the truth.

1164
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,750
If Obama wanted to say some really 
radical things,

1165
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:15,160
he could have already said it.
You know,

1166
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:19,030
Chris Rock really did this really 
fascinating interview recently.

1167
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:21,730
We said that he thinks it'll bomb was 
going to wait until his second term.

1168
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,010
Then he's going to do some crazy shit.
I'm like,

1169
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:29,250
God,
that sounds like you're wishful 

1170
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,250
thinking.
You know,

1171
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,870
that sounds to me like are you paid 
attention to what he has done?

1172
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Almost irreversible damage.
That National Defense Authorization Act 

1173
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,830
that treats the United States like a 
battlefield and allows indefinite 

1174
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,400
suspension or detention of American 
civilians with no warrant.

1175
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,010
That's insanity.
You don't need that.

1176
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,710
We're not falling apart.
We don't have violence in the streets 

1177
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,951
every day.
We're not in the middle of an Arab 

1178
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,391
spring situation.
We don't have nuclear bombs dropping on 

1179
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:52,391
our city.

1180
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:55,510
What the fuck are you doing?
Instigating or pushing forward those 

1181
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,740
kinds of laws and legislation.
The number one thing that we're supposed

1182
00:50:57,741 --> 00:51:02,741
to be about is the pursuit of liberty.
It's supposed to be liberty and justice 

1183
00:51:02,741 --> 00:51:02,741
for all.
That's how.

1184
00:51:02,741 --> 00:51:03,380
That's how it ends,
right?

1185
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,170
With liberty and justice for all.
That's what we want.

1186
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,260
And you're taking away liberty for what?
For what are you giving us extra 

1187
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,050
justice?
Is that why,

1188
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,600
you know,
that's bullshit is what it is.

1189
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:18,470
It's 100 percent bullshit.
It's not representative of the people.

1190
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,060
It's.
It's sad and it's got change.

1191
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,270
It's just how I was a change.
I don't know.

1192
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,890
It scares the shit out of everybody.
Right?

1193
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:30,010
Absolutely.
You know that judges are on twitter 

1194
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:30,010
under judge nap nap.
Oh really?

1195
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,280
Maybe get him on an upcoming podcast.
Things so maybe even talk to us.

1196
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,170
Sure.
He'd probably lock us in jail.

1197
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,450
I don't know about that.
His heritage nap.

1198
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,760
He's just a good palm made.
What's your full name?

1199
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:42,350
What's his name?
Paula autonomy.

1200
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,140
I call them nappy Tana because he has an
amputation.

1201
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,600
I'm following them now.
He's only got 55,000

1202
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:49,580
followers.
Freedom Watch.

1203
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,350
Yeah.
Cancel that shit.

1204
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,720
Him and Alex Jones.
We need to get Alex Jones on his podcast

1205
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:55,280
also sometime.
Yeah,

1206
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:57,050
Alex is going to do it.
He'll do it when he's in La.

1207
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:02,051
Again,
in Alex's book and if you have an Alex 

1208
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:03,620
on our podcast,
you'll get a view as to what's up.

1209
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,970
He's right about a lot of shit,
man.

1210
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:09,971
I mean he's a soldier.
He's out there fucking beating the 

1211
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:10,430
bushes.
He daily show the daily show.

1212
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,080
He has a whole studio.
The whole.

1213
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,410
Yeah.
Studio is pretty fucking impressive.

1214
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,370
It shows huge.
It's enormous.

1215
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:18,440
There's a lot of people listen to it.
You know.

1216
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,150
It's all doom and gloom though,
man.

1217
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:20,650
Yeah,
I've seen.

1218
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:25,670
I've seen clips of him gloom.
The best show we ever had was the time 

1219
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,670
of Joey Diaz took over.
Oh,

1220
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,350
I remember that.
I remember that day.

1221
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:32,430
Boom,
that we've talked about it too many 

1222
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:32,430
times on the podcast.
You'll remember that.

1223
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,130
The most glorious things I've ever seen.
I've never been the type of person that 

1224
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:36,130
when you drive around and you see like a
hot chick,

1225
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,580
like you'll wink at them or give them 
kissy faces and anything.

1226
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,100
Lately I've been doing it more just 
because I realized that because I 

1227
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,780
realized you pretty much can do that and
you'll never see that person ever again.

1228
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:51,930
They'll never know who you're putting 
out a creeper feel creepy ones.

1229
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,820
I'd just be like making like silly faces
at them or I don't even worse.

1230
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,670
They don't even know you and you're 
making silly faces.

1231
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,310
It's just funny seeing people's 
reactions and I love it,

1232
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,460
dude.
How many people?

1233
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,750
There's a lot of fear that you're 
generating out some bad.

1234
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:06,870
Who you out there,
Bro?

1235
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,230
It's mostly laughter.
Laughter,

1236
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,910
laughter.
They'll laugh.

1237
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1238
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,590
Well that's good.
Yeah.

1239
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,110
It's just like they look over like what 
the fuck's going on over here?

1240
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,290
Yeah,
probably that's where you just decided 

1241
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:23,290
to be a creep,
but this age.

1242
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:23,300
Yeah.
I don't know why it started.

1243
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,250
I think it's because it's.
I saw somebody

1244
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,410
do it to somebody else wants and I was 
like,

1245
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:33,411
that's hilarious.
Did that person just made that person 

1246
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:33,411
like laugh and then drove off it?
Never to see that person again.

1247
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:36,780
So have you ever been around the one guy
who can't hit a check?

1248
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,870
You know that guy who you're hanging out
with them and you,

1249
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:44,871
you,
you can't even hang out with them 

1250
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:44,871
because they'll just abandon you for a 
check?

1251
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:46,410
Yeah.
I remember when I was in an apartment in

1252
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:51,411
Hollywood when I was like 21,
22 and had some friends come out and it 

1253
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,200
was one of the guys was that guy who 
just can't stop.

1254
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,290
So when I went to bed I had,
I had my bedroom,

1255
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:01,290
we had like three friends in the living 
room and one girl who we all,

1256
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:04,350
we had all gone to school together and I
was offered her.

1257
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,400
I was like,
you can sleep in my bed,

1258
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:07,220
like,
not in a creepy way but like,

1259
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:09,120
you can put like a fuck you,
like,

1260
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,710
I'm going to try but I'm not going to 
make it.

1261
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,250
Like,
so anyways.

1262
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:14,790
She was like,
Nah,

1263
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm good.
Um,

1264
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,070
I'll sleep out here.
And I was like,

1265
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,020
all right,
like,

1266
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,110
you know,
fun.

1267
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,860
And then like five minutes later I got 
like a,

1268
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,640
like a knock on the door and was like,
what's up?

1269
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:24,780
And she's there.
And she was like,

1270
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:30,140
yeah,
he just tried to lick my neck when I 

1271
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,140
was,
when I went to sleep.

1272
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,140
Oh my God.
I was like,

1273
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,630
you want to ship in here now?
And she was like,

1274
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:31,440
yeah,
I was like,

1275
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,370
okay,
that's cool.

1276
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,920
And then I wasn't a creep though.
You didn't try to fuck her.

1277
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,930
Did you try to spoon her at all?
I think so.

1278
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,900
UHM.
You got to Swat.

1279
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,300
I think she swabbed you like get off me.
It definitely didn't happen.

1280
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,750
She came for comfort and then you just 
know I didn't,

1281
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,700
I didn't cheat cuddle with you at all?
No,

1282
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,790
I think it was very much like because 
when somebody just as leaving,

1283
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,040
she was just leaving.
Like that shit was really uncomfortable.

1284
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,010
I was going to be like,
well let me extend that feeling for,

1285
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:57,210
you know,
I was just like,

1286
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,080
you try to settle into a new level and 
then creep slowly.

1287
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,470
Honestly,
I can tell you this.

1288
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,890
There's a lot of times when I was single
that I didn't pursue that stuff because 

1289
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,390
I was too tired.
And because you're too tired,

1290
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,480
I would just go to sleep.
I was.

1291
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,240
Why is that?
Why are you so tired?

1292
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,650
No,
I mean like when it was late at night,

1293
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,170
like I was a,
I was a hot chick,

1294
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:16,560
what would it be?

1295
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,180
I'd be like,
yeah,

1296
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:17,820
I'm gonna.
Go Sleep.

1297
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,530
Whoa.
That's weird.

1298
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,390
Yeah.
I wrote checked out.

1299
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,100
No,
but I'm saying that alcohol,

1300
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,210
alcohol,
alcohol is not sober.

1301
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,300
Yeah.
There's nothing sadder than having a 

1302
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,300
whiskey Dick.
Probably.

1303
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,880
Maybe I'd be like.
I'd made it totally potential.

1304
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:37,080
Like College.
They think wanna go to sleep right now.

1305
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,300
That sounds like the best thing and I 
would lay down.

1306
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,130
Yeah,
I just got my thyroid checked.

1307
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:44,420
Has got a physical using the same time.
Tommy and I.

1308
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,290
It's so funny because he's the fucking 
best doctors.

1309
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,340
Dr.
Oh,

1310
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:54,341
I thought you were hearing about Brian 
getting a physical medical shit.

1311
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,110
Did he check your asshole out because he
didn't skip my answer.

1312
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,330
I was like,
I cleaned it for hours,

1313
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:02,150
you know,
and brush.

1314
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,950
No,
I didn't want to see things that scratch

1315
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,980
your asshole and Maxi Pad.
Lupas a loofah.

1316
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,390
Sponge Loofah.

1317
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,930
I scratched it all on the inside.
That's the important.

1318
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,710
And then I didn't do anything.
I did when I was in the shower,

1319
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,000
I was testing.
All right,

1320
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:26,001
this is what it's kind of gonna be like,
like I just wanted to like what are they

1321
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:28,270
looking for?
Bumps.

1322
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,670
Well they didn't do,
he didn't do it.

1323
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,750
No.
They reach it and they look different.

1324
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Cancer.
See I was most concerned about my 

1325
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,801
asshole too,
so I'm really kind of upset that he 

1326
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:40,801
didn't.
Why were you most concerned about?

1327
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:42,740
Because I think,
I think that's death would be from.

1328
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,710
That would be from assholes that you 
will get.

1329
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:47,400
It won't be you smoke cigarettes you,
you worry about.

1330
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,040
But I just worry about your.
I have weird ass issues.

1331
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,700
We've talked about that,
but he did feel my balls up,

1332
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:59,701
which was weird.
Like guy and he's just like rolling 

1333
00:56:59,701 --> 00:56:59,701
around in his hand and goes yep,
that's fine.

1334
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:01,090
Did you think that maybe if he jerked 
you off you could come?

1335
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,970
No,
no,

1336
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,680
I had my dick is so small that it gets 
checked check,

1337
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,060
but I almost want to point it out like I
almost want to be like,

1338
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:13,220
every time I'd get like a physical,
it's more like I want to be like,

1339
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:18,270
you just,
you should see it some other time a 

1340
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,440
little better than let me check my cock.
He did like the thing where he had to 

1341
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:21,940
like pull it out and I'm like one of 
those old hippy,

1342
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,500
a guitar string,
you know,

1343
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,050
where you hold the thing.
They like pulled it out and looked at it

1344
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,450
and then he check on it and then took 
all these blood tests.

1345
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,760
But he's testing me for everything and 
then he's like,

1346
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:32,080
all right,
so when you went to all stds,

1347
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:32,480
I'm like,
yeah,

1348
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,930
I'm dating a porn star.

1349
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,410
And he goes,
Oh,

1350
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:37,720
you are you guys all right,
we can do that.

1351
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:42,721
Brian's office.
You know how it is when you're dating a 

1352
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:43,480
porn?
He said is,

1353
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:43,900
he's like,
well,

1354
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:45,910
you should be fine because they get 
tested every 20 days.

1355
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:46,390
And I'm like,
Yep,

1356
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,510
that's exactly a bit in my act.
And he's like,

1357
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,320
oh,
mooch off her tier tests.

1358
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:51,680
I'm like,
yeah,

1359
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,420
exactly.
He's a funny doctor.

1360
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,120
Then this guy's really good.
And he said,

1361
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,580
tell Tom to start sending some hot 
chicks.

1362
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:58,780
And I,
and I said,

1363
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:04,360
and I said something really like say his
name on the air on unethical now and 

1364
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,881
then.
But when we were in the waiting room 

1365
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:08,881
where I just paid and everything at that
and I'm about to walk out.

1366
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:12,751
And he goes,
well it's good singer Brian Tell Thomas 

1367
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:12,751
said hi.
And I'm like,

1368
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:12,751
okay,
I'm sorry I'm not hot for you.

1369
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:16,470
Or something like that.
And it came out like when it was like 

1370
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:16,470
everyone in the room's like,
what the fuck?

1371
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,190
And then I'm like,
I'm sorry I'm not pretty enough.

1372
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,220
Nevermind kinetic element at the 
doctors.

1373
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,040
Everybody in that room probably had no 
idea what was going on.

1374
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,230
So what did he say about your lungs and 
cigarettes and stuff.

1375
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:30,370
Like he said,
everything was perfect.

1376
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,560
That was good.
Now they're doing the blood tests.

1377
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,680
I would like to second that evaluation.
What do they check when they check your 

1378
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,611
lungs did make you cancer and that's it.
They just like make it a huge deep 

1379
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:41,611
breaths.
Why?

1380
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:46,051
They like tests layer.
They listened like all up and down your 

1381
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:48,010
chest and your back and then how long 
does it take you to die from cigarettes?

1382
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,030
I don't know,
man.

1383
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:54,330
It really matters if you.
I think if you have cancer in your 

1384
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,390
family and I don't have cancer and some 
people are genetically just don't get 

1385
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:57,390
it.
I think so,

1386
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,660
yeah.
I mean there's definitely stories,

1387
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:58,960
right?
Oh,

1388
00:58:58,990 --> 00:58:59,680
I know.
I know.

1389
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:04,690
A friend's grandparents who lived into 
their nineties and smoked and drank and 

1390
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,890
ate red meat and low.
They just died.

1391
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:07,540
They didn't die of cancer into that old 
age.

1392
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,730
Well,
they had a good time smiling.

1393
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,740
Yup.
Haven't been drinking.

1394
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,340
There were some things that I read once.
I don't know if it's documented,

1395
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:18,550
but that 100 percent of all people that 
live to be over 100 eat red meat.

1396
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,300
Really?
There's never been a documented of a 

1397
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,300
vegetarian

1398
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,710
lives to be over a hundred.
That could be total horse shit.

1399
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,050
Don't fucking crazy.
Vegans.

1400
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:30,680
Don't you text me about this company?
Do vegans?

1401
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,390
Vegans are there quickest to the 
fucking.

1402
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,610
The tweet,
the,

1403
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,110
the angry tweet,
the angry dietary tweet.

1404
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,270
Yeah,
they are.

1405
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,170
And the quickest,
Sylvia,

1406
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,840
two squiggles.
The diarrhea.

1407
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,550
I think a lot of fiber involved.
You're going to be really shit.

1408
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:47,990
And with that Vegan Diet.
I love fucking a good Vegan meal though.

1409
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:49,550
I love that.
A few meals.

1410
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,370
I'd drink that Kale shake every day.
That's fantastic.

1411
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,400
I have a Kale Salad a few times a week 
from a place where it's hard to get 

1412
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,880
grass fed meat these days,
man.

1413
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,060
Apparently all of it's getting consumed 
up in northern California.

1414
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:03,320
All the hippies up there.
Love it.

1415
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,020
It's all natural meat.
Yeah.

1416
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,510
It's way better for you.
You just go to whole foods.

1417
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:09,080
They don't have it.

1418
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:14,110
No,
they're out of it a lot because ups up 

1419
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:14,110
north.
Look,

1420
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,230
there's only a certain amount of people 
that are grown,

1421
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,480
grass fed meat and it's become super 
popular lately.

1422
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,490
So all these,
you know,

1423
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,850
it's more popular in Berkeley and San 
Francisco I'm sure.

1424
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,890
Then down here and retard advil.
So they uh,

1425
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,150
they can sell all of their cows up 
there.

1426
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:30,770
Why ship them all the way down to Los 
Angeles.

1427
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,320
So they're having an issue like last 
Tuesday though,

1428
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:35,720
the whole foods near me didn't even get 
a shipment of grass fed meat.

1429
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,340
Wow.
Yeah.

1430
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,120
I have to go there on Tuesday to get the
meat.

1431
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,220
It's crazy.
That's the only time they taste the 

1432
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,220
difference like it.
Fuck you.

1433
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:44,220
One hundred percent.
It's a totally different meat.

1434
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:48,830
It's a totally different animal because 
the cow that is raised on corn,

1435
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,350
they're fat fucks.
They're.

1436
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,490
They're marbled.
And it's really delicious.

1437
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,040
It's really,
really fucking yummy because all that 

1438
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,731
fat gets all like a Ribeye from a corn.
A corn raised cow is great because it's 

1439
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:06,221
so juicy,
but it's not quite as healthy for you 

1440
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,430
and it doesn't taste the same when you 
get a grass fed rib eye,

1441
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,490
there's much less marbling and you got 
to cook it quicker because it'll dry 

1442
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,980
out.
There's much less fat in it.

1443
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,120
So it's a.
it's sort of Syria to get better.

1444
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,560
God Damn.
It's good though.

1445
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,570
It's.
It's totally different.

1446
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:23,070
It's almost like a game he animal not 
gain me.

1447
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,830
Yes.
It's,

1448
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,200
it's,
you know,

1449
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,470
it tastes like buffalo or something 
almost.

1450
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,430
Yeah.
It tastes better.

1451
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,100
It tastes like you're eating a healthy 
animal.

1452
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,100
Yeah.
You know?

1453
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,590
Yeah.
There was some steaks I've had where I'm

1454
01:01:33,591 --> 01:01:34,450
like,
Oh man,

1455
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:36,700
like you can fill your body kind of 
slowing down.

1456
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,780
That was not grass fed beef.
Those supposed to be way healthier for 

1457
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,900
you to something about the actual animal
being healthy.

1458
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:48,770
That like a lot of guys I know a lot of 
fighters have switched to grass fed meat

1459
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,760
recently.
My,

1460
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,590
my buddy,
uh,

1461
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,060
Einstein and listen to this all the time
is one of Eddie's black belts,

1462
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,360
said his performance really started 
increasing when he upped his greens and 

1463
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,870
unchanged to all grass fed meat.
Really?

1464
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:01,220
So big difference.
Yeah.

1465
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,240
Yeah.
It's just healthier,

1466
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,460
you know,
it just makes sense that your body would

1467
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:06,500
respond better if you're eating 
healthier animals.

1468
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:09,110
Yeah.
It does make sense for fucking up man.

1469
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:13,280
Fucking eat your veggies and fruits.
Fucking up her God damn.

1470
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:18,490
Monsanto fruits and vegetables and crazy
man fat fuck cows and farm grown fish 

1471
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:22,150
because all the fish in the ocean or Dan
and you know,

1472
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:27,170
they said that the next hundred years is
going to be the last wild fish in the 

1473
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:27,540
world.

1474
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:33,170
Within the next hundred years.
There will be no more wild fish in the 

1475
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:33,170
oceans.
What we'll.

1476
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,300
We'll have out fish the entire region.
One company also say that.

1477
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,480
No,
they think about it from an exponential 

1478
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,030
growth point of view that there'll be 
more people in 100 years.

1479
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:42,570
You know?
I mean,

1480
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,600
think about 100 years ago there was only
like a billion people on the planet and 

1481
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,120
how there are 7 billion,
so it's crazy.

1482
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,440
What's it going to be 100 years from 
now?

1483
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:54,441
It's going to be 30 billion.
Where are they going to get all their 

1484
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:54,441
protein from?
A lot of it's going to be finished.

1485
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:54,500
It's easy to catch and they're going to 
go.

1486
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,310
Once they.
They know they're gonna,

1487
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,450
they're gonna fucking just troll 
everything.

1488
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,720
They suck all that fucking fish out of 
there.

1489
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,020
They're going to eat whales.
They're going to do everything they can 

1490
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,770
eat,
they're going to see everything that 

1491
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,441
humans can consume,
and then 100 years now we're going to 

1492
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:09,441
have to figure it out.

1493
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:09,900
It would just be an empty ocean because 
that would be crazy.

1494
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:14,901
That would be crazy.
Could you imagine if we actually kill 

1495
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:17,331
everything in the ocean within a 
thousand years if people lived to be 

1496
01:03:17,331 --> 01:03:21,460
1000 years,
why is that outside the realm of 

1497
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:21,460
possibility?
Yeah.

1498
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,410
It was something I tweeted earlier today
about the garbage patch.

1499
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,800
Some lady went to the garbage patches in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

1500
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,720
For folks who don't know bigger than 
Texas,

1501
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,840
there's a giant hunk of garbage.
All plastic that's Kinda caught together

1502
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,160
in this one swarm.
It's like caught up,

1503
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,270
I guess in like the way the tides go is 
one area where it's collected where it's

1504
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:41,370
enormous.
It's bigger than the state of Texas,

1505
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,770
which takes like more than a data drive 
through.

1506
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,980
All right,
so that's how much garbage is out there 

1507
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,650
and it's just getting bigger and it's 
gonna keep getting bigger forever.

1508
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,660
Is that a homeless person's heaven?
You think?

1509
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:56,661
They all talk about it as if it's like 
Disney road never had to pick.

1510
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:02,640
I think the plastic breaks down though.
I think that's part of the issue is that

1511
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,160
the salt water breaks it down for like 
Jelly,

1512
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,130
like little particles and it's really 
fucked.

1513
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:09,790
It's not like,
just like stuff floating.

1514
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,450
Then you can scoop up.
Becomes like almost liquid.

1515
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,460
Yeah.
It's fucked up man.

1516
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:20,020
We're so creepy.
I'm thinking about what we do we kill 

1517
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,170
all the rhinos.
We fucked the ocean over.

1518
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:24,810
We eat all the fish.
We throw our garbage in it.

1519
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,670
You would drive by um,
trash.

1520
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,140
What do they call it?
Trash plants.

1521
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:28,780
You know,
talking to you.

1522
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:29,370
Yeah,
sure.

1523
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,970
Man.
Landfills.

1524
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,840
Landfills.
Yeah.

1525
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,640
And you see how like,
they're like,

1526
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:37,990
you know,
they're a higher altitude than like the 

1527
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:37,990
street level,
you know,

1528
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,600
that's just going to keep growing like 
one day that's going to be like a 

1529
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:41,600
building of God,
you know?

1530
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,640
It's like mountains,
like hills.

1531
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:47,460
The Stan hope and I filmed the finale of
the man show in a garbage dump.

1532
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,480
Really?
Yeah.

1533
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:51,300
Because the girls were trying to con us 
into taking them to an island.

1534
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,230
There was two of the girls that were in 
the old man show and we didn't get along

1535
01:04:55,231 --> 01:05:00,231
with them so well and they were like,
Adam and Jimmy used to take us to the 

1536
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:00,231
Bahamas.
We should do that.

1537
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,430
You should take it to the Bahamas.
We'll film the final scene there.

1538
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,160
And then we thought about it and doug 
and I were like,

1539
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:07,530
we should do it at a garbage.
And I was like,

1540
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:08,310
we think about it,
man.

1541
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:09,990
I wanted to do it in a garbage dump in 
New Jersey.

1542
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:12,390
I wanted to do it like the stinkiness 
grossest dump.

1543
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,040
I said,
you know,

1544
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,990
if you're at home and you're watching a 
series,

1545
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:19,210
two assholes hanging out with girls who 
never fuck you on,

1546
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,550
you know,
in a place where you can never afford to

1547
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:22,270
go to,
you know,

1548
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,020
hanging on the wall.

1549
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:28,020
How is that fun for you?
I go be much more fun for you to watch 

1550
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:28,770
us in a dump.
So much funnier to.

1551
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:29,410
So we,
yeah,

1552
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:31,780
that's what I felt like they were so mad
at us.

1553
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:36,040
It was gross and their defense,
it was really funny that they ask for it

1554
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,030
though.
First they were like,

1555
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,230
what's up with the Bahamas?
And yeah,

1556
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:39,640
they wanted to go garbage.
No.

1557
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,660
Well,
you know,

1558
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:43,110
it's,
I don't blame a man that culture,

1559
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,540
the hot chip culture of asking for 
things and then they would like,

1560
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:51,541
you know,
rub the writers shoulders and you're 

1561
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:51,541
going to put us in a scene,
you know,

1562
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,980
that kind of thing.
That's gross shit though.

1563
01:05:52,981 --> 01:05:53,450
Yeah.
Well,

1564
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,980
so that was the culture of it.
There was a lot of growth going on,

1565
01:05:56,981 --> 01:06:00,650
but sure not none of those as groceries.
That garbage dump Netapp for all of it.

1566
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,680
Fucking foul.
So bad.

1567
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:07,681
We were eating lunch and it's fucking 
garbage dust floating in the air and it 

1568
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:09,700
was on Catalina.
Catalina has a giant garbage do.

1569
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:13,450
They really enormous kind of a trip.
It's a bummer man.

1570
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,540
That whole society.
Then I think a lot of our garbage goes 

1571
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:18,550
out there.
That sucks.

1572
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:19,990
Yeah,
it does suck.

1573
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:25,380
Catalina for the,
for folks who don't know is island 

1574
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,110
outside of the coast of Los Angeles.
Fourteen miles off the coast.

1575
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,380
14.
I've never gone into.

1576
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:28,320
You do.
You do?

1577
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,830
Yeah.
That's cool man.

1578
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,590
There's no cars driving around.
Just golf carts and shit.

1579
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,310
Yeah,
it's weird.

1580
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,620
It's big enough that you could actually 
live there.

1581
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,570
You can go on a ferry or a helicopter.
Yeah,

1582
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,640
I took the helicopter.
Maybe that's where we should put our 

1583
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:42,640
compound.
The next year.

1584
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,050
That helicopter company crashed.
Really?

1585
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,370
Yeah.
Helicopter Cadillac.

1586
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,530
And somebody died.
Yeah.

1587
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,170
It would've been new though,
right?

1588
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,640
No,
no,

1589
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,320
no.
You can't stop me.

1590
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,630
You can't hold me down.
Y'All can't see me.

1591
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,270
Not me,
bro.

1592
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,310
Tell you what,
man.

1593
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,110
Fuck that.
Hell God.

1594
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,930
Fuck that.
Grabbed that fucking Pupello my hand and

1595
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,440
I'll spit it myself.
I got heart.

1596
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,740
I got a lot of heart.
You can't measure.

1597
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:09,430
You can't fuck up my opera and the size 
of the dog in the fight.

1598
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,670
It's the size of the fight in the dog.
This dog can hunt.

1599
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Would you live on Catalina?
But if we've got a giant piece of land 

1600
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:18,610
and Catalina and that's where we set up 
our compounds,

1601
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:23,650
I'd have to check it out first because I
don't like not having best buys and 

1602
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:23,980
things like that.
It's totally true.

1603
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:29,280
We should.
We should seriously look into a good 

1604
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,610
place where we can all move here.
Just everybody outside of La,

1605
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,770
but close enough.
We'll just get a giant chunk of land.

1606
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:34,130
Get a few hundred acres.
Yeah.

1607
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,030
All of us build houses there.
Do you not dope.

1608
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:42,031
That would be if we could have our own 
like m night Shyamalan Ding dongs 

1609
01:07:42,031 --> 01:07:42,031
village.
Debbie Austin,

1610
01:07:42,031 --> 01:07:42,430
the lake.
I like lake.

1611
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,120
How cool would it be for real if we all.
We got everyone that we know that it's 

1612
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,830
cool and we decided we're all going to 
be in property and build houses there.

1613
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,170
Yeah.
And all your friends live in like in the

1614
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,640
neighborhood.
And fucking awesome.

1615
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,030
If you live down the street and Chrysler
was there and

1616
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:03,830
Eddie Bravo lived up the hill down

1617
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,770
the hill and Dunkin lived over there and
already lives over it.

1618
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:08,660
That would be fucking awesome.
Yeah.

1619
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:12,140
That's how cults get started though.
That's what happens.

1620
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,670
Yeah,
that would actually be the most.

1621
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:16,370
But we talked about Christina and 
because she also

1622
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:21,460
loves a burt's wife really in the way 
and that way you know what's out there.

1623
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:27,290
It's Valentine's Day by the way.
I'm doing.

1624
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:29,930
I just realized I'm doing it for 20 
show.

1625
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,750
I'm doing a four slash 20 show in,
in Atlanta.

1626
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,080
Where's that place I'm doing at Brian?
Uh,

1627
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:37,300
it's on my twitter thing.
It just Atlanta,

1628
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:38,840
Georgia.
And your twitter doesn't want to pull up

1629
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:41,330
on my laptop.
It looks weird man.

1630
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,390
When I turn to looking at doing some 
nice.

1631
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,110
I'm doing someplace in Atlanta some high
times for 20 though.

1632
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:55,880
It's for 20.
I've never done it for $20 per barrel.

1633
01:08:55,910 --> 01:09:00,910
Nat Cole Tabernacle you is called the 
PTAB.

1634
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,970
Fucking silly goose.
You will.

1635
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,530
You might be the silliest goose goose's 
tabernacle.

1636
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,090
Yeah.
But that's on 4:20.

1637
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:16,460
I want to,
I want to do my special there,

1638
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:21,461
but I don't also have enough time,
but it would be the place to do it 

1639
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:21,860
because um,
the uh,

1640
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:27,010
you know,
Atlanta fucking crowds are awesome all 

1641
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:27,010
the way.
One of the most underrated cities in the

1642
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,760
country for sure.
And they have a great comedy community.

1643
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:32,240
There's that punchline.
Atlanta has a great community.

1644
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,890
I love the uh,
the laughing skull.

1645
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,560
I haven't been great too.
I heard that's great.

1646
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,450
Laughing skull.
Is that the vortex?

1647
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:41,410
And I think that's in mid town and that 
is um,

1648
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,270
that's like it's seats 74,
75.

1649
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:48,520
So it's like the ice house,
like the second stage and um,

1650
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:53,650
that is a great tool.
My favorite clubs to play in the ice 

1651
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:56,861
house Friday by the way folks,
we try to do the ice house whenever I'm 

1652
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:56,861
in town.

1653
01:09:56,861 --> 01:10:00,610
March is going to be the shit.
We're going to do a gang of them on in 

1654
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:04,001
March because I'm,
I'm home a lot in March to and have a 

1655
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:07,391
lot of fucking ice house shows.
We're going to do a lot of full 

1656
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:07,391
weekends,
Friday and Saturday whenever we can.

1657
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,560
But Tommy bonds will be involved in 
this.

1658
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,450
Yeah man.
Fuck yeah.

1659
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,480
Fuck you did a shit next week.
I'm actually recording my new album and 

1660
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:22,431
you're going to one at the comedy works 
in Denver was one of the greatest clubs 

1661
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:25,451
in the history of doing.
There's two clubs I'm doing the South 

1662
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:25,451
Club.
That's great also.

1663
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:25,610
Yes.
That's awesome too.

1664
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,620
That's the uh,
that's a bigger place.

1665
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:28,820
They have a balcony.
Yeah,

1666
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:30,950
they do.
If you are in Denver,

1667
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,490
we'd there too when?
December 20.

1668
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,280
We hit,
we hit.

1669
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:36,050
We'd somewhere in that place.
Really?

1670
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:37,270
Yes.
Look guys,

1671
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,930
to find it next time we go home to my 
show.

1672
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,890
Look for the weed and where,
um,

1673
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,930
uh,
what you say the game dictates a wow.

1674
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,800
It is this month,
which is February,

1675
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:49,580
right?
February.

1676
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,780
And it's,
it's the,

1677
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,200
it's a Friday,
the 24th and Saturday the 25th.

1678
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:59,770
I'm beautiful.
I'm recording a new album at the comedy 

1679
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,410
works south.
I tweeted the link.

1680
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,470
If you go to Tom Cigar Seg,
you are a.

1681
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,670
yeah,
you gotta go,

1682
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:09,671
come out.
It'll be fucking so much fun if you 

1683
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:12,141
never seen Tommy.
He's way funnier as a standup comedians 

1684
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:12,500
talking on a podcast.
Don't be.

1685
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,980
Don't confused for

1686
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,630
a while.
He's kind of monotone.

1687
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,450
It's kind of sexy.
Find his voice sexy.

1688
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,620
Yeah,
you told me.

1689
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:20,460
Oh,
but so anyway,

1690
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:21,390
folks,
24th,

1691
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:22,980
25th,
26th,

1692
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,460
24th,
25th,

1693
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,660
23rd to 25th.
But the recording is the 24th and 20.

1694
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:29,230
Who putting out your cd?
Uh,

1695
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,250
well that's actually one of the things 
I'm actually thinking of doing it 

1696
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:34,250
myself.
Do it,

1697
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:34,250
do it yourself.
We'll pump the shit out of it up here.

1698
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,560
That's what I want to know is hilarious.
You know,

1699
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,630
tom and I met a long time ago when I was
doing the maximum tour with Charlie 

1700
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,230
Murphy and John [inaudible] and what we 
do is we go to these different places 

1701
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:45,720
and they would have like a local guy 
opened up for us.

1702
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,760
Everyone that opened up for us was 
really funny.

1703
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:52,761
It was really good,
like local talent because it was the 

1704
01:11:52,761 --> 01:11:55,131
maximum bud light comedy tour and they 
really did a good job of casting the 

1705
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:55,131
local guys.

1706
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:57,450
But when we did Phoenix,
Tommy wasn't even local.

1707
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:59,430
Just somehow or another he got involved 
in this.

1708
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:04,730
And uh,
he was one of those guys where he went 

1709
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:04,730
up and I went,
Holy Shit.

1710
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:05,580
I go,
this guy is fucking funny.

1711
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:09,600
And it was dark and it was really well 
written and we became,

1712
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,720
we became besties ever since then.
That was fun.

1713
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:17,930
And that's actually the thing I was 
telling you is that every time I've 

1714
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:20,700
opened for you since then,
your crowds are always the shit.

1715
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,760
So that's fine.
I'm totally a pleading to the Joe Rogan 

1716
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,230
come out.
It's always been.

1717
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:31,840
You guys are always amazing audience.
Colorado's my plates.

1718
01:12:31,841 --> 01:12:34,080
Everybody knows that I fucking love 
Colorado.

1719
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,840
If I could convince my fucking crazy 
wife,

1720
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:40,140
eventually I will be back in Colorado.
I was the shit that place calls me.

1721
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,300
I'll be back.
I got that.

1722
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,530
That club,
Wendy is awesome.

1723
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,840
She's my favorite club owner in the 
history of club owner.

1724
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:47,250
She's the shit.
She is awesome.

1725
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,800
She's in.
She owns and runs both of them.

1726
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:54,060
She's just a Badass woman.
Coolest fuck real fan of comedy.

1727
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:59,240
A real friend to comedy or you know,
she has an open mic program that's 

1728
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,141
better than anybody's in the country or 
anybody that I've ever been involved 

1729
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:03,570
with ever in my whole time in comedy.
When you do,

1730
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:05,220
when you do comedy works,
um,

1731
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:10,430
they'll have like a,
you'll work with different people 

1732
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:10,430
through the weekend,
right?

1733
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,880
Like a different people didn't show.
And um,

1734
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,260
other local guys that will open for you 
are all headliners.

1735
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:20,340
Yeah.
You have just headliners opening for 

1736
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,340
you.
They're great.

1737
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:20,460
They're great.
The whole show is fucking.

1738
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,680
She takes care of guy.
She pays them well.

1739
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:24,780
Her food is great.
Especially in south south.

1740
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,490
She has a gourmet restaurant.
Oh,

1741
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,830
Jesus is fucking phenomenal.
Really good.

1742
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:33,850
God Damn.
I love Colorado snow and his fuck there 

1743
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:33,850
though.
80 degrees here.

1744
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:33,850
Socket.

1745
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,740
But snow is awesome when you don't have 
to go anywhere.

1746
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:43,130
Remember those times when you go out 
your back porch and you just fucking 

1747
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,130
here.
Nothing.

1748
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:45,810
Knowing the way sound just gets absorbed
and snow.

1749
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah.
I love it.

1750
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:49,140
Some great fucking times.
I still want to live in it.

1751
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,970
I just.
But I do like visiting snow.

1752
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:56,090
I like visiting it too.
I would like to get a house somewhere 

1753
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,090
where it's cold,
you know,

1754
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,100
where I could visit on occasion and you 
know,

1755
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,960
I just have to get some more baller 
money,

1756
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,990
but now I'm fucked because it looks like
fear factor is going to fucking bite it.

1757
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:06,020
What it's over.
I thought it was like some of the best 

1758
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:09,230
ratings ratings dropped that much down.
Well,

1759
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,920
there's a bunch of issues.
I think some of the,

1760
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,600
one of the issues is a,
let's be honest,

1761
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:18,930
it's a bit low brow and uh,
NBC is trying to have quality 

1762
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,100
programming like the author uses 
serious.

1763
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,010
I think so,
yeah.

1764
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:22,910
I think there's issue number.
They haven't,

1765
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:28,170
they haven't decided yet.
I think it looked they've got 

1766
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:28,170
appointment,
you know,

1767
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:28,170
I see what you're trying to do.
You know,

1768
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:28,300
I don't know,
Hayden,

1769
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,600
I love doing it just because I love the 
guys that I work with.

1770
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:35,440
I Love David Horwitz and Matt 
[inaudible] units and Rupert and all the

1771
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,660
people that all will be Thompson.
The director,

1772
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,930
the other people that I've worked with 
were really fucking awesome people.

1773
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:44,320
They're really fun to be around.
It's like a family and I miss them,

1774
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,380
you know,
the five years that I didn't work with 

1775
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:49,380
them and then I'm working with them 
again for this short season.

1776
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,860
It was really fun,
but it's not my favorite thing to do.

1777
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,770
I'm good at it.
I've been doing it for a long time.

1778
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:55,450
I know how to,
I know how to host a game show,

1779
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:58,990
but I prefer doing stand up and work out
for the UFC and this.

1780
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,990
They should move that show to hbo had 
needed it.

1781
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:06,430
Like you're eating fucking fish from 
Janice and I think it's over.

1782
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,200
And you know,
the other thing was like,

1783
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,140
I was telling them that the donkey loads
were too much.

1784
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,970
I was like,
you can't do this.

1785
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,680
We can't do this.
Like BC approved it.

1786
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,960
He approved it and I was like,
just because they approved it doesn't 

1787
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:19,960
mean you should be doing this.
Like seriously?

1788
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,960
You could see that when I'm the voice of
reason when I'm the one who's telling 

1789
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,790
you we're going too far.
That's it.

1790
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,230
Yeah.
Like what is happening here?

1791
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,960
It's just they got a little crazy.
Do you want her to have an awesome show?

1792
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,780
You know,
whatever it was,

1793
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:35,500
it was a fun thing while it lasted and I
honestly believe that these new episodes

1794
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:37,360
were better than any of the ones we ever
did before.

1795
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,300
I haven't enjoyed it.
I don't see anything wrong with it and I

1796
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:42,130
think it's silly that NBC went and did 
that because they,

1797
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:44,260
all their other shows are hurting bad.
They suck.

1798
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:47,510
That Whitney show just got horrible 
reviews or ratings.

1799
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,180
I watched it the other day.
It was not good,

1800
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,130
but you know,
it's hard.

1801
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,350
It's hard to do a good sitcom.
It's hard to do it right.

1802
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:54,890
And you know,
I heard she's a funny standup.

1803
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:59,910
I never seen her perform before,
but I heard that Chris Lee is a funny 

1804
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,000
comic as well and you know,
he's buddies with Brian.

1805
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:02,210
I never seen him.
He's funny as well,

1806
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:07,350
so you know,
how is it that they can have to really 

1807
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,541
funny people and not have a funny show?
A lot of times there's just too many 

1808
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:12,751
cooks in the kitchen.
A lot of times they're trying to 

1809
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:12,751
accomplish something and trying to get a
vibe going.

1810
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,170
They're trying to find their footing.
They believe in it though,

1811
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,230
because they renewed it for another 
season.

1812
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah,
no,

1813
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,120
they're both funny.
People are funny people.

1814
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,390
You take some wild man.
I,

1815
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,400
I really enjoyed my time on news radio,
but I got a real deep respect for the 

1816
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,080
craft of creating a television show,
you know,

1817
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,160
and that's one of the reasons why I 
never did it again.

1818
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,790
One of the reasons why I never get it 
again.

1819
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:32,380
It was,
first of all,

1820
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:37,381
I knew that the guys that I was working 
with were incredibly talented and it's 

1821
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:37,381
such,
Paul Simms,

1822
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:41,881
the executive producer was such an 
interesting and intelligent guy and his 

1823
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:44,140
sensibilities were so out there.
I knew that after like working with him,

1824
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,230
it was going to be really hard to do 
another sort of Sitcom,

1825
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,110
a real mainstream.
Even if it's a successful one,

1826
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,390
it's hard to do crap,
you know,

1827
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,490
you realize that,
um,

1828
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,280
that,
that,

1829
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,950
how much writing is everything,
everything.

1830
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,720
It's every,
you see these shows that are so good and

1831
01:16:58,721 --> 01:16:59,860
you're like,
Holy Shit,

1832
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,760
I shouldn't say it's everything because 
good writing was shit delivery and shit,

1833
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,260
Shit.
Comics and shit.

1834
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:10,261
Actors is not good either,
but it's a huge part of the problem and 

1835
01:17:10,261 --> 01:17:12,260
part of the equation Rather.
And you need real eccentrics to,

1836
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:17,290
to running.
One of the things that these guys were 

1837
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:17,290
there,
none of them were still.

1838
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:17,290
There's a couple of them that were 
standups,

1839
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:18,950
you know,
that we're on the staff,

1840
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,260
but for the most part they were just 
really bright,

1841
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,890
silly guys who knew how to put together 
something funny.

1842
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,940
It's fucking rare.
The for every matt stone and Trey 

1843
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,710
Parker,
there's 100 pretenders,

1844
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:35,780
you know,
at least for at least one anymore and 

1845
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:35,820
you can get caught on one of those 
sitcoms where you just like,

1846
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:39,020
you're reading the script and like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1847
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:44,020
Man?
Those intangibles to like a show airs 

1848
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,440
and sometimes it just gets legs,
peanut were drawn to it,

1849
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:50,470
you know?
And then sometimes you'll feel like 

1850
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,470
everything's right.
Like we got the scripts are great.

1851
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:51,650
We've got great actors every now and 
then,

1852
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,450
people don't respond to it,
man.

1853
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,310
That's Paul.
Yeah,

1854
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,580
I mean a lot of times it's who's the 
production company and what kind of pull

1855
01:17:57,581 --> 01:17:59,930
they have with the network where they 
decide to put the show,

1856
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:02,900
but I w I would definitely do another 
acting gig.

1857
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:05,420
I really enjoyed doing that.
A movie with Kevin James,

1858
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:07,160
the zookeeper movie.
That was a lot of fun,

1859
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,250
but it was mostly fun because Kevin and 
I have been friends since we were really

1860
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:13,250
young and to to do a movement even 
though it was a silly kids movie.

1861
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:13,760
Yeah,
it was fun.

1862
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,020
It's fun.
It's fun to act.

1863
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:20,020
It was fun to do.
You know the thing with Leslie Bibb and 

1864
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,371
the,
you know the chick from Talladega 

1865
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:22,371
nights.
I was like,

1866
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:22,371
this is kind of crazy.
I'm acting with the girlfriend Talladega

1867
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:26,950
nights.
I hadn't done any acting in fucking 10 

1868
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,950
years,
so it was weird.

1869
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:31,060
That was fun.
I would totally do something like that 

1870
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,060
was totally do a sitcom or something fun
act again,

1871
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,590
but for the most part,
one of the weirdest things about being a

1872
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:37,940
comic is that everybody wants to put you
into some acting situation.

1873
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:40,340
Where are you going to do something 
that's not nearly as funny as your act?

1874
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:41,750
That's true.
Yeah.

1875
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,010
Yeah.
Or you can see it.

1876
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,810
Like when you audition,
they were like,

1877
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:46,340
like,
punch it up or you change it,

1878
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:47,880
you'll add something.
It'd be like,

1879
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,070
that was really funny.
You're like,

1880
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:51,200
well yeah,
I kind of have to do this a lot.

1881
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,780
Yeah,
you gotta sometimes stuff up.

1882
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:56,420
Sometimes they get mad and I got yelled 
at one time too.

1883
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,660
Would they say I'm the guy laughed and 
then we did it.

1884
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:01,600
We did it again,
and he was like,

1885
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:03,410
that's just rude man.
I was like,

1886
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:04,490
what?
He was like,

1887
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:09,491
that's rude.
And he meant it was rude and I tagged 

1888
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:09,590
the line,
you know,

1889
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,270
I made up a line.
Whoa.

1890
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,920
And he laughed the first time and then 
he was like,

1891
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:14,360
it's really rude.
You need to drop that.

1892
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:15,830
And I was like,
Whoa,

1893
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,530
fuck him.
He fucked me up so badly that we did the

1894
01:19:18,531 --> 01:19:19,400
third take.
And I was like,

1895
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:20,360
yeah,
okay.

1896
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,480
Like I didn't even move my face.
So it was a weak bitch.

1897
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,050
Yeah.
And I was like,

1898
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,980
you just laughed at it,
man.

1899
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,950
Like everybody laughed at it.
That's 100 percent ego right there.

1900
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,790
Yeah,
he's the,

1901
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,140
he wasn't even the,
um,

1902
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,520
he was just a casting guy.

1903
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,380
He wasn't a director or the producer on 
it.

1904
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,730
He was just like,
well,

1905
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:36,090
he's trolling camera then.
Yeah,

1906
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,910
you know,
whatever it was saying,

1907
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:38,930
it's rude.
He's an idiot.

1908
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,200
That was one of the coolest things about
news radio is that Paul Sanders would 

1909
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:44,870
let us make up entire scenes for scene.
Didn't work day fully.

1910
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,730
It was like the secret producer on the 
set.

1911
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:47,840
He would just like,
rewrite a scene,

1912
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,820
really completely do it differently.
Dave.

1913
01:19:49,821 --> 01:19:51,290
Always a genius.
His,

1914
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,810
his,
uh,

1915
01:19:51,811 --> 01:19:54,870
ability to like see scenes and see jokes
and see like,

1916
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:00,130
you know,
his sketch background from kids in the 

1917
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:00,130
hall and created a lot of sketches,
a great writer.

1918
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:00,950
Awesome.
You know,

1919
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:02,780
he got off track with his life and you 
know,

1920
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:04,970
had a lot of hard times we had him on 
the podcast once.

1921
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:08,340
Talk about is a fascinating,
fascinating story of caution,

1922
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,630
a cautionary tale,
you know,

1923
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:12,330
for it to happen if you're involved in a
terrible relationship,

1924
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:17,430
it goes wrong and you know,
you have spiteful ex wife and the poor 

1925
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,580
guy man,
it's really horrendous,

1926
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:22,720
you know,
and that led to all sorts of other 

1927
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:22,720
issues as well.

1928
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,330
But as a,
as a writer and as a like a guy who like

1929
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:24,720
because as a comedian he said,
gene,

1930
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:26,430
just talented guy,
but brilliant.

1931
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,710
Just a brilliant,
really interesting,

1932
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:30,420
funny guy.
Really Smart Guy.

1933
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:35,450
She's getting back on and he was,
I'd love to have him back on and help 

1934
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:35,450
his comedy because I haven't heard 
anything about heard him.

1935
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,350
I saw him driving one day and that's,
that's sad drive.

1936
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,060
Well I know that he had some setbacks 
are just trying.

1937
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:44,430
I mean he can't go to Canada at all if 
he goes to Canada.

1938
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:46,020
Bill arrested him now.
That's crazy.

1939
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:51,050
Yeah.
It was like some crazy amount of money 

1940
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:51,050
that he had a show that took off for a 
little while.

1941
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:54,210
You got the pilot got picked up,
then it got canceled,

1942
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:55,980
so.
Oh yeah,

1943
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,920
I saw that.
I saw a commercial for it.

1944
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,330
It's a hard fucking world,
dude.

1945
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,040
It is,
dude.

1946
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,690
The world are.
Trying to create a Sitcom is not fun.

1947
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,600
No,
no,

1948
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,160
and the odds of you being in there so 
many people out there trying to do it.

1949
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,480
Oh,
I've written a couple.

1950
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,340
Have you ever done a couple of scripts?
Yeah,

1951
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,220
pilots.
Yeah.

1952
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:13,830
It's like,
I don't know.

1953
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,300
The other thing is naturally the brain 
just pulling your hair out and then you 

1954
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,910
rewrite it so many times in some reason 
they're like,

1955
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:22,440
yeah,
you need to make some more changes.

1956
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,240
Like I've already written it fucking 40 
times,

1957
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:25,440
but not only that,
by the way,

1958
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:30,500
they will never let you create your own 
shop because if you create your own 

1959
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,651
show,
you own the show and if you own the 

1960
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:33,651
show,
that's fucking billions.

1961
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:36,740
They have that thing locked down.
The only people who can own shows and 

1962
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:39,120
have be show runners and be executive,
those people are already deep,

1963
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:40,140
deep,
deep in the business.

1964
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:44,280
There's very little room for some new 
new guy who hates his own show.

1965
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,880
You know,
they,

1966
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:45,470
you know,
they have.

1967
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:50,590
You have to be paired up,
but some dude was already production 

1968
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:53,691
company.
They know what's at stake there and you 

1969
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:53,691
have your own thing.
Yeah.

1970
01:21:53,691 --> 01:21:53,730
You can't just come to them 
independently and say,

1971
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:54,600
Hey,
NBC,

1972
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:55,600
I,
my name is Tom Score.

1973
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,620
Me and my buddy wrote a sitcom.
I'm going to be the creator and 

1974
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:00,620
executive producer.
He's going to be the director.

1975
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:00,850
Is that cool with you?
Yeah.

1976
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:03,420
You guys are creative.
Come on in no way because that's a money

1977
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:08,430
train there.
They're giving you a free ticket on the 

1978
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,191
money train.
You know you get like some Roseanne 

1979
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:10,191
style syndication money or Seinfeld 
syndication money.

1980
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,330
They know what's involved in that.
A successful show.

1981
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,850
So they got,
they got that situation I'll locked up.

1982
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,740
That's one of the reasons why so many of
those shows suck.

1983
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:22,270
You know,
they got the same dudes feeding people 

1984
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:22,270
the same slop.
You know,

1985
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,941
there's like,
if you look at like the showrunners of 

1986
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:25,941
certain,
like hit shows,

1987
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,420
there's like two and a half man.
This dude does like a gang of them.

1988
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:29,720
The one that Charles Flores brought 
brawling with.

1989
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:34,140
That guy does like the big bang and.
Yeah.

1990
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:39,260
Yeah.
He's fucking Mike and Molly like at his 

1991
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:41,910
too.
He doesn't ask them with that makes 

1992
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,910
ridiculous money.
God.

1993
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,910
Yeah.
He's got it locked up.

1994
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,050
Wow.
Yeah.

1995
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:48,150
Dude owns hits television.
Hit when you have loved to see the 

1996
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:49,670
arguments with him and Charlie Sheen on 
DVD one.

1997
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:53,250
It'd be great if somebody fell.
Somebody on the two and a half men set,

1998
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:55,710
filmed some of the arguments.
I'm sure they have that.

1999
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,640
Fuck.
I wish.

2000
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:00,780
I would love to see that.
I just have to wait to fucking Egos,

2001
01:23:00,781 --> 01:23:01,170
man.

2002
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:05,340
You know,
I think that's the guy who also got a.

2003
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,360
do you remember Brett Butler?
Do you remember her?

2004
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:12,580
[inaudible]?
Do you remember when she was a big TV 

2005
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:12,580
star?
She had a show.

2006
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:15,850
I don't remember her.
What the fuck was that show?

2007
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,830
God Damn it was Brett Butler show.
No,

2008
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,360
no,
no,

2009
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,180
no.
He's aging something.

2010
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:27,630
Caroline no,
fuck man.

2011
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,790
Grace under fire.
Grace under fire.

2012
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,980
While she was like,
she was,

2013
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,930
you know,
she was fucking big time man.

2014
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,360
You know,
she was the star of a Sitcom.

2015
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:42,410
Yeah.
And she apparently just got crazy ego 

2016
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:46,270
bullshit went through and she threw a 
soda in his face and said,

2017
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:51,750
if you fuck your wife the same way,
you no wonder why she left you.

2018
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,580
Whoa.
And that was it.

2019
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,580
They pulled the plug on that bitch.
She's homeless.

2020
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,960
Yeah.
Now she's vanished off the face of the 

2021
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:02,960
earth.
I mean,

2022
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:02,960
she was an enormous star Dude.

2023
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,280
She was enormous man.
And she was also an enormous star as a 

2024
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:07,280
standup comedian.
You know,

2025
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,760
she was really charismatic.
You seen the homeless pitcher over?

2026
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,410
She's.
Yeah,

2027
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,890
she's a real hallmark for real honest.
They interviewed her and she's just,

2028
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:19,891
she looks like she got to pull that up.
I want to see this video and it says,

2029
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:25,300
the Golden Globe nominated actress who 
struggled with drug addiction went broke

2030
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:29,680
after in 1993 to 1998 Sitcom ended.
It's run on ABC.

2031
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,500
Oh my gosh.
Crazy.

2032
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,900
Brett Butler,
t two t's.

2033
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:36,490
You serious?
One 10 Butler,

2034
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:39,070
oh my God.
The actress,

2035
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:42,220
a Golden Globe nominee for a role in 
1993,

2036
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:47,221
1998 comedy series,
struggled with substance abuse while 

2037
01:24:47,221 --> 01:24:49,300
starring on the show,
which was in the top 10 for two seasons.

2038
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:54,301
The Chuck Lorre created show was 
canceled in 1998 after she was asked to 

2039
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:56,940
leave the set because of her drug use.
Yeah,

2040
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,920
she threw a drink in his face.
My friend was working on the set.

2041
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:05,220
He also worked on one of them,
one of the shows that I worked on on 

2042
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:05,220
news radio and he said,
she said in her,

2043
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,090
Oh,
you fuck you up.

2044
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:08,360
Same way you run

2045
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:13,290
fire was one of ABC Vegas.
Whatever happened to the star.

2046
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:16,210
Rhett Butler.
Sadly we have found out she is living in

2047
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:21,211
a homeless shelter and tonight she tells
me what it is like to hit rock bottom 

2048
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:24,730
and Hollywood.
I almost died like Michael Jackson.

2049
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:31,480
I was dying of addiction.
I would be in hell.

2050
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,770
Bread had it all.
A hit show on prime time TV,

2051
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,360
two years and the top 10.

2052
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,140
Kimmy,

2053
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:44,620
she made millions and lived in a 
mansion.

2054
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,850
A tough talking woman with a wild temper
and killing herself with drugs.

2055
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:52,060
Was it a drug or alcohol?
Your addiction?

2056
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,360
Everything but crack and noodles.
Pretty much.

2057
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:57,790
I had A.
I had a variety of things given to me by

2058
01:25:57,791 --> 01:26:01,750
doctors and other things.
I'm not doing it to be coy,

2059
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:04,970
but I'm not going to go through the uh,
you know what I did?

2060
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:09,971
I did it till the wheels came.
You just go up to your room right now 

2061
01:26:09,971 --> 01:26:10,490
and you don't come back down until you 
love your brother.

2062
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,290
Grace under fire was a working class.
Calm.

2063
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,230
Done in the same vein as Roseanne and 
mad about you now on DVD.

2064
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:23,530
It was produced by funny man,
Chuck Lorre greater up to an event and 

2065
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,240
the Big Bang Theory,
it was filmed here on the same studio.

2066
01:26:26,241 --> 01:26:31,220
Lot is set at stage 14 where Christina 
applegate up all night is now.

2067
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:34,010
You said you hope you've been forgiven.
What would you hope you've been forgiven

2068
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:39,011
for?
Making someone's day miserable over the 

2069
01:26:39,011 --> 01:26:42,670
choice of a word in 22 minutes show a 
lot of the times I've been an ass and 

2070
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:47,711
didn't even think I was like,
I'd call my managers know there's white 

2071
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:47,711
limo out here for an award show and 
they'd say,

2072
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:48,980
oh my God,
don't get in it.

2073
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,200
And it should've said,
you ungrateful cracker.

2074
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:53,060
Go get in the car,
go to the show.

2075
01:26:53,061 --> 01:26:54,980
They'll drop you out back

2076
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:58,590
because she wanted the black one.
Is that what some people have?

2077
01:26:58,610 --> 01:26:59,690
Weird things like that.
Yeah.

2078
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:04,850
All these great white hope rehabs.
The one in Malibu I called muffins were 

2079
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,230
they had a sous chef and collage class 
and I'm going,

2080
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:12,260
you're kidding.
And you know some won't give you sugar 

2081
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,860
and coffee and they give you drugs and 
other ones.

2082
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,200
It's just this bizarre.
$30,000

2083
01:27:16,201 --> 01:27:19,920
bucks a month and a lucky when you don't
die.

2084
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:24,921
And people used to come up and say,
I too am a survivor of so and so and I 

2085
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:26,400
want to go look,
if you don't wear the t shirt,

2086
01:27:26,401 --> 01:27:30,170
you'll have more fun.
She left Hollywood for a farm in Georgia

2087
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:35,171
where she lived with her 15 pets,
but then the money ran out and one of 

2088
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:37,040
Hollywood's biggest stars had to live in
a homeless shelter.

2089
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,880
Now Brad is making a comeback,
returning to stand up this weekend and 

2090
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,961
alleys downtown comedy club.
Want to make a comeback to be Nancy 

2091
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:51,541
grace nightmare.
I really feel like an old dog though.

2092
01:27:51,551 --> 01:27:56,551
It's almost like I was a horse that ran 
in the derby once the kids were coming 

2093
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:57,760
and going,
are you still doing this?

2094
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:59,950
I think it something to do with me and 
living through it.

2095
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:03,880
I don't think about what I survived.
I hope I forgive.

2096
01:28:03,881 --> 01:28:08,881
I hope I'm forgiven and I'm just really 
glad that I think things are funny and 

2097
01:28:08,881 --> 01:28:11,240
there's no end to that and bread has 
even more to reveal.

2098
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:13,990
Tomorrow.
She tells me her plans for a big TV.

2099
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,610
It creeps me out.
She got hooked on drugs.

2100
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,960
The she creeps me out,
but you know,

2101
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:25,500
just as much to lady talking to her,
I don't feel like I know anything about 

2102
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:25,840
her while she's talking and she's,
Oh,

2103
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:27,280
she's beautiful.
She's beautiful.

2104
01:28:27,281 --> 01:28:32,281
She seems real nice.
I don't know a goddamn thing about her 

2105
01:28:32,281 --> 01:28:34,560
not getting anything out of her.
That reminds me of the first time I 

2106
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:34,990
bought drugs.
The first time they ever bought drugs.

2107
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:40,170
Tell me what you remember.
Remember the first time you ever been 

2108
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:40,170
married?
He told me that you had a story.

2109
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:44,120
I met the first time ever about drugs.
I was in high school and I went to a 

2110
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,690
small high school so I was trying to be 
like,

2111
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,840
not make a thing to ask about it at 
first,

2112
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:53,841
you know,
because you don't want it to get around 

2113
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:53,841
and like be a.
So you were curious?

2114
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:58,550
Yeah,
I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know 

2115
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,550
who to ask because if you ask like at a 
small school you're like,

2116
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,460
I could blow up real fast.
That's how Gospel traveled.

2117
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,130
So my friend

2118
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,530
Steve had just transferred from like the
big high school,

2119
01:29:05,531 --> 01:29:07,770
like from high school but like 5,000
kids.

2120
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,720
And so it was like a weekend.
I was like,

2121
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:14,721
let's get a sack.
And I think we had just seen menace to 

2122
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:14,721
society and we were like,
it was up.

2123
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:17,190
But we were trying to totally hardcore 
guys.

2124
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,700
I'm like pulling the hat to the side,
be like he's Buddhist.

2125
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:21,600
No,
but I think,

2126
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:22,220
uh,
you know,

2127
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:25,210
a lot of like throwing swag into shit 
and being like,

2128
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,220
you know,
hey,

2129
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,440
it was good to sac.
You get your blackness on.

2130
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,710
Definitely feeling it.
14 like what's up dude?

2131
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:34,130
This shit.
I got your back making shit up.

2132
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:34,950
Little too white,
right?

2133
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:37,110
Yeah.
And so comfortable with your existence.

2134
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:38,370
Totally.
And then,

2135
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,780
uh,
he's like,

2136
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:41,040
I'll hook.
I know the guy.

2137
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:45,600
So this is like a Saturday night,
this long green,

2138
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:49,590
like old school seventies Cadillac pulls
up and he's like,

2139
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:52,050
that's the dude and this guy rolls the 
window down.

2140
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:52,560
And he was like,
Yo,

2141
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:53,820
get in the back.
And I was like,

2142
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:54,450
all right,
cool.

2143
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,760
We get in the back and thinking like 
that's where it goes down.

2144
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,160
And uh,
Steve Steve's like,

2145
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:00,050
Yo,
this is white pete.

2146
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,010
And I was like,
what's up White Pete?

2147
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:07,240
Like,
and then he was called White Pete 

2148
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,220
because they needed to give him a 
distinction for his name because he was 

2149
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:10,320
the only white guy that ran with his 
crew.

2150
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,940
Right.
And he was like,

2151
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,720
we didn't have driver's licenses,
so he was like exactly what we want at 

2152
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,410
that moment where we want it to be in a 
couple of years.

2153
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,610
Like he had like the whole unit,
like the oversized white tea and like,

2154
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:24,800
you know,
go chain.

2155
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,440
Yeah.
And fucking like fate.

2156
01:30:26,441 --> 01:30:27,210
And he was like,
what's up?

2157
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:29,280
I'm white people.
He talked like snoop dogg almost.

2158
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,930
Right?
And so we're like,

2159
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:32,460
all right.
I thought he was like,

2160
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:33,600
so we're going to go get it now.

2161
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:38,690
I was like,
go get what I thought were just doing 

2162
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:38,690
this in the car.
Wouldn't go get that sac man.

2163
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:38,690
I'm like,
oh,

2164
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:40,140
okay.
So we start driving,

2165
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:43,590
we go 30 minutes in the car,
we go to the next town over,

2166
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:47,700
which is Fort Pierce,
which is definitely a shittier place.

2167
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:53,270
Right.
So we're driving through for peers and 

2168
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,880
we go from a main street to like single 
lane highways.

2169
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:54,840
You know,
in Florida there's like,

2170
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,070
Oh yeah,
we're on a busy.

2171
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:58,560
Then we go to a single lane that has 
like canals on each side.

2172
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,080
Oh yeah.
And we drive it and then we go from that

2173
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:04,530
to a dirt road and then the dirt road 
off of that dirt road.

2174
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:08,130
Like we're driving down like this is 
some forensic files.

2175
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:10,560
Shit like we're going to end up on.
There's a lot of woods.

2176
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,010
Yeah.
Lot of brush groves,

2177
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:13,680
that kind of shit.

2178
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:18,680
And I was like fuck man.
And at this point like I'm thinking 

2179
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,610
about like menace to society and I'm 
like I want to be in that right now,

2180
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,770
but I'm feeling like I'm feeling really 
white.

2181
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:26,800
Really scared.
And so now it's night and it is,

2182
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:27,650
you know,
it's like,

2183
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:29,520
because he came over in the evening 
already,

2184
01:31:29,521 --> 01:31:33,270
so it was pitch black outside and we're 
on a dirt road off of a dirt road.

2185
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:36,240
Like you can scream,
there's nobody gonna hear Shit.

2186
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,540
And on the dirt road gravel path,
I see a light and the light is from a 

2187
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:46,770
trailer because we pull up to the 
trailer and we get out and it's me,

2188
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:49,200
Steve and white Pete and we knock on the
door,

2189
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:54,201
that trailer and this dude opens the 
door and he has this black guy has like 

2190
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:58,540
six dreadlocks.
Each dreadlock is like a size of like a 

2191
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:58,690
king size snickers bar.

2192
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:02,620
And he's got snicker bars coming out of 
his hair and he's like,

2193
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:03,430
what's up pat?
Pat?

2194
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,690
And he's like,
what's up White Pete?

2195
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,400
And they give each other a hug.
And I was like,

2196
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:07,350
oh fuck,
like no,

2197
01:32:07,351 --> 01:32:09,730
this really is like totally menace to 
society shit.

2198
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:15,170
Right?
But I'm told so trying to be cool about 

2199
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:15,730
it,
like so trying to be cool about it.

2200
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,610
And then he's like,
these white boys looking for sac.

2201
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:19,210
And he's like,
yeah,

2202
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:20,670
we could do that.
So we go into,

2203
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:24,870
mind you,
we're looking for $20 and we drove.

2204
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:27,250
And how long has it taken?
This is from this point.

2205
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,920
It's like we're already 30 miles south 
city.

2206
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,140
We started.
Would you just say like,

2207
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:36,160
nevermind,
after 10 miles white peaches sell it to 

2208
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:37,810
you,
why does he have to take you on the trip

2209
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:40,060
to the guy's house?
These are all the questions I have,

2210
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:41,230
but don't have the balls to ask.

2211
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,970
Like I'm in my mind.
I'm like,

2212
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:44,230
AH,
like I'm 14,

2213
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:46,330
15.
I'm not saying shit to this dude.

2214
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,500
Right.
I'm cool.

2215
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,600
Suck to get a sack,
right.

2216
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:54,630
We'll try me.
So we go into his trailer and he's like,

2217
01:32:54,841 --> 01:32:56,730
all right,
we're going to get to the sec.

2218
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,830
We back in 10 minutes.
I was like,

2219
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:01,600
who will be back in 10 minutes?
He's like,

2220
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:04,570
we will be,
you stay here and watch my place.

2221
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:05,440
And I was like,
what?

2222
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:11,040
Like,
what the fuck are you talking about is 

2223
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,040
what I'm thinking.
But then I just go like,

2224
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,040
yeah,
cool.

2225
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,000
Totally.
You're in his trailer.

2226
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,440
And he's like,
watch it for me.

2227
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,660
And I'm like,
oh no,

2228
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:19,690
like I'm feeling like that,
like real fear.

2229
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,040
But I go,
yeah,

2230
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:26,310
no problem.
Like I watched people's houses all the 

2231
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:28,090
time,
like it totally fucking terrified.

2232
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:30,970
And then he goes like the,
you walk in the trailer,

2233
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,850
you're in the living room because that's
the way trailers,

2234
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:33,070
right.

2235
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:36,160
Walk into it as a bedroom to the right.
I was like,

2236
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:41,161
waiting here on the bags.
He's like a 45 and a 12 gauge and he 

2237
01:33:41,161 --> 01:33:42,020
goes,
anybody comes in my,

2238
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:43,750
in my house,
you shoot them.

2239
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:44,890
I was like,
right.

2240
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,870
And then he was like a Sephora,
my Mama,

2241
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,370
my mama comes home,
don't shoot her.

2242
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:53,500
And I was like got it.
And except I kept trying to be cool 

2243
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:53,500
about it.
I was like,

2244
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,040
yeah,
like that's what's up.

2245
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,390
I know,
I know what you're saying man.

2246
01:33:56,730 --> 01:34:00,400
Look at that sac.
Totally like trying to be like.

2247
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,180
He was like,
all right,

2248
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:06,540
they walk out,
they leave me in his trailer with two 

2249
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,421
guns and a fucking message to not to 
shoot everybody but his mother and I 

2250
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:13,720
just sit there and watch the MTV video 
music awards and the whole time,

2251
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,550
like every show that comes just I'm 
rocking.

2252
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:21,210
I'm actually hoping that it's an 
intruder versus his mom because I feel 

2253
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:25,771
like if it's his mom,
she might accidentally shoot her or how 

2254
01:34:25,771 --> 01:34:28,720
is she going to react to my explanation?
Like pep just told me to wait here.

2255
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,220
Well,
he's getting some weed for me,

2256
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:32,080
but I'm not supposed to shoot everybody,
but you,

2257
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,470
are you cool with that?
She's like,

2258
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:40,471
Oh yeah,
that happens all to like how you're 

2259
01:34:40,471 --> 01:34:41,290
going to react to this so I fuck.
I mean I'm having a panic attack.

2260
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:42,910
We finally,
they come back,

2261
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:48,580
I get back in with a white pete.
He drives us back and I'm sitting there 

2262
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:49,390
like,
I'm like,

2263
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:51,580
what the fuck dude?
That was the worst that ever.

2264
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:53,230
Like I'm fucking terrified.
He was like,

2265
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:53,910
yeah,
Hammond,

2266
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,500
Pat,
pat.

2267
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:57,070
Pat became like best friends.
So they became like,

2268
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:59,390
like super close.
Like that was like his guy.

2269
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,680
He would go and I'd be like,
no dude,

2270
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,750
I don't want to hang out with pat at 
all.

2271
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,930
And like six months later when Steve got
his license,

2272
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,060
we went and he was like,
you want to get some weed today?

2273
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:08,720
And I was like,
yeah,

2274
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,200
yeah,
yeah.

2275
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:12,950
So where we go for peers pull up to pat 
pat's and I'm like,

2276
01:35:12,951 --> 01:35:15,470
God dammit.
Like she remembered how to get there.

2277
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:20,500
He did.
Steve had started going there all the 

2278
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:20,500
time.
Oh my God.

2279
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,680
We pull up to his trailer this time.
He gets out now this time,

2280
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:26,681
like with their friends.
So this is probably gonna be a much 

2281
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:26,681
quicker thing.
He comes out,

2282
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:27,650
he jumps in the back and he's like,
I have this role.

2283
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:29,180
And I was like,
oh no,

2284
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,510
we're fucking,
look for a sec again.

2285
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:37,240
I thought you just have this.
So this time we went to this,

2286
01:35:37,241 --> 01:35:37,940
but this are thing.

2287
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,950
Pap has scared the shit out of me the 
first time.

2288
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:45,280
But that second time he saved our life 
actually because we went from his 

2289
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,121
trailer.
The second time he jumped in the back 

2290
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:51,580
went to Avenue d,
which is the fucking shitty street in 

2291
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,150
Fort Pierce.
Like if you're going to like every city,

2292
01:35:53,151 --> 01:35:58,151
you know you have like,
I dunno whatever city you're in there 

2293
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:00,401
like that's ever seen.
If you've been to the street where you 

2294
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:02,690
see open drug dealing where there's not 
even some type of facade angeles,

2295
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:07,720
right,
but you've been done on a street where 

2296
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:07,720
there's like,
there's no pretense about it.

2297
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,340
There's just like Los Angeles.
Which part of filming fear factor?

2298
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:15,341
We were actually filming the playboy 
playmate addition of fear factor 

2299
01:36:15,341 --> 01:36:16,160
downtown area and we were watching 
people sell drugs,

2300
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:19,360
smoke crack right there.
We were in a crane and I go,

2301
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:20,450
look,
they're smoking crack.

2302
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,590
And the girls were like,
oh my God,

2303
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:22,900
they are smoking crack.
And like,

2304
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:25,250
this is ridiculous.
No one's protecting us.

2305
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:30,280
We're up here on a crane.
That was exactly like this where we 

2306
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,240
pulled up in,
in Steve's car and the windows come down

2307
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:37,241
and we just get surrounded.
Like the car got surrounded by six guys 

2308
01:36:37,241 --> 01:36:40,970
and they reached in their jackets and 
they go at this one guy who was.

2309
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,460
Y'All look familiar and this other guy 
goes,

2310
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:44,660
yeah,
y'all are real familiar.

2311
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,590
Y'All ever been here before?
And I.

2312
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:51,590
When you,
when somebody says that you look 

2313
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,590
familiar,
have any before,

2314
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:52,560
how would you answer that?
I'll just say nope.

2315
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,650
Nope.
Right,

2316
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,700
exactly.
At that moment I go no.

2317
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,530
And Steve at the exact same it goes.
Yup.

2318
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:01,550
Yeah man.
And then they're like,

2319
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:02,540
see,
I told you man,

2320
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,630
y'all look like the white boys had been 
snatching bags around here.

2321
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,390
And I was like,
Oh fuck,

2322
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,990
like you look like the white boys that 
have been taken bags from guys.

2323
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,760
I'm like,
no dude,

2324
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,080
that's not us.
It seems like,

2325
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:16,130
but we have been here before.
I'm like,

2326
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:20,010
will you shut the fuck up?
Is in the back,

2327
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:25,020
like hold on.
And he gets out and walks or talks to 

2328
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,020
all of them.
Like a,

2329
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:29,560
you know,
like he's the ambassador and like I 

2330
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,921
don't know what the fuck.
Like I own these guys there was like 

2331
01:37:31,921 --> 01:37:32,510
fucking.
And they totally let us go without,

2332
01:37:32,511 --> 01:37:34,480
without him we would have been fucked.
We will send noise.

2333
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:38,150
What is it with his phone that's not 
mine.

2334
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:41,650
It's my pat pat.
Pat,

2335
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,380
Pat,
pat.

2336
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:43,940
Pat is still,
I don't know what happened to Pat,

2337
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,430
pat and white Pete.
Who knows what good things.

2338
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:47,750
Probably not good things,
man.

2339
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,850
You said facebook?
Um,

2340
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,590
facebook.
Pap Pap.

2341
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,380
That will be the next person that makes 
up a fake twitter accounts of fee.

2342
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,000
That was.

2343
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,700
I had real fear.
Oh yeah.

2344
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:59,450
You're like for good fucking reason.
Oh,

2345
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,020
like when you feel your stomach dropping
your life,

2346
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,780
what's going to happen right now?
Oh my God.

2347
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:05,100
Yeah.
That's terrible shit,

2348
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:05,940
man.
When I was a kid,

2349
01:38:05,941 --> 01:38:10,941
when I was in high school,
we used to go to dorchester to eat late 

2350
01:38:10,941 --> 01:38:15,200
at night.
I was hanging out with this one kid I 

2351
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,701
lived in Jamaica plain before I went to 
high school in Jamaica plain was like a 

2352
01:38:16,701 --> 01:38:19,110
real shifting neighborhood.
It was kind of kind of creepy and it was

2353
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:24,240
it board some really creepy places and I
became friends with a couple of those 

2354
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:29,001
kids and I stayed in touch with them and
then when I went to high school I went 

2355
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:31,821
to visit him a couple times before I 
realized it was really fucking 

2356
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:31,821
dangerous.
Yeah,

2357
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:31,821
they were going to a bad high school 
man.

2358
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:36,540
They're high highschool situation.
My host high school situation was very 

2359
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,171
different.
We went to the same middle school 

2360
01:38:39,171 --> 01:38:39,171
together and middle school was kind of 
okay because kids were young,

2361
01:38:39,171 --> 01:38:41,120
they hadn't gotten into dangerous shit 
yet and you know,

2362
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,710
this is 1980,
you know,

2363
01:38:42,711 --> 01:38:47,711
this is early.
It was just like when the sugar hill 

2364
01:38:47,711 --> 01:38:47,711
gang would just come out,
hip hop,

2365
01:38:47,711 --> 01:38:48,720
inhibit,
inhibit of hip hop.

2366
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:53,721
That was the first rap music and it was 
very friendly in retrospect and things 

2367
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:57,120
changed radically though.
When when I left I went to a Newton,

2368
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:02,270
which is nice suburbs and I lived across
the street from a river and woods near 

2369
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:06,651
me and shit like that.
And they went to the inner city high 

2370
01:39:06,651 --> 01:39:07,170
school and they had some fucking tough 
times.

2371
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:08,190
Man.
I watched those dudes.

2372
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:13,050
They were basically involved in just 
just crime was everywhere around them.

2373
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,370
It was nuts,
man.

2374
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,730
You know,
inner city shit is just no fun at all.

2375
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:22,790
And I got lucky that my parents made a 
move to a nicer place and we anyway,

2376
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:27,840
we would go to these places like late at
night when I was hanging out with them,

2377
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,520
you know,
we'd hang out with some of their friends

2378
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:32,910
would go,
we'd go to like Dorchester at like 2:00

2379
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:33,830
in the morning to eat.
And I,

2380
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:38,980
first of all,
I couldn't believe who the fuck let me 

2381
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:38,980
wander around at 14 years old.
Yeah.

2382
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,860
But we were in some place where you,
there was bulletproof glass,

2383
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,590
they would sell you food but it was 
through bulletproof glass.

2384
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:48,591
It was sandwiches and there was like a 
slot where you would slide the food 

2385
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:52,011
under and it was like the worst fucking 
neighborhood you could possibly be in 

2386
01:39:52,011 --> 01:39:53,390
outside of Beirut.
You know,

2387
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:56,930
we're hanging out there and some guy 
goes fuck up,

2388
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,730
like decided to finish it.

2389
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:00,690
And I'm like let him go,
let him go.

2390
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:05,710
Let him go see the guy like bluffed his 
way out of a free sandwich and he would 

2391
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,770
walk off and he was eating it like right
at the front door,

2392
01:40:08,771 --> 01:40:13,050
like blocking the door like a dog.
Like it got far enough for,

2393
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:16,910
he was away from danger and he was just 
with no regard for how it looked.

2394
01:40:16,911 --> 01:40:19,020
It was just eating it,
blocking the doorway,

2395
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:20,920
eating the sandwich.
And I was like,

2396
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:22,470
um,
there's,

2397
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:27,570
there's people don't know like how,
how bad some neighborhoods are in like 

2398
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,740
Hollywood sunset between Fairfax and 
crescent heights used to be like.

2399
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:33,220
And like,
you know,

2400
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:38,370
I remember when I worked at a restaurant
there and one night man to two weekends 

2401
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:42,351
in a row,
first weekend someone got shot in the 

2402
01:40:42,351 --> 01:40:42,630
head on the steps into Denny's,
which was a.

2403
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,690
and then the next weekend somebody came 
in,

2404
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,450
one end into the kitchen,
took scissors,

2405
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,570
started stabbing people with scissor,
then stabbing themselves.

2406
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,980
But it was also God,
but it was also

2407
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,550
like a criminal hangout because at 
Denny's on Denny's,

2408
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,900
criminal hangout,
you know what I'm saying?

2409
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:01,420
It's open all night.
So that's where late night people,

2410
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,210
people who are up all night could go and
hang out.

2411
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:10,110
So it became like it was,
they just shut it down because they're 

2412
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:10,110
like everybody who's who's in here as 
like pimp,

2413
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:13,060
Hustler drug dealer and they're 
murdering people weekend after weekend.

2414
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:15,200
So they just shut that shit down.
But that was like,

2415
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:16,380
there was a dangerous area.
Man.

2416
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:21,480
Hollywood is so shitty,
shitty people come to Hollywood who 

2417
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,451
think that they're going to come.
We're going to go almost killed a guy 

2418
01:41:24,451 --> 01:41:25,730
yesterday coming home from the doctor.
This it was,

2419
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:29,050
I was probably going 45,
50 miles an hour and out of nowhere.

2420
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:31,600
The car next to me slams on his brakes.
I'm like,

2421
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:36,601
what the fuck?
So I slammed on my brakes even though I 

2422
01:41:36,601 --> 01:41:36,601
had no idea why.

2423
01:41:36,601 --> 01:41:39,090
He was slamming on his brakes type thing
because I couldn't see over his car and 

2424
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:43,320
they slam on brakes and just missed this
old man dressed up as a woman and he was

2425
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:48,460
just crossing the street like in the 
middle of the street jaywalking and just

2426
01:41:48,461 --> 01:41:50,760
screaming at us like,
like,

2427
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,200
like you could just tell you this 
fucking crazy.

2428
01:41:53,201 --> 01:41:55,460
I like lipstick all around his whole 
entire face.

2429
01:41:55,461 --> 01:41:57,140
Do you?
It was just an old man dress up as well,

2430
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:02,160
but let's Costar from grace under fire 
still pissed that bitch out of scream 

2431
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:02,830
and get the show.
I got to fucking bounce.

2432
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:07,831
I got to go do a show.

01:43:30,841 --> 01:43:34,291
not knowing what the fuck we're doing as
if we didn't start off today on the

We fucking slippery.

2472
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:38,710
This is real.
There's not a lot of production value,

2473
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:39,550
but it's free.
Okay,

2474

from twitter,

2484
01:44:01,871 --> 01:44:01,871
from all the cool links that I get sent 
to.

2485
01:44:01,871 --> 01:44:03,950
The amount of support that we get from 
our shows.

2486
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:07,200
It to me is the coolest thing that I've 
ever done in my life.

2487
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,830
As you got the best hands,
if I'm lucky,

2488
01:44:09,831 --> 01:44:10,940
I'm very,
very fortunate.

2489
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,550
We put out the right vibe and people 
respond and,

2490
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,390
and we put out this show for its real.
It's,

2491
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:19,460
you know what I'm saying?
It's like there's no bullshit,

2492
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:21,110
no pretense.
It is what it is.

2493
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,140
It's 100 percent free and we love all 
you freaks and we just want to let you 

2494
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:26,360
know that this is not something I take 
for granted.

2495
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:31,360
I've done a lot of shit in my career.
This is the thing I'm the most proud of 

2496
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:31,360
for sure.
It's a,

2497
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,200
you guys are most proud of the,
the whole,

2498
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,180
the whole thing.
Everything behind it.

2499
01:44:35,181 --> 01:44:36,720
All the moment.
I don't want to say movement though.

2500
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:41,860
All the momentum behind it,
all the shows and it's a humbling 

2501
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:41,860
experience,
man.

2502
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,120
When I do something like the Chicago 
Theater and is 3,200

2503
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:45,700
people and everyone's screaming and 
cheering,

2504
01:44:45,701 --> 01:44:50,701
it's really the greatest.
One of the greatest experiences of my 

2505
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:50,701
life.
And we're gonna keep going,

2506

2512
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:04,901
sell out is we do them every week.

2513

There's only 85 seats and it's fucking
