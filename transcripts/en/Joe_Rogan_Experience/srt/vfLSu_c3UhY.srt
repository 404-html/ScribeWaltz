1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,411
We're gonna get there,

2
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:01,050
get in line.

3
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,501
Um,

4
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:01,711
yeah.

5
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:02,520
I might have to get in line.

6
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,420
I'll do whatever I have to do.

7
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,363
What are you,

8
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,900
I'll probably get the bug
and then just want it badly.

9
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,801
I like it,

10
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:07,950
man.

11
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,690
I'd be willing to wait
in line for like an hour.

12
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,070
No,

13
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,330
half an hour.

14
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:11,970
Oh,

15
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,480
all right.

16
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,871
I was like,

17
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:14,060
let's see which,

18
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,540
just thinking about how long does it take,

19
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,650
how long has this line?

20
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,560
Half Hour.

21
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,051
Just order.

22
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:18,620
If you ordered,

23
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,453
they just ship it to you,

24
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,840
but you got the same day when
you wanted them immediately.

25
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,990
But what will hold me over is
that Samsung Galaxy s three.

26
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,360
I want to see it yet,

27
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,290
which I've heard good things.

28
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,530
Yeah,

29
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,011
I'll pull it out.

30
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,631
I'll let you touch it.

31
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,410
Did have somebody at a show.

32
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:33,244
I want to touch it.

33
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,193
Uh,

34
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,190
take,

35
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,590
take a picture with it and
the screen look beautiful.

36
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:38,191
It's insane.

37
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,240
And you know what else it can do?

38
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,890
It can take a blast of photos.

39
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,830
I can take our really 10 photos in a row.

40
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,461
Got High speed.

41
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:44,731
Yeah,

42
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:45,750
it does some weird thing.

43
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,220
Where can,

44
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,040
you know,

45
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,180
jump up in the air and it'll capture
the cow 10 different pictures.

46
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,990
It's amazing.

47
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,591
Like if a,

48
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,424
the deer

49
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:53,771
did,

50
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,270
I got my back yard for
wanting to get photos of them.

51
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,770
Them went to the bathroom,

52
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,390
they were going full on,

53
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,220
running fast back and forth,

54
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,240
like for no reason.

55
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,950
And I'm like,

56
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,170
what?

57
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,270
What are these guys doing?

58
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,280
This run around your house
is surrounded by crazy deer.

59
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,731
Yeah,

60
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,421
but they're a,

61
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,910
this is like where they feel comfortable
cause my dogs can't get Watson.

62
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,400
Then the nice animals,

63
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,270
who cares?

64
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,611
You're ready.

65
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,500
You ever said lucky?

66
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,600
They're lucky that uh,

67
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,660
it's not illegal to shoot him.

68
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,330
Yeah.

69
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,163
Would you shoot him?

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
Oh,

71
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,393
here's a problem.

72
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
Here's the problem with deer.

73
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,570
It's not a problem in my neighborhood
cause nobody drives fast.

74
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,060
You know,

75
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,220
it's a pretty quiet area.

76
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,851
But if you,

77
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,460
if you have this many
deer near a main road,

78
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,810
it becomes a real problem.

79
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,180
People all over the
world crashing the deer.

80
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,051
I mean,

81
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:39,410
it's just a fucking really common way
that people get injured in cars get fucked

82
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:39,610
up,

83
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,301
fucked up.

84
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,134
I fucked up,

85
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,100
ruined different deer that big.

86
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:43,670
Do you think of that?

87
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,740
How big that Deere was and
if that hit the windshield,

88
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:47,610
that's break your fucking face man.

89
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:47,930
Yeah.

90
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,590
And if the thing is still
alive and kicking and glasses,

91
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,740
flying your eyeballs,

92
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,940
if it was a motorcycle,

93
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,451
yeah,

94
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:53,681
you,

95
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,670
you literally have to kill those things.

96
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,840
You have to kill them.

97
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,381
And there's the,

98
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,670
Peta people don't want to admit this,

99
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,530
but this one of two options.

100
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,220
Okay.

101
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,390
You either assume your position at the
top of the food chain and deal with the

102
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,950
problem or you bring something else in
and you're no longer at the top of the

103
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,290
food chain because that's the only way
you're going to have to deal with this

104
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:12,680
issue.

105
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,480
What do they pray everywhere.

106
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,910
So you either eat it or
you bring in predators.

107
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,773
That's all you can do.

108
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,300
Cause you're either going to shoot it or
you got to bring in mountain lions and

109
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:20,601
wolves.

110
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:24,370
So they propose that we just let
deer just exploded in population.

111
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:24,650
Yeah.

112
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,140
Well they,

113
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,611
you know,

114
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:26,090
look,

115
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,830
they don't want people hunting.

116
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,160
Right?

117
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,300
They don't want people hunting.

118
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,790
But I don't know what
kind of ideas they have,

119
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,420
the desktop,

120
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,410
the population growth.

121
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,000
Because if you don't manage that shit,

122
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
and this is something that,

123
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,471
you know,

124
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:39,800
when I was a young man I
thought that like deer hunting.

125
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,281
Like wow,

126
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,690
why would you ever want to kill a deer?

127
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,820
I didn't even think about the irony
of wanting a cheeseburger and,

128
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,080
and,

129
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,860
and not,

130
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,131
you know,

131
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,860
in wondering why anybody
would go and kill a deer.

132
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,150
Like it didn't even make sense to me.

133
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,570
But as you get older and you understand
that you have to do something about the

134
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,230
population,

135
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,940
if you don't do something about the,

136
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,820
they are like rats.

137
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,301
The,

138
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,880
that's how every there's
going to be a disease.

139
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,840
There's going to be problems because
every population needs to be put in check.

140
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:11,560
The cycle has to be the reason why the
world so fucked up right now is because

141
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,730
there's nothing that eats us.

142
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,450
That's like the main reason
we can just dominate.

143
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,050
We can just run around all willy
nilly and nothing puts us in check.

144
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,970
And if that was the case with Deere,

145
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,200
we would be fucked.

146
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,770
We'd go 20 miles an hour everywhere
they'd be jumping in front of your car

147
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,604
everywhere you went.

148
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,620
The only good thing is
we'd never go hungry.

149
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,701
You just pull over,

150
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,540
pull out a gun,

151
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,340
boom,

152
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,140
blow into those stupid fucking things.

153
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
The head start a fire and,

154
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,260
and just start.

155
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,821
You could eat,

156
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,200
you would never starve to death,

157
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,080
but there'd be deer everywhere and you
wouldn't get anywhere and people would

158
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:44,290
die on the highway every day because
you would just hit one of those fucking

159
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,960
dummies kick through your skull.

160
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,310
They fucking fuck you.

161
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,840
Oh the fuck your head up man.

162
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,674
Deer Jerky.

163
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,220
Love it.

164
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,720
Just because I don't have a box of it.

165
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,200
Oh really?

166
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,471
Yeah,

167
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:53,770
I get,

168
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,050
I buy a venison jerky and elk jerky.

169
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,590
Yeah,

170
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,880
I feel like a man when I eat them.

171
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,260
I feel like I'm on mountain men.

172
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,870
I'm living in a cabin.

173
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,140
You are fear some felling fierce as fuck.

174
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,113
Alright.

175
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,410
Cut.

176
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,630
Deers living in my yard bro.

177
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:08,930
I'm like a wild person up here.

178
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,310
A wild person got to be
careful about wild though.

179
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,451
Okay.

180
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,420
I respect that shit.

181
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,350
Gonna keep it in line.

182
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,710
People that think that you
shouldn't kill deer are ridiculous.

183
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,551
You're ridiculous.

184
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,160
And to do something with them
ridiculous and you're dangerous.

185
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,611
Okay.

186
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,444
And it's stupid.

187
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,670
It's not like they're going to live
forever if you don't shoot them.

188
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,421
And by the way,

189
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:30,421
killing deer is a thousand times better
than running some ridiculous factory

190
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,230
chicken farm stuff and everything and
do a fucking box where it can't move.

191
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,030
Or just thinking about veal,

192
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,421
you know,

193
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,050
thinking about how they
raise veal and how,

194
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,450
how many pig farms or pigs or stuffed
right next to is where the tears are just

195
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,500
running around man,

196
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,490
just running around.

197
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,590
I would like to do the bow hunting.

198
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,250
Dude.

199
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,630
I've been watching a lot of bow hunting.

200
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,111
It's cool,

201
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,590
but I don't think,

202
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,430
I can't actually,

203
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,050
I'm not,

204
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,240
I,

205
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,220
I'm not good at stomaching the,

206
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,470
I'll show you something
I really won't like.

207
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,950
Really?

208
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,370
Yeah.

209
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,900
Yeah.

210
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,590
Wore this show called pig man.

211
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,693
And uh,

212
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,190
I've been obsessed with it from a,

213
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,520
to the time I saw them first
kill a pig with a knife.

214
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,420
The dog's hold the pig down and they
stabbed in the throat with a knife.

215
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,180
That's a show.

216
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,013
It yet show.

217
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,593
It's a hunting show.

218
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,730
It's about pigs in rural Texas.

219
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah,

220
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,620
pigs in Texas are fucking huge problem
and wild pigs are like literally like

221
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,960
destroying millions of acres.

222
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,970
There's millions and
millions of wild pigs.

223
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,570
They're ridiculous infestation to the
point where they're shooting amount of

224
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:31,780
helicopters and that's one of
the things they did on pig man.

225
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,290
This guy gets out a fucking helicopter
and shoots like 200 pigs in a day.

226
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,670
Well this is the disturbing.

227
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,451
That was disturbing,

228
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,000
but the most recent episode was
way more mustard disturbing.

229
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,870
He's going,

230
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,870
he goes hunting in Argentina and he's
trying to get pigs like these big giant

231
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,340
pigs and there's no pigs around.

232
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:53,260
So he shoots off Fox and he shoots a
Fox with a bow and Arrow and the thing

233
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,680
screams this horrible

234
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,830
and it was really fucked up man.

235
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:01,610
It was really,

236
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,610
it was really weird to watch because he
nails this thing and it just lets out

237
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,120
this horrible,

238
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,570
horrible screech and then you
realize he's not going to eat that.

239
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,880
You're not eating that Fox.

240
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,720
Like he just shot that Fox because he
could shoot that Fox and I was like,

241
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:17,901
oh,

242
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,340
what for the pelts or something?

243
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,071
Jesus Christ.

244
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,110
What don't we don't we live in,

245
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,100
in the fur trapping days.

246
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,820
You know,

247
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,020
you're not really a fur trapper.

248
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,400
I mean I guess it's worth some money,

249
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,770
but you just shot that thing cause
you wanted to shoot a fox and I,

250
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,020
when I lived in Colorado,

251
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,540
mem foxes are cool as fuck
cause they're bad ass.

252
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,680
They're kind of cool man.

253
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,910
There's um,

254
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,073
what's it called?

255
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,210
Coyotes that run around the uh,

256
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,500
the uh,

257
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,370
like Griffith Park.

258
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,540
The coyotes are different.

259
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,750
Coyotes and creeps.

260
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:42,950
Okay.

261
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,750
It is in my big dangerous creeps.

262
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,290
They are,

263
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,310
they're dangerous creeps.

264
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,860
But foxes are not
dangerous to people at all.

265
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,360
Coyotes will attack children,

266
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,560
but Fox says won't.

267
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,850
The foxes are coming packed.

268
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,773
Very clever.

269
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,280
They do coming back and they
come in packs down from you.

270
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,300
They come down from the hillside
and you'll all of a sudden,

271
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:01,530
like every few weeks I'll hear that.

272
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,360
That have like a maniacal
high pitch barking danger.

273
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,550
Andress.

274
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,680
Yeah,

275
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,800
they're always in my
front yard and they're,

276
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,021
they're,

277
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,940
they like play with my
dog through the window.

278
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,080
Like my dog will bargain in that
coyote will come out and just stupid.

279
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,630
Would I say about them?

280
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,810
Is that the only reason I don't kill us
is because they don't think they can get

281
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,380
away with it.

282
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,213
That's all it is.

283
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,840
And they'll kill anything else around us,

284
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,770
including your children.

285
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:25,790
They will attack your children.

286
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,100
Was having a bunch of times I've seen,

287
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,880
I've seen a dog running
like trodding a coyote,

288
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,510
excuse me.

289
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,343
Uh,

290
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,900
trodding down fountain
with a dog and its mouth.

291
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,763
Oh yeah.

292
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,723
Oh yeah,

293
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,750
dude.

294
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,190
That's what they eat late at night.

295
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,110
They snatch him right
off of people's leashes.

296
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,520
People go walking around
in Nice neighborhoods like
Brentwood that go walking

297
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,700
around with a dog on a leash and a coyote
will come and snatch that motherfucker

298
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,100
off and run their rights out here.

299
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:52,460
Man.

300
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,820
The rats just walk on my power lines and
you're just going from house to house.

301
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,400
He just,

302
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,233
Whoa,

303
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,310
that shit.

304
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,280
Fuck Oof.

305
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,071
I had had,

306
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:01,220
uh,

307
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,940
some guy,

308
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,840
they had a lockdown,

309
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,800
some house and quarantine it because
some people caught some horrible rat

310
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,390
disease from that hoarder show.

311
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,040
Geez.

312
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,311
Yeah.

313
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,170
They're cleaning up people's
houses and you know,

314
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,330
these people had a rat
infestation in their house,

315
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,890
so they've taught in this disease.

316
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:20,891
Apparently it kills like 20 to 50% of
the people who get it and it's incurable.

317
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,090
There's no cure for it.

318
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,320
So these people were catching
this horrible incurable
disease from cleaning up

319
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:28,790
people's shit houses,

320
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,860
Jesus rats everywhere and infestations.

321
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,090
And I used to see those
rats on the power lines.

322
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,390
And this is when I worked in
like a big corporate building.

323
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,740
And so I talked to the,

324
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,670
they had the guys would,

325
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,810
would come into the offices in the kitchen
and like set traps and do this stuff.

326
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:45,261
So I was like,

327
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:45,910
Hey,

328
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,181
I,

329
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:46,461
you know,

330
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:46,680
I,

331
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm terrified of the fucking rats.

332
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,590
I was like,

333
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,300
what can I do about rats?

334
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:50,811
And he was like,

335
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:51,500
well,

336
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,771
you know,

337
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,850
he's telling me the options.

338
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:53,271
And he was like,

339
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,890
he gave me these,

340
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,650
uh,

341
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,280
these like

342
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,390
Gel pad,

343
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,340
like Sticky Gel.

344
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,391
Like it's like a,

345
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:03,420
it's like a big rectangular thing
and you just place it and he's like,

346
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,080
there'll be running and then they'll
just get stuck in that and then they just

347
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,550
rot and then they'll just die.

348
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,530
So I was like,

349
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,020
all right.

350
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,450
So I was so scared of
them that I said fuck it.

351
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,670
I put it up on the roof and he's like
put like a little peanut butter and it'll

352
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,610
just come right there.

353
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,391
Cool.

354
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,230
I lay them out,

355
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,830
I come out the next day
they are from the roof.

356
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,430
They're down on the floor now.

357
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,840
Flipped over and shit on is
like the rats pick them up,

358
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,890
flip them over and shit all over
them like fuck your trap or real.

359
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:35,970
Yeah and they just,

360
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
they were just kicked over.

361
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,110
It might with rat shit all over them.

362
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,630
I had that really bad mouse problem when
I was in college and like it's still

363
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,970
about where the mice were just like,

364
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,510
like I would take a blanket off my couch
and mice would scurry out and blah.

365
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,230
What do you have like an ancient
infrastructure that's been infested,

366
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,920
like New York City's infrastructure is
really almost no way to eradicate them

367
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,060
unless you would clean every person
out of the city and then just kill

368
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,520
everything alive and the city otherwise,

369
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,140
and even then you're
probably going to miss a few.

370
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,260
They're going to be in crack
somewhere hiding those naval cuts.

371
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,210
There's more brats I think.

372
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,460
Then there are people in New York City.

373
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,180
Yeah.

374
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,440
So we had one of those traps,

375
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:13,580
but my mouse,

376
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:13,881
like,

377
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,181
I was like,

378
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,014
well one day and he's like,

379
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,550
what's that noise in my kitchen?

380
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:17,091
And I hear like,

381
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:21,080
like I like just the shuffling noise and
there's like just blood and there's a

382
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:25,010
mouse there that was like biting his
leg off and I didn't know what to do.

383
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:30,011
So I grabbed like one of the scoops
that you for the broom and I threw it

384
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,310
outside and I was like,

385
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,473
I don't care what's,

386
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,720
so I don't know what happened to it.

387
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,540
I just never went into
my backyard anymore.

388
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,513
She,

389
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,261
yeah,

390
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:39,940
when you got anywhere but this rats,

391
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,260
you just gotta get the fuck out of there.

392
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,550
This is,

393
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,310
you can't win.

394
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,143
You're not going to win.

395
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,650
You need to set up shop in a place.

396
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:45,840
It doesn't have rats like that.

397
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,300
The monoxide house,

398
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,350
same house.

399
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,183
It makes sense.

400
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,651
Jesus Christ.

401
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:55,330
What a shitty house got attacked by
rodents and poisoned brain to speaking of

402
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,081
poison brain,

403
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,640
this new sports illustrated.

404
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,830
I know you're a football fan.

405
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,430
She read this shit on Jim McMann.

406
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,421
No,

407
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:02,260
I know he's,

408
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,580
he's not doing well.

409
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,660
Not doing well man.

410
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,080
The Gym,

411
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,861
when I was a kid,

412
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,060
I was not a football fan,

413
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,680
but I knew who the fuck
Jim Mcmahon was mean.

414
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,660
He was a super famous football player.

415
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,370
Bandanas and he used to wear a bull shark.

416
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,771
Yeah,

417
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:16,390
the Superbowl shuffle while he,

418
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,790
apparently he has dementia and uh,

419
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,151
he,

420
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:22,970
his girlfriend takes pictures of them
together because one day she's worried

421
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,410
he's going to forget who she is because
she sees it slowly slipping away.

422
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,100
Like he'll be,

423
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,940
he'll kiss her goodbye and they'll be
downstairs just standing frozen because he

424
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,050
can't remember what he was going to do.

425
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,320
I think football is on the
verge of changing dramatically.

426
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,190
How the fuck can you,

427
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:36,490
that's,

428
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,600
they were talking to him,

429
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,900
he was on another sports show and they
were talking to him about it and he said

430
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,150
leather helmets might be the rule,

431
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,310
like go go to back to Lubbock leather
helmets and have no head contact at all.

432
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,910
He said,

433
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,870
but that's not gonna work.

434
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,250
I mean it's like who's
going to accept that?

435
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,113
Yeah,

436
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:52,811
I know.

437
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:53,880
I the um,

438
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,581
oh my God.

439
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,200
On real sports on HBO.

440
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,183
Yeah.

441
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
All those old players
that come in shaking that,

442
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,121
I've seen that,

443
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:01,811
but they have this,

444
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,620
uh,

445
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
this guy,

446
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,820
I feel bad that I forgot his name,

447
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:09,821
but he played for the saints
and he got als at like 34,

448
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,423
35.

449
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,800
And basically they said this is the
first edit like time we've ever seen that

450
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:20,150
this traumatic just head door there.

451
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,160
The severe head trauma repeatedly
might be a cause of als.

452
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,560
We've never had,

453
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,880
we've never shown evidence that
something could lead to als.

454
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,930
What does als stand for?

455
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,440
Uh,

456
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,273
it's uh,

457
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,300
it's a long,

458
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,493
uh,

459
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,230
it's a medical term that I
can't pronounce correctly,

460
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:38,980
but it's,

461
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,221
it's,

462
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:39,431
you know,

463
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:43,390
it destroys your muscles and the only
thing it doesn't destroy as it eats away

464
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,860
your muscles is your brain.

465
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,310
So you're totally aware of how
you're physically just brave,

466
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,553
evaporating.

467
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,570
And like they show,

468
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:52,760
he,

469
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,070
he played in the,

470
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,930
in the first game after Katrina,

471
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,451
New Orleans was,

472
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:58,660
was just devastated.

473
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:58,901
Right.

474
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,320
And they,

475
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,850
the super,

476
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,840
the super dome was used to house,

477
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,800
uh,

478
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,550
the city's residents who didn't have a
place to go and they never know if they

479
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,720
were going to even be able to rebuild it.

480
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,554
They rebuilt it,

481
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,280
you know,

482
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,420
got it all cleaned up.

483
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:14,440
And then they had their first game since
Katrina and it was like a big deal and

484
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:19,150
he blocked a punt that just
like sent the place into.

485
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,380
It's like one of the craziest,

486
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,270
you see the clip of it is like,

487
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,360
it's super emotional place.

488
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,070
Just goes nuts.

489
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,320
They're so excited to
have their team back.

490
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,420
And so he was that guy and he retired.

491
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,970
He played like eight or nine
years in the league and was like,

492
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:31,804
you know,

493
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,420
retired and looking forward
to the rest of his life.

494
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,620
How old was he when he retired?

495
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,180
He retired I think,

496
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,570
uh,

497
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,261
like 30,

498
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,970
31 years ago.

499
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,020
And then,

500
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,620
you know,

501
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,910
finally retired 31.

502
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,600
Uh,

503
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,320
he was just,

504
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,830
you know,

505
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,640
had his run,

506
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,300
like he wasn't,

507
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,541
you know,

508
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,770
he was a special teams player.

509
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:48,604
Like he had a good,

510
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,050
a good career.

511
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:50,884
And then,

512
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,900
but that seems like there's
plenty of years left.

513
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,980
And your athletic career,

514
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,520
um,

515
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,940
a lot of,

516
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,460
a lot of,

517
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,850
you know,

518
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,880
NFL guys or three,

519
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:58,750
four years.

520
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,190
And is it because of physical?

521
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,170
We just set up that you
just don't make the cut.

522
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,440
Yeah,

523
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,130
like a lot of times you'll see guys
that they were like big contributors and

524
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,000
then you know,

525
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:11,350
their way by this team picked up by
this team and all of a sudden they're 29

526
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:11,800
even.

527
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,633
And they're like,

528
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,540
they're,

529
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,620
no team wants them anymore.

530
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,030
Like there was so crazy.

531
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,301
Yes,

532
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,140
you were out.

533
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,741
You were out.

534
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,510
I mean it's so fucking,

535
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,040
you know those collisions man.

536
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,140
And they asked him during the thing,

537
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:23,441
they're like,

538
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:27,580
how many times were you
knocked out during your career?

539
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,540
And he was like twice,

540
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:28,841
you know,

541
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:29,381
where I was like,

542
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,520
blackout knocked out.

543
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,460
And then how many times did
you have like your Bell Rung?

544
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:33,731
You know,

545
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:34,481
where you're just like,

546
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,310
Holy Shit.

547
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,050
He was like hundreds,

548
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,883
hundreds of times.

549
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,530
It's written little practice.

550
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,364
Those cows,

551
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,571
those count too.

552
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,440
Practice counts,

553
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,280
everything counts.

554
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:45,761
And we see,

555
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:45,940
you know,

556
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,840
junior say out.

557
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,943
Uh,

558
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,790
I mean it's,

559
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,601
what do you do though?

560
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,230
Do you tell people that
got to stop playing for,

561
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,000
I would not want my kids to play football.

562
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,680
Tell you that I would be reluctant.

563
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,690
I know that like the one thing that,

564
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,710
the only way,

565
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,160
I mean,

566
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,140
the thing that most people agree
on is that the proper technique is,

567
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,990
is not being taught from a young age.

568
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,580
Now people are no longer like you
look at old footage of football.

569
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:10,791
Yeah.

570
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,120
They're different caliber athletes and
stuff and they're not like the monsters,

571
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,240
but like it was tech and it was
more technical tackling people.

572
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,560
Would you taught when you know,

573
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,940
you,

574
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,461
you load your,

575
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,330
Bend your knees,

576
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,880
you put your shoulder into
basically somebody's chest,

577
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,230
you wrap up and you tackle.

578
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:24,950
Those are the,

579
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,950
the tackles that rarely do you see that
result in like some devastating had

580
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,690
drama.

581
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,350
But now it's,

582
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,810
and this is now like meaning the last 15,

583
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,740
20 years.

584
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,843
It is like,

585
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,980
you see helmets being lowered,

586
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,070
crown of the head into
the other person's helmet.

587
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,150
Just head blows.

588
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,650
People are fucking,

589
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,430
you know,

590
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,840
throwing shoulders,

591
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:52,690
helmets and forearms into people's
heads and then you see them just there.

592
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
It's like they were just
in a car accident man.

593
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:54,951
Like they're just,

594
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,790
they can't handle it.

595
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,350
It doesn't matter what
type of helmet you wear.

596
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,091
Yeah,

597
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,924
there's um,

598
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,700
there's only so much punishment your,

599
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,630
your brand can take.

600
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:06,020
And I think that there's very few
things in life that hit you as hard as a

601
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,070
football player does.

602
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,230
I just think that those dudes,

603
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,390
when you look at a 300
pound guy running it,

604
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:15,440
you full clip and charging into your
body while another guy hits you over this

605
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,580
way and you collide together and
then the guy goes unconscious.

606
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,700
Like is there any other time in life
where you see a man completely armored up

607
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,050
just getting knocked unconscious?

608
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,884
Oh my God.

609
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,090
They have helmets on.

610
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,530
They have big arm or padding on their
shoulders and they get knocked the fuck

611
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,220
out knocked out and the real
problem now there are low,

612
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,910
they're more on top of
it cause they have to be.

613
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,850
But the real problem is you look
at like eighties and nineties,

614
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
the guys who are now 40 to 50.

615
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,490
Yeah.

616
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,650
And you're seeing a
lot of like depression,

617
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,570
um,

618
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,030
dementia,

619
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,570
dementia and you're
seeing Alzheimer's and,

620
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,050
and all these different,

621
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,790
a debilitating things take place.

622
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,900
Those guys would get
knocked out or you know,

623
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,430
they would get like a severe
concussion and it would just be like,

624
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,020
you need to go play right away now.

625
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,640
Like there wasn't like now there's like,

626
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,031
you know,

627
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:05,390
they're finally doing like if
you even have a sign of this,

628
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,310
you're going to be out
for this amount of time.

629
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,311
You have to have those guys played
with like full concussion syndromes,

630
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,860
which means that like
their brain just went,

631
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,180
there's just shook inside their skull
and now they're fucking playing again.

632
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,043
You know,

633
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,540
it's so crazy that they didn't even know.

634
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,433
It's like they,

635
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,720
that just shows you how recent,

636
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,770
not just the science of brain trauma
is where they really kind of understand

637
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,240
what causes real problems,

638
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,300
but also the,

639
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,520
the,

640
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
the idea of this as a sport.

641
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,860
So recent and in the Human Medical Venay,

642
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,291
you know,

643
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:39,740
um,

644
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,573
uh,

645
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,270
encyclopedia a far as like
things that happened to people.

646
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,250
How often did they have
to like judge a or,

647
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:47,551
or,

648
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:48,330
or,

649
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,080
um,

650
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,550
look at a very specific

651
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,150
group,

652
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,100
like people who do this one thing,

653
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,140
who all come down with
traumatic brain injury.

654
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,291
Like,

655
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,730
what the fuck is going on?

656
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,560
What does this one profession,

657
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:58,951
you know,

658
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,480
it's not like being a welder does that,

659
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,130
but being it's football player thing.

660
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,411
Well,

661
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,950
this whole idea of a football
player like a hundred years old,

662
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,270
I mean it's super new.

663
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,260
So we did in the medical history of like
things that you shouldn't do that are

664
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,190
fucked up for you.

665
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,800
This sort of hasn't really been fully,

666
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,033
fully entered,

667
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,500
but neither has fighting man.

668
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:16,711
I mean,

669
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,700
fighting like in as far as like people
have known about punchdrunk boxers

670
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,301
forever.

671
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,410
I mean that's always been,

672
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:22,920
you know,

673
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,860
the box has stuck around too long and
that the horrible stories and the,

674
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:27,694
the list,

675
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,310
so the words that are,

676
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,144
you know,

677
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,320
stumbling,

678
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,820
slurring out of their mouth.

679
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,150
It's,

680
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,610
it's terrible to watch that stuff.

681
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:34,971
But we've,

682
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,570
we've known about that forever,

683
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,570
but we're going to start to see that
probably from MMA fighters if they're,

684
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,550
they're not looked after Devin as well.

685
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:41,761
I mean,

686
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:41,941
they're,

687
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,241
they're,

688
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,250
they're taking shots to the head is wow.

689
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,310
It's all about knowing
when to fucking get out.

690
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:47,760
Yeah.

691
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,650
It's all about using as much,

692
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,170
you know,

693
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,630
intelligence as he can risk
as much as you need to,

694
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:55,560
but no more.

695
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,760
And then get out when you feel like
it's slipping away and you got to treat,

696
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:00,780
you've got to treat.

697
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,620
Um,

698
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,280
any real like head trauma,

699
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,390
a concussion,

700
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,610
like a really serious event.

701
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,080
Like it's not something to just be like,

702
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,914
well that happens.

703
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,031
It gets really,

704
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:12,864
really serious.

705
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,520
Well I've heard a dude's get knocked out
and training and then go to a fight and

706
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:22,300
then get hit with like a small shot in
the fight and they go unconscious because

707
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:25,410
they were really like walking around
like halfway knocked out already.

708
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,243
Yeah.

709
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,750
Marvin Eastman fought Travis Luder and
Travis Luder hit him on the end of the

710
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,680
punch.

711
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,040
It was like,

712
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,090
it was a really weird,

713
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:33,720
it didn't look,

714
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,553
it looked like,

715
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,690
like he just shut off.

716
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,410
He like,

717
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,090
he hit him and his whole
body and I was like,

718
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,140
that doesn't even make any sense.

719
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,780
But then you talked to the people that
trained with and they said he got knocked

720
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,840
out twice in camp for that fight,

721
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,930
which is just fucking crazy.

722
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,020
And he was probably right back like the
day after fucking taking shots when I

723
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,940
wonder if they're ever going to be able
to fix that and wonder if it's ever

724
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,950
going to be anything that can repair.

725
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,840
Because the thing about brain conditions
I think from impact is that the

726
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,250
degenerative and that,

727
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,660
just like with these boxers,

728
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,990
they say that something happened to them
10 years ago and they start to feel the

729
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,130
effects 10 years later.

730
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,510
Well I think,

731
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,900
you know,

732
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,501
because it's,

733
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,950
it's so unnatural either
to get like the trauma.

734
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,000
Absolutely.

735
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,510
Like most people that have
one occurrence like that,

736
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,510
that's the one occurrence
they have for their life.

737
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,800
They don't have that.

738
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,110
They don't go through
that hundreds of times.

739
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,711
You know,

740
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,790
you have somebody,

741
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:29,981
you know,

742
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:30,181
you know,

743
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,860
everyone knows somebody or
you're in a car accident.

744
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:32,371
Oh fuck.

745
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,300
And it fucked me up.

746
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:33,930
And you know,

747
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,930
that's that one time that
happened and I had headaches,

748
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,561
you know,

749
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,940
for fucking years.

750
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:42,480
And I went to this type of therapist
and I got this type of treatment once,

751
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,463
not like,

752
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,040
oh I've,

753
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,440
this is the kind of thing that
happens to me every six weeks.

754
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:51,441
I get fucking just laid out and fucking
pass out because somebody's devastated

755
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,534
my head.

756
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,180
A lot of camps that
didn't know any better.

757
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,730
They thought that that was tough and
guys up so guys were getting knocked out

758
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:01,000
and training all the time cause they
would go full clip and training.

759
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,100
That was like really
common and a lot of camps,

760
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:03,820
you know,

761
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,900
I don't want to name names,

762
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,980
but yeah,

763
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,700
people um,

764
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,270
they don't,

765
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,870
don't treat brain trauma with
as much respect as they should.

766
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,231
Yeah,

767
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,640
they did a lot of things fucked up.

768
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:17,641
I know they used to not believe that
you should give like a football players

769
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,400
water when they're like an August
generic like to toughen you up.

770
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,270
Like during practice feel like two
and a half hours with no water.

771
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,250
It's like 98 degrees outside.

772
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,530
They thought that was like
the smart thing to do.

773
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,060
They did a lot of stupid shit man.

774
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,500
They did a lot of stupid shit.

775
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,120
There's a lot of people
out there that got a,

776
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,630
their brains ruined because
people didn't understand.

777
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,290
And now,

778
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:38,500
now,

779
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,740
but,

780
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,970
but now it comes down to this.

781
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,863
Now we know.

782
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,620
Now what do we do?

783
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,040
Right.

784
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,550
It's cause it seems like you can fight
in MMA and get out of it without brain

785
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,150
trauma.

786
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,920
I don't know if that's
the case with football.

787
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,790
I really don't.

788
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,480
There's some guys that
clearly have made it out okay.

789
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,990
But there's,

790
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,530
there's guys,

791
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,450
I think there's going to be this wave,

792
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,310
this wave of guys,

793
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,360
you're going to see where it's not just
every once in a while you hear the news

794
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:01,970
of somebody.

795
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,700
It's going to be just dozens
of people that have severe,

796
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,840
you know,

797
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,290
uh,

798
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,820
brain injuries from football.

799
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,260
You get rid of the helmets.

800
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,861
Yeah.

801
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:13,950
That's what they're
saying is just that is,

802
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,380
we'll look,

803
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,020
it's a very bright suggestion
and people think it's silly.

804
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,501
They're like,

805
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,730
what are you talking about?

806
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,750
That's even more dangerous.

807
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:20,740
It's actually not,

808
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:21,370
man.

809
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,730
That was also one of the arguments about
MMA that they should switch to bare

810
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,480
knuckles because you can't punch people.

811
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,270
It was hard.

812
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,410
The only problem is you cut people a lot
easier with your knuckles then he was

813
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,651
still,

814
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,170
a lot of,

815
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,880
a lot of fights would be
stopped because of cuts,

816
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,010
elbows and knuckles cut people the most.

817
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,121
But um,

818
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,490
you can punch them and a lot harder
if you've got a little gloves on.

819
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,540
If you've got padding on,

820
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,201
I mean the,

821
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,210
the helmet is used in
football as a weapon.

822
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,340
It's just like when you talk about the,

823
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:45,911
the,

824
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,121
you know,

825
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,540
the,

826
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,710
the gloves that are dipped,

827
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,544
your hand wrapped.

828
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,400
It's a web,

829
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,510
it's a fucking solid weapon and
he's protected by all these pads.

830
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:54,820
So you can brace it against your,

831
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,361
you know,

832
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,070
your neck and everything and you're
running full into somebody's.

833
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,740
Yeah.

834
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,250
So silly sport man.

835
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,020
It's as a human being.

836
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,171
I mean,

837
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:02,381
look,

838
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,310
it's super and if,

839
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,640
if,

840
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
and if that's how you make your living,

841
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:05,680
you know,

842
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,820
a God bless Ya.

843
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,511
You know what I'm saying?

844
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,344
God bless.

845
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,300
But if you've got another option,

846
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:10,481
man,

847
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:14,680
you might want to not slam your body and
to dude's as hard as you can because it

848
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,750
seems like that Shit's bad
for you and it's pretty it.

849
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,120
There's definitely a good argument
against it because like a fighter like

850
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:23,260
Anderson Silva can go through whole
fights and not get touched me.

851
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:26,620
Just fucks guys up and doesn't even
get hit you and you look at it and go,

852
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:27,250
well,

853
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,770
if you're super talented
and super technical,

854
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:32,790
you know you can fight and
not take that much damage.

855
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,420
He goes through all Anderson's fights,

856
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,250
only the chill son and fight.

857
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,430
Does he ever take like a bunch of punches
and they still looked fine at the end

858
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:40,330
of that and brain?

859
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,230
Why'd you think he's all right?

860
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,190
He's fine,

861
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,730
he's fine.

862
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,690
He's 100% fine.

863
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,560
There's nothing wrong with him,

864
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,730
but he's a,

865
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,221
also,

866
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:47,180
he's delicious.

867
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,360
He's a dishing out way more punches
and more delicious punches he's taking.

868
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,340
He's just fucking people up so hard.

869
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,680
Yeah,

870
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:55,830
he,

871
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,270
he,

872
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,661
he's,

873
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:59,450
I got a totally different
confidence level than them.

874
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,110
He's on a totally different
like striking speed wavelength.

875
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,970
He's just putting Beaton's on dudes,

876
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:05,330
man.

877
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,170
And so because of that,

878
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:07,700
he's not like taking much damage.

879
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,120
But then you see some other
dudes that he's fighting,

880
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,541
you know,

881
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,460
some guys that he's fucking
up and you gotta go,

882
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:13,700
man,

883
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,980
how many more fights like
this can this guy have?

884
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,050
And every fighter has to
sort of decide on their own,

885
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,130
they have to reach this sort of,

886
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,793
it's a tough,

887
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,980
tough thing to come to man.

888
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:23,540
Fuck out his time to dip out.

889
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:23,960
Yeah.

890
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,520
Especially if that's
how you make a living.

891
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
How are you going to pay
your bills and the um,

892
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,281
not to mention,

893
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:28,491
you know,

894
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:29,150
the,

895
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,541
the uh,

896
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,300
the rush they get of
being like in the game,

897
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,990
you know,

898
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,270
being part of like prize fights,

899
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,610
you know,

900
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,960
and you're fucking in an arena and people
are screaming when you ended up like,

901
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:39,271
that's a,

902
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,440
that's a rush you can't
compare to anything you do
in your regular fucking life.

903
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,740
Yeah.

904
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,490
There's nothing like that.

905
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,390
Nothing like that.

906
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,190
That's a hard thing to fucking put down.

907
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,860
It'd be super hard to find
something that can come even close.

908
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,600
You'd have to be like a
fighter pilot or some shit.

909
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,820
They say that that's a
lot of people are saying.

910
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,421
That's what say,

911
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:54,770
oh like you know,

912
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,450
he played in the NFL for like 16 years,

913
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,490
which is pretty much unheard of.

914
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,800
Especially like as like a linebacker
and that like he just was like,

915
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,900
he was depressed about not getting the,

916
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,190
that rush anymore.

917
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,550
You know,

918
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,760
being like in the,

919
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,120
in the Games we'll also,

920
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,570
he I considerable brain damaged.

921
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,130
Yeah,

922
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,610
definitely.

923
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,510
That's the thing man.

924
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,620
They say that brain damage,

925
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:18,110
they say once it fucks
with your pituitary,

926
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,560
your brain's tops producing the
right amount of testosterone,

927
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,860
you get depressed from that.

928
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,271
You know,

929
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:22,650
you get that.

930
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,700
There's a lot of different factors that
can lead to like some pretty severe

931
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,200
depression because of brain trauma.

932
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:27,951
You know,

933
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,560
it's one of the arguments against
testosterone replacement for um,

934
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:31,880
uh,

935
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,960
for fighters actually.

936
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,530
Is the traumatic brain injury a argument?

937
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:37,040
I don't,

938
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,750
I don't totally completely understand it,

939
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,660
but I think they're saying is if you
get hit in the head and now it's like

940
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,230
James,

941
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,100
Tony was an example of it.

942
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,360
You get hit in the head enough and your,

943
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,490
your bond is not going
to produce testosterone.

944
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,363
Same Way.

945
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,460
But then I've heard other doctors say,

946
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,570
and this kind of makes sense to me,

947
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:50,691
well,

948
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:51,350
hey man,

949
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,800
if you can't produce for testosterone
anymore because he got hit in the head so

950
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:55,311
many times,

951
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:57,440
like maybe you should stop
getting hit in the head.

952
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,280
That's a great,

953
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,620
yeah,

954
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,391
that's a great lesson.

955
00:25:59,391 --> 00:25:59,691
You know,

956
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,240
it seems like that's the
thing you should stop first.

957
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,840
Yeah.

958
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Like forget about like trying to do
anything to supplement your testosterone.

959
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,730
You got to stop getting hit in the
head because your brain's going to stop

960
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:11,440
working.

961
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,110
She was like,

962
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,291
yeah,

963
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,990
my times can you hit your car with
a hammer before the engine brakes.

964
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,250
It's like neat.

965
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,500
Nef you know there's a,

966
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,270
there's great footage of James Tony
Sparring like a few years back and he's

967
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:23,481
like,

968
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,280
he's pretty out of shape in it and he
talks shit don't hire time that he's

969
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,731
barring.

970
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah.

971
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,970
And he's like,

972
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,803
he's winded,

973
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,440
but he's just like bitch ass faggot.

974
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,600
Well,

975
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,810
he's sold technically talented James,

976
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:38,811
Tony,

977
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,600
his shoulder rolls and his ability to tie,

978
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,250
figure out where you're punching
and block you and cover you.

979
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,810
He's a brilliant boxer,

980
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:46,470
man.

981
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,880
If you go back to hid the early days,

982
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:48,990
like when he knocked out Michael,

983
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:49,360
none.

984
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,120
[inaudible] James,

985
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,750
Tony's a God damn animal man.

986
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,260
He,

987
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,380
he's a power punch hours dude.

988
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,770
And he became a slick ass boxer.

989
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,930
He just didn't have the same motivation
to training that like some other guys

990
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:04,630
did.

991
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,230
If he trained like Roy Jones Jr train.

992
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,093
Oh my God.

993
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,860
What a fight that was
him and Roy Jones Jr.

994
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,090
That was a fucking great fight.

995
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,450
Yeah.

996
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,430
If he would have trained
late like Roy Jones.

997
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,553
Yeah.

998
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,800
That was too bad.

999
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,281
It's too bad.

1000
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,810
He never sort of recovered from that.

1001
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,980
Did they fight again?

1002
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,000
Did they ever fight again?

1003
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,351
I don't know if,

1004
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:22,230
if a twice,

1005
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,160
I dunno.

1006
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,060
I don't think they did it.

1007
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,893
Why do I feel like,

1008
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,300
why do I feel like they didn't?

1009
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,160
But James Tony was one of the only
like major guys that ever tried,

1010
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:32,940
uh,

1011
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,241
to,

1012
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:33,450
uh,

1013
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,470
get into MMA.

1014
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,401
Oh yeah,

1015
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:35,791
he did.

1016
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah.

1017
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,261
Yeah.

1018
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:37,530
If all Randy coture,

1019
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,320
how did that go then?

1020
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,163
Go so good.

1021
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,370
Randy.

1022
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,210
Go towards just grabbed him
and threw him on the ground.

1023
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,510
Really wrangled them like immediately.

1024
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,760
Was it like a ten second thing?

1025
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,283
Uh,

1026
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,921
yeah it was,

1027
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:50,511
it was a joke.

1028
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,450
Oh Jesus.

1029
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,860
He took him down with a low,

1030
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,200
a low single.

1031
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,290
Got them in an ankle pick.

1032
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,120
I guess they were trying to plan it.

1033
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,340
They were trying to plan the second fight.

1034
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,240
Oh really?

1035
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,571
Yeah,

1036
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,940
but I think James Tony
might be a heavyweight now.

1037
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,193
Big Boy.

1038
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,213
Yeah.

1039
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,500
Well they say that t yeah,

1040
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,360
I think you said they might.

1041
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,380
They say Tony is like
240 pounds and Roy Jones,

1042
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,770
you know,

1043
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,730
is still fighting,

1044
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,960
but he fights it like cruiser weight
sometimes or light heavyweights.

1045
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,520
I'm not going to drop down.

1046
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,000
I've been watching Roy John's fight to it.

1047
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,030
It's depressing as shit.

1048
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,781
I know it's not,

1049
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:25,710
it's not like the old days.

1050
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,050
It's not just like the old days
is getting knocked out a lot.

1051
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,680
Yeah,

1052
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,970
seen him knocked out a couple of times.

1053
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,200
He's a good analyst.

1054
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,400
He's actually a good analyst.

1055
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,530
I don't know why he doesn't just fucking,

1056
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,603
you know,

1057
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,541
he needs money,

1058
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:36,900
man.

1059
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,940
Apparently if you listen to the Internet,

1060
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,580
they say that he's another one of
those dudes that didn't pay his taxes.

1061
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,700
He owes millions of dollars.

1062
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,841
Well,

1063
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:46,241
you know,

1064
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,800
when someone tells you you don't have to
pay or someone's a shitty his financial

1065
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,290
advisor or you think you got
everything covered and you know,

1066
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:53,551
that's,

1067
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,810
this is never gonna go away.

1068
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,820
A lot of those guys don't
have good accountants.

1069
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:57,150
Ma'Am.

1070
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,590
I know you kind of pay your money,

1071
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,340
you got to pay.

1072
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,870
I don't think we should
pay as much as we pay,

1073
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,140
but I think you've got to
fucking pay you gotta pay if get,

1074
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,390
I get a little pissed off when I find out
about a guy that's been living high on

1075
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,280
the hog and it was millions
of dollars in taxes,

1076
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,390
you know,

1077
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,130
cause like we should all contribute.

1078
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,800
We should.

1079
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,300
There's a real,

1080
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,870
I mean,

1081
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,141
you know,

1082
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:16,230
this Obama argument that everybody
is upset at him because he said,

1083
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:16,531
you know,

1084
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:17,700
if you run a small business,

1085
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:18,481
you didn't build that.

1086
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,650
You didn't build the infrastructure.

1087
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,371
He didn't build a street.

1088
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:20,820
That's what he meant.

1089
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,700
Like you didn't build a streets
and everybody was upset by that.

1090
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,713
But in the end,

1091
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,460
a lot of ways that is true.

1092
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,660
I mean we do need to pay,

1093
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,400
everybody needs to pay a
little bit of something.

1094
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,180
It's just there should be some sort of
an accounting should be able to find out

1095
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:33,750
how you're spending.

1096
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,300
The money shouldn't be
so God damn wide open,

1097
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:39,960
we have to give you money and
then you'd do whether if you,

1098
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,070
especially if you're guy like him,

1099
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,460
I feel like how much money
did that guy give them?

1100
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:49,120
Roy Jones over the years and taxes and
millions and millions and millions of

1101
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,270
dollars.

1102
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,040
Millions he should have.

1103
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,450
Like if it gets a certain number
and you should be able to say,

1104
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:55,630
or this is what we did with your money,

1105
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:59,650
we went over it and we use all of your
millions to set up a base in Kosovo.

1106
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:01,180
You actually set up a base over there.

1107
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,420
That'd be really cool and people
would be excited to know that shit.

1108
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,681
What did I really,

1109
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:10,120
would you think about like what
Roy Jones spent stretching of acts?

1110
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,990
It's not done.

1111
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,100
That's going to be your shit.

1112
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,010
Tommy Segura stretch of the highway.

1113
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:15,670
It's not done yet.

1114
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,421
If you look at,

1115
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,110
um,

1116
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,460
you know a guy like Roy Jones,

1117
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,900
how much do you think he made?

1118
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,620
It was,

1119
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,453
it had to be,

1120
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,060
man,

1121
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,360
I want to say 100 million.

1122
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,970
I say that's not that.

1123
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,800
That's probably accurate
probably around that.

1124
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:27,130
Yeah.

1125
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,470
So it out of $100 million,

1126
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,220
let's get super crazy and
say you have to pay 48%,

1127
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,490
cause that's like the highest you can
pay without tax shelters and all that

1128
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,400
stuff that I'm sure a smart person
would figure out or a good accountant.

1129
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,030
So let's say he paid $48 million,

1130
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:43,870
so let's just go nutty.

1131
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:44,620
And B,

1132
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,610
he used that as a number.

1133
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,010
It's crazy.

1134
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,010
48 million supports and army firmware.

1135
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,600
That's like what did he,

1136
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:52,810
what,

1137
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,051
what,

1138
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,790
what country did they overthrow with

1139
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,363
your shit?

1140
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,271
That's your shit.

1141
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:58,750
Roy.

1142
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,690
Roy [inaudible] here with that body shot.

1143
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,020
That's the jet sign.

1144
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,200
Missiles and shit at yours,

1145
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:05,034
right.

1146
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,810
God Damn it really?

1147
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,640
This is twice in one podcast does
powerful Duncan Trussell it doesn't,

1148
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,310
obviously we watch our podcast from
that fucker Hump Day and Dunkin,

1149
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,020
you can just get sent a voicemail.

1150
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,150
I tell your,

1151
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,580

your listeners to come
and see me this weekend,

1153
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,000
but you could,

1154
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,990
you could say where you're playing,

1155
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,500
but don't tell them to come see you.

1156
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,093
Okay.

1157
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,110
You could say if you would

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,670
you know,

1324
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,450
chopping away at it and uh,

1325
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:12,711
and,

1326
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,660
and did it all the time and you could go,

1327
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:15,560
you go on tour,

1328
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,251
you could do,

1329
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,450
we could promote your shows.

1330
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:17,840
Like,

1331
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,410
that's ultimately what I think would be
awesome if everybody came in and were

1332
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,390
promoting your shows,

1333
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,570
were promoting your shows.

1334
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,130
We could all be doing shows like
all across the country of course,

1335
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,330
and use this as like sort of a platform.

1336
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,440
Come here during the week.

1337
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,430
Everybody fucks around.

1338
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,380
Everybody goes and does
their shit on the weekend.

1339
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:33,680
Yeah,

1340
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,513
that'd be awesome.

1341
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,271
But this,

1342
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:35,930
uh,

1343
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,700
you know this using the podcast to,

1344
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,893
you know,

1345
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,610
to work as like a promotional platform
for standup comedy shows the concrete.

1346
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,660
It's fucking thing ever.

1347
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,400
It's awesome.

1348
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,490
It's people really get to know you.

1349
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:48,091
Tommy Button.

1350
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:49,890
They do not like you sit on it tonight.

1351
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:50,990
Show couch and gentleman on

1352
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,770
my podcast is the most fun that I,

1353
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,030
that I have doing anything.

1354
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,120
It's cool that you do yours with your
wife and you actually still like each

1355
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:03,510
other.

1356
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,231
We love it man.

1357
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,064
We love each other.

1358
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,940
We have the most fun.

1359
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,170
If you guys had a lot of fun
poop podcasts I've ever heard,

1360
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,060
it's not just poop guys.

1361
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:12,600
No,

1362
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,650
but you were a guest.

1363
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,780
You were a guest recently
and we got to get you to,

1364
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,650
I wasn't allowed to.

1365
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,483
I would love to.

1366
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm doing a Dunkin's tomorrow,

1367
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,790
but I'll do yours one day next week.

1368
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,630
That'd be actually,

1369
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,730
I'm trying to get a rich roll.

1370
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:24,564
Who's the uh,

1371
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,290
the uh,

1372
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:25,950
Vegan,

1373
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,400
um,

1374
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,970
activist because people have been saying
you got to get like vegans so we get

1375
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:30,150
this.

1376
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,210
But he's a is an athlete and
I got Mac Dan's like also,

1377
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:34,260
which is on Thursday,

1378
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,300
who was another Vegan and
I have good friend of mine,

1379
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,740
he's a Vegan lunch today.

1380
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,270
All right.

1381
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,670
That this is in response to
like vegans who are saying,

1382
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:46,050
well you need to get someone to do a
counterpoint to Robb wolf cause Robb Wolf.

1383
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,800
I had the Paleo Diet Guy Peale,

1384
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,260
the author of the Paleo Solution,

1385
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,730
coffee,

1386
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,090
bacon and eggs for breakfast.

1387
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,451
I was like,

1388
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:54,931
oh my God,

1389
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,764
I want to blow you.

1390
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,440
I was like,

1391
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm eating Kale shakes every
day trying to stay healthy.

1392
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:02,930
And this guy says coffee
bic and an accident.

1393
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,870
But I tried it,

1394
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,730
but I'm telling you it's not correct.

1395
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,910
The year you have this
heavy feeling of like,

1396
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:09,690
it's like,

1397
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,050
Ooh,

1398
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,290
let's take the cigarettes for

1399
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,070
the coffee's supposed to counteract,

1400
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,840
but it can't fuck with Kale shakes.

1401
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:16,270
These kit,

1402
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,300
the my morning Kale shake is just,

1403
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,550
it's either that for me or hemp shakes,

1404
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:23,220
that's all I drink in the morning
and I have lots of energy,

1405
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:24,690
like plenty of energy during the day.

1406
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,763
I think we have,

1407
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,430
I think we have to be careful about how
much stupid shit we put in our bodies.

1408
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,210
And I would rather have no like putting
nothing in there then stupid shit.

1409
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,490
Not that big and an is
necessarily stupid shit.

1410
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,300
It's delicious.

1411
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,050
It's delicious.

1412
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,690
And I think your body processes
fat and all that stuff.

1413
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,890
It can process all those things.

1414
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:41,724
It's all natural,

1415
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,930
but it's not as,

1416
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,530
it doesn't give you the same like clean
feeling as like starting off with a

1417
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,480
vegetable shake.

1418
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,930
Yeah.

1419
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,160
So I'm going to have this guy,

1420
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,083
we're going to talk to heads.

1421
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:51,900
Cool.

1422
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,291
That's cool.

1423
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:52,741
And you know,

1424
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:53,041
he'll,

1425
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:53,220
he,

1426
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,870
cause he wanted to express himself.

1427
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:59,210
He wanted to explain what the fuck is
wrong with all these crazy mediators we

1428
00:37:59,211 --> 00:37:59,500
had.

1429
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,090
We had,

1430
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,010
we had red band on and we also,

1431
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,310
uh,

1432
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,170
if you guys go to your
mom's house podcast,

1433
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,040
if you check out mine,

1434
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,360
we also had Yoshi on tell
the story of when he ate.

1435
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,223
Um,

1436
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:15,510
Joey's banana bread and it's fucking
know she has a bunch of crazy stories.

1437
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:18,440
How about when he accidentally
put acid in his eyeballs?

1438
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:19,110
That story too.

1439
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,251
Yeah,

1440
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:19,891
it's fantastic.

1441
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:20,220
Yeah.

1442
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,070
It was at a friend's house and
the dude had an eye dropper and a,

1443
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:25,770
he didn't know there was acid in the
eye dropper and you needed to clean his

1444
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,410
eyes.

1445
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,980
So he was back in Japan because in Japan,

1446
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,830
eight drops of acid in his eyes,

1447
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,311
which is like,

1448
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,270
it's unheard of.

1449
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:33,940
You know,

1450
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,440
somebody told me the other day,

1451
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:35,691
uh,

1452
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:36,040
that,

1453
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,700
that Joey Diaz did that to Jay more like,

1454
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,310
like at a party really tricked him.

1455
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,480
And in saying that that was acid
and Jay Moore was like freaking out.

1456
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:48,250
Like that's some other comic told me to.

1457
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,150
So I don't know if it's true or not.

1458
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:49,984
As long time ago,

1459
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,980
like a long time ago.

1460
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:51,391
Yeah.

1461
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:52,890
You're going to start another campus.

1462
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:56,070
I don't know if that's a more
is going to be mad at you again.

1463
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,970
Supposedly the story goes that
Jay Moore was really freaking out.

1464
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,360
He was,

1465
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,320
he was fucking with him though.

1466
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,640
Yeah.

1467
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,150
And Jodi has was fucking
with him the whole time.

1468
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:03,810
It wasn't acid,

1469
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,730
but like Jay Moore was freaking
out because he was like,

1470
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,630
what does that really acid?

1471
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:07,464
What does that really,

1472
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:07,861
well,

1473
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:09,450
that's like what we were talking about,

1474
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:09,871
the,

1475
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:10,680
uh,

1476
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:10,951
God,

1477
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,750
I don't remember what the phobia is.

1478
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,730
Were you there that people,

1479
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,643
um,

1480
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,230
I really wish I could remember the word
because I looked up the word that I

1481
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:19,861
thought it was not,

1482
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,150
it's not Ella phrenia,

1483
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,163
Ella phrenia.

1484
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:22,800
Is that right?

1485
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,051
No,

1486
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,000
it isn't that what I said already,

1487
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,880
that that's about the someone's crazy
and you're around them kind of thing,

1488
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,540
that,

1489
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,373
that thing,

1490
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,450
you know?

1491
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:29,830
I mean,

1492
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,061
I mean,

1493
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:34,560
it kind of makes sense that if someone
starts treating you like you're crazy.

1494
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,070
Yeah.

1495
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,760
That makes sense.

1496
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,240
And you're like,

1497
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,481
oh,

1498
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:38,670
and then you start to maybe a dad,

1499
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,040
like you start to act in
the behavior that they've,

1500
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,060
their conditioning you to acton.

1501
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,183
You know what I mean?

1502
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,460
My ex girlfriends.

1503
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,583
Is that what you,

1504
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,130
that's how you control them.

1505
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,220
Jets.

1506
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,951
I'm crazy.

1507
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:52,810
And then grades event and stick
your penis inside of them until it,

1508
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,960
until it doesn't feel good anymore.

1509
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,450
And then blame everything on them.

1510
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,030
And then what else is the move?

1511
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,553
Get Fat.

1512
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,280
That's a good move.

1513
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,180
That's how you get rid of him.

1514
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:04,501
So,

1515
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:04,710
uh,

1516
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,130
anyway,

1517
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,780
I'm going to offer the
Vegan point of view,

1518
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,110
uh,

1519
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,671
because I,

1520
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,121
I think,

1521
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:08,580
uh,

1522
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,710
I shit on vegans enough and uh,

1523
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,760
there's a lot of people up.

1524
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,180
Why can't people just eat me?

1525
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,320
And if you want to eat a little Vegan,

1526
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,250
like I consider Vegan,

1527
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,660
like I'm eating Italian tonight.

1528
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,271
Yeah,

1529
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:19,051
they don't though.

1530
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,490
That's what's fascinating about it.

1531
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,180
It's a,

1532
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,840
it's sort of,

1533
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,520
it's a lifestyle choice.

1534
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:23,911
It's a,

1535
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:24,181
you know,

1536
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:28,890
you're making a decision that you don't
want to do anything that's going to harm

1537
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:29,581
the environment.

1538
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,510
You don't want to do anything that's
gonna make your footprint larger.

1539
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,523
It's kind of,

1540
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,670
I see the point,

1541
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,953
I just,

1542
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,700
someone's going to kill the animals.

1543
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:38,831
The,

1544
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:39,070
the,

1545
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,080
you have to kill them.

1546
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,530
Oh glass.

1547
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,440
You're going to start sterilizing them
at birth and then who the fuck are you to

1548
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,274
play doctor?

1549
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,740
You can just chop off a deer's balls.

1550
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:47,460
You've got to kill him.

1551
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,250
I'm going to bring Fogo de Chao that day.

1552
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,650
I'm just going to eat this today.

1553
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:54,840
Who Little Shit did you son of
a bitch and said don't do that.

1554
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,070
What about the smell of burning meet is
to like a person who's a super hardcore

1555
00:40:59,071 --> 00:40:59,580
Vegan?

1556
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,690
Probably nauseates them.

1557
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,460
I'm sure you know they're
not supposed to have honey.

1558
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,690
Why not?

1559
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,750
Because bees are slave.

1560
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,060
Oh fuck on that man.

1561
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,673
Fuck that shit.

1562
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,120
I got 10 minutes on vegans
in my new a new hour.

1563
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:15,251
Oh,

1564
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:16,650
it's quite be 10 minutes.

1565
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,491
That's great.

1566
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,150
That's just so,

1567
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,970
there's so much silliness we get.

1568
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,250
It's almost like being a Mormon and
vegans like right up there with being a

1569
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:24,084
Mormon.

1570
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:24,660
It's like at the,

1571
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,590
at the end of it you're like,

1572
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:25,771
wait,

1573
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:25,921
wait,

1574
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:26,051
wait.

1575
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:26,171
You wait.

1576
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:26,461
And what?

1577
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:27,294
Bees.

1578
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,841
Bees.

1579
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:28,710
Bees are slaves.

1580
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,150
It seems so extreme.

1581
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:30,480
Men.

1582
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,500
And I saw a guy who like trying to
encourage someone from to Vegan.

1583
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:34,220
Hey,

1584
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,810
don't worry about that man.

1585
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,820
Don't let honey stopped
you from being a Vegan.

1586
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,031
I mean,

1587
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:38,211
Hey,

1588
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:38,750
I don't,

1589
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,920
I don't use it for,

1590
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,000
don't let that stop you.

1591
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,511
Oh,

1592
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,440
I don't use it.

1593
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I am super ultra perfect via man accused
the honey that honey man means like

1594
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:50,180
bees have souls,

1595
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:51,014
man.

1596
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,340
Like why put him to work?

1597
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,873
Why?

1598
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,670
Why steal their work,

1599
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:56,450
man?

1600
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:56,781
I mean,

1601
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,510
how's that any different than what she
accused Carlos Mincey of doing that.

1602
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,700
Okay.

1603
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,980
He's just taking the
honey from these beans.

1604
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,980
Shut your fucking stupid face.

1605
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,000
His stupid fucking asshole.

1606
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,990
You're telling me that we can't
figure out honey and it's delicious.

1607
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Honey is awesome.

1608
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,690
We don't have to make it.

1609
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,680
These dumb cunt insects make it.

1610
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,140
Can we steal it from them?

1611
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,420
The way we steal it from
there was with smoke,

1612
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,810
these fucking stupid ass holes and
then they will blow smoke on them.

1613
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,770
Then you scoop them up with a kitty litter
shovel and you put them in a box and

1614
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:31,430
you close the stupid box and they buzz
around for a little while and then you

1615
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:36,050
take all their fucking honey and you
hack off those little babies that are

1616
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:36,681
growing in there.

1617
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:38,170
You get the fuck out of here.

1618
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,940
This little embryos that are
in there cut all that shit out.

1619
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,810
That's not necessary.

1620
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,390
Just kept me to that
honey spot is bare likes.

1621
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,190
Here's the hive.

1622
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,680
Is all the embryos and the honey
altogether in the same thing?

1623
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,520
I think so.

1624
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,600
I don't know cause that was
always fascinating when I
was a kid and I would find

1625
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,230
a beehive on the ground that you
do that and like open them up.

1626
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,980
Yeah.

1627
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,671
How weird was that?

1628
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:00,260
When you see them in the little shuttle,

1629
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,700
the little fucking pop.

1630
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,330
They mean they're just like the alien.

1631
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,440
They're just really tired.

1632
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,880
They're miniature aliens.

1633
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,450
Yeah.

1634
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,180
Especially if you watch
them fuck up other insects.

1635
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,770
Queen especially wasps.

1636
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,430
Yeah.

1637
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,430
There's a crazy documentary where it
details this one wasp attack where they

1638
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,540
came in and killed these honeybees
and it was an enormous wasp.

1639
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,960
They were way bigger than the honeybees
and it just comes in and just starts

1640
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:28,520
cutting the heads off the honeybees

1641
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,311
and these,

1642
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,080
this one swarm,

1643
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,290
this like thousand fucking honeybee colony
was killed by like 30 of these wasps.

1644
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,630
And it is fucking tough to watch man.

1645
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,200
These,

1646
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,891
I mean he's just like,

1647
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:43,201
what,

1648
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:45,020
what would we do if these
things were our size?

1649
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,501
Oh man,

1650
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,670
he wouldn't do Jack Shit.

1651
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,451
I had wasp,

1652
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:47,810
I got up,

1653
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,800
I walked into a wasp nest one time like
in Berwyn was and they just fucking,

1654
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,630
it stayed in my arm.

1655
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,920
Like I was like fucking yes.

1656
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:55,431
Stabbing.

1657
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:56,120
Yeah.

1658
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,870
And they,

1659
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,500
um,

1660
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,760
the thing about bees too,

1661
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,710
I found out that the queen has a stinger,

1662
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,371
you know,

1663
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,630
the Queen Bee has a stinger,

1664
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:05,120
but she only uses it to kill Queens.

1665
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,111
Oh really?

1666
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:06,944
Yeah.

1667
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,720
They use it to kill virgin queens.

1668
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:10,040
They use it when you,

1669
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,510
when you find a new queen,

1670
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:14,150
like when someone's getting together
and putting together a new queen.

1671
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,270
Yeah.

1672
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,080
You got to Jack that bitch or she'll come
to take your spot because it can only

1673
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:19,790
be like one queen the nest.

1674
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,340
So they don't use it just on,

1675
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,150
um,

1676
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,590
on Queens when they're out,

1677
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,840
they'll fuck up queen embryos.

1678
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,741
They'll fuck up.

1679
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:28,130
What do they,

1680
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,850
what are they called?

1681
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:29,810
What does it feed is,

1682
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,431
what is the,

1683
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:34,080
I don't know the term for an insect
fetus and the idea of Brian is it,

1684
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,630
it's not an embryo rather than
write whatever the fuck it is.

1685
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:36,751
Uh,

1686
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:36,980
the,

1687
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,090
uh,

1688
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,230
the infant thing inside the honeycomb,

1689
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:44,250
they stabbed him in the side and that's
how they know when they've been attacked

1690
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,210
by another queen.

1691
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:47,550
Like she knows there's
a hooker in that box.

1692
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,000
She's going to go,

1693
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,550
so just stabs it with her ass.

1694
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,010
And so that's what they're hooked.

1695
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:53,851
Their stingers for.

1696
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:54,331
Their stingers,

1697
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:55,740
not a stinger that injects venom.

1698
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,620
It's just a sore sore to kill the babies.

1699
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:01,830
We're so lucky.

1700
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,140
We're so lucky.

1701
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,570
They're little,

1702
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,470
those huge evil fucking cons.

1703
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,390
Um,

1704
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,291
yeah,

1705
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,770
it's fucking Fuck B's.

1706
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,400
We need to figure out a way to
get honey through little robots,

1707
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,680
little tiny ass robot bees.

1708
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,710
We should make drones that
look like bees make honey.

1709
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,850
And how about we make drones and just
look like B's except they're way stronger

1710
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:27,380
and harder and they come in and fuck all
the bees in front of their boyfriends.

1711
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,500
Imagine it'd be like robot bees
with giant robot be dicks like dog,

1712
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,820
like a steaming dog size.

1713
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:33,900
Fuck.

1714
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,261
Well,

1715
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:34,890
and just,

1716
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,440
we would have to have shotguns
and fly swatters everywhere.

1717
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:37,800
It just,

1718
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,190
yeah.

1719
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,470
Big Mace fly.

1720
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,860
Swatters if they did fab you just
like goes for through your back.

1721
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,523
You'd be fucked.

1722
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:45,460
I need,

1723
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:45,790
yeah.

1724
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,270
Size of a one the size of
a softball would kill you.

1725
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:48,900
Oh yeah.

1726
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,050
Just fuck your day up.

1727
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,251
Yeah.

1728
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:50,520
Yeah.

1729
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,200
I mean imagine just some value from,

1730
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:52,600
from the,

1731
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,540
from the fucking eat you alive.

1732
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,770
Oh shit man.

1733
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,000
Make babies in your body.

1734
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,720
That's a movie.

1735
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,790
I want to fucking see
that movie Tommy bonds.

1736
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,480
You're the best.

1737
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,141
Thanks for having me.

1738
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,210
Thanks for me on anytime,

1739
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:02,431
man.

1740
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:03,300
I was glad it was glad to do it.

1741
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,340
I want to and we got to do it.

1742
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:05,630
I mean,

1743
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,060
and in a nonsexual way.

1744
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,491
Um,

1745
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:09,324
I was thinking,

1746
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:09,811
man,

1747
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,250
when was the last time we
did a podcast with Tom?

1748
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:11,670
He funds,

1749
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,050
I wouldn't have you on soon.

1750
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,370
And I also want to come back,

1751
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,270
uh,

1752
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,500
cause I have a new album coming out.

1753
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,221
When are you,

1754
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:17,670
um,

1755
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,660
what are you doing tomorrow night?

1756
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,190
Tomorrow night.

1757
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,790
What is tomorrow?

1758
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,450
Wednesday night chilling.

1759
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,760
You want to do the Ice House with us?

1760
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,980
Sure done ladies and gentlemen.

1761
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,581
So now,

1762
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:27,750
tomorrow night at the Ice House,

1763
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,850
it is Joey Diaz.

1764
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,100
It is Brian Callin.

1765
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,270
It is Duncan Trussell and
it's Tommy motherfucking
buns and I believe Brian Read

1766
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,060
Ben will be coming down to actually smoke
the peace pipe with Duncan Trussell.

1767
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,730
It should be an epic desk squad event,

1768
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,564
Ladies and gentlemen.

1769
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,290
So come on down and if you want to
look fashionable when you're there,

1770
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,030
you're going to want to buy eight death
squad team shirt and you go to desk,

1771
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:52,321
quad,

1772
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:53,220
Dat TV.

1773
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,031
And what you said,

1774
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:54,864
what does this money go to?

1775
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,411
Well,

1776
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,950
for money all goes to support
the desk squad podcast network,

1777
00:46:58,951 --> 00:46:59,880
which is on iTunes.

1778
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:00,714
If you go,

1779
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,580
there's a bunch of
different podcasts there.

1780
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,220
There is the icehouse chronicles
that we do at the Ice House,

1781
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,210
which is one of my favorite podcasts
of all time because it's us.

1782
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,890
It's all of like the,

1783
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:13,530
the guys who are in town
that combined to do shows.

1784
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,510
Doug Stan hope has been on Tom Rhodes,

1785
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:15,931
I'm sorry,

1786
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:16,680
I was on it trying to,

1787
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,320
girl has been on a Ian Edwards,

1788
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:19,770
so it'd be me.

1789
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,311
So many,

1790
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,400
so many funny comedians and
of course Ari and Joey and,

1791
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,471
and we,

1792
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:25,500
we put on these,

1793
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:25,721
uh,

1794
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:26,521
once a week,

1795
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:27,570
twice a week sometimes.

1796
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:30,670
And it's like really of the
most fun shit that we do.

1797
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,890
We get to fuck around and we get to
loosen up before we go on stage and make a

1798
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:37,260
podcast at the same time and,

1799
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:37,830
and,

1800
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,980
and make each other laugh.

1801
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,920
And then we've been doing these shows
at the ice house that are like literally

1802
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,230
some of the funniest shows
that I've ever done in my life.

1803
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,090
And the,

1804
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,810
the club couldn't have been cooler.

1805
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:47,330
It's,

1806
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,650
it couldn't be a more
positive Karma space.

1807
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,790
You know the ice house has been around
since like the 1961 or something crazy

1808
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,600
like that.

1809
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,040
It's an old fucking club and it just the,

1810
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,040
you mean you stand in the room?

1811
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,491
The,

1812
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:00,661
the,

1813
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:00,970
the,

1814
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:01,840
the comedy room.

1815
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,200
Like when the doors are closed and
the lights are off and that place is,

1816
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,733
it's buzzing.

1817
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,350
It's got energy for like 50 fucking
years of comedy in that place.

1818
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:11,631
That's,

1819
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:12,041
that's a,

1820
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,390
that's an unusual place.

1821
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:13,660
Yeah.

1822
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,320
And I love that fucking
second stage room too.

1823
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,230
They're both awesome.

1824
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:17,981
The little rooms.

1825
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:18,700
Awesome.

1826
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,860
The little room might be the
best little room in the country.

1827
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,220
Yeah.

1828
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,510
It's super small.

1829
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:23,380
It's tight knit,

1830
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:24,580
but they're all like right there.

1831
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:25,570
And his two tiers,

1832
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,430
which is really rare in a small room.

1833
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,840
That little room is amazing.

1834
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:31,660
And it's might be one of the best
rooms ever for coming up with new shit.

1835
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,390
For just fucking around and
coming up with new material.

1836
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,080
Absolutely.

1837
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,220

00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,150

1842
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,800

dentist and all my medicine,

1844
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,540

like this migraine or something going

1845
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:49,870

1846

1881
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,353

1882
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,191
and it's,

1883
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:58,000
um,

1884
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,720
it's sold out,

1885
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,770
so go fuck yourself.

1886
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:00,401
So,

1887
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:00,670
uh,

1888
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,950
unless you're coming and then I
didn't have you see or anything that,

1889
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,211

1891
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:04,571
no.

1892
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:04,891
It's just,

1893
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:05,680
just in and out.

1894
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:05,831
Yeah,

1895
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:06,670
just one.

1896
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,181
And it's,

1897
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:07,900
um,

1898
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,020
I just decided to just drop into a,

1899
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,820
I never get down to Sacramento,

1900
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,061
you know,

1901
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:13,894
it's a,

1902
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,621
it's a cool city,

1903
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:15,880
but I'm hardly ever there.

1904
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:16,961
And,

1905
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,650
uh,

1906
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,270
I don't remember what
the name of the places,

1907
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,310
I think that Chris Theater,

1908
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,360
I think the crest theater I should,

1909
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,220
it's really nice theater.

1910
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,510
What we'll find out.

1911
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,260
Um,

1912
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,190
and then next week is the
week after that is Toronto.

1913
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,840
I met Massey Hall and I
understand that there's a,

1914
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,630
some ridiculous scalping going on and
that people are telling me that the

1915
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:40,220
tickets are like 300 bucks.

1916
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,250
I ate something weird the
other day about the Vegas.

1917
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,020
One of your shows that was canceled.

1918
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,440
Yeah.

1919
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,520
And they charge like ridiculous
amount of money extra for some reason.

1920
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:50,540
And then when they took,

1921
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:50,750
uh,

1922
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,260
when the,

1923
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,250
when the show got canceled,

1924
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:52,920
they dev,

1925
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,500
they didn't get the whole amount back.

1926
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,310
Really?

1927
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,210
What'd you hear this?

1928
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,500
Fuck you told me this.

1929
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,461
Somebody in Columbus,

1930
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:58,881
Ohio.

1931
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,730
It was a one of the guys from,

1932
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:04,010
so there's like a cancellation
fee or something like that.

1933
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,330
Even though it wasn't there,

1934
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,410
they didn't cancel,

1935
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:06,680
right.

1936
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,610
The venue cancer.

1937
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,610
And they say it was like
something like this guy's like,

1938
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:11,780
add a lot of mine.

1939
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,130
I need to find out what the,

1940
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,320
that might be not correct or correct.

1941
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,861
I don't know.

1942
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:16,694
We'll have to find out.

1943
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,151
But,

1944
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:17,301
uh,

1945
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:17,601
anyway,

1946
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:17,931
folks,

1947
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:18,710
listen,

1948
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,830
thank you very much for,

1949
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:20,631
for everything.

1950
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:24,740
You guys are the fucking coolest human
beings we've ever come in contact with.

1951
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,341
You know,

1952
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:25,551
we,

1953
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:26,870
we talk about it all the time.

1954
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,260
I mean,

1955
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,040
uh,

1956
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,310
Aubrey talks about it when he
deals with customers at on it and,

1957
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:31,650
uh,

1958
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,950
we talk about it when,

1959
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:36,710
when we do these comedy shows
where we're lucky as fuck man,

1960
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,010
and just whatever we're sending out there,

1961
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,390
the fact that you guys are picking it
up in such a positive way and responding

1962
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:45,440
in such a positive way.

1963
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,041
I mean,

1964
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,050
there's no way to say this
without sounding Super Corny,

1965
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:50,300
but it's enriched the fuck
out of all of our lives.

1966
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:55,301
It's made us feel like
we're really connected to
something that can really help

1967
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:57,080
and change the way people feel and don't,

1968
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,750
don't think we think that is a,

1969
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,190
in any small way.

1970
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,760
Um,

1971
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,593
uh,

1972
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,490
I did just don't think that
we ever take it for granted.

1973
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,370
It's a,

1974
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:08,840
I don't,

1975
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,760
it's a weird thing to talk
about it because it's,

1976
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:11,594
um,

1977
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:11,890
the,

1978
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,310
the whole,

1979
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:12,540
it's,

1980
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:12,790
it's a,

1981
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,860
it's a very strange situation
to find yourself in it when,

1982
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:16,161
you know,

1983
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:20,060
we just started doing this podcast
just fucking around and you know,

1984
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:22,460
thinking we're just going to talk shit
and put on the Internet and maybe people

1985
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:23,120
would giggle.

1986
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,560
And then having people come up to me,

1987
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,180
like everywhere I go telling me now I've,

1988
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:27,260
I've lost 50 pounds.

1989
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:28,340
I started doing Jujitsu,

1990
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:29,061
I changed my life,

1991
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:30,210
started reading the war of art.

1992
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,700
I didn't shoot myself.

1993
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:32,720
We hear that all the time.

1994
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,040
That's the scary one.

1995
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,090
That's one of the scary ones.

1996
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,571
And you know,

1997
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,230
people that said they,

1998
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,070
they don't have anybody like us near them.

1999
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,870
And it's not that they
don't think like us,

2000
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:43,070
they think just like us.

2001
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,431
They,

2002
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:43,671
they're,

2003
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,690
they're free thinkers.

2004
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:45,530
They're open minded,

2005
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:46,760
they're trying to be nice to people.

2006
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,720
It's just sometimes we are
defined by our environment,

2007
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,071
but no long,

2008
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:52,904
you fucks.

2009
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,920
Now we're all connected
by this crazy thing.

2010
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,611
And,

2011
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:55,820
uh,

2012
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,370
this podcast is a big part of it for us,

2013
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,710
and we know that it's a
big part of it for you,

2014
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:03,470
and we don't take that for granted in
any way and we love the fuck out of you

2015
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,070

2016
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:04,881

Thanks for all the positive vibes,

2018
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:06,831

2019
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:07,664

2020

And I'll see you guys on Thursday.

2021

2023
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:19,630
okay.
