1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,360
They never,
I don't know much about Moose there.

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:05,070
Awesome.
So fucking big.

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,940
Such a giant animal to one live boom.
Live with James Hetfield.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,620
How I Sarah do an awesome friend of Jim 
is a friend of mine.

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,690
So awesome to hear.
So yeah.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,830
So you're in.
Hey Man,

7
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:20,700
I listened to your new Shit in the gym 
today and you know,

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,900
what's amazing about it?
You guys still fucking rock hard,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,310
you know,
you haven't.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,040
I love aerosmith.
That was a huge aerosmith fan when I was

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,840
a kid,
but somewhere along the line they became

12
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,770
a ballot van somewhere along the line I 
started doing movies for music,

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,940
for mood,
music,

14
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,750
for movies that appeal to like a 
adolescent teenage girls.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,070
You know,
like something happened.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,400
Yeah,

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,250
I got,
you know.

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,550
And then other people start writing your
songs.

19
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,010
That's,
that's I think the,

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,930
the ultimate kind of uh,
uh,

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,180
not given up,
but you've,

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,710
you've,
you've lost your way.

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,990
Yeah.
But I wanted to talk to you about like 

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,230
there's a transition that very 
successful people make and either they 

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:03,660
make it or they don't.
And the,

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,670
the,
the transition is to go from being 

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,540
hungry and filled with all this anxious 
to being like stupid,

28
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:13,890
wealthy and famous,
but still keeping your art relevant.

29
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,570
Like how do you do that?

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,890
Uh,
we're super competitive.

31
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:23,891
People were really perfectionists and we
hate to let each other down.

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,520
Uh,
there is a,

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,270
there's always a better riff coming.
There's always a better album.

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,930
Uh,
maybe there's the never satisfied part 

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,240
to us that will keep us going til we 
die.

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,760
You know,
there's always the ultimate lyric that's

37
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,880
going to connect to everyone in the 
world or something.

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,470
There is always a better something that 
we haven't got yet.

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,550
So is that mindset,
is that you.

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,270
I guess in the beginning you just want 
to do it right?

41
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,570
You want to be a successful band?
Do you want to make it,

42
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:57,140
you're young,
you're filled with adjuncts,

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,100
but your music as a same sort of 
intensity to it.

44
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,840
Like today in the gym,
I got in there,

45
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,370
I hadn't listened to your new album or 
all.

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,070
I fucking cranked it up to nine and I 
just said,

47
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:11,071
let's go.
And I turned it on and right from the 

48
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,071
jump I was like,
whoa.

49
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:14,610
Like there's something about a good 
fucking hard rock album that just gets 

50
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,040
you pumped up and you guys are 100 
percent a plus.

51
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,120
Succeeded with this one.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,430
Awesome to hear.
Well that's,

53
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,810
that's why we do it too.
We write music,

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
we write music,
we record music that we want to hear 

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,370
because we're not hearing it out there 
sometimes.

56
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:32,250
So.
And that's how it's been since day one.

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,020
And uh,
you know,

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,350
as you were were pretty honest in our 
music too.

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,500
So I love the fact that from album one 
to here we're doing it our way and we're

60
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:48,501
writing songs for ourselves and that 
there's an honesty that has to be in it 

61
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,220
or people

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,220
can see.
People can see that shit on.

63
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,120
Yeah.
They're like little animals.

64
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,540
They smell it,
right,

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,910
don't they?
And they,

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,400
they smell,

67
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,710
they smell it the whole deal.
Yeah.

68
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:07,711
It's just,
it's refreshing to see a band that's 

69
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,230
been at it for a long time that's super 
successful.

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,690
That still goes after it.
Yeah.

71
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,691
The thing that,
the thing that bugs me a lot is when 

72
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:15,691
people say,
you know,

73
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,890
okay,
now that you're now that you're sober or

74
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:22,891
now that you're matured now all this and
you've worked out all your inner demons 

75
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:28,351
and things like that,
that your music's going to be all soft 

76
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,260
and flowery and I tell Ya,
if,

77
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,470
if I could exercise all those demons I 
would have and it,

78
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,700
but it just,
it's something you,

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,440
you embrace.
It's a part of me and I get to celebrate

80
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,990
it in my music.
I get to communicate it.

81
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:48,991
I get to use it as a therapy to help my 
own insanity and other people do too.

82
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,870
So when you get those like minded people
together in a place and play live music 

83
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:58,210
does something to people like you in the
gym.

84
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,870
I get to watch people at our shows 
transform from God.

85
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:09,160
I just took my tie off or I still have 
my frigging briefcase,

86
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,770
you know,
like handcuffed to me.

87
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,340
I want out of this and I get to let 
loose and I get to see these people 

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,650
transform and s and watch music.
Do stuff to them.

89
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,420
Yeah,
transforms the right word,

90
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,650
right,
because it does,

91
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,330
it's almost like music,
it,

92
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I think there's an element of music that
doesn't get discussed that it does have 

93
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,241
some sort of an effect on the body.
Like there's like when you hear a good 

94
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,260
song and you're in your Cannula,
so it's like a drug.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,860
I mean,
it is,

96
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,540
it's like taking,
taking a shot of this caveman nitrile is

97
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,030
more powerful than that really,
because it's instantaneous,

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,400
you know,
plenty of seating tickets.

99
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,540
Plenty.
Well that's the best place like for Lars

100
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,000
and I to listen to the music when we're 
putting it together,

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,160
you know,
does it make the car test?

102
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,190
You know that,
that because you're yourself in your 

103
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,190
car,
if no one else is in there,

104
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,680
uh,
you're,

105
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:06,370
you get to celebrate and listen and just
go frigging nuts in your car.

106
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,590
And that's the past,
the car test,

107
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:13,591
you know,
that's got to be where most people 

108
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:13,591
listened to most of their music these 
days with all the commuting people do.

109
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Especially here in la.
It's a ridiculous place as where you 

110
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,650
live in these totally.
We save people from road rage,

111
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,190
the kids just headbang people ramping it
up.

112
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,770
Well,
there's not too much shooting people in 

113
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,251
cars anymore.
It was going on for awhile in the 

114
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:32,251
nineties.
And as Trinity.

115
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,730
What do you live these days?
I live in Vail,

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,770
Colorado.
Oh no shit man.

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,270
Wow.
That's Kinda cool.

118
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,550
Is very cool.
It's quiet.

119
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,860
No frigging traffic.
Uh,

120
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,460
and especially now.
Super quiet snow.

121
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,980
A snow dose does something to calm you 
down a little bit.

122
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,830
I agree with that.
I remember when I was a kid in Boston,

123
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,690
there was those days when it would just 
snow hard.

124
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,000
He'd go outside and you experienced 
quiet like it.

125
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,250
Never heard it before.
Right.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,670
It's like everything filtered by that 
snow.

127
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,590
Well,
I like,

128
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,220
you know,
there's a,

129
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,230
there's a,
there's a lone wolf part of me that I,

130
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,650
I may,
maybe you can relate to,

131
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,850
but I like being by myself,
but I also like,

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,960
I need people to,
to connect with as well.

133
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,390
But when I get out,
uh,

134
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,440
you know,
living in Vail,

135
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,200
moving from California to Colorado was 
a,

136
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,800
was a great thing for me.
I feel really ugh.

137
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,610
I feel a part of nature there.
Um,

138
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,220
and you don't want to be inside there.
There's something about it.

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,200
You just want to be outside all the 
time.

140
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,450
What's so beautiful?
Yeah.

141
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,340
I'm going to Colorado this weekend.
[inaudible]

142
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:36,980
cool.
Yeah,

143
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,190
it's fucking stunning up there.
This is something about Colorado.

144
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,210
Those mountains are just the best 
natural artwork like you could ever look

145
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,350
at.
Yeah,

146
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:50,351
no doubt.
We get to look at the Gore range right 

147
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,601
out our mountain and I've drank plenty 
of coors lights in my life and that's 

148
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:53,960
the one on the can like,
wow.

149
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,580
I'm looking at it and uh,
lots of fourteeners there.

150
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,910
Lots of great,
uh,

151
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,650
you know,
lots of great snowmobiling,

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,130
rafting,
paddleboard and you name it.

153
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,950
It's a fourteener.
A 14,000

154
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,900
feet.
Pete peaks.

155
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,790
Oh,
14,000

156
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,550
feet.
The people who are in the climate,

157
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,970
those crazy peaks.
Yeah.

158
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,200
Or hunting,
you know,

159
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,760
what made you move out there?
Like,

160
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,420
what was the,
did you go there and visit first or just

161
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,570
decided you needed a separate from the 
hive and.

162
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:28,571
Yeah,
there's probably a multitude of things 

163
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:28,910
that made it happen.

164
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,300
My wife grew up there.
She was born in Argentina,

165
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,790
they moved to Vail,
she went to elementary school there,

166
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,590
you know,
we were going to Tahoe a lot to do 

167
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:40,590
skiing and stuff like that.
And she said,

168
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,380
you gotta we gotta go to Vale,
this is,

169
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
this is not snow,
will go to Vail and feel snow.

170
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,100
And we went there a few times and I 
loved it.

171
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,570
Now I'm not a huge skier,
but I can ski and have fun doing it.

172
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,760
My kids love it.
Um,

173
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,270
and so that my,
my wife turns into a kid when we go 

174
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,790
there,
which I kind of like,

175
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,510
it's a little more like me,
you know,

176
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,370
she can be a little,
you know,

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,220
a little too on point and a little,
you know,

178
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,630
uh,
she's,

179
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,590
she's,
um,

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,250
she loosens up and she becomes young 
again there.

181
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,790
Um,
so there's that kind of got sick of the 

182
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,310
bay area,
the attitudes of people.

183
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,020
They're a little bit.
I was,

184
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,590
you know,
they talk about how diverse they are and

185
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,570
things like that and you know,
it's fine if you're diverse like them,

186
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,740
you know,
but,

187
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,010
you know,
showing up with a deer on the bumper 

188
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,220
doesn't fly in Marin county,
you know.

189
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,810
Uh,
my,

190
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,110
my,
my form of eating organic doesn't vibe 

191
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,110
with theirs,
you know.

192
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,470
Did you,
do you have issues with that?

193
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,490
Like with the people you lived with up 
in Marin county with hunting?

194
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,130
Or was it just something you felt?
Yeah,

195
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,850
you know,
it's something I felt,

196
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,180
uh,
I probably made it up in my head a 

197
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,180
little bit.
Yeah,

198
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,750
because I'm pretty good at that.
Pretty creative and I can start fights 

199
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,910
with myself in my head all the time.
A lot of people get.

200
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,230
Oh yeah,
but,

201
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,480
but there was,
there was just a,

202
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,290
I don't know,
I felt that there was an elitist 

203
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,231
attitude there that if you weren't there
way politically their way,

204
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,290
uh,
you know,

205
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,140
environmentally all of that,
that uh,

206
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,660
you know,
you were looked down upon.

207
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,670
I think in Colorado everyone is very 
natural.

208
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,650
People are not playing some game,
they're not posturing,

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
you know,
they're very into,

210
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,710
oh,
you like doing that?

211
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,210
Cool.
How's that go?

212
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,130
How you doing with that?
You know,

213
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,600
and they're,
they're,

214
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,650
they're less,
they're less obsessed with stopping what

215
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:54,651
you're doing and more enjoying what 
they're doing.

216
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,600
You know?
That's interesting.

217
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,360
That's an interesting way to look at it.
I love the bay area,

218
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,340
but I've always felt like.
I think you nailed it.

219
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,610
The Bay area,
they love diversity as long as you're 

220
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:07,610
diverse.
The way they're diverse.

221
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,470
It's um,
it's so tech oriented,

222
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,300
it's so absorbed with one aspect of 
society,

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,600
technology and cell phones and the 
Internet and electric cars and it's so 

224
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,240
locked into that one sort of mode of 
being that I think a guy like you goes 

225
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,340
out there and shoot an elk or something 
like that.

226
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,840
It's probably like a little creepy to 
them.

227
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,310
Well,
I,

228
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,390
I just think I feel more at home in the 
midwest or the mountains or something.

229
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I mean,
I love the ocean and I love the bay 

230
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:39,700
area.
I love what it's got to offer,

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,550
but there's just a,
just an attitude that it was,

232
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,180
uh,
it,

233
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,990
it wasn't healthy for me starting to 
feel like,

234
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:52,991
uh,
I was just fighting all the time and I 

235
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:52,991
just had to

236
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:53,770
get out of my own head.
So Colorado does it for me.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,490
You were doing that show,
the hunt that,

238
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,500
uh,
that show that,

239
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,530
what is it on history channel or 
something like that where it was all 

240
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:03,820
about a grizzly bear hunting.
You were doing the narration for that.

241
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,220
Yeah.
And you,

242
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,380
I saw this crazy blow back because of 
that where there was people were they 

243
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,210
wanted a boycott at music festival that 
you guys were on and,

244
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,780
and there was photos of another guy who 
wasn't you or they're getting circled 

245
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,530
around it.
We're saying it was you.

246
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,110
They killed a grizzly bear and they were
saying,

247
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,570
we have to ban this.
This is heartless.

248
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,820
Was very strange.
Like what was your reaction to all that?

249
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,140
I,
I kinda just took it as,

250
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:36,141
okay,
that's how it's been for me in the bay 

251
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:36,141
area.
You know,

252
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,070
people don't understand it and I mean,
it's just like with anything,

253
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,100
you know,
I don't think they understand that 

254
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,760
someone can be,
is passionate about something else,

255
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,720
as,
as passionate as they are about what 

256
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:53,720
they are passionate about,
you know?

257
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,820
So if you're as a passionate about 
something,

258
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,840
there's someone who's the opposite and 
that's okay.

259
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,420
You can get along,
you can talk about it.

260
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,340
No one's right,
no one's wrong.

261
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,370
This is my life.
I like to live in it this way.

262
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,760
You like living your life that way.
I totally get it,

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,110
but we can coexist in this and let's 
really be diverse,

264
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,280
you know,
for me going out,

265
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,560
whether it's planning my own vegetables,
having my own beehives,

266
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,070
getting our own honey,
a,

267
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,580
harvesting my own meat on the ranch.

268
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,300
That's what I love doing.
I love sustaining my family with as 

269
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,750
organic as possible.
And uh,

270
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,040
you know,
I,

271
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I,
I respect people that don't want the 

272
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,650
blood.
They don't want all that scene.

273
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,400
They would rather see their meat or 
whatever it is,

274
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:55,150
show up in a nice cellophane package and
it's handed to them.

275
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,130
They don't want to know how it got 
there.

276
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,330
I I respect that my kids are like that.
They don't want to see it going on,

277
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,430
but I want to be as close to the earth.
I want to be as part of it as possible.

278
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,120
I want to be part of every bit of it and
respect it.

279
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Yeah.
I get that sentiment and I always found 

280
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,360
it strange how many people get upset at 
what you do,

281
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:21,361
but meanwhile they're eating meat.
I mean the San Francisco is filled with 

282
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:21,760
restaurants that are serving meat.
Everywhere you go,

283
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,060
every single store you pass by has meat 
in it and to focus on you for going out 

284
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,260
and hunting is always a little weird.

285
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,130
Well,
I guess I'm more old school.

286
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,210
I don't know.
Whatever it is.

287
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:38,211
You know,
I think the bay area prides itself and 

288
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm glad there is a place that prides 
itself on being progressive,

289
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,790
very moving forward.
Hey,

290
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,870
we're creating the future here and I 
love the convenience and stuff of that,

291
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,210
but then there's a part of me that just 
maybe is like frontier style.

292
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:54,480
I just love that.
I would rather be simple.

293
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,210
Mm,

294
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,590
well,
I think it's also probably you're 

295
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,001
performing in front of fucking hundreds 
of thousands of people all the time and 

296
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:02,460
he just like Jesus Christ,
you need a balance.

297
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,410
I mean,
you need some sort of an opposite end of

298
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,570
the scale just to weigh things out.

299
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,430
Very true,
very true.

300
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,270
Uh,
you know,

301
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,610
what about me?
I want me time,

302
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,720
you know,
chill time,

303
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,750
quit pulling me all these different ways
and stuff.

304
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,430
Uh,
certainly not complaining.

305
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:20,460
That's what I choose to do.
But I also choose this too.

306
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,790
Well,
that's where a vail completely makes 

307
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:25,790
sense.
So how long have you been raising bees?

308
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,640
Probably only,
maybe four years.

309
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,350
What,
how'd you get started in that?

310
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:34,380
How do you start raising bees?
Start with one.

311
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,620
We'll actually start with to really 
know,

312
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,930
um,
they're not like rabbits,

313
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,140
but they do produce quite quickly,
you know?

314
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,600
Uh,
my dad raised bees,

315
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,010
uh,
I just,

316
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,830
we always saw boxes out in the corner of
the house.

317
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,740
We grew up in la here,
you know,

318
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,620
the weather's so great.
So there's lots of activity.

319
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,050
That's the bummer about being in Vale 
now.

320
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,530
Not a lot of,
not a lot of action going on.

321
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,460
It's too high,
it's too cold and you know,

322
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,630
certain vegetables grow there but not a 
lot.

323
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,400
But uh,
in California,

324
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,350
the ranch love,
I love it.

325
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,250
I got to see,
I had a friend who in his backyard,

326
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:18,251
he,
he probably had six hives and he had 

327
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,690
this one really intense kind of rogue 
hive where maybe the queen had some kind

328
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:25,691
of strain of a africanized or something 
and her wife could not,

329
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,780
his wife could not go out in the 
backyard without being attacked,

330
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,550
you know.
So he says,

331
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,120
Hey,
can I go put my bees on your property so

332
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,520
they can cycle this queen out,
you know,

333
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:41,030
they got some breeding in.
It was just off Jesus Christ.

334
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,670
So he,
he brought it out to the ranch,

335
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:47,780
he pinched the B and then a pinch.
The queen pinched it.

336
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,140
What do you mean killed it?
And then she's crying.

337
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,230
It's a nice euphemism.
You didn't have to shoot it or nothing,

338
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,030
you know,
hold still.

339
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,520
So he just grabbed the queen and killed 
her.

340
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,400
Well has pinched.
It could because she was reproducing.

341
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,440
I mean,
they lay a million eggs in their lives.

342
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,680
It's insane that,
I mean,

343
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,950
I,
I basically,

344
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:11,951
I could sit here and talk a whole hour 
about bees because they're so 

345
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:11,951
interesting.
Let's do it.

346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,540
Alright,
well the listener,

347
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,890
I'm not scaring.
No,

348
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,030
they listen.
They'll listen.

349
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,410
Trust me.
It's interesting stuff.

350
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,620
So yeah.
But it put a new queen in there and 

351
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:23,970
they,
they cycled through all of the other bs.

352
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:25,430
I mean,
they only live a month.

353
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,640
So what is it?
And so a normal reaction when people go 

354
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,180
in the yard would be,
they would just disinterest.

355
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,310
They wouldn't care about you as long as 
you're not interrupting the hive.

356
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,370
Exactly.
But your wife would go out there and 

357
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,370
they would just get crazy.

358
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,630
Yeah.
It was.

359
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,630
So you.
Oh yeah.

360
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,670
This wasn't me.
This was my friend's wife.

361
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,210
That's right.
Um,

362
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,340
but,
uh,

363
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,290
yeah,
I mean he,

364
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,390
he's kind of used to it and she was not.
She was out to go swimming or go out 

365
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,380
there and they would,
they would get crazy with him,

366
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,970
but he's like,
it just doesn't bother me.

367
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,410
But she was like,
fuck this queen.

368
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,060
Fuck this hive.
Yeah,

369
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,080
yeah,
pretty much.

370
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,720
And there's certain things if we're in 
black,

371
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,110
they all attack.
You almost think you're a bear.

372
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,790
You know what?
Yeah.

373
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,940
Uh,
if you like just eaten banana's,

374
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,530
there's some,
there's some,

375
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,250
I dunno,
a smell or a something in it that is 

376
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,400
similar to their attack pheromone that 
they set off.

377
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,430
So there's a few things I've learned 
over the years,

378
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,380
Tony and bananas and don't,
don't wear black.

379
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,760
Exactly.
That's all you gotta do.

380
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,390
But I learned this stuff being in the 
bee club.

381
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,330
You're going to be club.
Yeah.

382
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,840
In,
uh,

383
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,350
in,
uh,

384
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,580
in the bay area.
Yeah.

385
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:39,170
We'd meet down at the American Legion 
Hall and have a monthly meeting.

386
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,080
One of those dorks like me and my buddy.
Oh my God,

387
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,660
we would just sit there and kind of 
laugh about him.

388
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,130
Uh,
but we're sitting,

389
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,960
we're here to learn some stuff,
but there were people up there,

390
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,090
okay.
We inseminated the queen with this and 

391
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,090
you know,
that we're counting bs,

392
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,931
you know,
we put little numbers on every B and 

393
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,320
we've caught their flight pattern and 
how many were reproducing this.

394
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,700
And I mean it,
it's all,

395
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,580
you know,
it's all a,

396
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,070
like,
uh,

397
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,850
they're,
they're,

398
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,970
they're doing research on how to make 
the be stronger because the bees are 

399
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,730
going away.
But um,

400
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,720
you know,
it's,

401
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:20,130
this might this little a Varroa mite 
that's killing a lot of them too,

402
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,110
along with the pesticides and 
herbicides,

403
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:22,650
but,
uh,

404
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,980
you know,
people that are so into it and we're 

405
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,620
just gonna sit in there going home,
man,

406
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,180
what have we gotten ourselves into?

407
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,050
But it's Kinda,
you know,

408
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,940
it's funny in a certain way,
but I'm glad that it's happening.

409
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,380
But,
uh,

410
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,560
you know,
I get it at the end of the season,

411
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:45,561
you get like 500 pounds of honey and 
you're handing them out to your friends 

412
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,000
and everyone's loving it.
Five hundred pounds of honey.

413
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,230
That's insane.
Yeah.

414
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,470
And we're bottling it up.
My kids are filtering it,

415
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,140
we're bottling it up and it,
dude,

416
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:58,740
it's just straight from the hive into a 
bottle.

417
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean,
after you've filtered it.

418
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,370
And it really helps with allergies.
It helps with,

419
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:05,430
uh,
you know,

420
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,480
the whatever,
getting the pollens and the,

421
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
and the nectar is from the area.
So when you take that in and it helps 

422
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,290
build your immune system.
Yeah,

423
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,400
I've heard that.
So you've experienced that person.

424
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Absolutely.
And I think being stung by bees helps 

425
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,460
you to.
It helps with,

426
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,220
with something getting your,
your immune system built up to.

427
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,870
It's supposed to be really good for 
arthritis.

428
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
They,
they take people like literally take 

429
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,060
bees,
people that are,

430
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,980
that have serious arthritis in their 
hands and they sting their hands with it

431
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,850
on purpose.
Right.

432
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,820
I think there's some people that do it 
for their lips here in la.

433
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,650
I think you need people that are so 
deep,

434
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:45,651
deep,
deep into the pe world because you're 

435
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:45,651
not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it,

436
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,711
but if someone's just so far gone,
they're measuring all their bs and 

437
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,000
monitoring their flight patterns and 
checking their DNA.

438
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I'm just fascinated that there was a 
clear differentiation between a normal b

439
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,030
and the way these bees were behaving 
that you could tell that the queen was 

440
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,160
kind of a freak,
but Italia,

441
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,160
those freak beast,
the Africanized or whatever.

442
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,310
Now there's a Zombie bee and we can.
We can get into that too,

443
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,920
but uh,
they are,

444
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,850
they are aggressive and an aggressive,
you know,

445
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:17,430
it's like any society,
they do well,

446
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,110
they,
they get most,

447
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,190
they produce a lot of honey and they,
they,

448
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,320
they're very,
very prolific in what they do,

449
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,670
you know?
Yeah.

450
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:27,900
I've had killer bee honey.

451
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,660
They make killer bee.
Like what sounded good on it.

452
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:35,661
I don't know if he knows any better if 
it's a killer bee honey better than 

453
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:39,080
regular honey,
but just pretty dope to have killer bee 

454
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,690
honey around your house.
Well,

455
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:40,650
yeah,
you know,

456
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,000
that.
And the um,

457
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,420
uh,
uh,

458
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,430
Gosh.
Oh,

459
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,430
what's this stuff called?
I mean there's,

460
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,990
there's lots of really cool healing 
properties in,

461
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,620
in like even the,
the,

462
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,750
the kind of glue that they use to plug 
up holes and you know,

463
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,250
uh,
the Royal Jelly,

464
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,320
which is,
you know,

465
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,270
comes from there,
like the brain and it,

466
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,100
that's how they produce a queen.
I mean,

467
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,630
there's so royal jelly is.
Yeah.

468
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,270
Yeah.
It's from their brains.

469
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,260
Brain juice,
man.

470
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,060
Holy Shit.
How does it come out?

471
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,330
Is it come out of a hole somewhere?
A,

472
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,460
what?
Do they have to scoop it out of their 

473
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,460
fucking heads?

474
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
I haven't seen it that close,
but they injected into the,

475
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,260
injected,
into the queen cell or there's a cell 

476
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,220
that they make when a new queen is being
made to all the bees that are flying 

477
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,310
around that you see out here,
you know,

478
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,350
they're all females.
It's a huge.

479
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,890
It's all female society.
So the drones that are in there,

480
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,350
which were the males,
they're there just to reproduce and then

481
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,380
they get kicked out in the wintertime 
and they didn't all die.

482
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,250
Yeah.
Whoa.

483
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,750
Yeah,
man.

484
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,340
It's hard outside.
Brutal.

485
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,040
Brutal for us men in the B world.
So if they all die,

486
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,870
how do they continue to reproduce?
Well,

487
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,950
there's some,
I guess the couple stay on.

488
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,980
They,
they,

489
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,870
the queen makes more.
Wow.

490
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,110
So those guys are just dead.
The Queen makes more on the new ones.

491
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,250
Takeover.
The new boys.

492
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,390
Yeah.
Yeah,

493
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,380
and they're just doing work.

494
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,100
They're just there.
They're just fertilizing.

495
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,720
That's what they're doing.
They're just there to fuck.

496
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,300
And then everybody else doing all the 
real word fuck and go die.

497
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,300
That's what you get to do.
What a brutal world.

498
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,270
That's what a fucking crazy world.
And then the queen goes around the hive 

499
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,020
and finds the females,
other,

500
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,300
other potential queens and stabs them 
while they're in the hive.

501
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,500
Pretty much.
Yeah.

502
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,780
Well they're,
they're all females.

503
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,490
All females.
Septa for those drones.

504
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,140
And then you know,
if there's,

505
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
if they're making a,
you know,

506
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,780
she knows she's going to die or they're,
they're kind of pissed off with her.

507
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,850
She's not reproducing as much as she 
should.

508
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,200
She will take off with half the hive and
that's why you see a swarm.

509
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,380
So she'll go and form a new hive and 
then these ones have a little queen cell

510
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:52,330
that they've laid eggs and start to make
a new queen.

511
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,920
So that's how they reproduce.
And if there's three or four queen cells

512
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,170
in there,
the first queen that's born,

513
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,470
she comes out and she kills all the 
other Queens so she can rule game of 

514
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,870
thrones type shit.
That's fascinating.

515
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,410
And you're going to get bs.
I can tell them from right now looking 

516
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,110
in my head,
I'm just looking at websites in my hand.

517
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,700
I'm like trying to find out where to get
the bees.

518
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:21,150
Yeah,
that sounds like an amazing way to get 

519
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,150
honey.
I mean,

520
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,300
it just sounds like a really cool thing 
to do to taste so good.

521
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,590
And we've got,
you know,

522
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:24,070
we,
we,

523
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,130
we have a place in Hawaii so we've got 
Hawaiian flavored Hawaiian flavored.

524
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,110
Well there's stuff,
you know,

525
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,960
that they,
they,

526
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:36,961
uh,
get the nectar and pollen from over 

527
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:36,961
there and had Hawaii's nonstop.
Yeah.

528
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,700
So you're getting honey year round.
What island and Maui.

529
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,380
Oh Man,
I love Maui.

530
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,870
That's a beautiful spot.
Um,

531
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,980
so when you,
how do you know

532
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,040
that a b is Africanized?
Because that was the big thing that 

533
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,311
everybody was worried about.
You remember it was like the early 

534
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:54,311
nineties.
Everybody's like,

535
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:58,110
can we say,
found an African killer bee and no next 

536
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,110
echo or something?
And was like,

537
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,950
it's coming up.
It's gonna,

538
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,860
it's gonna Swarm.
They going to take over the country.

539
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,040
And inside of a few years there was a 
big hysteria about that,

540
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:04,670
right?
Yeah.

541
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,510
Well,
and there are,

542
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,570
there are states where there are more 
prevalent than others and they're just 

543
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,310
more aggressive or more aggressive in 
their,

544
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,190
their,
uh,

545
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,930
they're,
they're very protective.

546
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,910
So you'll get stung if you're messing 
with them to,

547
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,460
that's all it is.
There's nothing so.

548
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,420
But we,
there was a big concern that they were 

549
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,460
going to take hold and that it was going
to be that these bees,

550
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:28,940
we're just gonna come here and outbreed 
the regular bs and I hear laughing,

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,830
remember possible?

552
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,740
Oh yeah,
for sure.

553
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,420
There's some great movies about that 
too,

554
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
you know,
the killer bees,

555
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,990
but there's no way to tell by looking at
them.

556
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,730
I don't know.
I don't think so.

557
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,830
I'm somewhat into it,
but I haven't,

558
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,440
haven't investigated that part yet.
So these bees that came over from the,

559
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,160
perhaps africanized bees that when they 
killed the queen and then introduce 

560
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,840
those bees to the rest of the bs that 
everybody chill out.

561
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,300
Yeah.
So it's just that one crazy bitch.

562
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,080
Well,
yeah,

563
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,370
she,
you know,

564
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,780
she's laying the eggs,
she's passing on the whatever DNA.

565
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,480
Uh,
but those are the,

566
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:06,260
uh,
the,

567
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:07,850
uh,
the forage or bees,

568
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:12,851
the ones that you see out and about.
They only live a month so they will die 

569
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:13,610
out.
And how long did she live?

570
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,160
She can live between one to five years.
Wow.

571
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,880
What a bizarre culture stream.

572
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,930
Really,
really cool.

573
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,940
And without them,
I mean you're,

574
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
there's lots of,
uh,

575
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,080
you know,
orange almonds,

576
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,260
all kinds of stuff,
especially here in California and the,

577
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,890
you know,
in the,

578
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,210
uh,
in the center,

579
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,360
a center of California,
all that farming.

580
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,700
If there's no bs,
there's no fruit.

581
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,390
Yeah.
What a bizarre sort of symbiotic 

582
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,570
relationship that we have with some one 
weird insect pollination.

583
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I mean,
you would've thought that that would 

584
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:52,700
have been taken care of some other way 
and it wouldn't be that a baby has to do

585
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,240
it.
Well,

586
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,750
there are others that do it.
What other butterflies?

587
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,260
And I'll tell you,
not just honeybees,

588
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,290
but there's,
there's probably over 3000 different 

589
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,300
kinds of bees there.
They don't have,

590
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,570
they don't have a hive society like the 
honeybees do,

591
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,870
but all these other bees are like 
loners.

592
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,150
They're,
they live in the ground or something and

593
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:22,151
they just,
they just get enough pollen for 

594
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,001
themselves,
so they're kind of lone lone wolves out 

595
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,480
there,
but the honeybees are the ones that have

596
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,410
more of a society.

597
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,970
I raised chickens and the chicken thing 
with us happened.

598
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,100
We just got a couple of chickens and the
next thing you know,

599
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:39,101
we got this giant fucking chicken house 
at 23 chickens and they're running 

600
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:39,780
around my yard.
Is that the same way with the leg?

601
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:43,190
Just kind of like slowly step into this 
and then get deeper and deeper?

602
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah.
Let me just like getting your first 

603
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,300
tattoos,
like,

604
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,300
yeah.
Wow,

605
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,540
that's cool.
I want more.

606
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,280
And uh,
yeah,

607
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:55,281
you just start to appreciate it.
I think when I come off tour it's like 

608
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,570
my head is like ricocheting around in 
there a,

609
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,540
a,
a goal.

610
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,950
When I sit and watch the bees,
just watch them go in and out,

611
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,010
in and out.
There's like this frigging landing strip

612
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:09,480
that he come in and they look so busy,
it relaxes me.

613
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,400
It's like,
wow,

614
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,200
okay.
I'm not that busy,

615
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,570
just cool.

616
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,580
Just chill.
No.

617
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:22,581
Is there a way,
do you like a glass wall in any way 

618
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,911
where you can see into the hive?
You ever seen those hives where they 

619
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:25,911
make them?
Do you have it like that?

620
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:26,520
We can look in there.
Yeah.

621
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:27,600
I've got one of the.
Yeah.

622
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:30,390
Well,
oh that's like a display one would bring

623
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:35,391
into schools and see I don't have one of
those but I got a couple of different 

624
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:37,640
kinds of hives and it's fun to see,
you know,

625
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,650
sometimes you have the frames that I'm 
already kind of prebuilt and then they 

626
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:48,081
just deposit their stuff in it or you'll
watch them grow their own comb from 

627
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:52,221
nothing and it's pretty amazing.
How do you get them to stay there 

628
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:52,350
though?
Like how does it work?

629
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,880
Like I see those boxes and I know that 
bees do have hives in those boxes,

630
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:58,200
but how does it initially start?

631
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,940
Well,
it's the queen.

632
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,560
Wherever the queen is,
that's where they go.

633
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,590
So she decides to be in that.
So how do you get her to stay in that 

634
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:06,590
box?
Uh,

635
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,490
do you have a place for her to lay eggs?
I mean,

636
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,510
that's.
Yeah.

637
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,040
And she will stay and if she's there,
you know when they go off to to swarm to

638
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:20,091
go find a new hive.
If you've ever seen a swarm up in a 

639
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:20,640
tree,
just like a giant,

640
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,730
like football size or even bigger,
a shape of just bs at Queen is right in 

641
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:32,160
the middle and they're all just around 
her and then they send off the scouts to

642
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:34,380
find a new spot.
They come back say,

643
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:39,381
hey,
it's over here to do the little wiggle 

644
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:39,381
dance and that shows them how to get 
there.

645
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:43,641
And they all go there.
We had an incident once on fear factor 

646
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:43,641
where we covered these people with bs.

647
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:48,060
There was like a beekeeper there and he 
had his hives and a local hive came over

648
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,240
and a group of bees came over and met 
with these bees and we had a clear the 

649
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,120
area out and they had to have a 
conversation.

650
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Like literally what happened.
They were in the air just floating 

651
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,441
around and then they worked it out and 
then the rbs came back and they went 

652
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,860
back to the hive and the bees went about
their business.

653
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,690
They were just like,
what the fuck's going on?

654
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:08,580
You guys moving in here?
Like what are you doing?

655
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,170
Territorial.
Somehow or another,

656
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:12,180
they worked it out though.
There was no death,

657
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,240
there wasn't be fucking braveheart war.
It just,

658
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,370
they figured it out.
Had a good negotiator.

659
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,820
I don't want to.
What do they communicate with any living

660
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,270
these in pheromones.
Like how are they?

661
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,990
Smells.
Smells and dances.

662
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,400
Dances,
yeah.

663
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,600
Some B will find it.
Like,

664
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,870
hey man,
I found like a garden somewhere and 

665
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,080
they'll come back and they'll see them 
do the little wiggle thing.

666
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,081
It's like how many wiggles this way?
And then they turned left and then turn 

667
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:42,081
that way.
That's,

668
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:42,081
that's like

669
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,110
a half a mile this way and then that,
that way.

670
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:46,760
And then they all learn it and then they
go for,

671
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,980
hey,
I found some water,

672
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:48,940
here's a place to go.

673
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,440
So they literally can tell them where 
something is.

674
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:52,520
But the movements.
Yeah.

675
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,090
Holy Shit.
That's crazy.

676
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,760
So it's almost like a,
like a body language pretty much.

677
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,250
And they all know it somehow.
Instinctively.

678
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:02,750
Yep.
Wow.

679
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,910
Yeah.
It's pretty bizarre.

680
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,340
There's a lot to learn about those 
things.

681
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,030
That's really bizarre.
Yeah.

682
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,380
I didn't know that they can tell each 
other where something is just by 

683
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,890
wiggling,
like they have like this means a mile.

684
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,650
That means go left.
Wow,

685
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,450
man.
I can get.

686
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,630
I'm going to get deep and bs,
man.

687
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:22,120
What the fuck have you done?
All right.

688
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,020
Yeah.
And there's,

689
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,630
I'm sure there's probably a feel of 
like,

690
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,080
wow,
I'm,

691
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,550
I'm,
there's a whole society right here in my

692
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:34,610
yard and I'm,
I'm overseeing it,

693
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:36,920
you know,
there's probably a sense of importance.

694
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,540
Uh,
but you know,

695
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,630
I lay off of.
I mean there are people that are 

696
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,930
checking them all the time and this and 
that and oh,

697
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:49,931
you got to put the,
the certain pads in there to kill the 

698
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,820
Mites and you gotta do this and that.
It's like another natural man.

699
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:56,210
They've been around longer than we have.
So just let them go.

700
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,130
They know what they're doing.
I don't know who,

701
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
who's to say I know what I'm doing with 
them.

702
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,880
Do they need specific types of plants 
around them in order to survive?

703
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,810
Yeah.
Well,

704
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,940
something that they can pollinate.
And you know,

705
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:12,790
it's from a,
it's good to plant,

706
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,050
you know what I've planned,
I've planted stuff that,

707
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,040
you know,
okay,

708
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:21,041
it blooms in the spring and then there's
other stuff that blooms in the summer 

709
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:21,041
and then there's other stuff that 
blooms,

710
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,670
you know,
like in the late summer.

711
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,620
So they've always got something going 
on.

712
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,960
But they hibernate.
They hibernate in the winter.

713
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,370
No kidding.
Like bears.

714
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:28,730
Yep.

715
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,570
So when you are in Vail and you,
uh,

716
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,210
you have obviously a really cold weather
in the winter,

717
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,220
what do they do?
They just shut down and stay in the hive

718
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:37,850
and don't move.

719
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,110
Well,
uh,

720
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:44,111
I don't have bees in vail yet and I'm 
going to try and figure out how to do 

721
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:44,111
that.
But uh,

722
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,140
they,
I mean just like cattle,

723
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,170
you know,
your winter room down in the lowlands.

724
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,280
So,
uh,

725
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,420
I haven't found a place to,
to have bees go where there,

726
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,140
you know,
there's less snow,

727
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,410
but I'll,
I'll figure something out because it's 

728
00:31:59,410 --> 00:31:59,410
something I love doing.
It sounds amazing.

729
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,130
So in California you have a whole ranch,
like you have,

730
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:05,180
like you're totally like a prepper,
almost your sustainable.

731
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,310
Are you sustainable out their well 
water?

732
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,780
You Bet.
Yeah.

733
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,070
That's a dream of mine.
It is awesome.

734
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,160
I'll tell you,
and that's a place I could just go up 

735
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,160
and disappear.
I love it man.

736
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,670
And just get lost.
Just get lost in the anything.

737
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,920
Get lost in detail.
I got lots of fun stuff up there,

738
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,420
you know,
quads and you know,

739
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,270
I've got my welder and whatever.
I just get lost in things and I love it.

740
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,680
Uh,
you know.

741
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,610
Yeah.
You know,

742
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,560
hunting deer,
Turkey,

743
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,950
uh,
stuff that we eat the hunted off in the 

744
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:40,950
ranch.

745
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,320
That's a,
that's such a beautiful thing,

746
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:47,321
man.
I remember hearing about Neil Young's 

747
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:47,570
place that he's got some giant ranch up 
there and Neil young and just chills out

748
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:52,571
and apparently has speaker set up around
a lake where he can be on a boat and 

749
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,610
push the boat out into the middle of the
lake and the speakers will broadcast.

750
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,180
It's perfectly set up because you know,
he's a serious audio file.

751
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,910
Do you ever see his MP3 thing that he 
created?

752
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,640
It didn't really catch.
Catch on.

753
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,670
Yeah.
It didn't really catch on for some 

754
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,291
reason because people were just so 
attached to listen to music on their 

755
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:11,291
phones now,
but it's,

756
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,360
it's an amazing little device and it 
just did that to,

757
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,430
to really put that much effort and 
intention into something that's not 

758
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:21,860
really necessary in the modern world.
Just shows you what a serious audio file

759
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:22,490
that guy is.

760
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,650
Yeah.
He loves it.

761
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,170
He loves music.
He loves the nature as well.

762
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,240
And I've been up to his ranch.
It's really cool.

763
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,030
We played the Neil Young,
uh,

764
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,070
bridge school benefit like three times 
and he invites people out there to the 

765
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,010
ranch.
It's beautiful.

766
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,600
It has buffalo out there and it seemed 
acres.

767
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,360
Does he have out there a lot?
A lot.

768
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,750
I didn't count or something like that.
Yeah.

769
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,050
Wow.
But yeah.

770
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,280
Beautiful.
You know?

771
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,310
Yeah.

772
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:51,280
for a guy like you,

773
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:51,970
I mean,

774
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:56,480
I think you've found like this really 
amazing and enviable balance between the

775
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,510
arena shows and all the fucking 
craziness of rock and then Chirp,

776
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:03,260

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,990

781
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,960
like you've Kinda like found this 
interesting piece.

782
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

783
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,120
Slowly.
I'm not there yet,

784
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:22,750
but you know,
it uh,

785
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,270
more will be revealed,
you know,

786
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,810
it's uh,
it's uh,

787
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,660
you know,
it's a journey and I,

788
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,600
once I realized that it's just a 
journey,

789
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,490
I'm okay with it,
you know,

790
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,470
um,
someone on a,

791
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,660
another interview was just asking me,
hey,

792
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:39,360
you know,
back in the early days you guys released

793
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:40,950
an album almost every year,
you know,

794
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:42,130
you've got like five,
you know,

795
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,390
five albums in six years or something.
And what happened?

796
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,730
That was eight years since the last one 
is like,

797
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:50,880
dude,
there's a lot more life to do.

798
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,440
You know,
there's a lot,

799
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,070
you know,
vacations with families watching my kids

800
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:57,340
grow up.
Um,

801
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,890
uh,
you know,

802
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,950
touring a lot longer than it used to be,
you know,

803
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:07,190
Shit.
Back in those days we had this many 

804
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,340
songs and this is how many gigs we can 
do and then we're back in the studio.

805
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,340
So a lot is happening in life and uh,
everyone in the band is on the same 

806
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,970
page,
which is really a great thing.

807
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,000
Um,
we've all got kids,

808
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,330
we've all got other lives,
but we can't live without metallica 

809
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,260
event.
It's just something that joins us,

810
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:33,261
you know,
where these frigging for married guys 

811
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,190
that know more about each other than 
anyone knows about us.

812
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,120
Maybe our wives,
but you know,

813
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,850
the fact,
you know,

814
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,470
Lars and I have known each other for 35 
years.

815
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,900
Wow.
Even maybe 36.

816
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,730
But I tell you that I've don't,
I,

817
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:51,600
there's nobody else I've known longer 
except for maybe family than large.

818
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,960
So it's a brother,
he's a brother.

819
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:55,860
I hate him.
I love him.

820
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,810
I want to kill him.
I want to hug him.

821
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,370
All that,
all that stuff,

822
00:35:59,371 --> 00:35:59,700
man.

823
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,360
Well,
it's also you.

824
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:01,960
I mean,
I,

825
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:06,961
I got to imagine that you,
you guys have to realize what an 

826
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,290
unbelievably fortunate and amazing 
experience you guys are on.

827
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,370
How many people have a dream when their 
kids are being a fucking rock star?

828
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,770
How many people get to be in Metallica?
It's crazy,

829
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:21,100
dude.

830
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,830
I wake up everyday and think I'm 
fricking blessed.

831
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,630
I mean,
this is unbelievable.

832
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,220
What if I complain once today punched me
in the face,

833
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,110
you know,
this is stupid,

834
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,400
you know,
exact,

835
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,100
so stupid that I would complain about 
something.

836
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,020
Um,
but I tell you,

837
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,310
it is hard at times being on the road 
doing stuff and when you don't want to 

838
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,340
do stuff,
you do it.

839
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,640
But then you find something,
you find someone,

840
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:54,500
you find a thing and it's usually 
someone in the crowd that's just,

841
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,140
you know,
I see myself right there.

842
00:36:57,141 --> 00:37:01,150
It's like I'm that kid right there at 
the motorhead concert looking up at.

843
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,730
Let me go on.

844
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,110
This is Paul Guy.

845
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,750
And so I just suck that energy and go,
all right,

846
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,150
this is a,
this is all I need.

847
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,480
This is all I need right now.
That's beautiful.

848
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,560
That was a hard one right when lenny 
lenny died.

849
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,670
We went hard to the end.
No doubt he really did.

850
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:27,240
He fucking war.
That breaks out or the tires out fucking

851
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:30,960
screeched right into the rocks.
Oh my God.

852
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:36,050
Yeah.
And he didn't want anyone to know that 

853
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,050
it was really that sick and he just kept
going.

854
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,971
And God,
that's what he knew and it's what he 

855
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:40,971
loved.
And it's what he was.

856
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:42,060
And you know,
for me,

857
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:44,820
I thought the man was immortal,
you know,

858
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,610
he was just this icon of a figure,
uh,

859
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,970
the,
you know,

860
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,790
he was the godfather of heavy music for 
us.

861
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,880
Without him,
there certainly wouldn't be a Metallica,

862
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,300
certainly wouldn't.
He was a,

863
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:03,420
he was the catalyst for Lars and I 
getting together,

864
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
you know,
the ad in the paper,

865
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,570
you know,
we like bands.

866
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,130
Like motorhead was like,
hey,

867
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,770
somebody else liked motorhead.
Alright,

868
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,370
ads in the paper.
Is that crazy?

869
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:16,010
When you stop and think about that,
that's how you got back.

870
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,690
That's how you guys get together back 
then.

871
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,920
That's how you found band members ads in
the paper looking for a drummer.

872
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,940
He goes straight to them.

873
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Each section,
you know,

874
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,880
all the,
the,

875
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,580
the,
you know,

876
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,870
the,
the,

877
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,390
uh,
uh,

878
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,900
the classifieds,
you know,

879
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,690
pass up all this stuff.
Just get right to age,

880
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,010
sit heavy metal.
I was like,

881
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,300
oh,
there's my ad.

882
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:39,160
And there's his,
we should meet.

883
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,080
There's only two of us.

884
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Well,
you guys have been through such a 

885
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,010
fascinating change in music too,
because I mean obviously lars was a huge

886
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:56,621
figure in the controversy surrounding 
mp3s and that was like during the 

887
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,530
napster days.
That was the time where everybody 

888
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:02,530
realized like,
Holy Shit,

889
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,080
something just happened,
you know,

890
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,000
and I don't think we realized it back 
then.

891
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:10,390
I think lars,
in a lot of ways was one of the first 

892
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,600
people sounding the horn.
He was one of the first people going,

893
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,660
hey,
all this selling record shit is gonna go

894
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:15,490
away.
Like,

895
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:20,491
do you understand what's going on here?
People just taking things and putting 

896
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,590
them online.
And this was a totally new thing.

897
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,900
Absolutely.
And

898
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,210
that poor guy still,
you know,

899
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,010
he's taken bullets.
He's taking hits for it still really?

900
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:36,011
Where,
oh everyone who's got a beef with any 

901
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:37,100
other thing than a,
you know,

902
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,610
napster,
they,

903
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,700
it just gravitates towards that all the 
time.

904
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,380
That poor guy.
Yeah.

905
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:47,381
He,
he got beat up by that and we all stood 

906
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:47,450
behind him.
Obviously he was the spokesman for it.

907
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,270
He,
he,

908
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,420
he chose.
He chose to do that.

909
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,830
Management said,
hey,

910
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,200
this is coming,
this is coming,

911
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,770
let's be the ones that stand up for 
artists.

912
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,740
And he took that.
He,

913
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,800
he grabbed the flag is that I'm going 
and there were lots of other musicians 

914
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:12,281
and people that were on board as well,
but they weren't as vocal or taking the 

915
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,070
hits like he did.
There was something about,

916
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,560
you know,
even like a Dr Dre,

917
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,590
he was on board with it,
but for some reason in the rap world 

918
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,080
it's like,
well,

919
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,190
it's all about money.

920
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,030
Anyway,
so,

921
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,700
so what is,
for heavy metal,

922
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:32,180
there was some kind of stigma around,
you know,

923
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,320
you,
you're,

924
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:36,860
you're an asshole if you're rich or if 
you've been successful or something.

925
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:39,590
It's like we got to pull you down into 
hell with us,

926
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:40,190
you know,
don't,

927
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,230
don't be getting good now.
You know?

928
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,390
Yeah.
So that was that stigma.

929
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,020
But there were other artists that would 
show up at shows saying,

930
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,810
hey man,
I'm really glad you're doing what you're

931
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:51,800
doing.
It's like,

932
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:52,700
come on,
you know,

933
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,800
join us.
Oh No,

934
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,310
oh no.
My career would be over.

935
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,810
It's like,
you fuck,

936
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,210
you know,
it's so frustrating.

937
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:02,990
It's like,
dude,

938
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,160
do you believe in it?
Yeah.

939
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,740
Then stand up.
It's like,

940
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:07,790
yeah,
but no,

941
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,560
it will fall apart.
Something will happen.

942
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,520
My fans,
blah blah blah.

943
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So they,
they were concerned about their own 

944
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,690
careers and not the big picture of 
artists.

945
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,550
And obviously these days you can see 
there's no copyright laws,

946
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:23,630
there's no nothing,
man,

947
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:26,600
you can rip this and that and whatever 
and do whatever you want with it.

948
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,080
There's a beauty to that and a lot of 
creativity comes out of it,

949
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,920
but it gets watered.
It gets,

950
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,570
you know,
I dunno,

951
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,360
we,
we acknowledged that.

952
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:43,361
Yeah,
there's an inspiration somewhere for 

953
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:44,420
everything blatantly taking that and 
using it is,

954
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,210
it's pretty frustrating to me.
Um,

955
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,400
and we're,
we're,

956
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:54,401
we were at that point where we were,
we had a such a following.

957
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,520
We had such a strength in Metallica that
we survived all of that stuff.

958
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,430
Um,
but there was a lot of bands that 

959
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:06,430
didn't,
you know,

960
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:06,430
uh,
they couldn't sustain themselves,

961
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,110
couldn't feed their families because of 
what happened.

962
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:14,111
And I think the frustrating part was no 
one really understood that music is our 

963
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:16,820
life,
you know,

964
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,180
if you take that,
if you take our,

965
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,330
like the way we wanted to present our 
music is part of the art.

966
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,310
Well again,
in an album,

967
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,400
meaning like one song leads to the next 
song winning

968
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,300
well like releasing an album.
Here's how we'd like to release it.

969
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,360
We don't want it leaked over here.
We don't want this happening.

970
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:43,010
We don't know a present a presentation 
is part of the art.

971
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Like when you walk into an art studio,
the artist has been in there putting it 

972
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,400
together like,
okay,

973
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,630
I want you to see this first.
And then that.

974
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,030
And then you go here and you get Bam,
you know,

975
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:59,230
that there's a passion behind that.
And when someone just throws it out 

976
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:03,311
there,
then it kind of loses a leaves an 

977
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:04,880
impact.
Um,

978
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,020
so if I'm complaining punched me in the 
face,

979
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,060
but we have survived and we feel good 
about it and we've adapted.

980
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,250
But the record companies certainly did 
not,

981
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,260
you know,
they took it

982
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,990
a hard hit.
But also,

983
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:20,640
you know,
when you look at the record deals,

984
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:24,790
the deal that record companies make with
artists and you see like what,

985
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,430
what a record company selling,
well,

986
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:28,950
they're only selling your work without 
your work,

987
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:31,860
without your creativity,
without your creations.

988
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,200
There's nothing to sell.
That's all they sell.

989
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,530
But then you look at these insanely one 
side and deals that they cut with 

990
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,251
artists,
especially emerging artists that might 

991
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:43,590
be a little bit more desperate,
don't realize that potential,

992
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,170
especially the potential for income that
they might have in the future.

993
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,340
I mean,
I've seen some of those.

994
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:52,341
I don't know.
There was that one that somebody said 

995
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:52,620
that courtly love didn't really write 
it,

996
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:55,080
that it was ghost written.
I don't know who the fuck wrote it,

997
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:57,090
but courtly love put it out saying that 
she wrote it,

998
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:02,091
but it was a breakdown of how artists 
make money from the creation of an 

999
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:05,650
artist,
a creation of an album to having it sold

1000
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:10,100
and record stores to where the money 
gets extracted and how much is left with

1001
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:12,000
the actual artists.
It's pretty fucking disturbing.

1002
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,640
Yeah.
Even A.

1003
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,430
Well,
yeah.

1004
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:20,431
A couple of years ago we,
we got the rights to our catalog or our 

1005
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:24,820
music from kill 'em all up until now we 
own it finally,

1006
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,040
which is weird.
My tell my kids,

1007
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,600
Hey,
you know,

1008
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,760
let's go celebrate.
We've got,

1009
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,450
we got the master recordings,
we own it finally.

1010
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,230
And they were just looking at me like,
what the hell are you talking about?

1011
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,320
You wrote it,
why isn't it yours?

1012
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,890
Okay,
well I'll have a little talk about how 

1013
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:45,890
it was back then.
You know,

1014
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,090
you would somewhat sell a little bit of 
your soul to get a bigger something,

1015
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,150
you know,
it was basically the record company was 

1016
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,740
a bank and a marketing tool to get you 
where you want it to be.

1017
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,210
So uh,
you know,

1018
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:03,270
it was a necessary thing at that time,
but it's great to have our stuff back 

1019
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,110
and be able to,
you know,

1020
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,870
we own our own record press.

1021
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,520
How cool is that?
Whoa.

1022
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,940
In Germany,
one of our management people found a 

1023
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,381
place that had some machines that were 
for sale and we bought one and so we 

1024
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:23,010
press our own vinyl man and we could 
kind of do whatever we want.

1025
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
What color vinyl today,
you know,

1026
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,110
or what crazy things you can do,
you know,

1027
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,700
uh,
you guys can kind of do whatever the 

1028
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700
fuck you want now.
Right?

1029
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,100
But you don't need a record company.
You do anything.

1030
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,090
Well,
it depends.

1031
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,740
Uh,
we have a record company.

1032
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,730
We own our own in America or North 
America.

1033
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,710
The rest of the world is a little 
tougher,

1034
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,560
you know,
there's a lot of countries out there,

1035
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:51,561
especially in Europe and there's no way 
we can deal with the distribution in 

1036
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:53,970
each different country.
So we've cut really good deals with,

1037
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,910
with other record companies that have a 
vision and a,

1038
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,920
have a love for Metallica and understand
that this is powerful stuff and people 

1039
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:06,660
love it and we want to be part of the 
family.

1040
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,180
Um,
but having your own record press is 

1041
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,250
pretty darn cool thing that was really 
inspired by Jack White,

1042
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,840
uh,
who,

1043
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,280
uh,
you know,

1044
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,040
white stripes,
fame,

1045
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,840
they rec on tears.
He's done a lot of stuff,

1046
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,720
but he,
he loves that stuff.

1047
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,840
He's pressing his own stuff.
He's coming up with different ways of 

1048
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,940
doing vinyls and colors and hidden 
tracks and cool stuff like that.

1049
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,030
And it's,
it's just another way to get creative 

1050
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,630
in,
in your career is vinyl.

1051
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:45,230
What's selling more than anything now 
when it comes to actual physical hard 

1052
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,980
copies of things,
I don't know the numbers and they're 

1053
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,701
probably very all over the place,
but vinyl has never gone away and it's,

1054
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,580
it's,
I don't know if it's coming back,

1055
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,700
but it's more popular than it was.
I think there's just something tactile 

1056
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,931
about it.
There's something great that people are 

1057
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:06,330
finally understanding that you can look 
at artwork,

1058
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:08,740
you can feel it.
And then the,

1059
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,450
the,
the ritualization of opening up the 

1060
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,740
player,
taking it out and blowing on it,

1061
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:19,530
clean and it putting it down,
setting the needle down.

1062
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:23,160
And it's something really cool.
I just,

1063
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,210
I came down to La a few months ago and 
hung out with some high school buddies.

1064
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:28,380
It's like,
Hey,

1065
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:33,381
what do you want to do?
I was listening to some songs and he 

1066
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:34,880
takes out the Kansas Angel album,
puts it on and.

1067
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,140
Exactly.
Dude,

1068
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:42,740
this sounds

1069
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,600
so great.
And we were actually listening to music,

1070
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,000
sitting down,
listening to it.

1071
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,270
My kids got into vinyl.
They got a,

1072
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,460
you know,
like at urban outfitter,

1073
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,230
you buy the little,
the setup now and that's where they,

1074
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,750
that's where you can get vinyl.
It's,

1075
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,190
it's there,
there are some record stores out there,

1076
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:06,191
but that's where they gravitate towards.
Got them this little player and uh,

1077
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,590
they just picked out some album covers 
dating even know who they were just 

1078
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:11,590
like,
this cow,

1079
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,680
this cover looks cool,
this speaks to me.

1080
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm buying this.
I remember telling them that kind of 

1081
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:17,800
thing.
Cool cover.

1082
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,100
Yep.
That's how I discovered tons of bands.

1083
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:24,370
So they go into the room and you know,
I leave them alone for awhile and they 

1084
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:24,860
come back and I haven't come out.
It's like,

1085
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,150
what's going on?
I look in there,

1086
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,530
there,
you know,

1087
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,560
the record players on the floor covers 
and stuff strewn out all over the place 

1088
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,730
and they're laying on the floor 
listening to.

1089
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,560
It's like,
that is what that was me,

1090
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,940
you know?
Uh,

1091
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,980
and my,
my daughter comes out and she said,

1092
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,390
dad,
you'll never guess what,

1093
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,020
like what their songs

1094
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,000
on the other side.
Oh my God.

1095
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,710
Yeah.
It's not a CD,

1096
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,150
you know,
I was like,

1097
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,310
she discovered some huge thing,
you know?

1098
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,310
Wow.
Well that was one of the things that was

1099
00:48:55,311 --> 00:49:00,311
not.
What is this vinyl sales outperformed 

1100
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:03,491
digital downloads for the first time.
He shows a significant shift in how 

1101
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,350
people are consuming music.
That's really interesting.

1102
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,740
Stick man.
I tell you,

1103
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:12,741
that's just cool in general,
the more ways you can get music to 

1104
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:14,340
people,
the better.

1105
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:19,540
Well,
I think the other thing that you were 

1106
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,540
saying,
it's like it's a whole presentation.

1107
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,450
The album cover,
you opened it up,

1108
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:25,451
the inside the artwork,
all that represents your vision of what 

1109
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,020
you guys are trying to put out.
And that was one of the things that kind

1110
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:30,260
of went away with digital.
Like all of a sudden there were no album

1111
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:31,940
covers,
so the CD was that big,

1112
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,320
so you couldn't really,
there wasn't,

1113
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,540
you know,
it's like a tiny little piece of art and

1114
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:37,760
if you're downloading it,
you're not even getting that,

1115
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,220
you just,
you're just getting the music itself.

1116
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:40,860
Well,

1117
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:45,970
and you would get downloadable artwork 
but you're not really looking at the 

1118
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,500
artwork while you're listening to it on 
your mobile device,

1119
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,230
you know,
so you know,

1120
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,970
the event of sitting down and,
and,

1121
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,300
and disappearing into the music,
you know,

1122
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,580
being a real music listener,
not while you're driving.

1123
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,380
I get it.
It's,

1124
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,120
it's keeping you from killing people on 
the road,

1125
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:07,680
but when you go home and you sit and you
just get lost in stuff.

1126
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,270
Even like those cheap friggin 
headphones,

1127
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:13,800
man,
the little earbuds,

1128
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,980
my kids were listening to stuff on that.
It's like you guys haven't experienced 

1129
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,650
music,
like,

1130
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,710
good sound here.
Try these headphones on the like,

1131
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,710
whoa.
I hear stuff I didn't hear before.

1132
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:30,770
And uh,
but just seeing my kids get excited 

1133
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,210
about going to a live concert,
you know,

1134
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,490
they go there and they absorb it in like
every sense.

1135
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:43,090
You're not just having your ears hear 
something and that will never be,

1136
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,010
I don't know,
maybe the frigging goggles or some kind 

1137
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:54,110
of audio visual stuff will reproduce 
live shows,

1138
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,200
but there's something about being next 
to a sweaty fucker at a Gig and you 

1139
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:01,950
know,
they're pushing you or uh,

1140
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
you know,
seeing someone headbang wildly are 

1141
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,810
getting thrown over the top of you and 
there's just so much smells,

1142
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,300
things like that that just can't be 
recreated.

1143
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,400
So live music.
My daughter,

1144
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:18,401
just like,
I can't believe that guy just pressed a 

1145
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:21,581
button on his computer and he's singing 
over his own music that's not 

1146
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:22,340
performing.
You know,

1147
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,030
she discovered that on her own,
hey,

1148
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:29,300
these guys are actually playing their 
instruments and they fucked up.

1149
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,730
They fucked up a song.
It was so cool.

1150
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,300
You know,
I saw something that I wouldn't have,

1151
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,890
you know,
really cool like that.

1152
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,540
Yeah.
The lip syncing thing,

1153
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:43,541
man,
when you go to see a concert and you 

1154
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:44,150
find out that people that lip sanking 
that's so disturbing.

1155
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,980
It's just what have you done with this 
is what is the point of this?

1156
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,560
It is disappointing.
What is live performance?

1157
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:56,561
Live performance is supposed to be your 
experience in this thing actually 

1158
00:51:56,561 --> 00:52:00,131
happening.
You're watching this person express 

1159
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:00,131
themselves.
Then they're not.

1160
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:02,570
They're not pretending.
You're not supposed to be pretending.

1161
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,670
Right?
Are you pretending you're you will get 

1162
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,630
money back because you're not.
That's not.

1163
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,460
That's,
that's pretending.

1164
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:15,461
That's not singing,
not gone to see plenty of shows with my 

1165
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:17,190
kids and you can tell it's like,
alright,

1166
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,530
the Mike's way over here and they're 
still sing in and it's like,

1167
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:23,060
well they have to have the backing 
tracks.

1168
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:23,550
Cut.
They're,

1169
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,730
they're dancing and they're out of 
breath like,

1170
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,820
well,
fucking stopped dancing to the song.

1171
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,090
I mean are you a dancer or you're a 
musician or singer in cardio?

1172
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,150
Just start running hills.
It can be Diego to Vail and run up.

1173
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:41,300
The 14 are exactly.
It can be done,

1174
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,100
but I've seen shows where there's that 
going on and then he'll get real,

1175
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:51,130
you know,
like sit down on a couch plugging and 

1176
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,911
acoustic and sing out a key and like 
really try and struggle with a song or 

1177
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,590
sing it,
you know,

1178
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,720
it's like,
that's natural.

1179
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,780
That feels good.
Who would not gravitate towards that 

1180
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,840
than listening to the album?
I'm going to listen to the album.

1181
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:03,920
A home.
Yeah.

1182
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,070
That's why it's cool to just see an 
acoustic set sometimes from people you 

1183
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,160
know,
just like it's as minimal as possible.

1184
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:11,750
You're breaking it down to the bare 
bones,

1185
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,390
just a guitar and sing it or something,
you know?

1186
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,520
Yeah.
That is pretty intimidating.

1187
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,640
I tell you when we do like that Neil 
young benefit where it's,

1188
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:24,690
you know,
acoustic only and if your frigging neck 

1189
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:24,690
naked up there,
dude,

1190
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,740
every note is like,
you know,

1191
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:31,530
in every fuck up on the vocal.
It's,

1192
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,310
it's great.
I mean it's like when,

1193
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,000
uh,
you know,

1194
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,250
you go or you're going to be on a TV 
thing and they put makeup on you.

1195
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,600
It's like,
why are you doing that?

1196
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,060
Right?
No,

1197
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,640
exactly.
Uh,

1198
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,930
so when people see me in person,
they think,

1199
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,410
damn,
you're one ugly fuck.

1200
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,420
It's like,
no,

1201
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,230
I want to be as ugly as possible to 
everyone.

1202
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,120
So when they see me,

1203
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,390
Oh hey,
it's,

1204
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:55,980
you know.
Exactly.

1205
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:57,060
Exactly right.
Yeah.

1206
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,120
You're not airbrushed.
Yeah.

1207
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,800
You see a photoshop yourself and it's 
like,

1208
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:06,850
you know,
they smoothed out all your lines and 

1209
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:06,850
you're like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1210
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:06,850
Sometimes

1211
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,630
sometimes you gotta to do it or like,
you know,

1212
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,410
if you're in a band like I am and the 
three guys get the stuff put on and then

1213
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:12,980
I show up,

1214
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,970
dude,
oh my God,

1215
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,410
I,
you're a shiny.

1216
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,210
It's like people going to go fuck this 
band.

1217
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:23,400
That dude sweating.
Yeah,

1218
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,940
right,
right.

1219
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,240
When it comes to the napster thing and 
what would happen with Lars,

1220
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:31,000
I feel like there's two different 
things.

1221
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,270
There's something,
there's what's really happening and this

1222
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:37,090
is how people look at it.
And what's really happening was like all

1223
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:40,200
of a sudden this door got opened up,
this Pandora's box got open,

1224
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,640
right?
And you guys were looking at it going,

1225
00:54:42,641 --> 00:54:43,630
well,
this is a,

1226
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,520
we're going to lose our record sales 
like you do.

1227
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:49,240
You understand that like people have 
been consuming music in a certain way,

1228
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,750
had been paying for music and that 
paying for music is supported.

1229
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:57,100
All these people that are a part of this
industry that makes albums,

1230
00:54:57,101 --> 00:55:00,520
there's this gigantic thing behind it.
This is all going to go away because you

1231
00:55:00,521 --> 00:55:04,030
just put a hole in the bottom of it and 
all the money is gonna get dropped out.

1232
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,550
But then the way it looks is look at 
this rich motherfucker.

1233
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,390
You know,
he doesn't,

1234
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,250
he doesn't appreciate his fans.
Hey Man,

1235
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:17,251
I can't afford your album right now.
Is it okay if I just download it for 

1236
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,430
free?
And a lot of people thought,

1237
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,000
well,
hey,

1238
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,360
people who can afford it will still be 
downloading it and then they'll buy it 

1239
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,590
when they can.
But that wasn't really the case,

1240
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:26,920
was it?

1241
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,310
No,
I don't know.

1242
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,150
I,
you know,

1243
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,010
I'm all for convenience in the 
technology moving forward,

1244
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,070
getting music out to people is the 
important part.

1245
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,520
But just make sure the artist gets what 
they deserve from it because without 

1246
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:47,730
that it's going to become a hobby.
No one wants,

1247
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,940
you know,
I don't want to see the paramedics show 

1248
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,580
up at my house and it's like a hobby for
him.

1249
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,110
Hey,
you know,

1250
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,390
I'm not really getting paid for what I 
think I should get paid for my creation,

1251
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:02,650
but I guess I'll save your life.
You know?

1252
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Maybe people didn't relate that to 
their,

1253
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,910
their career or something equivalent.

1254
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,090
I think because the money wasn't 
equivalent.

1255
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:16,040
They looked at you guys like,
you guys are already so rich.

1256
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,320
What do you give a shit?
There's no way you're going to be broke.

1257
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,590
You guys made millions and millions and 
millions of dollars to tour all over the

1258
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:26,591
world.
And it became touring thing was way 

1259
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:26,591
artists made money then.
Right?

1260
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Touring and merchandise.
And that's now how record companies are 

1261
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,210
stress.
Structuring their deals,

1262
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:32,570
you know,
hey,

1263
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:34,540
we get a piece of your merge in and

1264
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,620
touring.
See that's bizarre though.

1265
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,530
The record companies,
getting a piece of your touring to me is

1266
00:56:39,531 --> 00:56:44,531
very strange and I've seen not just a 
piece but an exorbitant amount and that 

1267
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:45,870
disturbs me.
Well,

1268
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,060
it's the only way they can survive.
No,

1269
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:52,210
they shouldn't be around them because 
then you become a parasite because you 

1270
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:52,210
don't deserve it.
I mean,

1271
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,430
especially now where bands can literally
become gigantic because of Youtube.

1272
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,820
We didn't.
Justin bieber become huge just entirely 

1273
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:00,820
because of youtube.
Jamie knows,

1274
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,520
look at them.
Fucking Justin Bieber Fan.

1275
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,560
He hides it.
Hey,

1276
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:06,890
me too.
First I heard him saying,

1277
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:08,480
I thought it was a girl.
I didn't even know it was a.

1278
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:09,410
I didn't know.

1279
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,960
Well,
I'll tell you the,

1280
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,250
the whole,
uh,

1281
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,080
you know,
would you,

1282
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,800
would you go up to the artist and take 
that out of his pocket?

1283
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,860
You know,
would you go into a record store and 

1284
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:23,860
just lift that,
steal it,

1285
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,810
run out the door with it,
you know,

1286
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,780
what'd you do that with?
You know,

1287
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,760
okay,
there's,

1288
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,110
you know,
there's,

1289
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:35,170
there's big corporations that are rich 
and would you go walk in and just steal 

1290
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:35,210
their stuff?
I mean,

1291
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,520
they're software companies that are 
massive.

1292
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,410
What'd you go in there and just rip 
their stuff.

1293
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,600
I don't get that mentality.
I don't call me old school,

1294
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,580
but you need to earn what you get and if
it gets stolen from you,

1295
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:54,581
it doesn't make any sense that it's hard
to fathom and what it seems like to me,

1296
00:57:55,641 --> 00:58:00,641
and I could be talking out my ass,
but the record companies dropped the 

1297
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:05,201
ball and the new record companies became
itunes in control at all.

1298
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:11,590
Here's how much we're charging for your 
music and here's how much you're going 

1299
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:11,590
to get.
Everyone's even.

1300
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,520
It's like some communist approach,
you know,

1301
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,220
and I,
I don't understand.

1302
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,250
I don't understand that.
If we're an artist and we make a lot of 

1303
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:21,250
money,
that's up to us.

1304
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,870
If we give all our money away to charity
or we throw it back into a movie that 

1305
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,450
bombs,
which happened,

1306
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,520
um,
that's our choice.

1307
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,880
We're the fucking artist.
We get to do what we want.

1308
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:37,090
It's our party.
You're invited and we can destroy this 

1309
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,330
thing if we want.
I don't want you to destroy it.

1310
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,730
Yeah.
The itunes distribution models of very 

1311
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:43,730
bizarre one.
It's very strange how they've,

1312
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:48,530
they don't know what they're doing.
No one knows what they're doing and you 

1313
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,431
know,
there was a system that worked and I'm 

1314
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:51,431
up for bucking the system and making it 
better,

1315
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:53,420
but it didn't,
it didn't get better.

1316
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,920
It's like the,
like you said,

1317
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:57,020
the cat got out of the bag and you can't
put it back in,

1318
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:57,920
man.
You just can't.

1319
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,470
Um,
so what do you do?

1320
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,580
Oh,
you got spotify or you got something 

1321
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,010
else where streaming's going to help get
the artists their money and it's,

1322
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,740
it's,
um,

1323
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,600
you know,
companies like that are losing money.

1324
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,870
A lot of spotify.
I don't,

1325
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:19,990
I don't,
I don't know the exact workings and I'm 

1326
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,950
not going to speak for them at all,
but it's hasn't been figured yet is what

1327
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,040
I'm

1328
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,040
saying.
It hasn't been figured out how to make a

1329
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:30,041
music model work and there's no one way.
Maybe there will never be one way again 

1330
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,690
and that's fine,
but it's still unbalanced.

1331
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:38,050
Well this technology continues to evolve
and change is sort of in a lot of ways 

1332
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:42,281
like twitter,
like how many millions and hundreds of 

1333
00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:45,460
millions of people use twitter,
but they can't figure out a way to make 

1334
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,130
money with it is this very strange thing
where people just want to use stuff,

1335
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,160
they don't want to give you any money so
you have to figure out some way to 

1336
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,491
extract money from all these people 
using stuff and if you have a streaming 

1337
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:54,491
service,
you know,

1338
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:59,470
and it's free.
It's a free streaming service and I see 

1339
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,030
some of the fees that they pay artists 
for music that's been played millions of

1340
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,730
times like wasn't what does that one 
song,

1341
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:10,330
I forget who it was like the most played
song on spotify and then they have the 

1342
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,790
numbers that the guy got for that actual
song and you're like,

1343
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,580
well where the fuck is the money going 
then?

1344
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,860
Right?
Like what?

1345
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,250
Well,
you know,

1346
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,810
we're talking a lot about money here.
There it is for Almay to,

1347
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,660
oh,
he's fucking ads.

1348
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:30,290
This is what's wrong with America.
Looks like you're using an ad blocker.

1349
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,060
Yeah.
I'm using an ad blocker to stop this.

1350
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:36,460
You Fuck Jesus Christ had a display 
here.

1351
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:40,820
It goes for made only 2 million,
$700,000

1352
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:45,821
in song writing royalties from 43 
million plays of his song that I can't 

1353
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:48,970
look at the ad because the fucking ad 
blocker.

1354
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:51,700
What,
what,

1355
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,450
what is that?
Business insider.

1356
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:54,530
Hey,
fuck you.

1357
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:58,160
Business insider.
And you either got it,

1358
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,760
you can't have the ads just pop up.
You can't.

1359
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,270
Those are gross.
Uh,

1360
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,120
it's frustrating I think.
But that's another thing.

1361
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:09,130
That's how they're making money right 
away because nobody wants to buy 

1362
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:09,130
magazines anymore.
Well,

1363
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:09,590
that's how they're making money.
Not for l,

1364
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,190
$3.
Million plays of happy 2000 bucks.

1365
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,280
That's fucking crazy.
That's a plane ticket for $43 million.

1366
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,450
I mean,
it's nuts.

1367
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,310
We talked a lot about money,
but it's not.

1368
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,460
I mean,
it's not about the money and it doesn't 

1369
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:27,740
mean it shouldn't be anybody's fricking 
business.

1370
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:30,020
How much you make,
how much he makes.

1371
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:31,430
I mean,
if you want to reveal it,

1372
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:36,850
fine,
but why is there such a stigma around 

1373
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:40,910
being successful?
I don't understand that people will just

1374
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:42,650
want to repeat,
repeat for it.

1375
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,080
You know,
there's a disingenuous idea that,

1376
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:50,130
or the disingenuous approach to art if 
you're just doing art to make money and 

1377
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:52,070
that's what people hate.

1378
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:57,270
People like what are the things that I 
loved about your new album is it's 

1379
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,730
totally clear 100 percent that this is a
real metallica album.

1380
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,400
This isn't just some ham and we need to 
make some money.

1381
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:06,580
Let's slap together some shitty ideas 
and make them metallica album out of it 

1382
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:06,890
and we know how to do it.
No,

1383
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,960
it's a fucking metallica album.
You know,

1384
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:11,450
and that's because you're creating your 
art.

1385
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,120
You're not necessarily doing it saying,
hey,

1386
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,340
if we do this,
we should be able to make money.

1387
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:21,470
Then that's I think when people think 
that someone's just trying to make 

1388
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:22,650
money,
it drives them crazy because they,

1389
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,800
someone people know in their head that 
that's not how great artists created 

1390
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:32,990
that you might have.
The money might be a consequence of 

1391
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:32,990
great art,
but it's not.

1392
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:32,990
You don't say,
well,

1393
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,070
let's make a movie that makes $100,
million dollars.

1394
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:36,930
There's going to be awesome.
No the fuck it's not.

1395
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:42,080
That's gonna be a bunch of Shitty CGI 
and explosions and a hot girl and the 

1396
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,470
guy and the girl kiss at the end and 
fuck you.

1397
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:46,380
I saw it all coming.
It's been done before and it's been done

1398
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:49,740
before because you're just slapping 
together a formula and that stuff drives

1399
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:53,220
people nuts when you know that someone 
is doing something just for money,

1400
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:58,310
so whenever money gets discussed,
people automatically get that sort of 

1401
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,430
weird distaste,
that God's money,

1402
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,560
that fucking money is ruining 
everything.

1403
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:06,390
They're going to be doing ballads on 
some teenage angst fucking movie next.

1404
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,450
Right?
Well,

1405
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,760
that's not hard wired,
that's for sure.

1406
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,080
No,
no,

1407
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,340
we're still.
We're still.

1408
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,330
We're men.
We're still searching for.

1409
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,360
Still doing it.
Still searching for the right.

1410
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,490
The best.
The ultimate riff.

1411
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,850
You're still doing it.
That's what's most important.

1412
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:25,680
You're still doing it and it can be 
done.

1413
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,670
I think when we were kids,
there weren't old rockers.

1414
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,680
You know,
I'm 49.

1415
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,910
How old are you?
Fifty three.

1416
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,120
When we were kids.
Who the fuck was an old rocker?

1417
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,820
You know Jerry Lee Lewis is pretty old.
He's still out there doing it.

1418
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,010
Chuck Berry's still touring.
Holy Shit,

1419
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:46,011
you know,
but now you got fucking Mick Jagger's 

1420
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:48,390
going crazy on stage.
He's still a kid.

1421
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,170
Fucking kid.
The last sperm,

1422
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:57,171
the fucking last survivor with one sperm
with the fucking ax wound across his 

1423
01:03:57,171 --> 01:04:02,001
face,
marches through the battlefield and 

1424
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:03,480
punches through that egg.
I made it God damn pirate.

1425
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:09,150
But I mean that guy still out there 
smashing it.

1426
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,560
Like I've seen him write his fucking 
concerts are rockin.

1427
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,000
He's got energy.

1428
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:20,260
Not only him,
but the one person that we get compared 

1429
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:20,300
to the stone was like,
how long are you going to do this as the

1430
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:21,100
question.
Right,

1431
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:23,570
right.
I don't know when it's.

1432
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,400
If it's still fun,
we're going to do it.

1433
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,800
When it's not fun,
then we'll let you know.

1434
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,930
Yeah.
But yeah,

1435
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,470
Mick Jagger and the stones,
Mick Jagger for sure he's out there.

1436
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:34,790
He's doing his thing.
He's,

1437
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,710
he's all over the place,
you know,

1438
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,570
the stones,
music wise,

1439
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,430
uh,
and the rest of the band,

1440
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,090
you know,
they're,

1441
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:42,950
they're,
they're doing what they've always done,

1442
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,640
but it's not the physicality like,
say metallica has.

1443
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:47,570
So,
you know,

1444
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,070
uh,
you know,

1445
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,410
Charlie Watts's not lars Olrick,
you know,

1446
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,740
like,
fuck,

1447
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,510
you know,
right.

1448
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,530
At some point your body's saying,
oh boy,

1449
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,550
we can't do this for this long anymore.
Let's take a break.

1450
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,940
Uh,
so keeping yourself healthy and fit in a

1451
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:07,730
physical,
mental and spiritual sense.

1452
01:05:07,731 --> 01:05:12,731
You got to do all of that for sanity 
sake and other bands that are out there 

1453
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:18,551
that are doing it,
that angus young is probably the guy or 

1454
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:21,250
I definitely take my hat off for that 
dude is insane.

1455
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,940
And so,
I don't know,

1456
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,290
you must sweat gallons every show and 
he's,

1457
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,660
you know,
he's like the size,

1458
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,760
you know,
he's like a little dude.

1459
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,570
He is in health and he's out.
Where's that water coming from?

1460
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,010
How can you sweat,
you sweat your body weight,

1461
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:44,130
you know,
and he's out there headbanging and rock 

1462
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:44,130
and I mean,
and he's,

1463
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,750
he's up there in age too.
So that's the person,

1464
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,240
we're kind of a,
I guess seeing how.

1465
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:53,560
How long can this guy go?
The canary in the coal mine.

1466
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,820
He is,
man.

1467
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,970
Is he not a fucking brain damage from 
that head banging like,

1468
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:00,820
well,
soccer players getting brain dead.

1469
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,780
He might,
but he might give a fuck.

1470
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,240
Like that's the price you pay.
Take some vitamins,

1471
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:06,320
get back out there,
bitch.

1472
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,040
Yeah.
Well I'll tell you,

1473
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,950
out of the big four,
know the big four.

1474
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:13,920
Metallica slayer,
megadeath anthrax,

1475
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:19,040
these four bands that are still going 
and unbelievably after 35 years myself,

1476
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:25,130
Dave Mustaine and Tom Arrive all had 
neck surgery from all of this head.

1477
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,300
Neck surgery.
What kind of neck surgery?

1478
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,140
Uh,
it was a partial diskectomy in like c,

1479
01:06:31,141 --> 01:06:32,160
I think c six.
Okay.

1480
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:37,161
So you had a bulging disc.
It was we pressing on your nerve would 

1481
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:37,161
rest on my.
Yeah,

1482
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:37,700
my,
my arm.

1483
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:37,950
I couldn't

1484
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,550
pick my nerve.
So it was like making your hands numb.

1485
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,680
Yeah.
Well I couldn't pick my arm up.

1486
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,920
Did you ever do decompression?
Like spinal decompression chamber?

1487
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:49,970
No.
Spinal decompression.

1488
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:52,730
Like they put a harness on your neck and
they stretch your neck.

1489
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:53,970
Did they do that?
Yeah.

1490
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:59,020
Do you have one of those at home?
I don't need to get one of those 

1491
01:06:59,020 --> 01:06:59,150
gigantic.
It's so simple.

1492
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:01,310
It's just a harness that you put on 
straps,

1493
01:07:01,311 --> 01:07:06,311
velcro around it.
It connects to a door at the top of a 

1494
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:06,950
door and you just sit down a chair and 
it's like you're hanging yourself.

1495
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:07,550
You pull it,
click,

1496
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:12,610
click this and it just stretches.
It carries your weight a little bit on 

1497
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:12,740
your neck.
You're still sitting.

1498
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,670
You could totally.
That's it.

1499
01:07:13,671 --> 01:07:16,550
Like there seat up in that time.
I have one of those in my house.

1500
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,840
It's fucking invaluable.

1501
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:23,050
It's so giant because it's the only way 
to legitimately stretch your neck and a 

1502
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:27,191
lot of spinal decompression.
Lot of bolts discs and the pain and 

1503
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,680
discomfort associated with it.
You can mitigate a lot of that with one 

1504
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:32,680
of those things.
It's big.

1505
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,980
I don't have to wear that shirt right 
now.

1506
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:39,010
You wear whatever you want to go naked.
I got another thing I'm going to show 

1507
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:39,890
you that's called the iron neck.
That'll strengthen your neck up.

1508
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,120
We were looking at that.
Yeah.

1509
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:44,030
I'll show you how to do it.
This guy just brought it in last week.

1510
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,830
I'm.
I'm obsessed with it.

1511
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,930
It's fucking amazing.
And it's also good.

1512
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:49,940
It's not difficult to do.
It's pretty easy to do,

1513
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,310
but it's also good for not just 
strengthening your neck,

1514
01:07:52,311 --> 01:07:54,080
but increasing your range of motion.
Hey,

1515
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:59,110
great.
I can imagine they're all after a while,

1516
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:00,080
man.

1517
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,490
Yeah.
Not just that,

1518
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:03,410
but just the posture of your guitar,
you know,

1519
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,720
it's,
you know,

1520
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,740
you're playing really low and you're 
down and you're back.

1521
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,260
You know,
there's posture stuff,

1522
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:12,200
but I agree that making,
making,

1523
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,920
making it straight,
making your back straight is harder now 

1524
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,250
than it was leaning against the wall and
thinking,

1525
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,410
wow,
I don't want to be that old dude.

1526
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,650
Punched over the middle of his back is 
like a frigging,

1527
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:25,880
you know,
like the,

1528
01:08:25,881 --> 01:08:26,390
uh,
you know,

1529
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,150
hunchback of Notre Dame or something.
It creeps in on you.

1530
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:34,151
You don't even realize it's happening 
until it's too late and then you can't 

1531
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:34,151
straighten it back up again.
Right.

1532
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:34,580
Do you exercise?
Yeah.

1533
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:38,500
What do you do?
I got a physical trainer in Vail,

1534
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,560
uh,
basically keeping range of motion going 

1535
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:43,560
core,
uh,

1536
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,680
you know,
lots of hiking,

1537
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,210
treadmill,
stuff like that.

1538
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,670
I'm not so much,
you know,

1539
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:54,671
power bulking up or anything,
but just trying to stay mobile.

1540
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:58,760
I've got a,
and I'm sure everyone my age has some of

1541
01:08:58,761 --> 01:08:59,450
it.
It's a,

1542
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:04,770
you know,
a spinal stenosis where there's calcium 

1543
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:04,790
and,
you know,

1544
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
kind of our threat,
arthritic buildup around the nerves 

1545
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,840
around your spinal cord.
So keeping that mobile,

1546
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:16,841
keeping things moving.
I go to a holistic healer to who was 

1547
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:19,640
breaking up calcium on,
on fingers and toes and stuff.

1548
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:24,641
And uh,
I'm doing all I can do and all I can to 

1549
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,510
get up there and be angus young still.
Yeah.

1550
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:31,511
Well,
if you're experiencing issues with 

1551
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:31,511
stenosis,
two,

1552
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:31,850
that,
that machine can help that a lot.

1553
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:33,720
Strengthen your,
your whole spinal cord.

1554
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,480
And I got another thing in the back.
I want to show you.

1555
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:37,670
It's called the reverse hyper.
And actually,

1556
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:38,720
uh,
this is it right here.

1557
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,380
It actually helps decompress your body.
Um,

1558
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,950
it decompresses your spinal column and 
strengthens it at the same time.

1559
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,200
It's created by that.
See that guy with the black shirt.

1560
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:49,830
That guy's a fucking psychopath.
Stems,

1561
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,200
Louie Simmons,
great guy.

1562
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:55,670
We interviewed him for the podcast.
He's completely out of his fucking mind.

1563
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,340
He's been on steroids straight since 
1976.

1564
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:03,341
He's never gone off of them,
pointed that lady like something's 

1565
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:07,190
happening.
So fuck he's explaining what it does to 

1566
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:07,190
your back.
But uh,

1567
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,200
that machine man,
anybody with back issues,

1568
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:14,201
any back issue at all because what that 
machine does is it allows your back to 

1569
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:16,340
actively decompress from the lower back 
all the way up to your,

1570
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,750
um,
to your neck area and uh,

1571
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,900
it,
it strengthens everything and decompress

1572
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,010
it.

1573
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:27,010
So it lengthens your spine.
It stretches all that tissue out and 

1574
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:30,020
pulls all that,
all the Fascia and all that stuff out.

1575
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:35,050
Like you could see him like 
demonstrating in here when this woman 

1576
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,860
gets up there and see as it goes down,
it's actually pulling your back.

1577
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,550
And that's like the only exercise that 
I've ever seen that decompresses.

1578
01:10:40,551 --> 01:10:43,520
And then on the lift up strengthens all 
those muscles.

1579
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:48,521
And then on the way down,
it pulls them down and have a bunch of 

1580
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:49,160
different things in the back because 
I've had some disc issues myself,

1581
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,350
but I took care of all of them without 
surgery.

1582
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,330
Right on.
But it wasn't.

1583
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,860
The doctors are trying to cut me like 
they,

1584
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:57,740
that's the immediate thing.
Like,

1585
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,290
you're going to need surgery,
get in there,

1586
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,960
we'll probably eventually going to have 
to have your disks a fuse.

1587
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:02,720
And I was like,
what?

1588
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,760
Like wait a minute,
I'm moving around.

1589
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,360
Fine.
Like,

1590
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:06,170
why?
How come?

1591
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,480
How come you guarantee that it's gonna 
get worse?

1592
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:11,690
Like why is it that when you're one at 
one state,

1593
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,130
they never think you can improve this

1594
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,960
with physical therapy and it can get 
better.

1595
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,210
Their immediate reaction is it's gonna 
get worse.

1596
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,400
So count on getting the surgery.
Oh,

1597
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,300
that's what they know and that's what 
they're schooled on.

1598
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:27,301
And uh,
I love the fact that you're giving them 

1599
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:27,301
the finger and say,
Hey,

1600
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:27,540
no,
I don't have to go down that path.

1601
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,150
I'm going to try it this way.
And uh,

1602
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,410
there are lots of different ways to do 
that.

1603
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:35,700
And unfortunately mine was,
it was touching the nerve and I couldn't

1604
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:39,210
lift my arm and it was atrophy happening
and so something had to happen.

1605
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:41,730
But my back,
yeah,

1606
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:42,890
I've gone onto,
I've had like,

1607
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,110
you know,
a ruptured discs,

1608
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:51,060
a broken ribs going on tour,
you know,

1609
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,880
singing with two broken ribs.
Not Fun.

1610
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,290
Uh,
but yeah,

1611
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:58,470
the back man when it,
when it hurts,

1612
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,860
you turn into a fucking baby man.
I just like,

1613
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,690
eh.

1614
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:07,710
No.
You could have like a torn calf muscle 

1615
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:07,710
and you limp around,
but you seem to be okay.

1616
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:07,920
But you're back.
You're like,

1617
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,430
I can't do anything.
My life's over.

1618
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:13,060
Yeah.
But.

1619
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,640
All right,
well go see your,

1620
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,540
your torture chamber or your.
Do you do yoga?

1621
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,590
No,
no,

1622
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,380
no.
You gotta do gotTa get involved?

1623
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,200
Yeah,
it seems like it seems fucking.

1624
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,750
Seems like everything wrong.
Like housewives,

1625
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,730
bullshit.
Maybe gay dude.

1626
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:31,470
I don't care about doing any of that 
crap.

1627
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,360
If it's going to help me,
it will.

1628
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,690
I'm into it.
Anybody over 40 in particular?

1629
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:39,030
Yoga is gigantic especially.
Yeah.

1630
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,780
Cool.
Well,

1631
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:41,970
I mean,
I've done things where,

1632
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:42,600
you know,
okay,

1633
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:47,601
we're going to ask your body some 
questions and here put this statement 

1634
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:51,441
against your chest or here,
what are these colored glasses and you 

1635
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:51,441
know,
hey,

1636
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:53,220
here's tuning forks on your body,
you know,

1637
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,220
things like that,
you know,

1638
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,390
I'm totally,
I'm an explorer.

1639
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,520
I'd like to.
And if it works,

1640
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,660
cool.
If it doesn't work.

1641
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,800
Hey,
I tried it.

1642
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,530
What was the question you had to ask 
your body?

1643
01:13:03,531 --> 01:13:05,670
You wrote it down on a piece of paper 
and put it to your chest?

1644
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,470
Yeah.
What was the question?

1645
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,540
Uh,
am I retarded?

1646
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,470
Never go full retard.
Like a champagne for that?

1647
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,850
No,
it didn't look right.

1648
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,290
Uh,
I don't know what the question was.

1649
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:19,940
Like,
why am,

1650
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:25,040
why am I doing this?
Why am I writing a piece of paper and 

1651
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,340
putting it on my chest?
Something like,

1652
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,050
you know,
am I willing to get healthy?

1653
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:29,070
Something like that,
you know,

1654
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:29,480
us,
uh,

1655
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,840
uh,
I'd like to be friends with my body 

1656
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,270
instead of abusing it,
you know,

1657
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,150
stuff like that.
So well,

1658
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:41,220
the intensity of your performances.
I mean,

1659
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:44,010
I just can only imagine the,
the physical strain that it puts in your

1660
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:49,011
body.
That's why I wanted to ask you about 

1661
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:49,011
fitness.
Like you Kinda have to be in shape to do

1662
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,690
metallica concerts at 30.
Forget about it.

1663
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:52,780
Fifty three.
Yeah.

1664
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,230
Well we have,
we have pet on the road,

1665
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:56,290
uh,
uh,

1666
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,180
a therapist who will stretch us out.
Do A.

1667
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,030
No,
we're all different.

1668
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,410
You know,
my back,

1669
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:03,630
my neck,
Robert's calves,

1670
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,960
you know,
he's this CAC.

1671
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:08,360
Yeah,
it's like a,

1672
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,860
he's like a,
he's these frigging Tarzan,

1673
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,110
that guy.
He's gets way

1674
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:12,760
down,
you know,

1675
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:16,270
it.
Surfer calves and finger or his forearms

1676
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,510
from playing with his fingers.
They cramp up.

1677
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:20,840
So,
uh,

1678
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,290
and then lars largest shoulder or this 
one,

1679
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:24,600
you know,
high hat.

1680
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,090
Um,
so we've all got our thing,

1681
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,530
Kirk's risks and this guy is out there 
helping us and you know,

1682
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:35,920
he'll,
he'll give us things to try and work on.

1683
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,640
And um,
you know,

1684
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:42,690
we all,
we all have to have our regiments out 

1685
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:45,151
here.
It's like you take apart a home on the 

1686
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:45,151
road,
you know,

1687
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:48,361
it's not like I need my,
I need my hotel room decorated like my 

1688
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:49,680
house,
you know,

1689
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:54,810
bring my bed on tour and not that,
but it's people that can help me out on 

1690
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,950
the road.
Some people do go crazy like that,

1691
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,810
right?
Yeah.

1692
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:04,290
I want you to recreate the a.
and I've heard stories and it's kind of 

1693
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:04,290
funny.

1694
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,680
Maybe it's true.
Maybe it's not,

1695
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:08,860
I don't want to continue a rumor,
but just hearing that,

1696
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:11,050
yeah,
some of the guys in the stones will have

1697
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:15,220
their decorator come in and,
and they've decorated their hotel room,

1698
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:20,230
like their home or something,
put their favorite things in there and 

1699
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:24,631
all that.
And then they're there for a night and 

1700
01:15:24,631 --> 01:15:26,701
then they go off to the next place and 
the decorator meets them in advance and 

1701
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:27,280
sets it up at the next spot to,
uh,

1702
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,030
yeah,
I mean,

1703
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:30,460
yeah,
I guess if you're fucking Mick Jagger,

1704
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,350
whatever,
do whatever the hell you want.

1705
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:34,600
Your 90,000
years old,

1706
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:36,340
you're still getting chicks pregnant.
Hey,

1707
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,550
what kind of reality does that guy live 
in Houma to say it's wrong,

1708
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:40,420
man,
you know?

1709
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,690
Yeah.
Uh,

1710
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:46,870
you do what you want and feel good about
it when you go to bed and wake up and 

1711
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,870
go,
okay,

1712
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,350
I'm all right.

1713
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,910
You know,
that's the main thing,

1714
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:51,040
you know,
if I've gone to bed and say,

1715
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,420
man,
that was stupid.

1716
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:53,800
Or actually,
yeah,

1717
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:58,540
the other day it's pretty stupid that I 
gotta call this guy and tell him what we

1718
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,850
were doing this.
Uh,

1719
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,150
oh,
what was it?

1720
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,070
Uh,
the Guy Billy on the street,

1721
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,560
you know,
that billy on the street with a,

1722
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,450
a billy idol,
I think his name is,

1723
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,250
and he just,
you know,

1724
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:11,170
he's on the street just running up to 
people.

1725
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:11,980
Say,
look,

1726
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,360
hey.
Yeah,

1727
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:14,720
like quiz shows.
You like it,

1728
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,420
what's the name of Adele's album?
No,

1729
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:18,310
you suck.
And then run off to the next person,

1730
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,440
you know,
really manic kind of crazy stuff.

1731
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,410
We did that in a store with him the 
other day.

1732
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:27,970
We went shopping at a supermarket and a 
in a,

1733
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,470
uh,
in a shopping cart,

1734
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,200
metallics,
pushing a shopping cart around.

1735
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,030
He's running up to people going,
hey,

1736
01:16:34,031 --> 01:16:36,280
what are you buying today?
What A.

1737
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,210
Oh,
you're making a salad.

1738
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:42,450
Hey,
do you want to get pumped up while 

1739
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:42,450
you're shopping?
We got metallica here to pump you up.

1740
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:47,130
So we pressed the play button and same 
as playing rock joke.

1741
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,050
Come on,
we're a park.

1742
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:50,570
Yeah,
yeah,

1743
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:55,571
yeah.
And we're filling up their car with 

1744
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:55,571
stuff they don't need no fuck.
And um,

1745
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:56,140
uh,
this one guy,

1746
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:01,700
this one guy who was at the salad bar 
and he looked like he just took a break 

1747
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:01,700
from work,
you know,

1748
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:06,060
it was on his lunch break and I start 
filling up a salad with peas and all 

1749
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,120
kinds of stuff and we're throwing salad 
over the place.

1750
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:08,960
And uh,
uh,

1751
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,530
I turned around,
did grab some more stuff.

1752
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,230
Lars had put dressing on a salad.
I didn't know that.

1753
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,480
So at the end when we took off,
I just,

1754
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:23,680
I wanted to just throw it in his face 
like it was dry salad and the dressing 

1755
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:24,830
when all over him,
he's like,

1756
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,200
you fuckers like,
oops,

1757
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,430
that backfired.
Okay.

1758
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:29,910
We've gone a little too far.
You know,

1759
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:33,350
I'm 18 again in trashing the hotel room.
Okay.

1760
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:38,590
We're at the supermarket.
She allowed James Wright who organized 

1761
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:38,900
this fucking thing.
Oh,

1762
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:43,930
a w.
was it just part of our Promo tour 

1763
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:43,950
thing,
you know?

1764
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,550
Um,
and uh,

1765
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,910
we're trying to do funny,
do cool different stuff.

1766
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,170
You know,
some of these shows they're,

1767
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,840
you know,
they get wacky and uh,

1768
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,810
uh,
I don't know if you saw the,

1769
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,230
the metallica playing with the roots on 
Jimmy Fallon.

1770
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,950
Plan Sandman on the little.
No,

1771
01:18:01,951 --> 01:18:02,130
I didn't

1772
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:02,850
see that.

1773
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:07,130
We got little recorders and they know a 
little,

1774
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:09,290
you know,
like a little drum sets,

1775
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,490
you know,
little kids instruments.

1776
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,610
That was a lot of fun.
So we're getting,

1777
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,500
you know,
getting to have some fun and kind of not

1778
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,040
be too serious about all of this.
You know what,

1779
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,060
that's cool

1780
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,120
thing to see someone who's as big as you
are in a band that's just a goddamn 

1781
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,110
gigantic monolith,
epic band.

1782
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,360
But you guys are silly.
You guys are pretty Goddamn epic.

1783
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:32,110
All right.
I think you know that.

1784
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,390
Well,
the fact that here it is,

1785
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:40,090
give me some volume.
What's the matter?

1786
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:42,650
Put it in,

1787
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:50,030
we'll get the roots are good man.
Great Band.

1788
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:06,270
Jimmy Fallon is such a silly guy.
We were having some fun.

1789
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:12,480
Definitely having some fun there.

1790
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:17,590
Well that's,
that's also a cool thing to see from a 

1791
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,770
fucking hard band too.
I mean,

1792
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,290
you guys don't necessarily take.
I mean,

1793
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,780
you obviously take yourself seriously.
You're obviously,

1794
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:27,410
you're serious about what you do.
Take yourself too seriously.

1795
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:27,950
Seriously.

1796
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,720
About your art or art.
When we write a song,

1797
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,060
it's,
we're serious about this,

1798
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,190
but when we go out,
when we play live,

1799
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,750
I mean we're,
you know,

1800
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:41,380
we're not,
we're not the best musicians separately,

1801
01:19:41,381 --> 01:19:42,410
I would say,
um,

1802
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:46,600
and someone might disagree,
but when you put us together,

1803
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:49,810
something happens and we create 
something really cool.

1804
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:54,811
There's an energy.
And I think back from the very 

1805
01:19:55,151 --> 01:19:58,630
beginning,
like when someone fucked up the song,

1806
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,910
we just stopped.
It's like,

1807
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,860
Oh man,
let's try it again.

1808
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,210
We can do this better.
You know?

1809
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:08,190
And people said with the,
you're not supposed to do that.

1810
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,410
Do.
They're not very professional.

1811
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,100
It's like,
yeah,

1812
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:12,960
but that's what happened.
I mean,

1813
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:18,150
if we're honest,
we want to do it better and we know we 

1814
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,541
can,
so we're going to stop it and do it 

1815
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:20,541
again,
you know?

1816
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:20,541
Uh,
or I mean,

1817
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:24,861
just like the other day I was like this 
frigging brainfart on stage where we're 

1818
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,160
up there and they play the one,
the intro to one,

1819
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,980
which is like this army,
heck you,

1820
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:33,930
you know,
all the war going on.

1821
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:37,080
And then I start this thing and I 
started the wrong song.

1822
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,690
I started to fade to black instead of a 
different song.

1823
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,610
I'm standing there going,
what do I do now?

1824
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:50,210
And in like,
this wave of shame comes over you like 

1825
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:50,500
you're a bad man.
Know.

1826
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,780
And I'm looking over my roadie and 
they're going not that song.

1827
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,830
And I look at it,
it's like,

1828
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,030
okay,
I'll stop it.

1829
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:01,200
And then I went to the other song and 
then I'm able later to go up and say,

1830
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,840
hey,
you want to hear faded black again?

1831
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:07,230
You know,
you got a joke about it or else you,

1832
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:10,410
you.
It's like you become.

1833
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,440
It's like you gotta expose your 
vulnerable parts.

1834
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:18,650
People people make.
We'll make fun of that and they'll take 

1835
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:22,440
advantage of it sometimes,
but most of the times people will relate

1836
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:23,100
to it.
Like,

1837
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,330
ah,
he's human.

1838
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,740
He fucked up.
Okay.

1839
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,710
You know,
so trusting that there's more,

1840
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,190
there's more lifeguards than sharks out 
there most of the time.

1841
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:32,750
Yeah.

1842
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:37,930
I think also there's a beat.
People differentiate the big difference 

1843
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,430
between a mistake and someone who's 
careless or doesn't give a fuck.

1844
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,900
Very true.
Very true.

1845
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:47,050
And that's just.
You guys are obviously very serious 

1846
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:49,391
about what you do,
but everybody occasionally has a brain 

1847
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:49,391
fart.
There's just no getting around it.

1848
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:54,190
I've been in the middle of a UFC 
broadcasts and I fucking forget 

1849
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:57,521
someone's name and I called their fights
100 times and I can't remember why I 

1850
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:02,201
can't remember the name and then for 
whatever reason I have to look down at 

1851
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:02,600
my notes in there it is,
and I'm just angry with myself.

1852
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:07,830
Just sometimes it just doesn't work and 
there's no rhyme or reason to why your 

1853
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,830
brain doesn't work.
Right?

1854
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,850
Sometimes.

1855
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,440
So you're tough on yourself.
Oh yeah,

1856
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,400
I'm horrible myself.
Yeah.

1857
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:16,990
You say this to yourself that you 
wouldn't even say to your worst enemy.

1858
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,030
I don't.
There's no words.

1859
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,590
I don't just,
it just feelings.

1860
01:22:20,591 --> 01:22:25,380
Just I could have a show where I

1861
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,860
kill,
but I fuck up one word and one joke and 

1862
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,140
that's all I can think of.
That's just no way.

1863
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:34,080
If you care about what you do,
that's just part of it.

1864
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,600
Absolutely.
And that's it.

1865
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:40,190
There's a healthy part to that and then 
moving on from it is,

1866
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:43,080
it's easier now than it used to be.
It would just,

1867
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,810
it would live in me for awhile.
Like,

1868
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,210
Oh dude,
you forgot the words to that song,

1869
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:51,020
and then it becomes a mental block to 
get up there and you go,

1870
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,150
Oh shit,
like,

1871
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:52,840
uh,
you know,

1872
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:54,500
like a kicker or something,
you know,

1873
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,230
a guy going to kick a field goal.
It's like,

1874
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:56,990
Oh,
I missed that one.

1875
01:22:56,991 --> 01:22:58,760
I can't believe I did.
Then the next one,

1876
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,650
oh my God,
now it's a thing,

1877
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,190
you know?
Oh,

1878
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,460
so getting over those mental.
Yeah.

1879
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,010
Fighters a fight and then

1880
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,240
they come back and then you see the 
discomfort.

1881
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,070
You can see the confusion and the fear 
and that's,

1882
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:15,460
uh,
that's one of the side,

1883
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:20,500
I think,
psychological issues or some of the 

1884
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,501
hardest issues that people ever overcome
and it's just literally like a pattern 

1885
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:26,431
of thought in your mind or if you just 
decide that you're not as good as you 

1886
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:28,220
used to be,
you can manifest that in there.

1887
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:30,280
Like physically you can do all the same 
things.

1888
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,190
That is so cool.
So

1889
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:33,860
crazy.
The power of thought.

1890
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:38,890
The power of my mind is it's pretty 
dangerous at times and being creative,

1891
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,990
a makeup,
all kinds of crap,

1892
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:47,260
you know,
like a large largest doing that just to 

1893
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:47,260
fuck with me.
I know it.

1894
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,090
And then you talk to them later.
It's like,

1895
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,480
what are you talking about?
What?

1896
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,600
Yeah,
that's,

1897
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,550
that's pretty.
It's,

1898
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,210
it's,
it's a curse and a gift that creativity,

1899
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,820
you know,
how hard was it for you to get sober?

1900
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:05,060
A fear was a big motivator in that for 
me,

1901
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:09,230
you know,
losing my family was.

1902
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:14,650
That was,
that was the thing that scared me so 

1903
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:15,010
much.
That was the bottom I hit that my family

1904
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:20,011
is going to go away because of my 
behaviors that I brought home from the 

1905
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:23,651
road.
I got kicked out of the house by my 

1906
01:24:23,651 --> 01:24:24,760
wife.
I was living on my own somewhere and you

1907
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:27,140
know,
I did not want that.

1908
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:30,530
And maybe it's part of my upbringing,
you know,

1909
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:33,050
um,
my family kinda does sitting graded when

1910
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:33,920
I was a kid,
you know,

1911
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,990
father left,
my mother passed away.

1912
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:40,280
I live with my brother and then Kinda 
just all like the family,

1913
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,600
you know,
where'd my stuff go?

1914
01:24:41,601 --> 01:24:44,690
Where,
where it just kind of floated away and I

1915
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:46,760
do not want that happening,
you know,

1916
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,730
no matter what's going on,
we're gonna talk this stuff out and make

1917
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:50,750
it work.
You know,

1918
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,730
and my wife's have the same,
uh,

1919
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,800
same idea,
same thought that,

1920
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:56,270
you know,
her,

1921
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,460
her family,
she was the invisible kid too,

1922
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,800
you know,
so we relate a lot.

1923
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:04,190
So there's no way we're going to let you
know any argument,

1924
01:25:04,191 --> 01:25:06,410
get in the way or just,
you know,

1925
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:09,020
we're survivors,
we're survivors and we're gonna.

1926
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,240
We're gonna talk through it.
No matter how much.

1927
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:12,590
And you know,
she,

1928
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:15,290
she did the right thing,
she kicked my ass,

1929
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,970
right the hell out of the house,
you know,

1930
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:21,290
and um,
that scared the shit out of me.

1931
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:22,910
So.
And she said,

1932
01:25:22,911 --> 01:25:27,911
hey,
you're not just going to the therapist 

1933
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:30,041
now in this nuts talking about this.
You got to go somewhere and sort this 

1934
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:30,890
shit out.
So that's what I did.

1935
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:35,190
So Rehab did Rehab really worked for me.
Helen,

1936
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:40,250
jeff to go for a while.
What worked for me was a seven weeks 

1937
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:47,710
someplace like basically tearing you 
down to bones,

1938
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:53,540
ripping your life apart.
Anything that you thought about yourself

1939
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:56,390
or what it was,
anything you thought you had,

1940
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,160
your family,
your career,

1941
01:25:58,161 --> 01:26:01,700
your,
anything gone strip you down to just,

1942
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:03,050
okay,
you're,

1943
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,530
here's how you were when you were born.
You were okay,

1944
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,970
you're a good,
good person.

1945
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,650
Let's get back to that again.
And then they slowly rebuild you.

1946
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,950
And then I went to a,
uh,

1947
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,960
another they call them aftercare places.
I went there to a couple different ones 

1948
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:24,200
and they fine tune stuff and get 
integrated back into life.

1949
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,590
Because when you're in this cocoon and 
your frigging raw,

1950
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:32,620
I mean,
I was raw meat when I came out and you 

1951
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:32,620
can see it in some kind of monster 
movie.

1952
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:37,450
I was pretty raw still.
I didn't know what I could or what I 

1953
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,330
should or shouldn't do,
you know.

1954
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,920
Um,
so the,

1955
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:44,660
the last place we went to was a place 
that helps relationships.

1956
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,700
So they got me and my wife together and 
we'd see people separately and then come

1957
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:54,701
together and talk about what we did and 
communication frigging saved my life 

1958
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,030
saved,
uh,

1959
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,760
our family.
Um,

1960
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:03,230
and working through that stuff.
So very grateful for my wife.

1961
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:05,930
She's the one that didn't ask for this 
shit.

1962
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:11,410
She walked through fire with me and we 
walked out together stronger,

1963
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,810
way stronger than we ever would have 
been before.

1964
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:17,180
And you know,
my kids know my story,

1965
01:27:17,181 --> 01:27:22,181
my kids know my struggles and they 
respect that.

1966
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:27,760
They respect me and a different way.
I don't have to tell them what to do all

1967
01:27:28,251 --> 01:27:29,990
the time or just be like,
I'm this.

1968
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:33,380
I can say sorry.
I can tell them,

1969
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,120
hey,
here's what happened when I did that.

1970
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:37,640
And you know,
I don't need to preach to them.

1971
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,960
They got their own stuff,
but now they,

1972
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,570
now they goof with me.
I ruined my trust with my family and now

1973
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,820
by some miracle they are goofing with 
me.

1974
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:49,790
It's like,
Dad,

1975
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:51,200
shut up.
What do you get them like,

1976
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:52,280
come on,
you know,

1977
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,010
your overblowing this your way out of 
dad,

1978
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:57,330
you're taken up way too much space here.
Okay.

1979
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:03,560
So they helped me and I realized that 
there is help in a loving way.

1980
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,260
How long have you been sober now?
15.

1981
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,010
Fifteen years.

1982
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:10,090
Did it start out when you,
when you first started doing it,

1983
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:13,190
did it feel like as you broke through 
and you,

1984
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,280
you know,
you went to therapy and you got out of 

1985
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Rehab and you're going through this 
whole thing.

1986
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,400
Was there a,
like a shaky leg period where you're 

1987
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:23,400
like,
man,

1988
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,000
do I know who I am anymore?
Oh absolutely.

1989
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,290
That was it.
That was,

1990
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:27,910
that is,

1991
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,440
you know,
the power of the mind and how,

1992
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:32,340
you know,
here's how my life works.

1993
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:37,020
And to actually just completely throw 
that away and start over,

1994
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,040
it's like,
well,

1995
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,960
wait a minute,
who am I without this?

1996
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:40,820
Um,
uh,

1997
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,230
I can't talk to people.
I'm like,

1998
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:45,060
I'm anxious,
I'm shy.

1999
01:28:45,061 --> 01:28:48,630
I'm all of the stuff that I thought 
booze was helping me with,

2000
01:28:48,631 --> 01:28:50,480
or you know,
you know,

2001
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,380
booze,
drugs,

2002
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,230
women,
a shopping,

2003
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,660
eating,
gambling,

2004
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,750
you know,
there's so many things that can manifest

2005
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:05,220
out that it's,
it all goes back to one core thing.

2006
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:07,650
It's like I don't,
I don't really know who I am.

2007
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,640
So it took years and years and years to 
figure out,

2008
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:13,080
okay,
I like that.

2009
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,330
That's part of me.
And this is part of me,

2010
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,170
the anger,
the,

2011
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:16,590
the,
the,

2012
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:17,610
the,
you know,

2013
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:19,890
the quirkiness,
the dork part of me,

2014
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,600
all these little things that make me,
I got to hug them,

2015
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:25,110
I accept them,
you know,

2016
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,260
and quit running from them and 
pretending like I am some immovable 

2017
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,250
object on stage,
that's tough and you know,

2018
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,110
nothing can do,
you know,

2019
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,010
nothing going to hurt me.

2020
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,270
But inside,
you know,

2021
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,440
it's kind of a cliche saying that,
you know,

2022
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:45,441
the harder that external shield,
the softer the inside and the more 

2023
01:29:45,441 --> 01:29:47,820
vulnerable and,
and balancing that,

2024
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:50,670
you know,
almost like you're concentrating so much

2025
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:52,650
on the outside that you ignore the 
inside.

2026
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,730
Totally,
totally.

2027
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:57,180
And then forget what I really want and 
then you lose yourself in that other,

2028
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:00,780
that other person and yeah,
being in a band,

2029
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:05,440
certainly a accelerated that,
you know,

2030
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,760
there's,
there was drink and drugs and all kinds 

2031
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,921
of stuff just thrown at you all the time
and it's starts off as a fun little 

2032
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:17,181
thing and then it turns into whiskey and
escape and then all of a sudden you 

2033
01:30:17,181 --> 01:30:20,571
don't really,
you don't remember why you're out there 

2034
01:30:20,571 --> 01:30:21,270
doing stuff.
I went on tour just so I could go to the

2035
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:21,990
Strip club,
you know,

2036
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,220
hey,
we're going to this place,

2037
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,170
you know,
and overcoming a drink here.

2038
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:29,220
And you knew all that stuff.
But the actual playing on stage,

2039
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:32,700
it Kinda got forgotten about a little 
bit,

2040
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,500
you know,
it was,

2041
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:36,120
we get caught up in the rockstar stuff 
and there's a,

2042
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:41,510
there's a song on this album hell Motha 
into flame that directly talks about the

2043
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:47,540
how fame can be this crazy drug and it 
can completely take you over if you let 

2044
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:49,830
it,
you know,

2045
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,980
you're searching for that thing that's 
gonna save you and it's,

2046
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,270
it's you,
it's in you.

2047
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:59,271
It's already there,
you just gotta you just gotTa find it 

2048
01:30:59,271 --> 01:30:59,271
and accept it.

2049
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,790
Well you,
you're very down to Earth Guy,

2050
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:04,940
which is very unusual for someone who's 
as famous as you are.

2051
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:08,390
And that's one of the reasons why I 
wanted to talk to you about this because

2052
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:10,220
it seems like,
like right now you're,

2053
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:10,780
you,
you know,

2054
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:11,690
you can be,
you,

2055
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,280
you're just in that.
But what it seems like for someone who's

2056
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:19,730
as famous as that,
who gets on stage and you know,

2057
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,760
for thousands of people just don't want 
fucking crazy and you're up there.

2058
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:30,431
I mean,
that has got to be intoxicating and 

2059
01:31:30,431 --> 01:31:33,161
confusing and oftentimes I feel like 
people are a prisoner to whatever image 

2060
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:40,510
that either they projected initially or 
it becomes how the public perceives them

2061
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:47,180
because of all their success and because
of the fact they go on stage and 100,000

2062
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,290
people go fucking ape shit.
What,

2063
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:55,110
what does that like trying to like find 
yourself while you're also

2064
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,950
kind of worshiped?
Right.

2065
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,160
Well enjoy.
Do you hit it?

2066
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,250
I mean it's the transitions from road to
home or always somewhat difficult.

2067
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,880
It's like there's a,
there's a ptsd that goes along with it.

2068
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:12,040
You know,
you are,

2069
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,740
like you said worshiped,
you know,

2070
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:15,100
there's a lot of,
you know,

2071
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:20,370
where do I get my validation?
Really that's where I have to step back 

2072
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:20,530
and say,
okay,

2073
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:26,350
am I who these people say I am or think 
I am.

2074
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:29,200
They have their own vision or version of
me,

2075
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:31,390
just like I had my own version of Lemmy,
you know,

2076
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:36,630
this,
this thing that it was strong and you 

2077
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:39,511
know,
these people expect me to be a certain 

2078
01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:42,100
way and when you,
when they meet you in normal life,

2079
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:45,580
you're sitting with your family eating 
or your frigging in the supermarket,

2080
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,140
you know,
throwing salad on some guy,

2081
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:50,920
you're a people want you to do the thing
you do,

2082
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:51,880
you know,
hey headbang,

2083
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:55,450
jump up on the salad bar and rock out or
something is food.

2084
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:01,120
Music does that to me.
Music playing music with these guys does

2085
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:04,330
that to me.
But when I'm not doing that,

2086
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,070
I'm just a dude,
you know,

2087
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:07,950
and they don't want that,
that it,

2088
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:09,910
it hurts them.
It scares them.

2089
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,140
Like,
wait a minute,

2090
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:14,530
um,
I need you to be this certain way.

2091
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:18,790
It makes me feel secure.
So when you're not that I,

2092
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,590
you know,
I don't want to sign stuff.

2093
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:22,630
I don't want to take pictures,
selfies with people.

2094
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,630
I want to shake your hand and I don't 
want to talk with you.

2095
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:26,800
I want us.
Hey,

2096
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:28,390
who are you?
What do you do?

2097
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,130
Here's what I do.
You know,

2098
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,760
people think they know me because of the
music and all the interviews and all the

2099
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:35,470
stuff.
I get that,

2100
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,950
but I don't know you.
So when you come up and say Doula,

2101
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:44,980
you know,
I want to know you because we're at a 

2102
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:44,980
disadvantage here.

2103
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,750
If you get swamped by people and they 
all want to take pictures.

2104
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:48,070
How do you,
how do you handle that?

2105
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,650
Oh,
I,

2106
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,840
I,
I gotta leave.

2107
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:55,060
I mean,
there's the anger part of me that I 

2108
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,440
still wrestle with and things get 
stupid.

2109
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:59,650
Uh,
and um,

2110
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,870
it's like,
it's a fight or flight thing,

2111
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:04,090
man.
It like I'm being attacked.

2112
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:09,270
Wait a minute.
You don't get overwhelmed by all the 

2113
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,270
people.
Yeah.

2114
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,270
Yeah.
Uh,

2115
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,370
it's,
it's just so weird.

2116
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,510
It's so weird.
We're,

2117
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:14,920
we played in front of half a million 
people and a million people.

2118
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,690
And where was that?
This was in Russia.

2119
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:20,590
This was a shit in the airfield.
Oh my God.

2120
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:23,080
So we've done that.
What the fuck was that like?

2121
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:27,190
Um,
it was a sea C of Russian people.

2122
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,510
I mean,
that's what it was,

2123
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,920
that this was in 1991,
91 91 when the,

2124
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:38,220
you know,
the curtain came down and all of that 

2125
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:40,411
and a Time Warner had a uh,
uh,

2126
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:45,720
they wanted to basically get their foot 
in the door and so they were created a 

2127
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:45,820
free concert.

2128
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,290
Uh,
it was,

2129
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,950
it was a ACDC,
us,

2130
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:55,240
Pantera and I think maybe a local band 
or some other bands.

2131
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:58,940
I'm sorry if I can't remember,
but they flew us in there.

2132
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,860
We landed in this airfield.
Oh,

2133
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:05,861
Motley crew was on it,
landed in this airfield and as far as 

2134
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:10,781
the eye could see it when it was a free 
concert and it was just people and we 

2135
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:15,290
get on stage and do what we do.
But there were,

2136
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:16,760
it was military,
you know,

2137
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:19,760
military and the front.
Look at that photo.

2138
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:23,870
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

2139
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:25,400
Jamie,
go full screen with that.

2140
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,510
Don't just go with that one.
What in the fuck?

2141
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,690
Oh my God.
That's insane.

2142
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,280
That it.
Is that the one?

2143
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,820
That might be something else,
but it looks a little newer,

2144
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:39,830
but it says here it was from 91 mosque 
house.

2145
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:42,740
Wow.
That's pretty remarkable.

2146
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,420
And there were.

2147
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,820
Imagine a sea of people like that and 
see there's a helicopter helicopter 

2148
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,880
flying over people.
I mean,

2149
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:52,130
my God,
if that thing goes down,

2150
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:55,150
man,
it could be chopping up photo.

2151
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:59,840
We can go right up there.
That one onstage facing those people.

2152
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:03,800
Oh my God.
That is fucking insane.

2153
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,840
That helicopter would come down close 
and they were yelling at people like 

2154
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:08,840
stop.
You know,

2155
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,810
people were moshing are going crazy.
They didn't know what that was.

2156
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,510
Oh Wow.
It was like a fight.

2157
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:16,570
I freaking communist country man.
And was like,

2158
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,380
wait,
people are getting out of order.

2159
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:20,690
This is chaos.
He didn't have the Internet then either.

2160
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,180
No Way.
They didn't know what to expect of that.

2161
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,660
So there are people throwing,
hitting people from the,

2162
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:29,630
from the helicopter.
And down on the front there,

2163
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:31,740
there were guys in uniforms,
you know,

2164
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,860
there was no police military.

2165
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,970
Same thing,
you know,

2166
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:40,240
so they're standing there and their 
uniforms and after like three or four 

2167
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:40,240
songs,
they're like,

2168
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:44,470
fuck this.
And they took off their stuff and then 

2169
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:44,600
their headbanging and having a good 
time.

2170
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:49,601
So we saw the transformation of,
you know,

2171
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:50,180
uh,
uh,

2172
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:55,300
closed down society to freedom right 
before us individually and in people.

2173
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:01,490
It was awesome.
What does it feel like to stand in front

2174
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:04,340
of 500,000
people?

2175
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,320
What does this sound like?
What does the sound of their roars like?

2176
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,900
Pretty massive.
I'm obviously,

2177
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:17,440
you know,
I lost count it land on 300 and 

2178
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:17,440
something thousand,
but I tell you,

2179
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:20,690
and they don't speak your language.
That's just such a,

2180
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,720
that's the power of music,
man.

2181
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:26,150
That's a language in its own.
It's connects people.

2182
01:37:26,151 --> 01:37:28,190
It is so cool.
So yeah,

2183
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:31,790
we went to a place that no one spoke 
English or people were telling us,

2184
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:34,970
you know,
I learned English from your lyrics.

2185
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:36,500
Like,
Oh shit man,

2186
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:40,820
I failed English just so you know,
I didn't do so well in school.

2187
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:43,400
It's pretty bizarre.
Yeah,

2188
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,910
that's intense.
Yeah,

2189
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,240
that is intense.
That's a,

2190
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:51,130
that's an experience that almost no 
one's prepared for.

2191
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:51,840
I don't think,
I thought,

2192
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:56,870
I don't think there's a single human 
being that can do that and not be 

2193
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:56,870
somewhat

2194
01:37:56,870 --> 01:38:00,210
affected by it or at least need a lot of
decompression,

2195
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,610
lot of downtime to sort of sort that 
out.

2196
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,050
Which.
Hence Vale.

2197
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2198
01:38:05,561 --> 01:38:10,510
It's like you go out into the mountains,
nature doesn't give a shit who you are,

2199
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:13,670
Mother Nature will kick your ass,
you know,

2200
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,590
and leave you frozen and,
you know,

2201
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:19,180
last.
When did you start hunting?

2202
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:25,710
Well,
I think it started out my dad was a 

2203
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:25,710
hunter that I remember him,
skin and deers in the,

2204
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:28,330
in the garage and in southern California
here.

2205
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:34,390
Skeet shooting probably started with 
that skeet and trap.

2206
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,700
And then uh,
uh,

2207
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:41,880
went duck hunting with my buddy up in 
Colusa and San Francisco area and then,

2208
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,480
hey,
we're going on a pig hunt,

2209
01:38:43,481 --> 01:38:44,440
let's go.
And then.

2210
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:49,640
So it was slowly the animal got bigger 
and bigger and a really,

2211
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,690
really enjoyed it.
Enjoyed the,

2212
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:53,900
the,
you know,

2213
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,420
the Guy Hang,
you know,

2214
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,970
just get away and uh,
and just,

2215
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,830
you know,
get scared together.

2216
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,540
The guy hangs a big part of it.
It's awesome.

2217
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,260
It is so cool.
Yeah.

2218
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:08,290
Making fun of each other and you know,
all the,

2219
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,690
all the stuff that you don't get to do,
you know,

2220
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,920
you just,
you just go and hang and uh,

2221
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,400
you know,
I like getting scared.

2222
01:39:15,401 --> 01:39:17,200
I like it and scared out there.
It's like,

2223
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:18,930
wait a minute,
I'm,

2224
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:19,420
you know,
I'm,

2225
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,140
I'm,
I'm,

2226
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:21,760
I got this,
you know,

2227
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:27,270
60 pound backpack on and I just came 
from sea level and I'm up here at 11,000

2228
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:33,460
feet and I don't feel very good guys.

2229
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:38,440
How the fuck am I going to get off this 
mountain?

2230
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,690
I can't do it.
They're like,

2231
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:45,691
yeah,
you can come on and it will carry you 

2232
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:45,691
off if that's what it takes.
Like,

2233
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:46,380
okay.
Yeah,

2234
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:47,530
it's a truck is,
you know,

2235
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:52,240
it's like a three hour hike to the,
to the three hour hike to the spike camp

2236
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,550
and then another two hours to the base 
camp.

2237
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:57,580
You know,
you can do it and stuff like that,

2238
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,660
you know,
pushing you to limits that you didn't 

2239
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:02,660
know you could go to.

2240
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:05,070
Yeah.
I saw you had a guitar that had a camera

2241
01:40:05,071 --> 01:40:06,080
on it.
Oh yeah.

2242
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:08,010
This dude's deep.
It's awesome.

2243
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,550
You're deep

2244
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:10,300
dude.
I love the coolest stuff.

2245
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,410
Yep.
Yep.

2246
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:14,380
I got turned onto it by those guys and 
yeah,

2247
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:19,410
you know,
it can get pretty cold and scary up 

2248
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:19,410
there and it's,
it's fun to.

2249
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:19,410
You

2250
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:22,090
presents to me this really interesting 
sort of,

2251
01:40:22,091 --> 01:40:27,091
uh,
integration of technology and a almost 

2252
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:32,011
like gadget geek mindset applied to 
hunting to make the very best stuff.

2253
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,210
Yep.
So as soon as I saw that you got gotta a

2254
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,330
cool pattern on your guitar,
I'm like,

2255
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:38,050
ah,
he's in deep.

2256
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:40,350
Yeah,
we contacted them.

2257
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,160
It's like,
Hey,

2258
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:44,430
can we borrow your pattern?
It's pretty fucking cool.

2259
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,120
Uh,
yeah,

2260
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:46,770
I love it.
And how often do you get out?

2261
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:48,360
Well,
yeah,

2262
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,420
you know,
at least a co,

2263
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:50,420
uh,
probably,

2264
01:40:50,421 --> 01:40:55,421
you know,
a couple of weeks every year is what I 

2265
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:55,421
get to do a in

2266
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:57,340
obviously if it's elk season in 
Colorado.

2267
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:02,780
Um,
and then there's deer season in 

2268
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:02,780
California and Turkey season.
So.

2269
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,420
So do you get to hunt near Vail where 
you live?

2270
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:05,350
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2271
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,390
yeah.
On elk up there.

2272
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:11,490
Oh my God,
it was twice as many elk as any other 

2273
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:11,530
state in the country.
It is amazing.

2274
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,930
And you know,
from the house,

2275
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
are you dropping the kids off at school?
Just drive up the road a little bit and 

2276
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,630
be spotting,
you know,

2277
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:21,910
hey,
there's some elk up there and you know,

2278
01:41:21,911 --> 01:41:23,150
where the kids go to school,
there's a,

2279
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:24,880
there's a sheep herd,
you know,

2280
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,430
just up in the mountains like wow.
Oh my God,

2281
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,940
it'll take me about 45 years to draw 
that tag.

2282
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:34,420
But you guys will start to get those 
points up.

2283
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,520
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2284
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:40,620
So that's,
that's another good reason to live in 

2285
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:40,620
Colorado,
right?

2286
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:40,620
Absolutely.
Out there near,

2287
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:41,650
I mean,
mule deer,

2288
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,510
white tails.
I mean that's a pretty game.

2289
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:45,040
Rich state.
Yeah,

2290
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:45,710
the elk,
I mean,

2291
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:46,930
you know,
I liked,

2292
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:52,140
I liked the venison elk.
S probably the thing I would eat 

2293
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:52,480
nonstop.
Yeah.

2294
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,900
People who have never tried it before.
Really the,

2295
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:59,930
I mean you can get it in a restaurant 
but you're getting it from New Zealand 

2296
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:00,440
and it's not going to be as fresh and 
it's not the same,

2297
01:42:00,441 --> 01:42:05,441
but it's an unbelievable meet will 
pulling it out of your freezer and 

2298
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:06,370
making it there for your kids.
I mean there's nothing,

2299
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,100
there's no,
nothing more organic than that.

2300
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:12,310
Especially when you know specifically 
where it came from.

2301
01:42:12,311 --> 01:42:13,600
You were there?
Yeah.

2302
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:17,410
This is not mixed up with some other 
crap from some other farm or something.

2303
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,470
This is it.
This has been cut and prepared for you.

2304
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:23,320
So I see that massive thick bastard out.

2305
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,340
And your latest one.
Yeah.

2306
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,800
Data something.
Boy,

2307
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,990
where is that?
I want to get ranch.

2308
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:30,850
Oh,
I should've let you guess.

2309
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:32,380
No,
I was going to get New Mexico.

2310
01:42:32,381 --> 01:42:37,381
No,
that's from here to California to hone 

2311
01:42:37,381 --> 01:42:39,961
ranch.
They put rocky mountain elk into home 

2312
01:42:39,961 --> 01:42:41,760
ranch in the 19 fifties and because 
California it's a about a half hour 

2313
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,381
outside of Bakersfield,
so it's sorta like mid California and 

2314
01:42:46,381 --> 01:42:48,280
because of that it's not cold again.
They get snow up there,

2315
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:50,860
but not enough snow where the elk have 
to struggle for food.

2316
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,540
So they eat a lot.
Yeah,

2317
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:57,100
lot of mount lines up there though.
They have a massive,

2318
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:59,380
massively thick.
It's a big animal.

2319
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:00,130
Yeah,
he was huge.

2320
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:02,650
He was like a thousand pounds.
It's a big ass elk,

2321
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,320
but blow.
That one was a rifle.

2322
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,530
Yeah.
I've shot one there last year with a bow

2323
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:13,620
this year I went with a bow.
We unsuccessfully hunted for five days 

2324
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,150
and pulled out a rifle and got it done 
in an hour.

2325
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:21,280
I go back and forth with the bowl.
It's not cheating.

2326
01:43:21,281 --> 01:43:22,510
I mean it's,
it's hunting,

2327
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:25,210
but if you want some really hunting the 
best way to go.

2328
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,820
I am a meat hunter and that's the way to
do it,

2329
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:32,850
you know.
And New bowhunt hunt a the on my ranch 

2330
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:37,850
at home in California.
Uh,

2331
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:40,160
it's just tough.
It's tough with the black tail,

2332
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:43,780
you know,
you've got a fairly small deer too.

2333
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:44,950
Yeah,
that's pretty tough.

2334
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:50,310
I just liked pulling it.
I like target practicing and stuff and 

2335
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:50,620
you know,
I have gone bowhunting.

2336
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,220
I'm taking a pretty nice

2337
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,530
alk with it when it's the Rut.
I mean that.

2338
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:59,700
Yeah,
it's so amazing and it scares the shit 

2339
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,130
out of you and the screening and friggin
froth

2340
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:04,710
beast coming,
running down at you with a ready to kick

2341
01:44:04,711 --> 01:44:06,390
your ass or fuck you.
Yeah.

2342
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,440
Yeah.
It's a pretty intense moment.

2343
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,130
Right?
Um,

2344
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:15,700
but I've missed some stuff so much and I
just,

2345
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:17,530
you know,
I'd rather use A.

2346
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:20,260
I want to get the animal down and done.

2347
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,590
Yeah.
So rifles,

2348
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:27,600
definitely the best way to do that.
But bow I bow hunting requires so much 

2349
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:27,600
more discipline.
It's just,

2350
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,090
it's a constant pursuit,
but for me it's a great meditation.

2351
01:44:31,091 --> 01:44:32,500
Just the practice of archery.
Not,

2352
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,790
not even just bow hunting.
I'm,

2353
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,290
I'm a big fan of just I'll have to do 
it.

2354
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:36,850
Like I'll leave here,
I'll go home,

2355
01:44:36,851 --> 01:44:38,300
I'll shoot 100 hours.
Cool.

2356
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:40,150
Yeah,
just to just clean my head out.

2357
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:45,500
It's a good way to just [inaudible] you 
can't think about anything else other 

2358
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:45,610
than that target in order to do it 
right.

2359
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:48,190
Especially shooting at like 70 yards or 
something long.

2360
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2361
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:54,330
So what Bo?
I saw you gotta I use a white hoyt.

2362
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,810
Yeah.
I have a white pro defiant.

2363
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,620
It's the newest model just to fucking 
awesome bow.

2364
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:02,450
This is the coolest thing about bose is 
that unlike rifles,

2365
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,300
I mean rifles,
the technology at such a high level,

2366
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:08,600
but I have a rifle from three years ago.
That's awesome.

2367
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,890
It's just as good,
but both from three years ago it's.

2368
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,920
Well,
it's like a little behind the times,

2369
01:45:12,921 --> 01:45:14,350
you know,
you got some new technology,

2370
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,850
you could still use it,
you could still kill something with it,

2371
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:20,690
but the newest stuff,
they did the technology and bows,

2372
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:22,340
they essentially innovate every year.

2373
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,690
I agree.
Yeah.

2374
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:26,240
And yeah,
I had a,

2375
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,640
yeah,
had a matthews from three years ago and 

2376
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:31,640
I went in to get it tuned up and the guy
says,

2377
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,380
oh my God.
It's like,

2378
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,680
you know,
a computer that's a few years old.

2379
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:38,300
Wow.
It's dude.

2380
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:41,670
If you want to get hooked up with this,
if you want to get hooked up with coin,

2381
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,620
I'll have one sent to you.

2382
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:43,980
Okay.
I'll look it up.

2383
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:46,530
I got,
I got to matthews that I really love and

2384
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,000
you know,
who knows next year,

2385
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,590
like you said,
the technology,

2386
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:55,010
just the way they pull,
the way they balance and all that stuff 

2387
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:55,010
that,
like you said,

2388
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:56,070
with a gun,
you know,

2389
01:45:56,190 --> 01:46:01,190
guns,
guns have come a lot of wastes the long 

2390
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:01,320
ways too.
I got this awesome fierce gun that uh,

2391
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:06,510
you know,
carbon fiber barrel and it's super 

2392
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:06,510
lightweight for packing in,
you know,

2393
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,340
it's down to like six pounds with a 
scope on it.

2394
01:46:08,341 --> 01:46:10,680
So yeah.
Lightweight.

2395
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:11,310
Good.

2396
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:16,800
Yeah.
If you go in like sheep hunting or 

2397
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:16,800
something like that,
you're going way up into the mountains.

2398
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,310
Like I know guys who cut the bottom off 
of their toothbrush in order to save 

2399
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,960
weight.
Literally they do everything they can.

2400
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:26,990
They cut every ounce,
bring it toothbrush for the kid to brush

2401
01:46:26,991 --> 01:46:28,720
your teeth up in the mountain.
You don't brush your teeth,

2402
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:32,140
they're going to smell your stinky ass 
fucking breath before anything.

2403
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:34,720
That's probably the first thing they 
smell.

2404
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:37,900
That's why I'm in successful guys who 
actually eat,

2405
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:42,930
like they'll take pine leaves and chew 
them up inside their mouth just so that 

2406
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:46,760
their breath doesn't come off as some 
meat eating monster Predator to a deer.

2407
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,920
Interesting.
Yeah.

2408
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,520
I think that's probably like one of our 
big smells

2409
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,150
is the breath,
you know,

2410
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:57,200
bio and then your breath.
A lot of people smell breath smells 

2411
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:57,300
worse than their bio.
Right.

2412
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,090
You've got to think.
Especially old old guy,

2413
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:03,410
old guy with rotten insides.
Yeah.

2414
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:06,450
All that fucking funk.
So you spray up,

2415
01:47:06,451 --> 01:47:08,970
you do all that stuff and get killed.
I don't spray up.

2416
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:10,020
No.
I,

2417
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:10,860
uh,
I've used.

2418
01:47:10,861 --> 01:47:11,700
Oh,
Xanax,

2419
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:12,510
you know those,
uh,

2420
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,900
ozone things in a tree stand.
I've used that where they,

2421
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,740
they blow ozone on you and it confuses 
the scent that actually works.

2422
01:47:19,741 --> 01:47:22,800
It's very bizarre.
It has to be directly on you.

2423
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:27,360
And the ozone somehow attaches itself to
your scent molecules.

2424
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:29,040
And then when the deer gets it,
he's like,

2425
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:34,041
what in the fuck is this?
But it doesn't blow off all those red 

2426
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:34,300
flags where he just wants to,
you know,

2427
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:36,000
he smells a Predator and he wants a 
bolt.

2428
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,200
Right?
Yeah.

2429
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:37,940
Wow.
Well,

2430
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:42,950
I guess it'd be,
you could see the results of it if 

2431
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:42,950
you're in the same spot year after year 
or something.

2432
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:45,970
But I'd never know if that stuff works 
because we're traveling,

2433
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,030
doing different stuff,
different places all the time.

2434
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:50,760
Well most of the hunts I go on our spot 
and stalk.

2435
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:53,340
So that's not really.
It doesn't really apply.

2436
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:57,120
But in that sense when you're doing 
something spot and stalk,

2437
01:47:57,121 --> 01:47:58,230
you just have to play.
The wind.

2438
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:00,390
Wind is going towards them.
You're fucked.

2439
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,250
They're just,
that's what they're designed for.

2440
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:05,000
I mean they can smell things.
The way I describe it to people is like,

2441
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:08,760
you know how you could smell a skunk if 
it got killed like five blocks away.

2442
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:11,970
That's how a deer can smell.
You can smell,

2443
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:14,670
they can smell you like a skunk.
Like they're like,

2444
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,170
fuck,
let's get outta here.

2445
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,580
They,
they smell skunk,

2446
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:21,840
they bolt.
But I've seen them smell you from 100,

2447
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,740
200 yards out and they just catch your 
wind like boing boing.

2448
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:29,490
Fuck this bound away.
So brush your teeth,

2449
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:30,840
you get to bottom teeth,
bro.

2450
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,700
Thanks for the tip.
Probably a good idea.

2451
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:35,690
Fifty three.
I got to tell you to brush her teeth.

2452
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:39,120
It's hard to tell Rockstar to do 
anything.

2453
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:45,770
Yeah,
I mean that's one of the things that 

2454
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:45,770
some people like about hunting.
So you don't have to wash it,

2455
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,400
just go out there and wear the same 
goddamn closed for five,

2456
01:48:47,401 --> 01:48:49,860
six days.
And that doesn't send off a signal.

2457
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:51,210
Oh it's.
It certainly will.

2458
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,940
But you're wearing Merino wool,
especially like base layers.

2459
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:57,060
It actually can be.
That absorbs most of the smell.

2460
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:59,580
So you think the baby wipes do good or 
bad?

2461
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,460
Well,
a baby wipes pro.

2462
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,440
It's probably better not to smell like 
shit.

2463
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:09,270
Especially human shit.
And he'll like a fake cleaning product,

2464
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:14,250
either fake cleaning product won't.
I think anything odd to a deer,

2465
01:49:14,251 --> 01:49:19,251
it's probably not good.
But I think there's probably specific 

2466
01:49:19,251 --> 01:49:19,510
Predator smells that we exist,
you know,

2467
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,260
unless you're like a strict vegetarian.
And also hunt,

2468
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,180
I would imagine,
nick,

2469
01:49:24,181 --> 01:49:26,850
you smelled terrible.
You can probably smell like a killer.

2470
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,860
Yeah.
I don't know what they're smelling.

2471
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,780
You know,
I would like to know,

2472
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:34,020
like if they could tap into the mind of 
a deer when it smells a person,

2473
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:35,760
like what?
What alarms go off.

2474
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:37,620
That would be bizarre.
Like the,

2475
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:42,621
you know,
think the red flag of the Cape on the 

2476
01:49:42,621 --> 01:49:42,621
bowls.
Like it's not really red,

2477
01:49:42,621 --> 01:49:44,040
it's just something's moving,
you know,

2478
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:45,570
what do they see?
What do they hear?

2479
01:49:45,571 --> 01:49:48,040
What do they smell?
Yeah.

2480
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,820
I guess once you figure that out then 
it's really on how much.

2481
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,640
How much shit did you have to deal with 
when there was that,

2482
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:56,800
the blowback from that?
The hunt show,

2483
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:59,200
you know?
Uh,

2484
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,280
it,
it's like I wanted to get into 

2485
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,230
voiceovers so that I took the Gig.
They have a great voice for it.

2486
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:05,830
It was,
it was,

2487
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:08,110
I didn't even know it was your voice 
while you're doing.

2488
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,300
It was kind of interesting.
Like it's,

2489
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,880
you know,
you did it in a very professional 

2490
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,611
manner,
but it was a very controversial show 

2491
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:18,810
because it was a grizzly bear hunting.
Yeah,

2492
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,630
yeah,
yeah.

2493
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,280
And well,
you know,

2494
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:23,350
I took the Gig,
you know,

2495
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:28,440
I wanted to,
I wanted to get into the voiceover 

2496
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:29,170
stuff.
So that was offered to me and yeah,

2497
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:31,510
I probably had,
it could have had a choice whether I did

2498
01:50:31,511 --> 01:50:32,890
it or not,
but that's what that was.

2499
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:37,890
And I think the main,
the main head happened when I did that 

2500
01:50:40,451 --> 01:50:42,850
show and then we went to go do 
Glastonbury,

2501
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:47,970
which is like the ultimate,
like a celebration of a English hippie 

2502
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:55,101
dumb.
And they somehow caught wind that I'd 

2503
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:56,340
been a,
you know,

2504
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,560
always a hunter.
And he did this show and uh,

2505
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,820
and it was like boycott Metallica,
you know,

2506
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,720
don't play the show.
We don't want that.

2507
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,730
And Wow,
you know.

2508
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,030
Uh,
so what we did was we made a,

2509
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:15,360
we made this silly video.
There's always something going on in 

2510
01:51:15,401 --> 01:51:16,780
England where,
you know,

2511
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:18,730
there's a,
there's something,

2512
01:51:18,731 --> 01:51:21,390
there's a controversy that's going to 
happen with the,

2513
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,710
you know,
the,

2514
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,910
uh,
so when an artist shows up,

2515
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:26,140
they do something,
they,

2516
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:28,330
they want something special.
So what they want.

2517
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:30,550
So the fact that I was,
you know,

2518
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,900
I did this bear hunting show and so we 
made this movie,

2519
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:37,240
uh,
about uh,

2520
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:40,000
it was a guy in England put this movie 
together that,

2521
01:51:40,001 --> 01:51:45,001
um,
it depicted old school English hunt 

2522
01:51:45,001 --> 01:51:45,250
huntsman,
you know,

2523
01:51:45,251 --> 01:51:46,030
they're on horseback.

2524
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:46,940
Fox hunters,
you know,

2525
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:52,120
took doctor in our release,
release the Fox and all the hounds go 

2526
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,440
and they go galloping through the,
uh,

2527
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:54,340
the,
uh,

2528
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:56,170
the,
the English countryside,

2529
01:51:57,070 --> 01:52:02,070
and they come to a spot and they start 
getting shot at and it's,

2530
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:08,280
these bears come out of the woods and 
they've shot the hunters and they become

2531
01:52:08,411 --> 01:52:11,170
the hunter and the crowd loved it.
You know,

2532
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:12,340
they.
Oh yeah,

2533
01:52:12,341 --> 01:52:15,220
right arm,
the bears,

2534
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:16,630
you know,
uh,

2535
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:20,830
so it Kinda just instantly diffused all 
that bullshit and you know,

2536
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:22,990
when you're able to,
like we said earlier,

2537
01:52:22,991 --> 01:52:26,140
make fun of yourself and make fun of 
controversy.

2538
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:31,660
Then it just,
it kind of goes away and then you just 

2539
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:31,660
get on,
you know,

2540
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:32,560
get,
get back to business,

2541
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:37,561
you know,
what is it frustrating when they were 

2542
01:52:37,561 --> 01:52:37,561
distributing that picture that wasn't 
even you?

2543
01:52:37,561 --> 01:52:40,600
There was a photo of some guy that 
looked kind of like you in front of this

2544
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:41,680
giant brown bear.

2545
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,800
Well,
let me just told him,

2546
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:50,020
told me about them,
that they're ignorant and that's not 

2547
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:50,020
even me.
So,

2548
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:50,020
you know,
there,

2549
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,880
there are people out there that want to 
just,

2550
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:57,460
just want to throw the fuel on the fire 
and make it crazier and get upset about 

2551
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,550
stuff and uh,
you know,

2552
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:00,500
um,
I,

2553
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:03,200
I got no control over that man,
you know,

2554
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:04,930
once it's out there,
you know,

2555
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:11,120
I don't want to spend all my time 
justifying what I do or don't do it.

2556
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:13,430
It's not even something that I did,
you know.

2557
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,950
So yeah.
It's a waste of time.

2558
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:18,080
Do you bear hunt at all?
I did.

2559
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,560
I did.
But now I wear clothes.

2560
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:22,880
Do you hunt?
Bear?

2561
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:25,640
That was really stupid,
man.

2562
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:27,530
Sorry.
I like stupid jokes.

2563
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,880
Do you hunt bear?
Uh,

2564
01:53:31,881 --> 01:53:32,690
I did.
I went,

2565
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:37,700
I went to Russia,
went to Khan Chaka and hunt bear.

2566
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,200
Yeah,
it was a,

2567
01:53:39,201 --> 01:53:41,420
it was a crazy,
crazy adventure.

2568
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:44,090
Was it brown bear or what are the,
what they have up there?

2569
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:44,660
Yeah,
it was brown.

2570
01:53:44,661 --> 01:53:46,520
Bear it wouldn't eat any of it.
No,

2571
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:51,760
no I did not.
And that's one regret I have and I mean 

2572
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:51,760
getting the meat.
I mean,

2573
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:56,600
for some reason they didn't allow you to
bring meat from Russia into America,

2574
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:03,250
but we did have meat there.
They had meat from other bears and so 

2575
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:07,781
that's how we sustained ourselves out in
the middle of the shot is brown bear.

2576
01:54:08,061 --> 01:54:10,490
Tastes like,
you know,

2577
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:14,540
bear doesn't taste great to me.
This super fatty for sure.

2578
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,380
Uh,
this,

2579
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:18,710
this was less fatty because it was 
spring bear and then,

2580
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:19,730
you know,
they were out,

2581
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:20,960
you know,
they hadn't,

2582
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,160
they just come out of hibernation.

2583
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,100
So he had a,
I wouldn't,

2584
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:30,400
it's not my favorite thing,
so I'll probably wouldn't hunt it again 

2585
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,470
because I do like to eat what I want.
I want a harvest so it wasn't,

2586
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:35,000
wasn't great,
but we had links.

2587
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:37,340
We had all kinds of different stuff 
there that they,

2588
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:38,760
you know,
they right in the middle of nowhere.

2589
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:39,620
Links.
Yeah.

2590
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:42,380
What does that taste like?
It tastes like chicken.

2591
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:45,380
Everything tastes like chicken.
Uh,

2592
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:47,180
you know,
it depends on how you cook it.

2593
01:54:47,181 --> 01:54:51,200
I mean,
it's meat and it tasted like meat and we

2594
01:54:51,201 --> 01:54:55,640
were in this little little hut that was 
super short because,

2595
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:56,840
you know,
it's really,

2596
01:54:56,841 --> 01:55:01,841
really cold out there.
And there was like about eight feet of 

2597
01:55:01,841 --> 01:55:01,841
snow.
And uh,

2598
01:55:01,841 --> 01:55:06,100
yeah,
you're in this little hut that's really 

2599
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,100
short to keep warm,
you know.

2600
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:06,970
And uh,
the,

2601
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,540
the hunter,
the guides out there,

2602
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:10,610
they had ak 47,
you know,

2603
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,770
we were,
it was pretty scary,

2604
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:15,720
you know,
we took a military helicopter,

2605
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:18,780
probably flew two hours in this thing 
that looked like it,

2606
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:20,720
it survived world,
you know,

2607
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:25,870
one and two,
well it wasn't around World War One but 

2608
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:26,180
survived world war two and it was,
you know,

2609
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:31,210
exhaust down the side and no seats and 
we're sitting on the metal floor and 

2610
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:33,800
we'd get dropped off in the middle of 
this nowhere place.

2611
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,320
And these guys have snowmobiles and 
there's,

2612
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:39,080
you can't get around because the snow 
was so thick.

2613
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:43,070
You needs snowmobile and the guide show 
up in their,

2614
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,830
you know,
their,

2615
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:44,070
here's

2616
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:47,700
Russians with AK 47.
We're Americans high,

2617
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:50,160
you know.
Hey,

2618
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:55,670
common.
Is it that they have these hunts out 

2619
01:55:55,670 --> 01:55:57,471
there?
It's so they knew what they were doing 

2620
01:55:57,471 --> 01:55:57,471
this,
this is a normal thing they did,

2621
01:55:57,471 --> 01:55:57,471
it was set up,
you know,

2622
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:58,380
I was like,
you know,

2623
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,200
the,
um,

2624
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,690
through the safari club,
you know,

2625
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:02,970
and,
uh,

2626
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:05,250
it was just one of those crazy things 
like,

2627
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:08,340
hey,
I'm going to try this and get scared.

2628
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:10,590
And I was,
wow,

2629
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:15,591
listen man,
you gotta get Outta here because I know 

2630
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:15,591
you're a,
you're supposed to leave it to.

2631
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:15,591
It's a couple minutes later than that.
So,

2632
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:17,250
uh,
thanks for doing this man.

2633
01:56:17,251 --> 01:56:19,050
I really appreciate it.
It was great meeting you.

2634
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:22,770
It was great talking to you and uh,
it was just awesome conversation.

2635
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:23,940
But likewise,
brother,

2636
01:56:24,130 --> 01:56:25,390
appreciate you and,
uh,

2637
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:26,880
keep doing what you're doing,
man.

2638
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,830
I will.
You all right.

2639
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:29,940
See if folks.
