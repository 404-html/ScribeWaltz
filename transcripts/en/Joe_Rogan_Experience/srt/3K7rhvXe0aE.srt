1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,040
You're fucking freaks.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,180
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by stamps.com

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,370
stamps.com,

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:11,941
which is right now,

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,070
the only way Brian sells those,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,581
those,

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:14,880
uh,

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,200
kittycat tee shirts that you see,

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,480
those death squad shirts
from death squad.tv.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,900
He actually uses stamps.com so
we know it's a good product.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,230
If you use the code word Jre,

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,180
there's a little microphone in the
upper right hand corner was old school.

13
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:29,130
He microphones for whatever reason,

14
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,240
that's like the cool microphone.

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,920
I don't know why I never got that,

16
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,380
but regular microphones don't
get nearly enough fucking credit.

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,530
There's something sexy about those old
school Frank Sinatra in the 1930s back

18
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,630
when people were dumb as fuck.

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,880
That was a really awesome microphone.

20
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,910
So it's like a talk shit.

21
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm like,

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,581
yeah,

23
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,414
it's classy.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,891
Uh,

25
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,640
if you click on that and
entering the code word j r e,

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,740
it was a special offer.

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,750
You get all kinds of cool shit,

28
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:59,751
like a free scale and 80 bucks
and $25 in postage coupons.

29
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,560
And if you look at the website,

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,981
go to,

31
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,520
um,

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,390
go to stamps.com and then click on the
thing and entering the code word jre.

33
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,460
It'll fill you in on all the details.

34
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,070
Uh,

35
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,841
about the,

36
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,081
uh,

37
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,700
the opera w the way it is.

38
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:11,980
It says,

39
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,140
I have it says $110 bonus offer.

40
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,993
Why does it say $80?

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,610
Because he normally just a normal person
that goes to stamps.com he only gets

42
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,870
that $80 a offer.

43
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,470
But if you've typing or you click on
that microphone and type in j Rue,

44
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:24,850
you get a even better off.

45
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,080
Then you get $110.

46
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,371
I got confused.

47
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:27,640
I was like,

48
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,421
did they lower it?

49
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,100
I hate it when people like lower it,

50
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,491
you know,

51
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,324
when they have like,

52
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,170
I don't want to call them
out on it because there are
our customers or were you

53
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:35,390
know,

54
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,300
their customers or something
like that working together.

55
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah.

56
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,260
Uh,

57
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,770
anyway,

58
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,160
if you go to stamps.com but it allows
you to do is you measure all your shit.

59
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:42,281
Like,

60
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:42,880
say if you say it,

61
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
sell things like,

62
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,320
you know,

63
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,340
send things online.

64
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,170
You measure all your shit at home,

65
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,580
you put your little sticker on it,

66
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,330
boom.

67
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,230
Postman picks it up.

68
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:51,280
You don't have to go to the mailbox.

69
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,810
You'd have to wait in line.

70
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,890
You'd have to weigh your shit.

71
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,780
You could do it all right there.

72
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,230
Print up your own postage and
be done with that whole process.

73
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Use The code word J,

74
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:04,330

77
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:07,330
N.

78
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:07,330
I.

79
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,163
T.

80
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,740
We,

81
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,100
uh,

82
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,240
if you haven't been to the website,

83
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,190
we don't know what the
fuck to call the company.

84
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,040
So we call it a human
performance enhancement company,

85
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,240
if that makes any sense.

86
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,860
Human Performance Company,

87
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,760
uh,

88
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,780
the whole company is just focused on
shit that makes your body work better.

89
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,450
Uh,

90
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,440
exercise equipment that's the
best for functional strength,

91
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,790
nutritional supplements that are passed
for recovery and for cognitive function

92
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,470
and endurance and all that shit.

93
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,410
Very,

94
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,970
uh,

95
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,740
all of it is very healthy stuff.

96
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,850
It's like whatever we feel like we would
buy whatever we feel like we would use.

97
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:40,960
And I think,

98
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,201
you know,

99
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:45,190
it's beneficial as far as like exercise
equipment or vitamins or supplements.

100
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,310
That's the kind of stuff we sell and we
just try to sell you the best shit we

101
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,144
can find.

102
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,410
And if you use a code name,

103
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,130
Rogan,

104
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,770
you saved 10% of any and all supplements.

105
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,280

A phone is

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,850
most litigious,

156
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,490

00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:08,271

You know this is a strange times.

186
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,950
It's good to have a man like
Everlast around trying to be,

187
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,510
trying to think,

188
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,390
trying to make it happen.

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
These are strange times,

190
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,470
my friend every day.

191
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,683
How are You Ben?

192
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,340
Good.

Live in Levin.

194
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,163
Yup.

195
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,971
Dan Dah,

196
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:31,360
Dah,

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,820
Dah.

198
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,170
I'm surrounded my crazy women.

199
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,490
That's how I've,

200
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,070
you know,

201
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,730
if you could say that you've
probably had a fun life.

202
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,510
I'm surrounded by and completely insane
women with the ones that I'm not crazy

203
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,600
or not fun to be around unfortunately.

204
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,601
Just had a new one,

205
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:44,880
you know?

206
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
Got a three month old at home graduations,

207
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,100
ma'am.

208
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,460
Thank you.

209
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,260
Yeah,

210
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,490
everything's going good man.

211
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,740
Um,

212
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,050
you know,

213
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,850
just,

214
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,290
just turned rambling mines as well.

215
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,123
Has it been a year?

216
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,640
It's probably been about a year.

217
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,390
Yeah.

218
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,180
Somewhere around there.

219
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah.

220
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,430
Last time.

221
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,970
Too Long.

222
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,151
Yeah.

223
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,730
This is the first time at this
place to made an acoustic record.

224
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,470
We're going to have just
because of y'all rarely.

225
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,730
That's ridiculous.

226
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,563
When does that come out?

227
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,530
Um,

228
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,510
like August sometime.

229
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,450
I don't have the exact date,

230
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,350
but y'all will have it.

231
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,920
You know what I mean?

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,630
So you started doing acoustic shows,

233
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,081
you know,

234
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,370
I would do acoustic stuff,

235
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:14,690
like,

236
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,320
like walk in the radio station,

237
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,154
promote your record.

238
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,431
Right.

239
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:17,791
You know what I mean?

240
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,450
And then like,

241
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,283
um,

242
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,540
came and did your podcast first time,

243
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,920
didn't do any music and I mean,

244
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,560
people were still super love,

245
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,011
you know what I mean?

246
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:30,290
And then that second time when I came
and did music the first time and kind of

247
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,330
busted the cherry and the Joe Rogan
show in the musical world also,

248
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,280
you did,

249
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,880
you know,

250
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,590
like the reaction was ridiculous,

251
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:37,801
man.

252
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:37,981
I mean,

253
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,651
we've been doing coke,

254
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:39,870
Cousteau tours,

255
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,171
like,

256
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:40,651
you know what I mean?

257
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:44,070
Like it's literally like we toured all
the Europe and the winter and sold out a

258
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,471
lot of shows.

259
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,690
There's a lot of Joe Rogan
lovers in Europe too,

260
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,000
man.

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,541
But you know,

262
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:49,900
man,

263
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,261
there's,

264
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,570
there's something really
cool about acoustic music.

265
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,990
There's something really cool about when
you're doing a song and it's just you

266
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,460
and your guitar and that's it.

267
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,460
You now or in,

268
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,860
in a keyboard back up or whatever.

269
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,100
When you're right there doing
it live and raw like that on a,

270
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,450
on an internet radio show,

271
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:05,141
it's all just,

272
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,890
broadcast is no stop.

273
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,241
There's no,

274
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,400
let's try this again and
let's get it from the top.

275
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,130
When you drill down and it's just a good,

276
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,060
the way it says something about a us,

277
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,750
a sing,

278
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,210
a real singer songwriter and a guitar.

279
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,250
It's one of the purest
forms of expression.

280
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,460
The way it like hits you like
emotional impact of songs.

281
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,560
A dude with a guitar with a voice like
yours and a guy who was always writing.

282
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,300
That's when I dig about you.

283
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,530
You're always writing.

284
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,850
You've always got new shit.

285
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,860
You're always coming
in here with new songs.

286
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:38,200
You always have like
you're always working,

287
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:38,531
man.

288
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,570
You were just always putting in
the work when it comes to you

289
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,423
music.

290
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,273
You know what I mean?

291
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,260
It,

292
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,670
I mean you make people laugh,

293
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,080
you go look for crazy shit.

294
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:46,650
You know what I mean?

295
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,360
Something you're so
tells you you got to do.

296
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,180
Yeah.

297
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,390
You could make some money
at it as the bonus is the,

298
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,800
but uh,

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
there is the artist side of it that
it's like if I don't wake up and hustle

300
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,680
something out of nothing out of thin air,

301
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,141
you know,

302
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,060
then rent might not
get paid in six months.

303
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,901
That's true too.

304
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,640
And we've all seen people drop off.

305
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,271
It's scary.

306
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:03,961
Once you're moving,

307
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,550
you've got to keep moving once you know,

308
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,031
more money,

309
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:06,691
more problems.

310
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,170
You know,

311
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,840
one other thing is I
said something to Irish,

312
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,300
whole lot of fucking problems.

313
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,540
Yeah.

314
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,280
Anybody who doesn't want those problems,

315
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,391
don't be silly.

316
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,010
They're better than the starving problems.

317
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,350
I was telling the army should fear that.

318
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,621
You know,

319
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:23,600
we were talking about like
writing material and we just,

320
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,820
in the middle of the conversation,

321
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:25,550
I'm realize I'm like,

322
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,930
you know,

323
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,460
if you're an Ra ship for your fan,

324
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,710
you're the only one who could deliver it.

325
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,210
Like it's your responsibility.

326
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,550
You have like thousands
of Ari Shaffir fans,

327
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:38,470
but you're the only one who can deliver
you like you a particular style of

328
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:38,951
comedy.

329
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,210
You are what you look like,

330
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,080
the way you speak.

331
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,220
It's either the only one,

332
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,083
this is it.

333
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,460
So like for someone who's an Everlast fan,

334
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,930
you're the only one.

335
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,740
There's no other,

336
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,480
there's no other Everlast out there.

337
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,060
You the only guy who can
produce Everlast material.

338
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,210
So that's like a giant responsibility.

339
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,770
And if you're a fan,

340
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,470
you want to tap into a dude
is always creating new shit,

341
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,161
you know,

342
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:00,491
that way,

343
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:00,791
you know,

344
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,840
if you become a junkie,

345
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,460
like if you're a Leonard Skinner Junkie,

346
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,260
fuck man to sit,

347
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:05,500
they,

348
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,861
you know,

349
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,930
that fucking plane crash
was a long ass time ago.

350
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,850
But if you're an Everlast fan,

351
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,550
you're always begging out new shit.

352
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,121
You know,

353
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,040
we work in trying to be like,

354
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:15,850
you man.

355
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,140
I don't even know what that means,

356
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,063
but thanks.

357
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm not even trying to be like me.

358
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm just trying to make sense
of the whole fucking thing.

359
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,460
Cancer.

360
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,300
Have you seen the,

361
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:25,481
uh,

362
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,250
the thing that's going
down right now in Turkey?

363
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
Do you know what's happened to the riots?

364
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,641
Rebellion.

365
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,990
Massive rebellion and Turkey.

366
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,390
I have not read much about it.

367
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,810
Uh,

368
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,380
this,

369
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,620
it's,

370
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,360
they're saying it's some sort of like an
occupier style revolt and I saw a photo

371
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,201
of a,

372
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:44,260
these people walking down
the street and it's insane.

373
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,430
It's like some end of the world.

374
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,030
Shit.

375
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,870
It's like Brian,

376
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:47,860
see if he could pull up the picture.

377
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:48,700
It's crazy.

378
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,840
This picture of these people were
walking down the street together.

379
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,441
I mean,

380
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,840
it was overflowing with people.

381
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,600
It's like everyone was out
there marching in protests.

382
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,900
It was like 100% of the people in the
city and seeing them walking down the

383
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:02,071
street.

384
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:02,191
It's,

385
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,430
it's fucking craziness,

386
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:03,940
man.

387
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,340
I don't exactly know what
the fuck the story as though.

388
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,840
It's kind of strange to me too.

389
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,200
It's like,

390
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,590
I mean,

391
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,971
I don't know what,

392
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,540
maybe it's just my perception of things,

393
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,360
but it seems like the
less we are like that,

394
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,780
like our country that used to be that
kind of country where there'd be,

395
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,680
we got in an uproar.

396
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,550
They protested.

397
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,753
You know that though.

398
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,060
I mean it happens but let's keep it real.

399
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,600
It doesn't happen.

400
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
Like using the more,

401
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,050
the rest of the world takes
advantage of their freedom.

402
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,960
Like the less we actually use ours at all.

403
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,600
Well I think we're just so soft.

404
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,370
It's so sad when you're by like,

405
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:33,641
you know,

406
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,930
powdered donuts at 3:30 AM you know,

407
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,780
at the Ralph's every other block.

408
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,380
It's,

409
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,650
yeah,

410
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,483
life gets easy.

411
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,380
It's,

412
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,950
that's not good for you to be,

413
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,100
for things to be that easy,

414
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:43,390
you know?

415
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,770
That's why like an easy job.

416
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,780
It's probably one of the
worst things you should ever,

417
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,231
you know,

418
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:48,370
you don't want an easy job.

419
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,560
You don't want something that
you could just have brain it,

420
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,330
you will slowly rot away while these
kids in Turkey or throwing Molotov

421
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,700
cocktails at the cops and trying
to take over the government.

422
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,260
You know those are,

423
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,130
it's like,

424
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,180
but it's always going to be that,

425
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:01,450
right.

426
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,980
We wishing good luck to them or not.

427
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,310
That's the,

428
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,031
I said I'm not,

429
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,830
I don't know what I'm going to go.

430
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,210
I'm going to go with yes.

431
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,410
Just because I'm a rebel.

432
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,400
I'm down with that.

433
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,241
Brian,

434
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,050
are you a rebel?

435
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,030
I am ready to go with,

436
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,391
yes.

437
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,110
Awesome.

438
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,970
We're done with the younger,

439
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,210
you have a bomb on your hat.

440
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,220
So funny by the way,

441
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:19,990
and being on the airplane with
his hat was really uncomfortable.

442
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,660
I forgot that I had it on and it's just
like writing after the Boston bombings

443
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:25,021
too.

444
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:25,471
And I was like,

445
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,860
why am I wearing this kind of taste?

446
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,743
Good choice.

447
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,190
Did you have the Cammo
jacket to go with it?

448
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,501
No.

449
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:33,334
Like a hunting.

450
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,443
Like a duck.

451
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,270
The duck dynasty,

452
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,110
like hunting jams

453
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,960
with an empty scabbard.

454
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,250
Yeah.

455
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,270
Check my sword.

456
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,950
Jesus.

457
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,820
What about those fucking guys that
just hacked the dude up and Oh yeah,

458
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,391
in England.

459
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,320
That to me was like,

460
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,060
what the fuck is wrong with?

461
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,240
And hope it's really crazy.

462
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,310
If you seen the video of the
guy talking to the camera.

463
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,110
I didn't hear the talking about the
image but I didn't hear any of that.

464
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,750
What?

465
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,920
Like the rant or anything?

466
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,311
Yeah.

467
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,670
I don't know what happened man.

468
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,390
But apparently it was
something to do with religion.

469
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:05,841
Yeah,

470
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,081
that's,

471
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,210
I'm kind of know distant from religion.

472
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,070
I used to experiment
and all kinds of them.

473
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,660
I don't reject any blue
or a Muslim for a while.

474
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,550
Why am I mean?

475
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:13,911
I won't,

476
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,744
I don't,

477
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,110
you know,

478
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,420
I,

479
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,800
I don't practice cause I just
don't believe in organized
religion at this point.

480
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,250
Right.

481
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,730
I believe,

482
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,400
I do believe in God and I believe
in a single creator and all that.

483
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,820
Damn.

484
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,250
But there's a lot of stories
I don't believe in magic.

485
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:25,910
Right.

486
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,420
You know what I mean?

487
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:26,571
Well,

488
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,220
you know what I think about religion.

489
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:28,371
You know,

490
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,450
when I was a young man,

491
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,870
I was forced into Catholics and I don't
believe in killing motherfuckers because

492
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,880
my shit is right and yours is wrong.

493
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,720
You know what I mean?

494
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,100
Unless it's you're breaking into my house
trying to steal my shit then then I'm

495
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:40,430
a fair.

496
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,030
You're fair game.

497
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,141
Well,

498
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:41,440
when I,

499
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,900
when I was a kid I was forced to go to
Catholic school and I hated religion for

500
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,910
a long time after that and
just thought it was ridiculous.

501
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,900
The nuns were cons.

502
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:48,591
It was a mess.

503
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,220
It was just,

504
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,120
I was raised Catholic.

505
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,281
I got a story to it.

506
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,220
Did you go to Catholic school?

507
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,030
Yeah,

508
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,471
so I've,

509
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:55,070
I've for longest time,

510
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,371
yeah,

511
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:55,880
go ahead.

512
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,410
I'm sorry for the line is time.

513
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:59,490
After that I thought that
religion was horse shit.

514
00:15:59,510 --> 00:15:59,750
You know,

515
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,010
I thought this is nothing in this.

516
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,160
But then as I got older I realized
that it's just because I had a terrible

517
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,971
experience with it.

518
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,640
And if you look at like a lot
of the principles of religion,

519
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,060
you got to decipher the fact that people
been around for so long just telling

520
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,900
stories and by the time it gets written
on paper or people's try to twist

521
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:15,171
things,

522
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:18,140
they're the way that they would like it
to be when it comes to translations and

523
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,680
things like that.

524
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,940
And it goes in different languages.

525
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,290
But the core of it all,

526
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,950
it's like people trying to figure
out how to get along to connect.

527
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,380
Yeah.

528
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
People trying to figure
out how to express love.

529
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,060
People trying to figure out how to,

530
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
how to treat one as you
would like to be treated.

531
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:35,750
You know like literally the tenants for
life that people figured out before they

532
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:38,090
really knew much of anything
about how the world works.

533
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,640
They had these ideas and
they said they came from God.

534
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:41,721
You know,

535
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,720
and whether or not anybody had
one on one experience with God.

536
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,590
I don't know.

537
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,371
I mean mate Shit,

538
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,660
who the fuck knows it's there.

539
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:49,730
Just the at the earth exists at all.

540
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,570
It's pretty fucking crazy
as far as I'm concerned.

541
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:51,980
It's nuts.

542
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,551
But I mean,

543
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:53,361
I compare it to this.

544
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:54,194
It's like I,

545
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,360
I don't say I know anything about a god.

546
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,920
I have a sense that
there's a higher power.

547
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:58,760
I have a sense of it,

548
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,001
you know,

549
00:16:59,001 --> 00:16:59,834
I feel like I do.

550
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
I feel like there's something there.

551
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:05,480
But can I understand it or
explain it or define it now man.

552
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,170
Cause you know,

553
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,770
I always say,

554
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,071
you know,

555
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,770
somebody wants told me that's
like your shoe defining you.

556
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,280
Right.

557
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,461
You know,

558
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,370
there's gotta be a line before
between whatever a creator is.

559
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:14,090
And when the creation,

560
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,940
I don't even assume it human
characteristics anymore.

561
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,530
I just take it as like,

562
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:18,710
you know,

563
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,480
kind of like whatever
energy I'm following.

564
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,230
I never,

565
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,580
I never went to school for music.

566
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,690
You would to tell I was,

567
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,270
I never planned to do any
of this shit with my life.

568
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,300
And I don't say go around.

569
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,250
I'm not preaching or anything,

570
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:33,251
but I'm saying alls I did was follow a
certain path in energy and led me through

571
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:34,940
every religion.

572
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,660
It led me through every religion
and by the time I got to Islam,

573
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,110
Aye.

574
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,370
Aye.

575
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:39,860
Aye.

576
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,300
Aye.

577
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,190
I took it into my life and it's
primarily about peace and love.

578
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:47,720
And then there's all this other sub
cultural crazy stuff that goes on in these

579
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,230
other places.

580
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,770
I approached it from a Western mind in a
western philosophy of like just this is

581
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,090
a philosophy to deal with.

582
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,230
It's not like my,

583
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,350
my clan didn't get murdered by that
guys Emam 14,000 or 1400 years ago.

584
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,051
You know,

585
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:04,950
there's all these sub stuff that goes on
between these Sophie's and Sunni's and,

586
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,091
and that's when I was like,

587
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:06,361
you know what?

588
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,780
Organized religion as a whole is
garbage because it meant they're just

589
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,720
organization to it.

590
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,720
Somebody in charge and then
there's power struggle.

591
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,530
Yeah.

592
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,560
Whenever you put it in individual vantage,

593
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,220
religion should be mine.

594
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,650
It's not even up for discussion.

595
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,401
And last,

596
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,520
we're going to sit there and be like very,

597
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:22,801
you know,

598
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,634
unless there's no,

599
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,870
I sat down with you.

600
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,870
I know we could sit down and
have a cool conversation,

601
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,920
but you know,

602
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,630
there's also 400,000 people that listen
to this or of millions of people that

603
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:34,464
listen to this and,

604
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,543
and you know,

605
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,810
you can't have a reasonable argument
with every single one at the light.

606
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,321
You know,

607
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,700
I think that the idea of the organization,

608
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,340
like when you put something
into a giant organization,

609
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,420
then you set rules up.

610
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,190
All of a sudden things get weird,

611
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,490
you know,

612
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,860
that's when people get into power and
its influence gets manipulated and,

613
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:52,251
and the,

614
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:52,500
you know,

615
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,360
like I tell people all the time,

616
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,360
you can consider me Muslim,

617
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:54,901
but I'll go out,

618
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:55,531
I'll go out tonight,

619
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,910
which you and we'll drink three whiskeys.

620
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:57,880
I don't care what you eat,

621
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:58,030
bank.

622
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,470
And what will you meet Allie?

623
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,121
Pepperoni.

624
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:00,451
Yes,

625
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:00,840
I will.

626
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,673
You know,

627
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,151
my wife,

628
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:02,984
that's my wife,

629
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,021
my wife,

630
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,430
the half Jewish lady,

631
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,450
uh,

632
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:06,780
you know,

633
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,850
reintroduced pepperoni's into the life.

634
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,060
So I made a moderation recently to the
lyric was I'll never eat a pig and less a

635
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:15,451
pig as a cop.

636
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,284
So it Kinda just,

637
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,120
it leaves a little open door.

638
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,150
I was in Seattle and some lady came
to the show and gave me venison,

639
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,700
pepperoni that she had made with venison.

640
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,740
Her husband was a deer hunter.

641
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,300
God Damn,

642
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,133
it was good.

643
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,290
There was so much of it.

644
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:31,871
I ate it all.

645
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,980
We see you throwing shit on the grill
on Instagram and I just haven't got that

646
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:35,581
call ever.

647
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:35,910
Like,

648
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,743
come on,

649
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,740
come on,

650
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,400
have some of his venison steak with
me and my underwear two o'clock in the

651
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,380
morning and just being
out there with nature,

652
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,980
that's my,

653
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,600
you know,

654
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,770
my mind is my real time.

655
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,730
My spare tire man.

656
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:48,241
You know what I put,

657
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:48,571
I bought,

658
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:51,690
I posted a picture reasonably
like a Willie Nelson,

659
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,890
like on oh my.

660
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,281
That was like,

661
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:53,501
man.

662
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:54,960
And I'd looked at it
afterwards and I was just,

663
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:55,141
man,

664
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,730
I look so young and Dan and go,

665
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,211
man,

666
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:58,440
I gotta drop like to Apple.

667
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,450
Even hashtagged it on there.

668
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,810
I got to drop like 20 pounds.

669
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,640
I meant to ask you this,

670
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,140
you're,

671
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,480
you're,

672
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,580
you have this artificial
valve and your heart.

673
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,940
Does that prevent you from doing
any kind of actual reasonably Joe?

674
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,380
My Engineer Guy,

675
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,280
one of my entourage,

676
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,400
he's that guy hard into
[inaudible] and uh,

677
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,120
and he was doing P90x in the morning and,

678
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,540
and insanity at night.

679
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,490
And that guy right there,

680
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:20,860
Tam.

681
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,590
So like he got me kind of pumped up.

682
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,071
I started,

683
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:24,540
I went from p nine Dx,

684
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,980
it lasted about one day.

685
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,650
And then I went to my doctor
because it discouraged me.

686
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,221
I was like Yo.

687
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:29,671
And he just,

688
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,504
I got it.

689
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,220
I got to find a dude who like,

690
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,040
I'm interested in your guy who's coming
in here and a couple of days that the

691
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,840
fitness dude,

692
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,770
oh I need to find dude,

693
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,380
he knows how to build my,

694
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,030
my,

695
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,790
my heart back up to that level of output.

696
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,870
Cause it right now it's not there
and I can't just get on a treadmill.

697
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,540
It's boring.

698
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,180
I'd rather play basketball and he's
someone who's going to make it fun,

699
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,430
make it interesting and bright.

700
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,131
And then also,

701
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:51,461
you know,

702
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,240
keep me from eating fucking Lorna Doones
at like two 30 and does the valve,

703
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,810
does the valve function like normal car?

704
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,120
Except for like 2025
pounds that he don't like.

705
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm healthy as an ox.

706
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:03,590
Right.

707
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,691
Oh,

708
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:04,091
okay.

709
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,440
So you could do anything.

710
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,730
So if I got there,

711
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,630
you know what you should do man,

712
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:08,680
he should take martial arts,

713
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,491
take a martial law,

714
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,520
was doing Jujitsu and stuff and then it's
like I kind of put this weight on when

715
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,010
my doctor mind,

716
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,890
I won't blame my daughters,

717
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,520
we had this like a lot of her
life is pumping calories into her,

718
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,290
like keeping weight on cystic fibrosis.

719
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
Youngsters is important
for their lung development.

720
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,110
So like everything in our
house is extra fat in it.

721
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:26,710
And for a long time I just Anna and hey,

722
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:27,431
I mean I won't lie.

723
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:27,900
The department,

724
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,050
you know,

725
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,170
you go through depressions and
you know your food is an outlet.

726
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,400
You've got snack a little
too much sometimes.

727
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,600
But food is yummy.

728
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,733
It's delicious.

729
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,270
The problems so good.

730
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,860
But you know,

731
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,680
so you know,

732
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,510
I just wound up putting on weight.

733
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,900
What was the question there?

734
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,700
When I went into my second and my
daughter and it's a whole nothing we just

735
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,534
talking to about what?

736
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,710
Martial arts you said.

737
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,760
Oh yeah I was doing Jujitsu.

738
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:48,970
Yeah.

739
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,300
Yeah.

740
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,470
And then after I put this weight on,

741
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:50,771
I went,

742
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:54,710
I tried to go back and it's like with
a spare tire trying to do hip throw.

743
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,070
You got it.

744
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:56,630
Yeah man.

745
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,870
You know I was like no I got it.

746
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,260
I got to do that.

747
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,200
I got to drop some pounds to get
back just so I can drop some pounds.

748
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,930
It's just treated as like an,

749
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,110
I mean you should probably
get in shape before you do it,

750
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:10,660
but you could treat it as some
sort of a mental exercise.

751
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,620
Fire Yourself.

752
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,220
There's some torn.

753
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,020
If I make that move I
was telling you about,

754
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,321
you know,

755
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:14,771
I'll probably,

756
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:14,951
you know,

757
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:18,070
I'll be able to hit the Runyon canyon
run and walks and stuff like that.

758
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,911
That's always fun.

759
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,650
I liked that walk.

760
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,280
It's getting up to the top is a reward.

761
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,081
It's huge.

762
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:25,480
I actually used to pull up and start at
the top and walked down cause then you

763
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,280
got to come back up and get your car.

764
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:27,970
You know what I mean?

765
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,370
Caffeine and Jack Daniels
also helps with weight loss.

766
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,580
If you throw up a lung Caner,

767
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,430
this was amazing.

768
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,380
It was just terrible for weight loss.

769
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,560
That's horrible.

770
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:37,394
It's just sugar.

771
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeah it is.

772
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,730
Unfortunately because of I drink whiskey,

773
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,250
it turns right into sugar.

774
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,293
How weird.

775
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,110
I'm not hastily.

776
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,980
I can't give that up.

777
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,860
I need to guy who's going to show me
how I can work around some of the feet.

778
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,330
I think that it's,

779
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,770
it's all about moderation,

780
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,280
you know?

781
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,620
I don't think you have
to give up the whiskey.

782
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,470
I think if you want to stay.

783
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,180
Another thing is I stay steady.

784
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:55,510
I don't,

785
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,041
I I like,

786
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,370
I don't pass a certain point.

787
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,230
You know what I like to 60
and it's like oh that's the,

788
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,181
that's it.

789
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:01,640
That's too big.

790
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,473
Then you get mad.

791
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,880
I get mad but I never,

792
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,380
I don't go like to like to 90 or 300 I
did once I think like two 90 way back.

793
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:09,130
Like,

794
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,820
wow.

795
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,400
But a lot of it too is like we
were talking about thyroid earlier.

796
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,611
I,

797
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:16,100
after my surgery I have to take
a thyroid pill to like keep my,

798
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:16,330
my,

799
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,440
my metabolism just kinda just went when
all the surgery and stuff happened,

800
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,690
my body just kind of said
we're going to slow life down.

801
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,561
Yeah.

802
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:25,450
I would imagine that heart surgery.

803
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,480
So I just need to find out
how I can build back up.

804
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,160
I don't even need to do 90
x like full blast like that,

805
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,020
but I didn't know what I'm saying.

806
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:34,450
But it's good because it makes you do it.

807
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,960
Yeah.

808
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
If you're going to eat it,

809
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,120
it seems like it's too much then,

810
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:38,711
then you know,

811
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,380
do as much as you can
and then stop button.

812
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:40,660
Yeah.

813
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,530
But it makes you do it.

814
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,340
Whatever.

815
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,770
You're going to find the dude that's
going to take money to help me.

816
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm sure

817
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,810
he could find it.

818
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,010
You guys going show up
at my door and be like,

819
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:49,970
Yo dude,

820
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,050
get out of bed pussy.

821
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,260
You want someone bad like that.

822
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:56,540
That was going to be your willpower.

823
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:56,930
Then we'll,

824
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,200
you know,

825
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
we'll be fighting and he's probably
going to be in much better shape for me.

826
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:04,160
So I'm going to have to break out a bat
and it's like an assault charge and I

827
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:05,630
got to buy him a car
when I should have just,

828
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,573
I got in shape,

829
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,110
get Richard Simmons banding,

830
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,730
smoke a bunch of and have
Richard Simmons help you out.

831
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,020
That sounds like the best thing ever.

832
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,160
You won't feel threatened by him.

833
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,430
You would get to make your heart grow.

834
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,500
Cause he's so heartwarming.

835
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,200
I think you just created the
greatest reality show ever.

836
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,093
Wow.

837
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,070
The greatest reality show as I might even,

838
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,630
I might even say yeah to that

839
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,950
if that's all it was about [inaudible]
I don't think he would ever would bust a

840
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:31,281
move.

841
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,320
Come on now it's time's gone.

842
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,530
You know,

843
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,770
maybe when he was younger maybe it
would have felt it and felt confident.

844
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,550
Just give you a gentle patter.

845
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,110
The ass.

846
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,400
Every Saturday he does a class in La
that you could actually sign up for.

847
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,221
So I'm sure he's up for,

848
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:44,690
I'll go grab me some dolphin shorts,

849
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:44,961
man.

850
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:45,690
That's right.

851
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,351
Get in there,

852
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:46,831
son.

853
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,370
Don't be scared to tease.

854
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,470
Don't be scared to give them
a little tease and you know,

855
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,530
like coke and fucking and,

856
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,731
and,

857
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:53,921
and,

858
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,700
and Sushi and I don't
mean Coca Cola by the way.

859
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,943
Oh,

860
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,411
I know.

861
00:24:58,411 --> 00:24:59,710
I like steak and cheese subs.

862
00:24:59,711 --> 00:24:59,970
Yeah,

863
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,803
I'd love steak,

864
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,650
steak and cheese.

865
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:01,951
So,

866
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:02,760
so good.

867
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,160
Steak and cheese sub
with a good Italian roll.

868
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,431
Oh,

869
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:05,821
sweet.

870
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:06,600
Jesus.

871
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,340
I know it's bad.

872
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,173
Where are you getting that from?

873
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,480
All sorts of different places
got hooked me out with,

874
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,311
do you ever go to Kava?

875
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:12,750
Gretta's you want to get some,

876
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:15,840
some serious Italian food that
you really should never be eaten?

877
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,830
Cavarretta retinas and uh,

878
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,170
I guess it's in Canoga Park.

879
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,450
It's an old school Italian Deli.

880
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,980
God Damn Dude,

881
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,630
they got a sausage and peppers.

882
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,700
It's um,

883
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,703
I don't remember.

884
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,520
I know how to get there,

885
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,130
but it's one of those things where you
take a left on there and go right on

886
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:34,461
there.

887
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:34,581
And,

888
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,210
um,

889
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,920
Cavarretta is Google it people.

890
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,270
I'll be there.

891
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,670
This is the news of Michael Douglas.

892
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
A throat cancer affect your pussy.

893
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,520
Eating at all is a little shocking.

894
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,690
A little shocking,

895
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,411
you know,

896
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,244
I mean,

897
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,620
cause I could swear I
heard it a long time ago.

898
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:51,620
Like he first blamed it all on
that kind of already suspected it.

899
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,340
Maybe.

900
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,701
Maybe,

901
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,080
but I heard about just yesterday,

902
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:54,920
I was first time I heard,

903
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,650
I just heard it yesterday and
we're talking about in a while ago

904
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,903
on something.

905
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,213
Hmm.

906
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,740
Maybe.

907
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,960
Maybe it's just that the,

908
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,170
maybe the media,

909
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:03,790
you know,

910
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,700
it's picking up on it.

911
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,470
The second run around,

912
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:06,860
you know,

913
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,060
maybe you talked about it before,

914
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,400
but it's a recent thing because,

915
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:10,970
uh,

916
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,480
a lot of people think that it apparently
that it was like cigarettes or alcohol.

917
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,700
He sat HPV and his throat.

918
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,240
Right.

919
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,080
Brian don't do that.

920
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:18,914
That's just rude.

921
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,970
What was that?

922
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,350
Put a Photoshop of them.

923
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,870
Let's face off photo
shopped Michael Douglas.

924
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,700
Plus he works on his face.

925
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,421
That's just rude.

926
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,200
That's is that already is,

927
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,310
but yes,

928
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,733
that's the chief claim.

929
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,131
Yeah,

930
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:31,964
that's,

931
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,451
it's,

932
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:32,691
you know,

933
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,270
it's kind of fucked up that
sex can give you diseases.

934
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,500
Like what a stupid,

935
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,860
shitty little fucking trick by nature
that sex eating pussy can give you some

936
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,620
horrible throat cancer.

937
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,220
Well rude and what sex is
most chicks isn't like HPV.

938
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:51,930
Something like most girls have or most
guys have huge percent of the population

939
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:52,200
has it.

940
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,530
Apparently they can
just recently they can,

941
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,130
um,

942
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,710
they can give you a vaccination fraud,

943
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,000
but the vaccinations
apparently are a little scary,

944
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:01,921
aren't they?

945
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:02,850
Just there for the girls,

946
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,031
right.

947
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:06,960
Young girls get stacks and there was
somewhere where it's a controversial with

948
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:10,020
her trying to make the girls like
somebody was trying to make girls get them

949
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,400
like or make it mandatory.

950
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,090
Ooh,

951
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,391
wow,

952
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:12,991
that's crazy.

953
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:17,340
And then they give you a
inoculations vaccinations for kids.

954
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:17,431
They,

955
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,170
one of them to give you is a hepatitis B,

956
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,220
which is a,

957
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,790
I think mostly that's actually
transmittable I think.

958
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,780
And you've given it to like kids,

959
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,291
you know,

960
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,320
it's like how many people get
hepatitis B and now it's like,

961
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,060
a lot of them are just from sex.

962
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:30,301
You know,

963
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,730
like maybe it's something that the
kid needs to worry about eventually,

964
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,570
but when it,

965
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,500
but when it's a baby,

966
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,120
are we sure that hepatitis,

967
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,710
I just remember being
told when I was young,

968
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:39,600
sex without love was unhealthy.

969
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,111
Really.

970
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:43,650
Who told you that crazy ass
hole doesn't want to have fun?

971
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,510
I can't remember.

972
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:44,970
Crazy.

973
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,800
Fuck my mother.

974
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,330
Oh silly mom.

975
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,770
It can be both.

976
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,911
It can be both.

977
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:55,770
Sex with love is best know sex without
love is pretty fucking good sex.

978
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,940
It's nothing wrong with it.

979
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,440
People,

980
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,090
if not it needs to be the same.

981
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:00,690
But the connection,

982
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,770
there's a connection there.

983
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,460
Yeah.

984
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,990
If you know,

985
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,660
if you love somebody,

986
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,030
probably care enough and more about
them to find out whether or not,

987
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,420
but,

988
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,830
but at certain numbers it's like the sex
without the love is more than a rushed

989
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:14,560
state.

990
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,900
Right.

991
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,631
Let's just go,

992
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:16,111
come on.

993
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:16,351
You know,

994
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't care.

995
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,030
They don't speak English.

996
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,140
Do you remember when everybody
was worried about AIDS?

997
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,651
I do.

998
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:22,921
You know what?

999
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:24,450
I was just saying something
about it the other day,

1000
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,261
like weird.

1001
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:25,570
Like you know,

1002
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,960
it's nobody worries about it.

1003
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,790
Oh,

1004
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,120
show wasn't I just telling you other day,

1005
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,820
like in the nineties like when you're
out of that five days when you had to

1006
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:33,000
wait,

1007
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,440
even if you knew you were cool,

1008
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,840
you were like five days.

1009
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,081
You are.

1010
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,730
We had to wait for the test to come back.

1011
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:39,564
You were still

1012
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,510
hold on or this and you know,

1013
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,373
dude,

1014
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,333
that's no joke.

1015
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,240
It's like not even in this
kind of thinks about it.

1016
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,850
I remember I was in my car and I was
driving to the gym and I was listening to

1017
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:54,930
the radio and Nace I've remembered the
fucking the street I was turning on when

1018
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:59,650
they said Magic Johnson just announced
that he's HIV positive was home.

1019
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,520
I was thinking this shit
was the Zombie apocalypse.

1020
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,270
I was like him going on the radio
and saying he's HIV positive.

1021
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,104
Oh my God.

1022
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,430
Magic Johnson,

1023
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,480
one of the greatest basketball
players of all time.

1024
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,380
We're all going to die.

1025
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,411
I was like,

1026
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:13,951
he's got hates.

1027
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:14,731
Holy Shit.

1028
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:15,541
It's common man.

1029
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:15,750
I would,

1030
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,150
I just anticipated a wave of AIDS.

1031
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,710
He said never arrived.

1032
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,360
Change.

1033
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,351
Strange.

1034
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:22,741
Strange,

1035
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:23,430
strange.

1036
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,370
I remember when he died
of aids and I was like,

1037
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:26,700
wow,

1038
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,361
cause that one,

1039
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:29,460
nobody even knew about
it until he was dead.

1040
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,383
It's crazy.

1041
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,230
Yeah.

1042
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,750
And these people that are
dying of AIDS in Africa.

1043
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,450
That's a really fascinating
thing as well because,

1044
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:36,840
um,

1045
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,110
apparently someone please tweet me,

1046
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,500
and correct me if this is incorrect,

1047
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:41,980
but

1048
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,940
what I've was told was that a lot of
what they see when they release figures,

1049
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:46,390
like,

1050
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:46,571
you know,

1051
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,040
x amount of people have aids,

1052
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,920
that doesn't mean x amount of
people or even HIV positive.

1053
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,050
That means that they have
the symptoms of aids.

1054
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,640
It means their immune system is fucked.

1055
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,960
So they see these people in,

1056
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,540
whether it's from poor nutrition
or a host of various diseases,

1057
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,220
they don't necessarily test every one of
these people because it's expensive to

1058
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:03,880
do that.

1059
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,270
So apparently when you hear
x amount of people have aids,

1060
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,310
that's a little on the rough side.

1061
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,750
It's a little bit of a rough estimate.

1062
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,081
What,

1063
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:11,390
you know,

1064
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,090
it's just people are fucked.

1065
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,710
It's a shit spot to be,

1066
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,150
there's a lot wrong with being there.

1067
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,920
There's a lot of fucking diseases.

1068
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,160
It's not just a,

1069
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:19,540
you know,

1070
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,980
HIV like,

1071
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,040
Goddamn Africa's got a
host of fucking diseases,

1072
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,360
especially when you're poor
and you're not eating anything.

1073
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,620
And then like I remember seeing something
on a show once about like there was

1074
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:34,570
some certain tribe or area of Africa
where the believe the cure for aids,

1075
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,160
what's to fucking version,

1076
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,100
which is like,

1077
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,900
wow,

1078
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,733
oh,

1079
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,390
how do you even come up with that?

1080
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,860
Africa is still rock,

1081
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,050
some really crazy ways of life.

1082
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:50,620
It gives you insight into the way the
world was just a thousand years ago or

1083
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:51,580
2000 years ago.

1084
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,280
Like witchcraft is huge in Africa,

1085
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,540
which craft and burning people because
they're witches and accusing people of

1086
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:03,541
witches and people doing things to
help cure you of demonic possession.

1087
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,350
There's like a big business in it where
they like cure children of demonic

1088
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:09,540
possession and they,

1089
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,120
they,

1090
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,510
they take them from their
parents and their required,

1091
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:15,730
their parents come up with thousands and
thousands of dollars to give to them.

1092
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,670
So the parents go fucking crazy and do
anything they can to get the money to get

1093
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:22,270
their children back because this guy's
claiming that this child is possessed by

1094
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:23,104
the devil.

1095
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,120
So if he doesn't do this exorcism,

1096
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,250
like they'll kill this kid like this.

1097
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,310
It's a a normal common thing in Africa.

1098
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,730
I remember seeing something
about that fucking crazy.

1099
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,180
There's a,

1100
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,600
and there's a ton of them and they're all
running this racket scare the fuck out

1101
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,550
of everybody killing people and it's,

1102
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,030
it's an,

1103
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,800
it's a naughty place to live

1104
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,550
and it's 2013 man.

1105
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:46,031
Just like,

1106
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:46,540
you know,

1107
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,130
we're sitting here chilling in the valley,

1108
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,560
having ourselves a good
old time drinking coffee,

1109
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,341
kicking back,

1110
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,174
playing music.

1111
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,510
This is dude out there is like burning
people because he says there are a,

1112
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,790
which you know that's
all going on somewhere.

1113
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,653
Yeah,

1114
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,503
it's nutty.

1115
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,660
It's Nutty as fuck or moving there.

1116
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,523
Don't go to African

1117
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,803
people tried.

1118
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,170
There was a bunch of Europeans are
going to start a wildlife preserve.

1119
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
I think it's going to
preserve itself just fine.

1120
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,940
I don't know if you really
need to preserve it,

1121
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,310
you need to stop people from killing them.

1122
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,620
People where people are always
killing him for like hard on pills,

1123
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,603
you know,

1124
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,120
it's always Chinese people that think
that you can get some Rhino Horn grinds it

1125
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,460
up and you dick grows some tiger penis.

1126
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,650
That's ridiculous.

1127
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,090
That's what,

1128
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,923
that's what,

1129
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,550
what else?

1130
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,420
There's some other benefits for Rhino
Horn or other uses that they use,

1131
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,950
but that's what they're
killing these rhinos for it.

1132
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,190
They're like wiping out the white vinyl
population and because people in Asia

1133
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,660
have this thing for rhino horns,

1134
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,460
it's kind of,

1135
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,270
it would kind of suck if
there was no more rhinos.

1136
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,800
Rhinos are kind of bad ass.

1137
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,040
The fact that that thing actually,

1138
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,830
there's gotta be thin
at this point though.

1139
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,941
It must be very thin.

1140
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:50,330
I think some of them are actually extinct
now because these dudes just won't

1141
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:50,930
stop hunting them.

1142
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,711
They don't give a fuck.

1143
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:52,544
It's just this is,

1144
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,200
they live wild.

1145
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,760
That's a wild place.

1146
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,161
We're so,

1147
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:58,430
so off on that same thing.

1148
00:32:58,431 --> 00:32:59,650
I loved cater hunters,

1149
00:32:59,660 --> 00:32:59,931
man.

1150
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:01,660
I love all people.

1151
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,000
I want to go,

1152
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,530
yeah,

1153
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,110
I want to go.

1154
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,100
I want to go with some pros.

1155
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,820
I don't want to go and
just try and kind of gator.

1156
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,550
I want to be one of the themes
and like just even being,

1157
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
the boat's got to be an adrenaline.

1158
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,880
I'd like 12 foot gate or on a boat.

1159
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:17,714
Fuck

1160
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,340
those dudes got to be
strong as fucking oxys.

1161
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,250
The one family,

1162
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,690
the son and the dad,

1163
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,180
they'll their bill young dudes
with that crazy accident.

1164
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:31,160
The Dad's got a rat tail that it was like
supposedly like the world champion arm

1165
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:32,180
wrestler in his weight class.

1166
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:32,960
I believe it.

1167
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,460
I bet that guy's drunk as fuck.

1168
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:34,971
He's a son,

1169
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,310
supposedly fights a little in me,

1170
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:36,880
man.

1171
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,510
That's Ron dinosaurs around all day.

1172
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,630
I mean the literally pick it up
dinosaurs and shoot him in the head.

1173
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,700
In the original season of swamp people,

1174
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,740
there was a dude that
would go out and live,

1175
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:49,410
catch them for like experience
like scientists wanted to go.

1176
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,810
You've got the medium sized ones but
still water by their necks and he would be

1177
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:54,644
like,

1178
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,070
tape.

1179
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,670
Wow,

1180
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,503
crazy.

1181
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,433
Love that shit.

1182
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,670
How do you get good at that?

1183
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,370
Those are the people that are going to
be around when it all goes bad still.

1184
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:02,150
You know that right?

1185
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,770
Well if you want to go to Louisiana,

1186
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:04,660
you can be around too.

1187
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,511
They're everywhere.

1188
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,060
Those fucking,

1189
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,150
you can't kill the alligators
enough like there's,

1190
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,130
you have to really go on an assault.

1191
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,350
Those guys are pulling 500 out of season.

1192
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,430
They still got,

1193
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,611
yeah,

1194
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:15,110
he's still got alligators
all over the place.

1195
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,970
Crossing highways and shit.

1196
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,271
They're disgusting.

1197
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,030
That must be rough and a dog around there.

1198
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,930
Fuck yeah it is.

1199
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,141
I,

1200
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,100
when I lived in Florida,

1201
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,780
dog got stolen from some old lady.

1202
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,010
That alligator just

1203
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,650
go rack doggy every right to that.

1204
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,484
His mind,

1205
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,810
their gallery that's not stolen as the
rules of the word dog was slipping.

1206
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,690
Not only is it Doug slip
and it was tied to a chain.

1207
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,720
There was an old lady who can't run
other end and that's just dinner.

1208
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,580
Yeah.

1209
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,310
The Florida one of the alligator
recognizes the old lady couldn't run.

1210
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,530
I wonder because it just
came out of the water.

1211
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:48,800
It's like,

1212
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,100
Yep,

1213
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll take that Mac.

1214
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,530
Cause she's lucky it took the dog.

1215
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,641
She's very lucky,

1216
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:56,540
but they're weird.

1217
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:56,771
They're,

1218
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,340
they'd very rarely attack people.

1219
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,160
Although there was a story recently
where a guy was running from the cops.

1220
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,820
It was on a,

1221
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,960
in Miami and he,

1222
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:03,200
uh,

1223
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,100
hit the brakes and jumped off an
overpass into the water right where an

1224
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:07,881
alligator was.

1225
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,100
So literally as he jumped into the water,

1226
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,790
the alligator attacked him and killed
him right in front of the cops.

1227
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,720
Probably got jumps off a
fucking bridge and lands on you.

1228
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,640
The alligator just fucked him up.

1229
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,350
The cop said it was like
a scene in the movie.

1230
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,380
It's like the guy literally
locks up his brakes,

1231
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
jumps into the water,

1232
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:25,790
and then it's,

1233
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,800
ah,

1234
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,670
alligators are just ripping them apart.

1235
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,691
But other than that,

1236
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:33,710
it's pretty rare that they get people
crazy crocodiles with what we've got to

1237
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,544
worry about.

1238
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,460
They have a,

1239
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,800
they found Nile crocodiles
and the everglades now.

1240
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:38,820
Yeah,

1241
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,511
that's scary.

1242
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:39,931
So they,

1243
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:40,251
they,

1244
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:43,200
they issue to kill on order
for these Nile crocodiles.

1245
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,981
As far as they know,

1246
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,480
they don't have a breeding population,

1247
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,700
but there definitely have been
spotted in the everglades,

1248
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,750
which is fucking real problem assholes,

1249
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,313
Florida,

1250
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,071
Florida,

1251
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:54,730
the fucking cock of the country that are,

1252
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,010
that place is crazy.

1253
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:59,820
Phil would nutty white people who are
on bath salts and the fucking throwing

1254
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:02,250
snakes out their car window when
they're driving down the street.

1255
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,750
Then they're assholes.

1256
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,650
Florida is filled with the redneck.

1257
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,480
He has redneck assholes on the planet.

1258
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,580
It's a lot of fun down there though.

1259
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,070
It's on another level from the deep south.

1260
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:14,731
You know,

1261
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:15,840
it's like the deep south.

1262
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,420
That's like the Mexico of the deep south.

1263
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,570
That's what Florida's like cause
it's like you go below the deep,

1264
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:22,590
deep south is all class.

1265
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,191
He and shit.

1266
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:24,990
You can go to Tennessee
and be a gentleman,

1267
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,730
have a bourbon and you
know what I'm saying?

1268
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,730
But you get down to Florida
and shit gets crazy be.

1269
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,121
Why?

1270
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,310
Because it's the Mexico of the south.

1271
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,061
That's what it is.

1272
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:33,451
It's like,

1273
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:33,811
man,

1274
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,070
it's barely America.

1275
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,760
When you're in Florida,

1276
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,310
go do gigs in Miami.

1277
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,551
Dude,

1278
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:40,350
you are barely in America.

1279
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,760
And I say that in a good way.

1280
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,950
Like it is a beautiful energy.

1281
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,821
Like they're fun.

1282
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:45,930
Fucking peep on that.

1283
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,610
So one of the best places to go if you
want to just go and unwind and have a

1284
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,330
good time.

1285
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,350
I love watching all those,

1286
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:52,680
uh,

1287
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:52,891
you know,

1288
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:53,431
cocaine,

1289
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:56,900
cowboys documentaries about how
like basically Miami has just built,

1290
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,330
built out of cocaine real and murder.

1291
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,650
That's,

1292
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,810
I mean literally built.

1293
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,680
That's like literally built the city.

1294
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:05,450
Yeah.

1295
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,150
That dude,

1296
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,983
Billy Corbin.

1297
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,120
I met him in uh,

1298
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,910
in Florida.

1299
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,330
He's,

1300
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,590
he's a bad motherfucker.

1301
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:11,510
Those documentaries,

1302
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,050
God damn good cocaine
cowboys won the two Giselda.

1303
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:16,850
Is that what her name was?

1304
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,580
Just tell the blonde girl Roselda Zelda.

1305
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:19,950
Ooh.

1306
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,880
She was scary.

1307
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,840
Did you ever see the gun?

1308
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,300
Don't second cocaine
cowboys where it's dude was

1309
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,030
dude was banging her was
like making it happen.

1310
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,380
The Oakland guy was like,

1311
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,220
shit,

1312
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,360
Billy's man,

1313
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,530
it's hilarious.

1314
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:34,891
He was just,

1315
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:38,370
he stroked out there to get his little
stick way at every time he got to jail.

1316
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,000
And then how about the fact she got out?

1317
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,280
That should be by action.

1318
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,870
You're going to get at do some
you got to get at do some salute,

1319
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:46,141
man.

1320
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:46,974
He for him.

1321
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,500
Fuck yeah.

1322
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,170
Oh yeah.

1323
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,390
Yeah.

1324
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,410
This is a strong mills.

1325
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:52,760
You couldn't take a pill and just go
in where he had to get that shit up for

1326
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,410
grizzled.

1327
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah.

1328
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,470
That is a strong move.

1329
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,400
Are we sure that it was before
there was Viagara when was fired?

1330
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,910
I was like in the eighties man.

1331
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,241
It was,

1332
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,400
it was it the eighties hmm.

1333
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,460
I'm pretty sure this was in the
eighties early nineties at demos.

1334
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,630
When did they invent Viagara?

1335
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Brian Know Brian at his home.

1336
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,270
The weather was [inaudible] 78 degrees.

1337
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:18,810
Those core,

1338
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,880
those commercials are always so lame.

1339
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,120
It's always like a couple with gray hair
and they're holding hands and they look

1340
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,880
at each other and they come
close and you know the cuddle,

1341
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,810
you know it's,

1342
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,220
it's never a dude with a maniacal look
on his face and a boner that's five hours

1343
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:35,440
old will not die and he's
sweating and his heart,

1344
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,650
it's fucking Liba Navis

1345
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,503
chest.

1346
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,400
It's never that.

1347
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm always curious about the one that
says it lasts for three days and you can

1348
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:44,650
just like kind of call
upon it when you want.

1349
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,280
Jeannie,

1350
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,300
you keep for three days.

1351
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,910
I'm on that shit right now and it sucks
it really the three day things not that

1352
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:55,744
good like it.

1353
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,030
All right.

1354
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,440
Explain to me how that works,

1355
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,060
what you can just summon a
boner while you were on it.

1356
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,990
I noticed like the first
day it's like just intense,

1357
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:07,990
like everything that
happens close to your Dick,

1358
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:09,550
it just makes a boner immediately.

1359
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,590
Like today it's more like if I
start touching it or if something,

1360
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,240
if Jamie starts like kissing
it with is pretty lips,

1361
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,400
then it would definitely
like shoot right back up.

1362
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,800
But it's not as sensitive to the point
where I'm like walking around like

1363
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,550
Goddammit,

1364
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,880
I have a boner right now where
the first day he is third day.

1365
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,850
It's just kind of like you
have to try a little harder.

1366
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,000
But when it's ready,

1367
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:32,230
if you take invite Viagra
or Cialis or which,

1368
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:32,991
which one of them was,

1369
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,060
this was black power,

1370
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:34,740
which is,

1371
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:34,840
oh,

1372
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,640
it's probably see the Alice,

1373
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,520
but it's a bigger pill so it's
more Cialis than a normal pill.

1374
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,030
So it's like five days worth of Seattle.

1375
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:41,864
Oh my God.

1376
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,360
Why are you taking all of that?

1377
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,490
Because I have,

1378
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,760
but I don't you

1379
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,540
be a better idea.

1380
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,651
Don't think it'd be better.

1381
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,240
I did just take like half a pill.

1382
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,730
Have you ever thought
about taking half a pill?

1383
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,310
No.

1384
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:01,310
Cause I do you think are you going to die?

1385
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,680
Oh,

1386
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,360
where are your heart's
going to fucking give out?

1387
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,510
I think boner pills at a
certain level or unhealthy.

1388
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,070
Well,

1389
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,050
it's weight loss problems other places.

1390
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Most of the time

1391
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,570
it's like it's hard to
borrow it temporarily,

1392
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:19,380
but the interest rates get higher
the longer you hold onto it.

1393
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,990
Check Danielson's Ferris,

1394
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,780
so he says

1395
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,890
biological lunch,

1396
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,180
there's no bug free book,

1397
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,961
biological,

1398
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:25,560
free lunch.

1399
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,950
When you take something and it has a
very positive reaction and also probably

1400
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:33,600
has some side effects that you're not
really aware of that are equally powerful.

1401
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,493
Yeah,

1402
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,780
ripping pussy apart.

1403
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,230
[inaudible] another thing it does,

1404
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:39,861
it really helps.

1405
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:41,150
It's not coming at all.

1406
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,080
That's like if you sometimes don't
even come and you're just like,

1407
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:45,381
all right,

1408
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:48,680
I just fucking made that chick have
like the best sex and the whole entire

1409
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:49,010
world.

1410
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,010
I know many people across the country
or a barfing right now I'm just thinking

1411
00:40:52,011 --> 00:40:56,570
of you having sex with anyone and you're
talking about Taryn pussy apart and put

1412
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
a quilt quilt done.

1413
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,000
After that they hurt your brain or

1414
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,490
brain already heard which one is,

1415
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,130
that's crazy talk.

1416
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:05,611
No,

1417
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:06,444
it's cool.

1418
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,770
You should probably have less.

1419
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,600
I think there's,

1420
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:13,830
there's a certain dangerous with it but
you know that's one thing that is weird.

1421
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,430
Apparently it didn't enhance
his athletic performance.

1422
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,750
It's banned in the Olympics

1423
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,700
cause it's three cycles.

1424
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,001
Your,

1425
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,890
your blood positive

1426
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,731
doctor Brian,

1427
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:30,380
how would you a scientifically described
the effects of it moves the blood she's

1428
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:31,880
down around or your place.

1429
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:36,721
Yeah,

1430
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:39,030
but apparently enhances endurance.

1431
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,330
I like how the pill was called
the black power black power.

1432
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:42,661
It's a,

1433
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:43,381
it's a white guy.

1434
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:44,960
Fucking a black chick on the cover.

1435
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,493
Okay.

1436
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,820
Right.

1437
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,171
Got It.

1438
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:49,981
Cause I was like damn,

1439
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:51,480
he's making that grow happy.

1440
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,030
Yeah.

1441
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,030
Skinny white guy is only get white
girlfriend or only get black girlfriends.

1442
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:57,961
You know those dudes,

1443
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:59,660
the white dudes are only Jewish guy.

1444
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,790
Tell a lot.

1445
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,290
We take those things man.

1446
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:04,651
I got,

1447
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:04,861
you know,

1448
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:05,694
with the heart stuff.

1449
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,081
But I remember,

1450
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:08,190
I remember when I got out of hospital,

1451
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:12,180
a really important thing to me was the
doctor said you can't have sex so you

1452
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:13,530
could walk a flight of stairs.

1453
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,430
Wow.

1454
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,490
And I would look at the stairs
like every day and be like,

1455
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,333
I'm gonna try it.

1456
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,411
Three steps.

1457
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,490
And I'd come back down to,

1458
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,530
we bought a week and a half.

1459
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,110
Now when they date,

1460
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,200
they give you open heart surgery or
they have them open up your chest bone?

1461
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,063
Yes sir.

1462
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,451
What does that like,

1463
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,980
how long does it take
before that heals up?

1464
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,300
Um,

1465
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,081
do you feel it now,

1466
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:34,861
like when you touch it,

1467
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:35,650
does it bother you?

1468
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,310
Sometimes I feel the
wire through the skin.

1469
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:38,491
Yeah.

1470
00:42:38,491 --> 00:42:39,970
Cause they wire it shut.

1471
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,441
You know what I mean?

1472
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:42,380
There's a little wire in and
when I get x ray you see like,

1473
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,600
it looks like a little Barb wire
thing wrapped around the sternum.

1474
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,880
Does that go off when you go
through the metal detectors?

1475
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:48,691
Man,

1476
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,050
they'd have,

1477
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,820
they have to have it once or twice
in my life since this happened.

1478
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,651
I believed that,

1479
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,150
that it's that set it off.

1480
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,220
But it's like when they're on super high,

1481
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:57,530
like if they're set high,

1482
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,680
I think I've got,

1483
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,700
I've gone through those,

1484
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,750
you know the full body,

1485
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,890
they never say a word.

1486
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:03,180
They never asked me about anything.

1487
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,560
I don't even know if they see the full
body is a radio wave thing and what it's

1488
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,510
looking for is external objects.

1489
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,250
Right.

1490
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,350
Looking for shit that you might
have in your pocket and like shanks,

1491
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,520
you know sometimes like those lines,

1492
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,760
those make it go off if it,

1493
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,250
if it's set re you know,

1494
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,460
ridiculously high.

1495
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,443
Wow.

1496
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,980
Like I've had guys go like what is that?

1497
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:23,521
And I'd be like,

1498
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:23,851
I won.

1499
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,750
I didn't wear a necklace to the,

1500
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:27,360
I was like you must be getting
either the wire or my valve.

1501
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,561
Wow.

1502
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:29,640
Right through the skin.

1503
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,780
How fucked up is that?

1504
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:32,100
We have to test people from metal,

1505
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,410
make sure they're not bring
anything hard on them.

1506
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,760
Does it feel foreign?

1507
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:38,340
Like sometimes there's like
vibrate during certain things.

1508
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:39,780
Like if you're like on a roller coaster,

1509
00:43:39,781 --> 00:43:42,750
do you feel like I just certain
foreign object inside of you?

1510
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,170
No,

1511
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:43,440
no,

1512
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:43,651
no.

1513
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:44,230
It's all the,

1514
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,063
you know,

1515
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,610
the crazy part is like acoustics of rooms.

1516
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,650
Sometimes if I'm sitting
in the right spot,

1517
00:43:49,651 --> 00:43:50,580
it's so loud.

1518
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,920
It's ridiculous because it's like tick,

1519
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,101
tick,

1520
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:52,271
tick,

1521
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:52,491
tick.

1522
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:52,610
Yeah.

1523
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,443
Like people,

1524
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,031
I'll be like,

1525
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:54,480
what the hell?

1526
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,631
You know,

1527
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,310
if I'm in the right
spot in the right room,

1528
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,793
that is why,

1529
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,030
because 90% of the time for me,

1530
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:00,930
it's white noise.

1531
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,411
You know,

1532
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:02,180
I to just kind of,

1533
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,960
I don't hear that anymore.

1534
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,281
I want to,

1535
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:06,810
I can hear it click his life.

1536
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,853
Yeah.

1537
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,380
Oddly enough is it,

1538
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,671
you know,

1539
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:09,930
it's,

1540
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:10,620
it's a clock.

1541
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,340
To me it's like,

1542
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,671
all right,

1543
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,220
that's,

1544
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,000
that's each one of those is the second
I was thinking about it the other day,

1545
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,130
I was just talking to somebody about like,

1546
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:17,341
you know,

1547
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:18,360
when you really figured out what,

1548
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:19,470
how many days we live?

1549
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,920
Maybe thirty five thousand
forty thousand days.

1550
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,881
Is that a lot?

1551
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,320
365 days a year.

1552
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,490
So ten seven hundred 3000 so you know,

1553
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,550
23,000 if you live 60 years,

1554
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,031
70 years,

1555
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:41,031
call it 70 70 times 365

1556
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,030
sounds like we were all math retards.

1557
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:48,060
It's a lot of time and
somewhere in that neighborhood.

1558
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,240
Right?

1559
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,690
I'm sure a lot of days 40
let's call it 50,000 days.

1560
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:52,590
Your life is right.

1561
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:54,510
Does that sound like a lot doesn't to me?

1562
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,310
No.

1563
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:55,560
No.

1564
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,393
It doesn't sound,

1565
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,350
I equate it to dollars,

1566
00:44:58,351 --> 00:44:58,591
man.

1567
00:44:58,591 --> 00:44:59,670
I could spend that now.

1568
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,310
I go to here right now I spent $50,000.

1569
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,060
Right.

1570
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,570
You know what I mean?

1571
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:03,961
I hear you.

1572
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:04,531
I wouldn't want to,

1573
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,250
that would suck,

1574
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:05,580
you know?

1575
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,200
But unless you're a gambling man,

1576
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,010
you know,

1577
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,060
or just an ass.

1578
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,030
Yeah.

1579
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,130
I think we like to think that the
shit is going to last forever,

1580
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,120
but clearly it's not.

1581
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,630
Yeah,

1582
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,441
it's really short,

1583
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:16,650
man.

1584
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,110
That's the one thing that whole thing
really made me realize when I was laying

1585
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:20,640
on the thing going in thinking I was,

1586
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,140
I was literacy mainly thinking I was,

1587
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,250
I wasn't coming out of it.

1588
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:23,671
I was like,

1589
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:24,570
I'm dying.

1590
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,580
Do you know the whole,

1591
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:27,571
for me,

1592
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,430
I didn't see visions of
flashing before my eyes.

1593
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:30,264
It was just the whole,

1594
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,890
I think I might even said
it on the show before.

1595
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:33,150
It was the summation of like,

1596
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,070
that's how long it was.

1597
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,420
Right.

1598
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,400
That was a blink of a fucking
I from birth till now.

1599
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,060
Right.

1600
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,540
Which is,

1601
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,373
wow.

1602
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,300
And that was,

1603
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,133
you know,

1604
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,310
and that's really my
biggest lesson out of it.

1605
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,350
And now I've got a clock ticking.

1606
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,210
I'm the,

1607
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,491
I'm the,

1608
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,930
I'm the crocodile from Peter Pan,

1609
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:49,590
you know?

1610
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:49,771
Well,

1611
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:52,500
when you go through anything that really
makes you think that it could be over

1612
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:52,631
there,

1613
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:54,240
makes you reassess the whole picture.

1614
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,950
Sometimes we just get real used to
everything used to be and you know,

1615
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:00,810
I build to go to the
supermarket and get food.

1616
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:04,080
You get used to being able to
get up in the morning and walk,

1617
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:04,561
you know,

1618
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,240
you get used to all being alive.

1619
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:06,970
Being alive.

1620
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,803
Yeah.

1621
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,430
Just the,

1622
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,630
just being conscious.

1623
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:09,811
I mean,

1624
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,010
the world is a strange,

1625
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:12,420
strange fuck place manner,

1626
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:13,530
which is so used to it.

1627
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,540
We don't even think about a stranger does.

1628
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,430
Every once in a while I'll sit back and
just think about the actual breath I'm

1629
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:21,264
going to take.

1630
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,850
That's crazy.

1631
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,530
Yeah.

1632
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,160
What that,

1633
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,730
what we just and what you took in,

1634
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:27,930
what your body took out of it,

1635
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:28,770
what you're pushing out.

1636
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,623
You know what I mean?

1637
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,730
That one simple thing is,

1638
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,210
is,

1639
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,490
is high science and it's
invisible completely.

1640
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,900
You need it and it's invisible.

1641
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:37,800
You don't even know where it is.

1642
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:38,800
It'd be in a room,

1643
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,640
there's none of it in there.

1644
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:40,950
And they walk in there and God.

1645
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,293
Whoa.

1646
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:43,561
What,

1647
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:44,820
what led you to,

1648
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,480
to,

1649
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,260
to the Muslim religion as opposed to
like Christian with a family that,

1650
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,710
um,

1651
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,071
was,

1652
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,030
was Muslim.

1653
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,070
They never once talked
to me about or anything.

1654
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:58,071
I found some literature that I've read
and listened to a tape or two and at the

1655
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,640
F my fundamental understanding
of it is it's actually all,

1656
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:06,600
it's all three of the Judeo Christianity,

1657
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,111
you know,

1658
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:07,711
it's that whole,

1659
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:10,770
it's a summation of all three is it?

1660
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,720
Yeah.

1661
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,241
What are the,

1662
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:13,440
what are the three,

1663
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,091
Judaism,

1664
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,650
Christianity and Islam.

1665
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,370
It goes through all those so
called profits and all that.

1666
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,720
And to be honest,

1667
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:22,381
it's like all those,

1668
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:22,591
you know,

1669
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,970
the more the older I get,

1670
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,320
the more I see.

1671
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,510
Those are stories I still,

1672
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:27,920
like I said,

1673
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,890
believe in the creator.

1674
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,800
I believe,

1675
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,300
see Islam for me just brought me like,

1676
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,451
oh,

1677
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:32,440
this is all connected.

1678
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,910
And it was like very much about peace
in a time in my life when I needed that.

1679
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,523
And,

1680
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,663
um,

1681
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,811
but like I said,

1682
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:41,081
like I,

1683
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,910
I have not part of any mosque.

1684
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm not part of any and I haven't even,

1685
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,940
I don't even practice like that.

1686
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:46,421
You know what I mean?

1687
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:46,641
It's,

1688
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:46,900
it's,

1689
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,201
for me,

1690
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,880
it's like personal.

1691
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,743
Again,

1692
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,550
if it wasn't me and you
having this discussion,

1693
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:51,851
it's like,

1694
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:52,031
man,

1695
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:52,330
it's not,

1696
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,350
it's not even important,

1697
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:53,740
right?

1698
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,573
It's my thing.

1699
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:55,271
Whatever,

1700
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,140
yours is yours.

1701
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,850
Right.

1702
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,210
Cause if I was a real Muslim,

1703
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,000
like hardcore,

1704
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,460
everybody,

1705
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,530
it's praise Odin,

1706
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:03,350
I'd be all offense.

1707
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:03,701
You know what I mean?

1708
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:04,090
That's,

1709
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,520
that would be a great use of it.

1710
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,410
And it's just,

1711
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,000
and it's so silly because it's,

1712
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,531
it's like,

1713
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:09,080
come on,

1714
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,220
we're,

1715
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,210
that's kind of the point,

1716
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,463
you know what I mean?

1717
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,550
And,

1718
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,301
and I,

1719
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:15,820
that's when religion for me
gets narrow minded and just,

1720
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:16,330
I can't,

1721
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,560
I can't follow that path.

1722
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,020
So what you say is that
you benefit from it,

1723
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:24,190
you felt you find benefit from the
knowledge I've taken from it and I don't,

1724
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,150
I'll never,

1725
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,150
I mean you could say I'm Christian and
Islam and Muslim because I've practiced

1726
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,260
both in my life.

1727
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,560
You were talking earlier
about Catholicism.

1728
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:36,880
I have,

1729
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,450
I was raised like in going to catechism
school and all that and learning the

1730
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:40,900
lessons.

1731
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,580
And then at 14 I had the,

1732
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:43,630
uh,

1733
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,131
what they call it,

1734
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:45,100
confirmation,

1735
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:50,200
which was you go before the bishop and
you basically do this thing and you can,

1736
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:50,330
you're,

1737
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,280
it's like you're sort of Bar
Mitzvah of a Christian and Annette,

1738
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,180
that symbolic way.

1739
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,400
We didn't get any checks or big parties.

1740
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,823
Um,

1741
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,171
you know,

1742
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:00,370
it wasn't a big of like that.

1743
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:00,881
It was just kind of,

1744
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:03,820
you go there and you're a man now and
you get the Holy Spirit is supposed to

1745
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:04,654
come down in you.

1746
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,370
And I was buying in at that age,

1747
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:06,540
you know,

1748
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,151
I mean I bought in,

1749
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:10,870
I was going to it all and I remember
sitting there and the church and the guy

1750
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:13,840
anoints you with the thing and you say
the words and I'm walking back and I sit

1751
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,100
down in my pew and I'm like,

1752
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:15,880
okay,

1753
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,661
it's going to have another,

1754
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:17,650
kids are kind of act,

1755
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:18,360
act not.

1756
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:18,910
It wasn't like,

1757
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,211
ah,

1758
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:19,751
this happened to me.

1759
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:23,530
Book kids were like happy in the Aa and
I just didn't feel it goddamn thing.

1760
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,800
And for me it wasn't that I
thought religion was bullshit.

1761
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:27,760
Like how you turned.

1762
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:28,630
That was for me it was like,

1763
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,021
Oh man,

1764
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:29,920
there's something wrong with me.

1765
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,950
Oh for a long time.

1766
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,063
You know what I mean?

1767
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,941
And then like I said,

1768
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:38,560
I found this other thing that
Kinda was accepted me on my own,

1769
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:39,341
on my own terms.

1770
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:39,470
I,

1771
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,620
nobody introduced me to Islam personally.

1772
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:44,470
Nobody said this is what you should think
or believe or here's something for you

1773
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:45,304
to read.

1774
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,280
This stuff fell into
my lap and I was like,

1775
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:48,731
like I said,

1776
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:52,900
I follow signs and so that
got me through a very,

1777
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,530
I believe like that philosophy and
the way it took my mind are one of the

1778
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:57,700
reasons I'm still alive today.

1779
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,860
I think there's some great,

1780
00:49:58,861 --> 00:49:58,980
yeah,

1781
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,540
lessons and a lot of organized religion
and some great lessons and in both the

1782
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,360
Bible and the Koran and the tour,

1783
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:07,560
this is a great lessons in there.

1784
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:12,561
The problem is they're old as fuck and
they need to be updated like they need.

1785
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:13,741
There's not,

1786
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:17,040
it's not a bad thing to
have something like a Bible,

1787
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,930
but it's a bad thing to have some old
shit that nobody truly understands and not

1788
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:26,931
have some just guidelines of
how to live life and be a happy,

1789
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:29,570
healthy person and don't,

1790
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:29,991
you know,

1791
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:31,870
don't necessarily say that they came

1792
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,210
from anywhere.

1793
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,920
You don't know where the
fuck they can't from.

1794
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:39,010
But these are things that people have
accumulated and we figured out in time

1795
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:39,790
what's up.

1796
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,190
I got a song if you got a
song about this religion.

1797
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:42,581
Oh,

1798
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,090
okay,

1799
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:43,511
beautiful.

1800
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:44,140
Let's do it.

1801
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,973
Isn't my religion.

1802
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,083
Okay.

1803
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:47,520
Friday,

1804
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,670
it's almost like we set this up.

1805
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,021
Well,

1806
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:51,280
that's why I had to grab the guitar.

1807
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:55,691
Powerful.

1808
00:50:55,691 --> 00:50:58,240
Everlast that's my religion.

1809
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,410
This call Friday the 13th okay.

1810
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,873
Oh,

1811
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,611
thanks man.

1812
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:16,680
Down with red lights.

1813
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:19,590
Shine wants to junk is foul down the bed.

1814
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,380
The Sun rass run out of smashes him.

1815
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,350
The drugs they sound clear from over here.

1816
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,660
Todd is throw some money on table.

1817

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,600
Nobody wants to go to heaven.

1826
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,211
Holdup Hoda.

1827

1833
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:05,970

You're fine.

1837
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,343
You're fine.

1838
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,590
I was worried it was an important call.

1839
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,070
No,

1840
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,450

1841
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,100
I don't judge.

1842
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,350
I'm just saying I lost my
fucking whole train of thought.

1843
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,720
So we're going to do
this again from the top.

1844
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,260
Okay.

1845
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,093

00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,250
I don't blame you.

1851
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:28,920

1853
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,140
of course I don't want just like God.

1854
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,110
I couldn't even let go of it in my brain.

1855
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:34,944
I had to stop,

1856
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,653
start over.

1857
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,550
They see everything's fine.

1858
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,620
Real relax.

1859
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,431

1860
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:56,431
John's foul down the bed and wants to

1864
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,390
Push come to shove and throw
some money on the table.

1865
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:06,940
Cover last time stuff and got the solar.

1866
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,460
The whole got the heart of a lone man

00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,091
fucking thing.

1868
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:13,511
So,

1869
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:15,310
but the best that I can,

1870
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,850
just lack of a horse to the wilder.

1871
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,880
The walnuts drank it hill and no
one should know the scared little,

1872
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,350
but I'm really one hell of man.

1873
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,510
And now I'm a junkie.

1874
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:31,291
Fall in love.

1875

00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:36,380

1877
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,070
Things love up in the heavens.

1878
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:43,490
But here you must atone for your sams
for charging one lost stock badge,

scared to have knowledge.

1883
00:53:58,091 --> 00:53:58,924

00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:07,734
And that's true.

1888
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,780
Leo Survival.

Crazy.

1898
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,990
I didn't want to go to heaven,

1899
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:38,840
but everyone's afraid to die.

1900
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,780
God is real.

1901
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:43,890
But religions out.

1902
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:44,724

1911
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,250
It's horrible.

1912
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:05,480

1913
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,510

00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:09,930
Listen,

1918

I was going to be polite
and leave the room.

1920
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,310
You got to do it,

1921
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,600
that would be more distraction.

1922

Almost a man as a gay Muslim.

1952
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,900
Linda didn't know little ball.

1953
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,760

00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:24,750
He University Scape [inaudible]
Senate Ratatat tatted,

1985
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,640
no cat scan went out of Berlin,

1986
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,960
but it's still has static.

1987
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,600
Ran a brain and then it
blew down your own man.

1988
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:32,550
[inaudible]

1989
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,090
Hanson come through later,

1990
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,200
told the cops back off or hunting
his dead deep in his heart.

1991
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,280
He knew it was wrong,

1992
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:41,920
so it let to let it go
and he starts to move on.

1993
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,420
Sirens sounded,

1994
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,290
seem to sit down and found out
the little ball got surrounded.

1995
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,550
The dropped his gun.

1996
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:52,180
So when this is where
it got to in this story,

1997
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:54,590
he was only 19 and man man's dream,

1998
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:59,591
I hope pantsuit kid is still hear him
scream the same funders don't you Dan lab.

1999
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:05,340
Just another case about the round bat
straight and now who your soul gets cas.

2000
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,160
Good night show.

2001
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:07,994
Oh yeah.

2002
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:19,903
That was beautiful.

2003
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,720
That reminded me of the
Trayvon Martin case.

2004
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:24,554
Man.

2005
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,360
There's a lot of that in there.

2006
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,560
What's was going on with that didn't
have just in the trial is about to start

2007
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,120
again.

2008
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,301
Yeah,

2009
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,050
I don't know.

2010
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,250
I don't know what's going on with that.

2011
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,211
I think it's,

2012
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:32,841
it's heated up.

2013
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:33,890
It's in the news all the time.

2014
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,240
It's,

2015
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,570
it's fascinating the case man.

2016
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,300
People are in real trouble
for manipulating the news.

2017
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,291
The way they,

2018
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:39,560
uh,

2019
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,490
they portrayed it.

2020
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,950
A lot of people were under the impression
that that was like a little kid.

2021
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,010
There was like really small and those
were like really old pictures of him.

2022
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,230
You know,

2023
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,580
he's a much larger kid and they,

2024
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,870
he beat the fuck out of that
guy before the guy shot him,

2025
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,610
he had blood all over his head.

2026
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:53,990
His nose is punched in.

2027
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,270
There's a lot of weird
shit as to whether or not,

2028
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,200
you know he was a victim or he was an
asshole and that he shouldn't have been

2029
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:01,190
doing in the first place.

2030
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:01,761
It's good.

2031
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,710
It's a very racially divisive issue,

2032
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:04,130
you know?

2033
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,390
It's really fucked up issue.

2034
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:06,403
He's alive though.

2035
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:07,071
Yeah,

2036
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:07,904
that's true.

2037
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,410
Yeah.

2038
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,590
You could take a punch in the nose.

2039
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,030
You can apologize for that.

2040
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:11,890
You can.

2041
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:12,260
You can.

2042
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,920
You know what I mean?

2043
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,191
Well,

2044
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:13,911
you know what man,

2045
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:16,400
if he thought that dude was going to
kill it right or wrong and I'm outside,

2046
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,230
I'm just saying like one dude's alive,

2047
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,410
one dude's dead and one dude was
following another dude when he have been.

2048
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:21,801
I had,

2049
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:22,820
apparently that's not true.

2050
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,260
Apparently a,

2051
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:25,850
that was something that was also reported.

2052
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:26,480
That wasn't true.

2053
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:26,791
He didn't,

2054
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:27,770
they didn't follow that kid.

2055
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:30,530
Apparently they told him to stop and he
got in his car and the kid was looking

2056
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:31,364
for him.

2057
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,690
But who the fuck knows?

2058
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:33,141
You know when,

2059
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:34,400
when something like that happens?

2060
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:35,031
I never heard that,

2061
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:35,720
but I don't.

2062
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,710
I'm in a bunch.

2063
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,660
Bunch of different versions of something.

2064
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:39,480
World problems.

2065
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:39,810
Yeah.

2066
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,643
None of them are from,

2067
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,680
but that song reminded me of that a lot.

2068
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:43,191
You know?

2069
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:44,024
Slick Rick Song.

2070
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,321
Children's story.

2071
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:45,560
Yeah.

2072
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,393
Oh Wow.

2073
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:46,581
Oh,

2074
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:47,061
that's right.

2075
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:47,900
Once upon a time.

2076
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:51,420
How long ago was Amazon guys?

2077
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,140
All this learning and jobs.

2078
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:53,781
That's the,

2079
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:54,410
you know Andy?

2080
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:54,921
Wow.

2081
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:55,760
It's so different.

2082
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:56,770
I didn't even recognize it.

2083
00:59:56,771 --> 00:59:59,930
That's the front of my brain to shake
off that because I hate when I screw up

2084
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,000
or,

2085
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,320
or just getting a little something.

2086
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,100
Yeah,

2087
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,491
I know.

2088
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:05,720
I can have the best set ever,

2089
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:08,270
but I fuck up one joke and that
shit will haunt me for days.

2090
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,680
That's why I had to do
another one right away.

2091
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,080
I sit here looking at you like,

2092
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:12,901
wow,

2093
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,000
that was fucking awesome.

2094
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:14,601
Don't worry about it,

2095
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:15,140
man.

2096
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:15,920
It doesn't Peter.

2097
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,070
People don't think that it comes out
right every time people know that's,

2098
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,790
that's,

2099
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,030
that's the beauty of the does.

2100
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,080
I'm worried about people.

2101
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,990
Joe Rogan people have been
nothing but good to me.

2102
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:24,651
I'm just saying,

2103
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:25,341
me personally,

2104
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:25,821
personally,

2105
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,654
right

2106
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,080
there.

2107
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,370
Nobody else understand that.

2108
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,810
Accept you right now.

2109
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:33,321
You know,

2110
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:34,670
other people like it's no big deal,

2111
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:35,230
man.

2112
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:35,890
It's no big deal.

2113
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,800
Still all awesome.

2114
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,211
That's a beautiful song,

2115
01:00:38,211 --> 01:00:38,391
man.

2116
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:39,140
That religion songs,

2117
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,973
beautiful song.

2118
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,990
A lot of people that's
going to be the anthem.

2119
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,790
It's just me saying like I said,

2120
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:44,840
what if God is real?

2121
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,940
And then legends all just a big lie,

2122
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:47,360
you know?

2123
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,571
Well,

2124
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:47,920
you know,

2125
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,980
that's Kinda how I look at it.

2126
01:00:48,981 --> 01:00:51,080
Like God might be real man.

2127
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:51,591
You know what I mean?

2128
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:53,990
I kind of feel like it is whatever it is.

2129
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,213
I think it's,

2130
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:57,460
it's beneficial or not going
to be pleased with them.

2131
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:59,960
Motherfuckers murdering
each other over the rules.

2132
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,860
I think it's beneficial.

2133
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:03,320
There's one rule that we all,

2134
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:03,921
we all know it,

2135
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:04,690
right?

2136
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:05,720
Do one to others.

2137
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,000
That's the rule that it really is.

2138
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,260
That's the only rule.

2139
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,250
I think it's beneficial to be humbled
by religion actually is the last line in

2140
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:13,671
that song.

2141
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:17,030
Somebody needs to spark
it and being fired.

2142
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,410
That's a real religion.

2143
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,610
Everything he says,

2144
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,620
it's not a religion has
never taken a pot cooking,

2145
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:22,550
gotten on an airplane.

2146
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,680
That's a real religion.

2147
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,550
That's real.

2148
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,121
It's real.

2149
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:26,331
It's,

2150
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:26,581
it's,

2151
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:28,620
it's humbling and makes you
think about your childhood.

2152
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,040
It makes you think about
love and happiness.

2153
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:34,010
It makes you think about honesty and
friendship and makes you think about

2154
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:34,880
creativity.

2155
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,440
That's real man.

2156
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:36,890
That's theirs,

2157
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,560
that's connecting you
with a spirit of nature.

2158
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,540
It made you paranoid.

2159
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:41,961
Yes,

2160
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:43,250
it made you feel weird,

2161
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:47,030
made you have all these crazy thoughts
cause it's connecting you to the spirit

2162
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:47,730
of nature,

2163
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:52,130
the mother Earth Gaia in a
little baby dose of a plant love.

2164
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:57,140
And that baby dose of plant love just
sparks every cannabinoid receptor in your

2165
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:58,490
fucking monkey brain.

2166
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,700
And you start seeing shit in a way that
you're not going to see without the weed

2167
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:02,630
like it or not.

2168
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,850
But if you're a man of your own creation,

2169
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:08,810
absolutely you have gotten you where
you got because of hard work and

2170
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:09,644
dedication.

2171
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,311
So true,

2172
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,144
so true.

2173
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,103
But you know what?

2174
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,480
You will have an experience with that.

2175
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,240
Marijuana spirit gets
into your bloodstream.

2176
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,190
It gets in your system and gives you
a little dance and you can accept

2177
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,190
the fact that you were tuned into
some other form of intelligence.

2178
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:26,940
You could accept the fact that there's
something about this thing that's making

2179
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:30,540
ideas explode inside of your
brain and never been there before.

2180
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,170
Or you can just fucking
keep drinking coffee,

2181
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:41,200
go to work and just
believe in stupid shit.

2182
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,960
Been working right.

2183
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,793
Oh it is.

2184
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,910
Double Rock did the this is
there a better voice voice one.

2185
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:51,840
The silver one is better

2186
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,630
so it gives you a very specific sound.

2187
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,140
Oh,

2188
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,973
here's this one.

2189
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,530
Here's this one compressed.

2190
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,221
Oh,

2191
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:02,730
okay.

2192
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,440
Pretty low compression.

2193
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,041
No Mike Better.

2194
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:08,070
It'll make for a better audio on this
thing and you could call me up and do

2195
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:09,920
dirty talk to me and I
wouldn't even know it was.

2196
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,823
Yeah,

2197
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,300
I'd get scared.

2198
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,133
That's not what I want to hear.

2199
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:16,390
Kettlebell workouts.

2200
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:18,660
I'm doing battle ropes today,

2201
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,494
brother.

2202
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,000
Today's battle rope day.

2203
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,060
What do you got now?

2204
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:24,894
Man,

2205
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,513
we'll do another one.

2206
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,110
I can shake off that bullshit.

2207
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,550
Oh you son of a bit

2208
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,933
still still.

2209
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,410
It's still,

2210
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:32,640
no,

2211
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,090
it's gone.

2212
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,710
I apologize with all my heart.

2213
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,480
I did not think that that was
kind of distract you dude.

2214
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,980
I've done it to every interview ever
cause I won't turn off my phone,

2215
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,020
God forbid in case on it.

2216
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,310
And it wasn't a judgment.

2217
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:44,310
It was just like I just couldn't,

2218
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,900
I had the cords in my hand,

2219
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:49,560
started playing another song and
then lyrics from another song.

2220
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,573
It's like some weird,

2221
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,140
I've never written anything down.

2222
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,830
So it's like if a,

2223
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,360
if a picture gets cross referenced it,

2224
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:57,621
I,

2225
01:03:57,621 --> 01:03:58,454
I'm fucked.

2226
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:01,080
That is such a fascinating
way to do your music.

2227
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:02,330
I know Jay Dee Dee,

2228
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,140
Jay z does his raps that way too.

2229
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,940
I think that's really fascinating.

2230
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,070
I mean for me it's,

2231
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,290
again I think we discussed it but it's
like it started as like a wrap thing.

2232
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,060
Having a hall right here,

2233
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,363
I don't need it.

2234
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,300
Well you probably should,

2235
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:15,721
you know,

2236
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,510
I mean there's probably some benefit
to having it all right there.

2237
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:19,770
You know,

2238
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:23,070
be able to pull out at anytime you want
instead of relying on pieces of paper

2239
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,870
and you record it all.

2240
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,550
And like I said,

2241
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,790
when I open my eyes and saw something and,

2242
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:28,860
and then your brains,

2243
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,131
you know,

2244
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,720
automatically is asking questions.

2245
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,111
So,

2246
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:31,561
you know what I mean?

2247
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,101
It's not even,

2248
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:32,671
it's just like,

2249
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:33,720
that's not even like fuck Joe.

2250
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:34,880
It's like what's going on?

2251
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,140
Something bad happening and
that's enough that the songs gone.

2252
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,053
It's like,

2253
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,480
I think it's cool for people to just get
my fucking eyes closed is what I should

2254
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,343
did.

2255
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:44,700
That's what I,

2256
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,610
that's why I closed my eyes a lot during
performances cause it's sometimes some

2257
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:50,010
mother fucker will turn around
and like do his Facebook photo,

2258
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,770
shoot a Selfie with me in the background,

2259
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,900
like in the middle of a con like fuck,

2260
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:55,890
come on.

2261
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:56,330
Right.

2262
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,680
We used to go to concerts
to listen to watch concerts.

2263
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,760
Right now they're like watching it through
their phone for their youtube post.

2264
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:03,391
Yeah.

2265
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:06,180
They're looking at their life through
a little four inch window instead of

2266
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:06,520
living.

2267
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,240
If it's distracting and calming shows.

2268
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:10,074
You see a lot of that.

2269
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,940
A lot of people holding their phones up.

2270
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:12,601
You know,

2271
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:14,820
on one hand it's nice you
want to take a picture of me.

2272
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:16,890
But on the other hand it's kind of weird.

2273
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,753
It's,

2274
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,750
it's what's called weakness.

2275
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:37,470
[inaudible]

2276
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,600
[inaudible] name was Lucy Cadillac,

2277
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,200
this monkey.

2278
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,043
So now

2279
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,350
I got a weakness

2280
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,610
top down afternoon.

2281
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,340
She made me cry,

2282
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:52,641
limit deep.

2283
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:53,680
And Matt asked,

2284
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,060
grandma died when she was
five and she didn't know.

2285
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,550
She seen

2286
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:20,690
you will hurt deep in my bones.

2287
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:27,550
I got a weakness out of
the sitting on the edge.

2288
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:49,040
She's saying I slept with gangsters,

2289
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:49,800
thugs,

2290
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,633
smuggler,

2291
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,640
Congress smelling govern,

2292
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,350
missing golden man.

2293
01:07:57,351 --> 01:07:59,030
But this weakness is,

2294
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:01,973
it's Matt

2295
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,063
starts to

2296
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,343
sell map.

2297
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,240
Yes.

2298
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,430
My scan and

2299
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,890
I got a weakness.

2300
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,773
You

2301
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:23,813
know

2302
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:25,743
I

2303
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,400
got a weakness.

2304
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,020
I have beaver,

2305
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:30,854
I got

2306
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,993
edge.

2307
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:35,923
Just Wayne.

2308
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:49,943
Yeah.

2309
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,050
And you paint with a dark brush.

2310
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,530
Don't,

2311
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:59,363
don't.

2312
01:08:59,410 --> 01:08:59,980
Yeah.

2313
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,000
Almost always.

2314
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,480
Yeah.

2315
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,130
I mean there's happiness in it,

2316
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,151
but you pay with,

2317
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:04,984
oh yeah,

2318
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,670
that's,

2319
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,070
yeah.

2320
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,311
Yeah.

2321
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:07,560
There's the bad.

2322
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,730
This whole little bit.

2323
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:11,250
All the interesting people do that.

2324
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,093
Unfortunately.

2325
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,040
I hate giving people the impression
that you have to make sad music though.

2326
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:15,791
Cause I mean I,

2327
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:16,870
it's just not what I do.

2328
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,280
When you are happy music,

2329
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:19,583
not,

2330
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,190
I can't write that song,

2331
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,260
jump around.

2332
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:23,970
You know what I mean?

2333
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:24,803
You know,

2334
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,900
that's just a whole different
different time to write for you.

2335
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,710
Do you hear like that old stuff like the,

2336
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:29,861
the,

2337
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,210
the rap stuff and go like,

2338
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:31,421
wow,

2339
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,470
that's like a different time.

2340
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:33,610
Yeah.

2341
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:33,860
Yeah.

2342
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,890
My voice and I know I'm just a baby.

2343
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,933
Yeah.

2344
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:37,841
I haven't even had,

2345
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,600
I didn't even find my voice until
like the third house of Payne record.

2346
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,250
It's weird isn't it?

2347
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,130
When you look back on all the shit that
you've done and it took me like three

2348
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:46,660
albums to find my singing voice.

2349
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:47,051
You know what I mean?

2350
01:09:47,051 --> 01:09:48,130
Like Whitey Ford isn't,

2351
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:49,180
when I find a singing,

2352
01:09:49,181 --> 01:09:49,961
it's good work,

2353
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:51,220
but it's not my best.

2354
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:55,030
Like thank God nobody talked you
out of putting out that record.

2355
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,410
Tell that story.

2356
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:56,901
Cause Tom,

2357
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:57,100
hey,

2358
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:57,933
they tried.

2359
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:01,780
That is so frustrating to me because
it's always the case where people just,

2360
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,130
for whatever reason,

2361
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:03,420
they,

2362
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,260
they don't ever want
to accept that a dude.

2363
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:07,510
Like you could do more than
one different kind of thing,

2364
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,433
you know?

2365
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:10,691
Yeah.

2366
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:11,450
I hear that man.

2367
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,283
Um,

2368
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:13,631
I just,

2369
01:10:13,631 --> 01:10:13,991
again,

2370
01:10:13,991 --> 01:10:15,100
I follow the signs.

2371
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,740
I just Kinda of go back.

2372
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:17,770
I got,

2373
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,490
I got,

2374
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,370
I got to the point in house pain where
I felt like I was showing up for the

2375
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:25,120
checks and that made me
feel rather core link.

2376
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,400
It must be hard to do things
with a bunch of dudes,

2377
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:28,480
even if you love him too,

2378
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,850
even if you love him.

2379
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,551
Just to throw one.

2380
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:34,300
Writing songs with a bunch of
other dudes seems like a nightmare.

2381
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,581
Well,

2382
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:38,060
musically I was doing more
than my share of the work,

2383
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:38,960
so I'm sure.

2384
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:39,950
I'm sure.

2385
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:40,191
Again,

2386
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:41,270
it just became not fun.

2387
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,230
That's really what it was.

2388
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:42,561
It just do.

2389
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:43,341
It became a point where,

2390
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:47,260
and luckily I'm spoiled rotten
enough in my life that isn't,

2391
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:47,991
it wasn't fun.

2392
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:48,770
I wasn't doing it.

2393
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,580
Yeah.

2394
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,211
And I didn't care.

2395
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:50,481
You know.

2396
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:52,730
And the thing was I wasn't Uber
rich when I quit house of pain.

2397
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:53,001
I was,

2398
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:53,360
I hadn't,

2399
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,260
I had a few bucks,

2400
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,630
but like it was going to be like,

2401
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:57,440
what's next?

2402
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:57,981
Like in life,

2403
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:00,650
what's the next day is I didn't know if
I was going to make another record at

2404
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:01,484
all.

2405
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,100
You know,

2406
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,470
a friend called to come to New York,

2407
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:04,281
fuck record deals.

2408
01:11:04,281 --> 01:11:04,941
Fuck labels,

2409
01:11:04,941 --> 01:11:07,610
just getting a studio and smoke some dope.

2410
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,470
See what happens.

2411
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,860
He heard me playing guitar in his living
room one night and we got record that

2412
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:17,360
and this turns into that and what
it's like is this and then you know,

2413
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:18,690
still I don't,

2414
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,070
none of it is like was sup like
mapped out in some superior plan.

2415
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:23,611
We didn't have,

2416
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:23,791
you know,

2417
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:27,920
it was all going by your install on
the best shit the Hams is by accident.

2418
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,400
Of course.

2419
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:28,890
Yeah.

2420
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:29,670
Of course.

2421
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,091
There was a,

2422
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:33,690
there's a very few songs that are
guaranteed to give me goosebumps.

2423
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,250
But that song that you
did with Carlos Santana,

2424
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,120
the key,

2425
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,901
turn your lights on.

2426
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:38,734
You want to eat?

2427
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,431
Fuck yeah.

2428
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:40,990
That's one of my all time favorite songs,

2429
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:41,501
dude,

2430
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:42,270
that song.

2431
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:44,170
But before you even pick up a guitar,

2432
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,090
there's some about that
song where you know,

2433
01:11:46,091 --> 01:11:48,130
when a dude saying
something where there's a,

2434
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:53,110
there's an authentic pain being
expressed as an authentic emotion.

2435
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:57,010
Every word is like
every word is qualified.

2436
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,290
You know what I mean by an experience.

2437
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,191
And there's a,

2438
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:05,191
there's something that comes out of
that and that saw everything from Carlos

2439
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,080
Santana's mother fucking
guitar that 60 years of,

2440
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:08,770
you know,

2441
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,960
bullshit that guy's gone
through in his life,

2442
01:12:10,961 --> 01:12:15,670
60 plus years to all the shit you were
going through when you wrote those,

2443
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,830
those lyrics and the way
you were singing him.

2444
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:18,340
It was,

2445
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:18,731
that's a,

2446
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:21,070
that's a fucking crispy song,

2447
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:21,904
man.

2448
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:22,590
That song.

2449
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,080
Whoo,

2450
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:23,470
that's,

2451
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,191
it's crispy.

2452
01:12:24,191 --> 01:12:26,230
Like you hear that song and just whoo.

2453
01:12:26,231 --> 01:12:27,340
We get those goosebumps.

2454
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,580
Selena meant to be things.

2455
01:12:28,581 --> 01:12:28,971
You know what I mean?

2456
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:29,780
Cause I definitely,

2457
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:30,613
I had done that.

2458
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,120
We had discussed this in detail.

2459
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:36,710
I'd finished or the house or the Whitey
Ford record and got out of surgery and

2460
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,520
was being leaving a house
and got fucked over.

2461
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:41,870
Yeah.

2462
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,370
A lot of things happen at the same time.

2463
01:12:43,371 --> 01:12:46,430
We're account and fuck me in in the
hospital because cause the account,

2464
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:46,791
fuck me,

2465
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:49,010
I canceled my insurance cause
I didn't have insurance.

2466
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:51,290
I had a hospital bill at like 400 grand.

2467
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,270
I went from overnight being like,

2468
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,080
like I said,

2469
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:54,741
a few bucks.

2470
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:55,120
You know what I mean?

2471
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,030
I had like cash,

2472
01:12:56,031 --> 01:12:57,800
maybe like half a milli or something.

2473
01:12:57,801 --> 01:12:59,960
You know you need people right now,

2474
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,591
but wait a minute,

2475
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:01,670
this is what the fuck was depressed.

2476
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:04,850
He had half a million dollars
one day the day before.

2477
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,061
Oh.

2478
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:09,050
Then the next day I owed the government
like fucking after they took all the

2479
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:09,411
bread,

2480
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:11,390
like I still owed like the
government in hospitals,

2481
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:12,290
like half a million.

2482
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:16,130
So you went a million
dollar swing in like a day,

2483
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:17,600
let's call it a week.

2484
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,390
Oh my God.

2485
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:20,030
You hear in the news
about getting screwed.

2486
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:25,410
But then I had this song and somebody
says Santana's looking for a song and sent

2487
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,170
it and we talked about the rest man.

2488
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,240
But it was the first song
he cut for that album.

2489
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:30,980
He called it the centerpiece of his wreck.

2490
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,301
I'm proud of that.

2491
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:33,134
I'm proud of that.

2492
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:33,921
Give me a call,

2493
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:34,131
man.

2494
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:35,480
I ain't heard from you in like 15 years.

2495
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:36,314
Carlos.

2496
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:41,250
Carlos Santana does not listen to his
podcast and somebody that knows him desert

2497
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,570
busy being 1500 times

2498
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,290
or by the time everybody listens
to that old Carlos Santana,

2499
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:49,900
he was speaking to this.

2500
01:13:49,901 --> 01:13:52,150
I found a rock on the beach yesterday.

2501
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:55,210
I was with my kids and we found this
rock and how there's holes in it.

2502
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:55,601
And I said,

2503
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:56,740
is I like from space?

2504
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:59,080
Like is that an asteroid or a
media right or something like that.

2505
01:13:59,081 --> 01:13:59,914
Like what is this?

2506
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,240
And so I put on Twitter,

2507
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:01,691
I said,

2508
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:03,960
does anybody know any
geology people out there?

2509
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:08,970
Know what this is Joe Perry from Aero
Smith because the first person to respond

2510
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,360
and he says it's,

2511
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:11,291
it's a c,

2512
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,670
it's like a type of sea rock.

2513
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,151
And uh,

2514
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:13,610
it's a,

2515
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:15,940
it's come from the holes
come from water erosion.

2516
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,721
I was like,

2517
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:19,270
God damn re the real joke.

2518
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,520
And he's the first person,

2519
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,350
the first person that responds,

2520
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,184
I'll add Twitter.

2521
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:26,460
That's where this t game and tag is nuts.

2522
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,440
Joe Perry is a cool motherfucker.

2523
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:29,911
I've,

2524
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:31,040
I've had conversations with them.

2525
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,661
Carol Smith,

2526
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:32,494
dude,

2527
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,200
one of the bads guitars of all time.

2528
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,440
Maybe Joe Joe Perry's
baddest lick of all time.

2529
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,830
So many of them too.

2530
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:42,611
Not just that one.

2531
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:42,871
I mean,

2532
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:44,500
that's old school Aerosmith.

2533
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:45,400
That's worldwide,

2534
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:49,390
that's darkest corner of Africa bar.

2535
01:14:49,391 --> 01:14:51,790
You put that on somebody in
that bars and be like Aerosmith.

2536
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,743
Oh yeah.

2537
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,160
I grew up in Boston,

2538
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,660
so Aerosmith has royalty there.

2539
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:56,530
Boston royalty.

2540
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,730
They came from Boston,

2541
01:14:57,731 --> 01:14:58,510
you know.

2542
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,500
Oh that early shit,

2543
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,280
you know,

2544
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,001
walk this way.

2545
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,560
It was tremendous,

2546
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,860
tremendous fuel those
guys had behind them.

2547
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,950
But then eventually it became
ballads and he's not only,

2548
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:10,540
but the shocking thing is
not that he follows you.

2549
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:10,870
To me,

2550
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,550
it's that he's a goddamn gem.

2551
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,460
Ologist or whatever.

2552
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:18,160
Well I think he's a part of that
whole rock for science thing.

2553
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:19,030
Is that what it's called?

2554
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:19,391
What is it?

2555
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:19,841
Hold on,

2556
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:21,070
let me find out if that's true.

2557
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,780
There's something going on,

2558
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:23,081
Brock.

2559
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:23,914
The science,

2560
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,641
some,

2561
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:25,300
uh,

2562
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,370
maybe this will be a,

2563
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,010
somebody can hold up to,

2564
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,260
I dunno.

2565
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,520
There's something going on.

2566
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:31,361
Rockets.

2567
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,194
I Dunno.

2568
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,880
I think there's a,

2569
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,330
I shouldn't have said that because
I don't know the information.

2570
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,360
See if you can Google that.

2571
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,050
Anybody.

2572
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:38,560
Brian,

2573
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,340
see if you could pull up,

2574
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,420
cause it's going to take too much,

2575
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,313
too much look.

2576
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,250
But I think there's a,

2577
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,660
the Rock Stars of science.

2578
01:15:43,661 --> 01:15:44,290
Maybe that's it.

2579
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:44,890
Yeah.

2580
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,150
Rock Stars of Science.

2581
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:46,631
And they're,

2582
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:50,500
what they're trying to do is get
kids to be excited about science.

2583
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,410
So you've got people like
they're following Joe Perry

2584
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,030
following rock stars.

2585
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,010
So many junior high and elementary school

2586
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:03,250
kicked are falling.

2587
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:05,260
Any rock stars nowadays,

2588
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:05,620
right?

2589
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,453
They're all like

2590
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,070
little Wayne would be,

2591
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:09,580
you know,

2592
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:09,911
on that.

2593
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:13,420
And you might get them kids
deeper little Wayne right now.

2594
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:14,380
Joe Perry's just got,

2595
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:15,760
you know me and you going like,

2596
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:16,310
Damn.

2597
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,661
Yeah,

2598
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:17,680
it's Joe Perry.

2599
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:17,921
Yeah.

2600
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:21,280
There's a bunch of people in here
and then a bunch of science people.

2601
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,330
This is interesting.

2602
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,710
So it's actually a show.

2603
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,580
What is that?

2604
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,680
It's not rock stars and science.

2605
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,530
What was Andy do frame in,

2606
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:28,881
in,

2607
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:29,650
in,

2608
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,050
in that movie he liked to shape the rocks.

2609
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,370
And what did they call that tall?

2610
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,253
It is,

2611
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:37,421
I don't know.

2612
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:39,490
It didn't sound like Jamal
and just as someone who,

2613
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:39,810
uh,

2614
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,110
like his studies rocks,

2615
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,410
right?

2616
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,600
Just all rock geologists though.

2617
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:44,280
That's geologists,

2618
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,200
gem ologists like someone to study jams.

2619
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,410
Those Jews in the diamond business,

2620
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:50,861
that movie,

2621
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:51,840
the Shawshank Redemption,

2622
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:52,600
they're moving,

2623
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,680
they called him something in that,

2624
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,200
that diamonds are like very pretty.

2625
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,220
There's no mistaking that,

2626
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,151
but man,

2627
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:01,400
what an amazing job they've done
in making diamonds like this.

2628
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,650
A valuable commodity.

2629
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,380
Storing them in a warehouse
and releasing them.

2630
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:07,450
One that you keep in the prices elevated.

2631
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:08,711
That's a meme,

2632
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:08,930
right?

2633
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,370
Their diamonds are very pretty

2634
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:11,481
well,

2635
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:12,320
they are Brian.

2636
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:12,981
Okay.

2637
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:14,600
That's why people are
willing to pay money for him,

2638
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,823
but it's fashioned.

2639
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,960
Keeps so many Australian market.

2640
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:18,320
Yeah,

2641
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,010
it's brilliant.

2642
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,000
The way they're done is brilliant.

2643
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:20,850
You can,

2644
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:24,240
isn't it kind of modeled after the
gas industry hasn't of just the work.

2645
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,083
I mean,

2646
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,370
I take it that's almost the same
principle sort of all these countries.

2647
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:29,600
We have so much in reserve,

2648
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:30,050
but yet,

2649
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,471
you know what I mean?

2650
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,000
It's the cast is necessary.

2651
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,820
Diamonds that serves.

2652
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:34,221
There you go.

2653
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:34,520
That's it.

2654
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,750
That's much more gangster talk people
into buying a shiny rock for no fucking

2655
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:39,150
reason.

2656
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,510
It's marginally talks people into it,

2657
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,710
but it's like you have to buy it
for the woman you love half tablet.

2658
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,361
The genius.

2659
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:44,741
She was like,

2660
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:46,070
it's part of society now.

2661
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:50,990
Like that's you're expected to buy a
diamond ring for an engagement or wedding

2662
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:51,710
or whatever.

2663
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,640
I mean that's expected.

2664
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:55,280
You cast your Dalry he can't
be coming home with no rubies.

2665
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:55,611
No,

2666
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:58,520
that's your dowery and it has
to be like three months salary.

2667
01:17:59,080 --> 01:17:59,270
Yeah.

2668
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,400
What's so good fucking assholes.

2669
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:02,730
That's an asshole slogan.

2670
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,291
Be honest though.

2671
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,740
I wish I had only spent three minutes.

2672
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:10,430
Where were you then?

2673
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,211
It's a slogan,

2674
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:11,391
man.

2675
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:13,010
It's like have it your way at Burger King.

2676
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,460
You know,

2677
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,110
they're just selling shitty cheeseburgers,

2678
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:15,441
you know,

2679
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:15,770
don't,

2680
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,390
don't try to make it is,

2681
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,660
my wife has an official
one engagement ring.

2682
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,380
When I flew I flew her to Paris.

2683
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,281
Just kinda like,

2684
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:26,240
I decided it was like,

2685
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:27,040
no,

2686
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,100
it's time Paris.

2687
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:28,490
Yeah,

2688
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:29,323
I was on tour.

2689
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,920
Oh well I flew her like out to Europe.

2690
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:32,000
We hit Amsterdam and few other places,

2691
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,270
but I,

2692
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:34,460
my plan was Paris midnight,

2693
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,670
Eiffel Tower movie style.

2694
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,580
That's bad ass.

2695
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,430
But like I knew I had a
jewelry guy here at home.

2696
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:41,570
I'm sure you know who he is.

2697
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,010
Dana put me onto him.

2698
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:43,950
Okay.

2699
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:44,780
So he was,

2700
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,201
he's like,

2701
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:45,771
I got you.

2702
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:46,401
So when you get back.

2703
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:46,761
But I was like,

2704
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:47,361
I gotta do this.

2705
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,100
So I went into a little London,

2706
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,860
a jewelry store and bought like,

2707
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:52,160
you know,

2708
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:57,160
$500 little sliver diamond ring and you
know my wife treasures that just as much

2709
01:18:57,531 --> 01:18:59,480
as the other one because that's
when I gave her at the thing

2710
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:01,690
I did.

2711
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:01,961
I'm like,

2712
01:19:01,961 --> 01:19:02,120
Yo,

2713
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,480
like you would have
saved me a lot of bread.

2714
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,060
Well I think they like
both but it's a weird,

2715
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:10,100
this one is special because this one came,

2716
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:11,660
this one is,

2717
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:11,871
no,

2718
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,040
that makes this one special.

2719
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:13,760
Right.

2720
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,940
It's a weird thing that people are willing
to spend so much money on some little

2721
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:17,960
tiny piece of rock.

2722
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,390
It doesn't really do anything
was that was very strange.

2723
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:21,224
It was coal.

2724
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:21,970
Yeah.

2725
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:22,803
Long time ago.

2726
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:26,540
It was a thing in wired magazine years
back where there was a guy who was using

2727
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:30,650
Russian technology and he was creating
diamonds and the significant ones like up

2728
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:31,880
to two and three carrots I think.

2729
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,400
And they were also making
different color ones,

2730
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:35,270
which are really rare,

2731
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:35,891
but they were able to,

2732
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:38,630
I was just going to say I
have an old like 20 year old,

2733
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:41,590
like I have a canary yellow
diamond pinky ring and it's like,

2734
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,050
it was really,

2735
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,310
it's really Rick because it's natural,

2736
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:45,080
but nowadays it's like
you can get them like,

2737
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,140
I mean that's why all these guys
have like rainbow fluorescent,

2738
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:49,040
like diamond.

2739
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,430
Well that's all fake anyways.

2740
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,300
90% of that shit.

2741
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:51,830
Right.

2742
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,840
But here's what's fascinating.

2743
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:54,260
I have a great idea for a show,

2744
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:54,880
Joe.

2745
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,191
Okay.

2746
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:56,690
It's gotta be somebody
that can fight though.

2747
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,800
Richard Simmons,

2748
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,210
I'm serious.

2749
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:00,043
Like,

2750
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,690
yes,

2751
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:02,523
I can do a diamonds,

2752
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,540
red carpet.

2753
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:07,890
Fucking somebody on the red carpet at all
these advanced and like all these cats

2754
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:08,010
that

2755
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,210
wear this ridiculous jewelry.

2756
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,180
Primarily wrappers.

2757
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,520
A diamond tester.

2758
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,410
Oh,

2759
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,540
that would be so rude.

2760
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,050
That'd be so rude.

2761
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:16,720
No,

2762
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,371
you'd be blown.

2763
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:18,210
People's spots.

2764
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,140
It got to do it.

2765
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,041
It's ridiculous,

2766
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:20,251
man.

2767
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:23,490
There's guys walking around that that
got like apartment complexes around their

2768
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:24,330
neck if they're real.

2769
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:25,823
And those dudes,

2770
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,753
if they're real,

2771
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,560
I got guys that want to get at him.

2772
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,660
How rude that is.

2773
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,610
Not Very Islam have you sir.

2774
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,070
That is not very nice guys.

2775
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,060
They weren't sure who they are,

2776
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:36,894
where they are.

2777
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,240
This is what's fucked up about the
machine that makes the diamonds.

2778
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,480
I've talked to several women
who said this exact same thing.

2779
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:47,070
They say that those diamonds wouldn't
be as valuable to them because they came

2780
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,550
from a machine that they want the kind
that comes from the ground and I'm like,

2781
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:53,220
even if it's just perfectly exactly,

2782
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:54,690
exactly duplicated.

2783
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,830
It is a diamond.

2784
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:59,220
Like the only way you can tell
that this diamond and this is,

2785
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,150
this is a fact,

2786
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:01,380
like this is not a disputed thing.

2787
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,214
The only way you could tell,

2788
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,850
because if they tell you like they've
taken these diamonds to gem ologists,

2789
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:07,410
people work in the diamond trade,

2790
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,760
the DeBeers group,

2791
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,630
and they've looked at them and they
cannot distinguish these from perfect

2792
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:13,440
diamonds.

2793
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,090
Like they can make a perfect diamond.

2794
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,580
So it's a real weird thing.

2795
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,520
But for women,

2796
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:20,100
that's why we walk will lie to women.

2797
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,420
It's a real weird thing.

2798
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:22,141
But for women,

2799
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:26,190
that thing is that the one that's
more valuable is the one they want.

2800
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,780
They want the one that costs more.

2801
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,273
That's what I'm telling you.

2802
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,590
It's the actually want
it to be worth more.

2803
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:35,640
They want some sort of twisted revenge
on the fact that original marriage was

2804
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,880
basically an exchange of pop property
or a property for wife property to,

2805
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,880
you know,

2806
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,940
become the daughter property
because why property?

2807
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,810
What are you giving me?

2808
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,500
I think they do it for girls as
much as they do it for themselves.

2809
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:53,280
I think they do it to show other girls
to have big as bowling ball on their

2810
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:53,611
finger.

2811
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:54,540
Look what he got me.

2812
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,350
That's how I got my plus as,

2813
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:56,701
okay,

2814
01:21:56,701 --> 01:21:57,101
I'm looking at here.

2815
01:21:57,101 --> 01:21:57,570
You got me.

2816
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:58,201
Exactly.

2817
01:21:58,201 --> 01:21:59,034
You know,

2818
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,350
and want to let you know they rock.

2819
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:03,300
Some mother fucker
brought them in a boulder,

2820
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,050
you know,

2821
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:04,883
and it's like,

2822
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,630
well this is like a little competition.

2823
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:07,500
Like who did better,

2824
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,280
you know?

2825
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:08,441
Well,

2826
01:22:08,441 --> 01:22:10,980
I mean to the same degree
as we all want hot wives.

2827
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:11,460
Right.

2828
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,060
You know what I mean?

2829
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,750
Exactly.

2830
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,830
We all want a nice car.

2831
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,390
You also,

2832
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:14,640
yeah,

2833
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,640
but you want to fuck hot wife in
it before she's the wife of course.

2834
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:23,970
And then you buy or like an SUV or
something to cars I like or not.

2835
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:24,841
I don't like,

2836
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:26,070
I'm comfortable cars.

2837
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,990
I like cars that are stupid.

2838
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,790
My wife does not like any of my cars.

2839
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,160
I like to drive my car,

2840
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:34,163
my Nice,

2841
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,370
my fun,

2842
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:36,930
my toy toy car,

2843
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,270
that dope Audi spaceship thing.

2844
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:39,830
That's,

2845
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,140
sorry.

2846
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,210
That's one of the most
beautiful cars ever created.

2847
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,120
That Audi r eight masterpiece.

2848
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:45,871
A masterpiece.

2849
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:49,830
And like if you were a kid like back in
the 1980s and shit and you look back at

2850
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:54,270
the future like what's a car guy looked
like in the two thousands that Audi,

2851
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:55,104
is it man,

2852
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:56,420
that's a fucking spaceship.

2853
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,920
A four wheel drive spaceship
with paddle shifters.

2854
01:22:59,250 --> 01:22:59,670
It's fun.

2855
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,391
It's a dope car,

2856
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,000
man.

2857
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,521
You got some,

2858
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:02,354
you got some stuff?

2859
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:03,300
Yeah,

2860
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,140
my favorite car.

2861
01:23:04,141 --> 01:23:06,850
I've got a Porsche gt three gt three Rs.

2862
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,501
This the stupid car.

2863
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:09,550
Nobody should be able to buy that.

2864
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,610
You shouldn't be able to buy something
like that and just drive it around.

2865
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,730
It's a race car.

2866
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,471
It's ridiculous,

2867
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:15,304
but it's,

2868
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,690
you're so connected.

2869
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,341
You know what?

2870
01:23:17,341 --> 01:23:21,130
I'm a really been getting into man though
recently really been getting into old

2871
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:21,964
cars.

2872
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,990
Like when I look at like there's something
to me like I went for a long time.

2873
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:28,090
I didn't dig old cars because of my,

2874
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,390
I had a bad experience with a car.

2875
01:23:29,391 --> 01:23:31,780
I had belt at a 1970 barracuda built.

2876
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:32,470
Right?

2877
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,300
But there's some about like old cars,

2878
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:34,781
like if you get,

2879
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:36,640
get them to run and drive them around,

2880
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:38,290
there's so much more satisfying.

2881
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:42,610
If you could actually get a 1969 Camaro
and drive that motherfucker around,

2882
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,520
you could actually get it to the point
where you could actually drive it,

2883
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:47,740
make sure that it stops
when you want it to,

2884
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:49,600
and make sure that blinkers
work and all that bullshit.

2885
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:52,030
If you could like get it
shipped down to that point,

2886
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,380
you're in a,

2887
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,240
you're on a goddamn time machine.

2888
01:23:55,390 --> 01:24:00,390
You're driving around in a a working
piece of art that sounds like fun,

2889
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,720
like a giant Dick roaring
as it goes down the street.

2890
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,670
Everyone old car I want to build,

2891
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:08,350
but I haven't found the right one yet.

2892
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:09,110
Uh,

2893
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,450
59 El Camino.

2894
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,373
Ooh.

2895
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,490
I haven't found the right situation when
I've come across them and people would

2896
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:16,570
want too much for him.

2897
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,370
It'd be in like Iowa.

2898
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:19,383
Right.

2899
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,560
That's a beautiful car.

2900
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,401
It's another car.

2901
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:22,570
It's a Goddamn you're,

2902
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:24,460
you're in a different time
when you're in that car.

2903
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,970
The first El Camino
skirts on the back wheels.

2904
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,833
Oh yeah,

2905
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,261
I'd do it.

2906
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:31,910
Kind of like 1500 is a good year or two.

2907
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:32,950
But interesting year,

2908
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,001
you know those,

2909
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:36,070
those cars of the early fifties or the,

2910
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,780
the late fifties and
early sixties so I didn't,

2911
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:40,180
amazing times man.

2912
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,560
Like the old Barracuda,

2913
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,030
it doesn't have the
best shape in the world,

2914
01:24:43,031 --> 01:24:43,331
but man,

2915
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:46,330
it's got a weird shape
representative of a strange time,

2916
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:47,200
you know,

2917
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,240
in 1968 big ass.

2918
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:50,680
Huge fucking muscle cars.

2919
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:51,460
Yeah.

2920
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:54,370
Slide all over the place
with shitty steering.

2921
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,390
Like your car.

2922
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:59,260
That car is like intimately
connected to every move.

2923
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,520
The steering wheel.

2924
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:01,150
Yeah.

2925
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:05,410
And it's bought it or I went and picked
up my homie and we were just going

2926
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:07,240
around like the residential
neighborhood and I was like,

2927
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:07,721
watch this.

2928
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:10,420
And I was doing like 50
and just dead made a right.

2929
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:12,970
And there's,

2930
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,190
you know,

2931
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:16,120
there's a button you press on there like
where the shocks fill up with fluid.

2932
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:17,650
So yeah,

2933
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:18,843
it's just,

2934
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:20,800
it's crazy man.

2935
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,260
Well let's see.

2936
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:21,521
Got a,

2937
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:22,900
an almost perfect 50,

2938
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:25,240
50 weight balance cause
that's a mid engine car.

2939
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,910
That means the engine is
behind you and your seat.

2940
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:30,220
It was a brilliant piece of engineering,

2941
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:30,520
man.

2942
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,350
I was told it's the
poor man's Lamborghini.

2943
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,310
No,

2944
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:33,911
that's silly.

2945
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:34,780
It's a better car.

2946
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:35,261
It's more,

2947
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:36,400
it's better looking.

2948
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:40,480
Lamborghini looks like you're on coke
if you drive it around a Lamborghini.

2949
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,501
Honestly,

2950
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,334
between you and me,

2951
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,080
like I couldn't spend,

2952
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:45,880
when I went to buy that car,

2953
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:49,480
I went to a spot here in Pasadena where
there's a bunch of car dealerships,

2954
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:49,631
you know,

2955
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:50,620
high end portion,

2956
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,371
all this stuff.

2957
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:55,120
And I went there and I
went looking for an eight,

2958
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,830
actually just a sedan cause I was,

2959
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:57,820
it's another beautiful,

2960
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:58,630
I've been driving.

2961
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:58,900
Um,

2962
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,790
basically Sam series beamers for years.

2963
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:01,181
Like I was,

2964
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:01,361
you know,

2965
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:03,620
and I just wanted to switch it
up and I heard that was the same

2966
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,810
or similar and then the class and I was a,

2967
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:08,120
so I went and saw it and
the salesman told me,

2968
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:08,960
don't you don't,

2969
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,750
I told him why I like beamers and oil.

2970
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,200
I've been driving them for
so long and he was like,

2971
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:13,760
you don't want this car once he,

2972
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,570
I was like,

2973
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,190
that's exactly what I said to him.

2974
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:16,881
I was like,

2975
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:17,271
what do you mean?

2976
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:17,541
He's like,

2977
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:17,721
Nah,

2978
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:18,291
this is just saying,

2979
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:18,621
he's like,

2980
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:19,910
this is a great fucking car.

2981
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,721
And then I realized,

2982
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:22,970
I think he knows who I am and he's like,

2983
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,750
ah,

2984
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,930
you know,

2985
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:24,561
you don't want this car.

2986
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:24,791
It was like,

2987
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:25,460
and I'm waiting,

2988
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,630
I'm waiting for the pitch.

2989
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:27,290
Like,

2990
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:27,561
okay,

2991
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:29,380
what car do I want then and it,

2992
01:26:29,381 --> 01:26:30,214
and it doesn't come.

2993
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,131
And he's like,

2994
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:31,371
Nah,

2995
01:26:31,371 --> 01:26:32,204
this is just this.

2996
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:33,141
I was like,

2997
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:33,261
well,

2998
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:33,681
what are we?

2999
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:34,011
I was like,

3000
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:34,311
all right,

3001
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:35,060
well cool.

3002
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,080
I'm going to go next door and look at it.

3003
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:36,561
Another car,

3004
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:36,771
you know?

3005
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:37,280
And it was like,

3006
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,570
there was a Bentley
dealership right there.

3007
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:41,340
And I went in there and saw that Bentley
coupe and it was like this thing,

3008
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:42,830
it was $250,000.

3009
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:43,461
It's like,

3010
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:45,050
I feel like a jerk off in this car.

3011
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,560
Right?

3012
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,393
I mean like driving,

3013
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:46,850
it's just,

3014
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,140
I'd feel like an extreme jerk.

3015
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,440
And I went into the Jag and they'll,

3016
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,790
new jag wasn't out yet.

3017
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,560
Like I might at that
Jag would have been out,

3018
01:26:54,561 --> 01:26:55,100
I might have bought,

3019
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,720
I might've got that
just because I was like,

3020
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:56,930
well,

3021
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:57,201
you know,

3022
01:26:57,201 --> 01:26:58,640
and I was just in one of the car that day.

3023
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,103
I had a truck,

3024
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:02,240
I got to think I've got
to have a car in a truck.

3025
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:03,730
That's my thing.

3026
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:04,270
You know,

3027
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,450
there was sometimes more than that,

3028
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:06,740
but I got to have a car in a truck.

3029
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,800
So we'll first world problems,

3030
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:10,701
first world problems.

3031
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:11,534
Right.

3032
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:12,951
So then I,

3033
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:13,161
you know,

3034
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:13,671
I didn't see that.

3035
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:15,530
So I'm walking back to get
to my car where I parked,

3036
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:19,070
I have to go back through
the Audi showroom and then
I see the r eight and the

3037
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:20,120
corner and it's white.

3038
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:21,400
And I go there and looking
at them and reading.

3039
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,670
The guy in the kid comes
over and he's like,

3040
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:22,911
having,

3041
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:23,631
this is bad ass.

3042
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:23,891
I was like,

3043
01:27:23,891 --> 01:27:24,340
gas stove.

3044
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,040
He starts talking to me about it and I'm,

3045
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:26,781
and I'm like,

3046
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:27,830
just kinda national outlet,

3047
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,664
you know,

3048
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,631
in my brain saying,

3049
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,100
I can't get this fucking car man.

3050
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:31,953
You know,

3051
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,323
why are we thinking that?

3052
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,190
Just because it was like,

3053
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:35,430
you know when them
things like that's a win,

3054
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:35,991
you know this,

3055
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:37,220
it wasn't practical at all.

3056
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,510
There was nothing practical about it.

3057
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:40,040
There was no back seat for kids.

3058
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:40,560
There was no,

3059
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,300
no.

3060
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:41,601
I was like,

3061
01:27:41,601 --> 01:27:42,411
nobody's going for this.

3062
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:43,970
My accountant's not going
to go for this today.

3063
01:27:43,971 --> 01:27:45,680
They're going to break my balls over it.

3064
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:46,970
But then I'm like,

3065
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,151
ah,

3066
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:47,631
it was white.

3067
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:47,931
So it's like,

3068
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:48,920
I hate white cars,

3069
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:49,131
man.

3070
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:49,964
I hate him.

3071
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,613
And he goes,

3072
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,630
I got a black on black
carbon fiber one in the bag.

3073
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:55,580
And he was,

3074
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,260
I don't even think he
thought I was looking.

3075
01:27:57,261 --> 01:27:57,711
He was just like,

3076
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:58,280
you want to see it?

3077
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:58,581
I was like,

3078
01:27:58,581 --> 01:27:58,851
sure,

3079
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:00,680
I'll come see it and I see it.

3080
01:28:00,681 --> 01:28:01,420
And it's you,

3081
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:02,900
you'd see my car at the time of the day.

3082
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:03,171
Was it?

3083
01:28:03,171 --> 01:28:04,550
When you saw like four,

3084
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,760
oh that's even right up where the sun
is just slowly starting to make its way

3085
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:10,281
across.

3086
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:14,360
This carbon fiber was just
popping in and out and I was like,

3087
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,081
oh my God,

3088
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:15,914
if you could have

3089
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:20,300
the car looked like a sneaker
to me and I'm a sneaker freak.

3090
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:20,810
So I was like,

3091
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,441
oh my God,

3092
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:22,300
that looks like it's just something,

3093
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,620
it reminded me of an Air Jordan somehow.

3094
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,940
That's so hilarious.

3095
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:26,721
And then so I'm like,

3096
01:28:26,721 --> 01:28:27,554
Yo,

3097
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:27,861
I was like,

3098
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:28,800
let me take it first payment.

3099
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,331
And they were like,

3100
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:29,541
Nah,

3101
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:30,111
we don't do that.

3102
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:31,190
We'll take you for a ride.

3103
01:28:31,191 --> 01:28:33,830
And he takes me out for some reason.

3104
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:34,970
This is what they told me they were like,

3105
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:36,920
unless they know that it's basically sold,

3106
01:28:36,921 --> 01:28:37,221
like in,

3107
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:37,671
they like,

3108
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:38,121
you know,

3109
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:42,620
looking at you like you're buying this
car and I had no inkling yet of buying

3110
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:43,100
the car.

3111
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,730
What you should do,

3112
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,230
just sit down in the purchase seat,

3113
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,690
take a CD out,

3114
01:28:46,691 --> 01:28:47,420
put in,

3115
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,310
jump around and point to and go.

3116
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,144
That's me.

3117
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,140
I didn't have to do that.

3118
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:54,920
Just let me throw this out in car and
we'd go down and it's back there by the

3119
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,140
Rose Bowl where it's all canyon and
we get like three blocks from the

3120
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:57,501
dealership.

3121
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,640
He pulls over and he
gets out and he's like,

3122
01:28:58,641 --> 01:28:58,940
get in,

3123
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,870
drive the motherfucking car.

3124
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,090
Smartest the kid ever did in his lap.

3125
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,120
That is a good move.

3126
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,851
He was fucking,

3127
01:29:03,851 --> 01:29:07,890
the bosses didn't know shit about me or
anything and I'm tattooed to the kills

3128
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:09,080
and like I didn't even have jewels.

3129
01:29:09,081 --> 01:29:10,150
I would look like kind of like I look,

3130
01:29:10,151 --> 01:29:11,860
I can help kind of bummy that.

3131
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:15,560
I didn't even have jewels to
be walking around with tools.

3132
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,170
Man.

3133
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:16,550
I got my,

3134
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:17,390
I didn't have my jewels on.

3135
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:17,721
You know what I mean?

3136
01:29:17,721 --> 01:29:21,750
Maybe it's a good sales move by him to
pretend they won't let you take it away

3137
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,580
and then get outside of town and get,

3138
01:29:23,581 --> 01:29:25,590
I'm going to get gangster cause I
know you're a bad mother fucker.

3139
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:27,900
Take these keys man or
anyone to tell his boss.

3140
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,940
Either one of them like go ahead drive it.

3141
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,250
Smartest thing he ever did.

3142
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:31,650
Right.

3143
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,180
I pulled it back into the dealership

3144
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:35,650
buying this right now,

3145
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:36,510
this is my car.

3146
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:37,470
All right.

3147
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,041
And then I'm like,

3148
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:38,311
all right,

3149
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:38,580
let me,

3150
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,100
let me show the Wifi and I'm sure
the WAC and he's going to be like,

3151
01:29:41,101 --> 01:29:41,400
oh,

3152
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,071
what are you doing?

3153
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:43,230
And the kids can't sit in that.

3154
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:44,243
I text her,

3155
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:48,030
I think I'm going to buy this car and
just sending a picture of it and I'm

3156
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:48,751
waiting and I'm like,

3157
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:48,901
yeah,

3158
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:49,190
okay.

3159
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,080
Was somebody going to come talk sense
to me right now not to buy this car?

3160
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:52,470
You know,

3161
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,981
I wasn't sure.

3162
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:54,090
Is this a midlife crisis?

3163
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,160
I was never really a big
sports car guy was a big sign,

3164
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,270
like a nice sedan,

3165
01:29:57,271 --> 01:29:58,890
like old man kind of thing,

3166
01:29:58,891 --> 01:29:59,724
you know?

3167
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,580
And then my wife sends
back to the first Texas,

3168
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:02,460
you deserve it baby.

3169
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,393
I was like,

3170
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:05,090
dude,

3171
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:05,940
I got to buy this color.

3172
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:10,410
That's why I wound up with my toy.

3173
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,290
Maybe been one of the most
heartwarming podcast we've ever done.

3174
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:13,591
Brian.

3175
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:17,910
That's because of his heart
inside your pussy tearing stories.

3176
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,261
Besides that,

3177
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:22,030
everything else is not how this,

3178
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:22,921
this functioning.

3179
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:23,210
Uh,

3180
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:23,611
you know,

3181
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:25,590
you can just call upon
that whenever you want.

3182
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,700
The boner pill works.

3183
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,260
Having a card like that
is like driving a ride.

3184
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:35,160
You're in a ride every day and you don't
even have to abuse the law like this.

3185
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:37,380
People don't understand just
turning corners at normal speed.

3186
01:30:37,381 --> 01:30:38,580
It's like you're so connected to it.

3187
01:30:38,581 --> 01:30:41,410
It's fun and you don't even have to be
a nun on the freeway and you get nice is

3188
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:43,440
a lot quicker because you
can just dart in between.

3189
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:43,670
There's,

3190
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:45,960
the control is so amazing on those cars.

3191
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:46,291
You know what I mean?

3192
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:48,720
You can do things that I would
call other people assholes for.

3193
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,270
That's when we made engine
four wheel drive car.

3194
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:52,650
That's a crazy car man.

3195
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,670
That's brilliant.

3196
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:57,000
Piece of [inaudible] sport mode
and put those shock absorbers,

3197
01:30:57,001 --> 01:30:59,340
fill him up with the fluid
and that car is on rails.

3198
01:30:59,341 --> 01:30:59,700
Man.

3199
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,380
That's said crazy thing
about those old cars too,

3200
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:03,150
is that they do a lot
of adjusting for you.

3201
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:03,961
If you fuck up,

3202
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:07,950
like there's traction control that comes
in and stability control and antilock

3203
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:08,780
brakes,

3204
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:09,231
like do it.

3205
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:10,890
They do a lot of correcting for you,

3206
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:12,720
like to make it much more safe to drive.

3207
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:14,490
The cars were thinking driving.

3208
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,650
But that's the thing
that bothers me though.

3209
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:17,371
I love that.

3210
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,500
But the thing that bothers me
is that you miss out on like,

3211
01:31:19,501 --> 01:31:22,410
there's like a feel when you drive in a
steering wheel that doesn't have power

3212
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,580
steering and you know,

3213
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:23,811
you're,

3214
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:24,051
you're,

3215
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:25,390
you're hitting breaks that you,

3216
01:31:25,391 --> 01:31:27,570
you feel the brakes lock up.

3217
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,220
You know,

3218
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,420
it's like you have a more
of a connection to a car.

3219
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:31,350
Those old cars,

3220
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:32,101
you know,

3221
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:32,910
it's not good.

3222
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,380
It's terrible if you want to be safe.

3223
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,760
But as far as like real,

3224
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:36,703
I like the Audi.

3225
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,260
I like driving it and driving it
fast because every once in a while,

3226
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,240
even though it's that smooth
and cool and everything,

3227
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:42,781
you're so low,

3228
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:43,680
you feel every bump.

3229
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,720
And then also every once in a while
you'd do something wild enough to,

3230
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:48,750
it makes you realize you
gotta be scared a little bit.

3231
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,101
Women,

3232
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:51,150
women will never understand.

3233
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:55,590
And dudes who have never driven cars
like that would never understand either.

3234
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,180
That's one of those things
you talk to people in,

3235
01:31:57,181 --> 01:31:57,361
they're like,

3236
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:59,200
I don't give a fuck about cars man.

3237
01:31:59,201 --> 01:31:59,801
You say that,

3238
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:01,210
but I don't even understand
what you're saying.

3239
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:05,320
Like you either haven't driven one
of those fucking things or you don't.

3240
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,970
You can't afford it so you
don't even want to fuck with it.

3241
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:08,500
Which I understood only ridden in them.

3242
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:09,191
They've never done it.

3243
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:09,400
You know,

3244
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,560
they've never drove a car.

3245
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:11,800
Sure.

3246
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,940
If somebody just came up to you and said,

3247
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:13,481
do you want this?

3248
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:13,871
You'd be like,

3249
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:14,500
fuck yeah,

3250
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,610
and then you drive anything like,

3251
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:16,001
Oh man,

3252
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:16,834
this thing is awesome.

3253
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,673
You would get it then.

3254
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,900
But this first world problems,

3255
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,833
she didn't drive this.

3256
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:21,820
He knew.

3257
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,870
He knew the minute I put my foot on that
thing and so the corner I was going to

3258
01:32:25,871 --> 01:32:26,170
be like,

3259
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:26,590
I'm going,

3260
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:27,790
this is cars going home with me.

3261
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:28,540
If anything is,

3262
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,370
I remember a guy came up and was like,

3263
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:30,971
I want to look at this.

3264
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:31,271
I was like,

3265
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:32,110
get away from my car.

3266
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:33,850
I like before the paperwork.

3267
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,710
That's funny.

3268
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:35,590
We get away from my car,

3269
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:35,830
man,

3270
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:36,663
that's my car.

3271
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:43,370
He's sitting in it and farting and I
wasn't having none of that can't be,

3272
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,201
that's a,

3273
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:46,360
that's an impulse buy
that you could pull off.

3274
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:47,620
You've got damn Everlast.

3275
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,410
But if you're a dude who's living in
an apartment and you drive one of those

3276
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:50,621
things,

3277
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:51,160
you're an asshole.

3278
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,993
Had a good look.

3279
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,950
You gotta be real careful
about things like that.

3280
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,050
Cause he's just like financing.

3281
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:57,760
It just makes it so tempting.

3282
01:32:57,761 --> 01:32:59,290
It's almost doable.

3283
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:02,620
If I just work a couple
extra shifts washing,

3284
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,040
washing dishes or whatever the fuck
I'm going to do and slinging drinks,

3285
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,890
I can just maybe get that corvette.

3286
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:11,800
It was 150 and it was still like Ooh yeah,

3287
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,103
made me go.

3288
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:14,651
It's real money.

3289
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:17,550
I mean like you know a lambo or isn't
and that's like two fifties you know what

3290
01:33:17,551 --> 01:33:17,680
I mean?

3291
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,110
300 I think it's a way better looking car.

3292
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,160
I like the Audi better.

3293
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:21,994
I honestly do it.

3294
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:23,890
It's not what never again,

3295
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,020
the reason I started talking with us,

3296
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,481
I would never,

3297
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:29,170
I mean one that is about my limit
where I would spend on a car.

3298
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,980
I wouldn't say it's not understated
cause it's a pretty audacious car,

3299
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,000
but it's classy.

3300
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:34,691
It's beautiful.

3301
01:33:34,691 --> 01:33:36,220
It's like it's designed well.

3302
01:33:36,221 --> 01:33:37,031
I'm iron man,

3303
01:33:37,031 --> 01:33:37,271
dude.

3304
01:33:37,271 --> 01:33:37,720
Come on.

3305
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,830
That's what I'm talking about.

3306
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,780
Shit,

3307
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,211
I'm driving.

3308
01:33:40,211 --> 01:33:40,660
Right.

3309
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,640
That's the one thing still to like it.

3310
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:43,840
That car is like three years old now.

3311
01:33:43,841 --> 01:33:44,500
The body sits.

3312
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,870
That's a great thing is this device dot.

3313
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:48,820
I ain't going nowhere right
now and but like kids still.

3314
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:49,590
Yeah,

3315
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,423
like they,

3316
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:54,520
they just light up when you drive by
some kids they're like iron man car.

3317
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:55,354
Yeah.

3318
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,410
Some people don't get it.

3319
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,700
It's a thing that a,

3320
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:58,721
first of all,

3321
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:01,270
they get upset that you're talking
about some shit they could never afford.

3322
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,830
Sometimes people get upset about that.

3323
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:05,980
They be these two bridge to talking
about buying 150,000 because you fucking

3324
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:06,814
kidding me.

3325
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,320
It's the last thing people want to hear.

3326
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,790
Oh well but oh well

3327
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:13,990
I'm 43 fucking years old,

3328
01:34:13,991 --> 01:34:14,141
man.

3329
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:15,810
I've worked 20 fucking years of my life,

3330
01:34:15,811 --> 01:34:16,390
man.

3331
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,350
I pay mortgages.

3332
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,184
Many of them.

3333
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:18,881
I hear you man.

3334
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:21,280
Some of them don't even belong
to family members of mine.

3335
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:21,820
Man.

3336
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,300
I can not.

3337
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,230
I can by myself.

3338
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:24,610
That's what my wife taught me.

3339
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,150
That's you deserve that.

3340
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,010
That's beautiful.

3341
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:27,700
You earned it.

3342
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,090
Yeah,

3343
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:28,923
go get that.

3344
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:30,370
I'm a self indulgent motherfucker.

3345
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:31,120
Yeah.

3346
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,590
I I believe in true of what we do.

3347
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:32,981
Yeah.

3348
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:35,430
I believe it's important to be
a little self indulgent debate.

3349
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,820
I was told by a good friend when
I first like kind of made it like,

3350
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:39,940
and I was stressed about this,

3351
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:42,610
that and the other and like every once
in a while go out and buy yourself

3352
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:43,150
something,

3353
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,820
whether it's a pair of
sneakers or something,

3354
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:47,140
he'd just go out and you'll,

3355
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,033
you'll feel bad.

3356
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,800
This is a certain amount of
management you have to do.

3357
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:50,531
Your impulse was,

3358
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:53,920
but I think it's important to be impulsive
on a certain level is important to

3359
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,420
just go with your instincts on shit,

3360
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,550
whether it's with people or
with or with business decisions

3361
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,640
or with writing material
or writing skills.

3362
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:01,351
For my kids,

3363
01:35:01,351 --> 01:35:01,591
man,

3364
01:35:01,591 --> 01:35:03,000
I would live to the edge Joe.

3365
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:05,030
I'd live to like a penny
in the bank and then,

3366
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:09,450
cause I've check always comes like it's
eventually I got a good thing going on

3367
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:09,651
man.

3368
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:10,380
Is jump around,

3369
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:10,601
man,

3370
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:11,550
that thing don't go away,

3371
01:35:11,551 --> 01:35:12,384
man.

3372
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,120
Check.

3373
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,690
Like I could live like a pretty,

3374
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:19,890
I think I've been here so many times
and we talked for so many hours.

3375
01:35:19,891 --> 01:35:21,060
I don't know what I've said to you or not,

3376
01:35:21,061 --> 01:35:23,190
but like I could be that huge debt.

3377
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:23,980
Uh,

3378
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,300
w what's the dude who got
caught with the hooker and in,

3379
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,830
in Hollywood grant,

3380
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,270
he grant you Greg.

3381
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:34,630
He had a character in a movie that lived
off the money of his dad's song and I

3382
01:35:34,631 --> 01:35:38,010
that could be that guy so you can live
the rest of my life and not do a fucking

3383
01:35:38,011 --> 01:35:38,410
thing.

3384
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:39,100
Wow.

3385
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:39,361
I mean,

3386
01:35:39,361 --> 01:35:41,910
so I was that guy until I have kids now.

3387
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:42,210
It's like,

3388
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:42,840
Oh shit,

3389
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,130
I got to put some of this away.

3390
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:45,563
So,

3391
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:46,081
but I mean,

3392
01:35:46,081 --> 01:35:47,820
I would trick money off Joe,

3393
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:48,570
like money,

3394
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:49,380
money,

3395
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:51,090
walking the bars by a bar.

3396
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:51,931
Not the whole bar,

3397
01:35:51,931 --> 01:35:52,221
but you know,

3398
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:53,250
any by the bar for the night.

3399
01:35:53,251 --> 01:35:54,600
Like how much did you make tonight?

3400
01:35:54,601 --> 01:35:55,434
Three grand.

3401
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,610
Everybody's drinking for you.

3402
01:35:56,611 --> 01:35:57,270
Here's five,

3403
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:58,080
you know,

3404
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,070
stupid shit.

3405
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,860
I remember one nine Hollywood fucking,

3406
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:04,350
when I was real young first came back to
la with like a big stack of money in my

3407
01:36:04,351 --> 01:36:05,070
pocket,

3408
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:09,210
went to this club and this bartender chick
was just ignoring the shit out of me.

3409
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:11,940
It was a packed night but I was just like,

3410
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:12,751
I was like,

3411
01:36:12,751 --> 01:36:12,910
no,

3412
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:13,121
fuck,

3413
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:16,620
this bitch just really ignored me like
five times two I pulled out just a stack

3414
01:36:16,621 --> 01:36:18,090
of hundreds and I started
crumbling them up,

3415
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,460
just throwing a matter of
throwing them out and like,

3416
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:25,730
and then she realized there was like $700
on the floor and it came over and the

3417
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:26,600
next thing I know I'm,

3418
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:26,751
I'm,

3419
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:27,720
I'm running the bar.

3420
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,770
That's hilarious though that throwing
money at her just as long as the number

3421
01:36:31,771 --> 01:36:35,490
was high enough folding it up and she
was like hitting her with it and she

3422
01:36:35,491 --> 01:36:37,260
accepted that because it
was a hundred dollar bills,

3423
01:36:37,261 --> 01:36:38,350
you can't do that shit with toys.

3424
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,250
She got very upset that she was getting
something thrown at her and then like

3425
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:44,520
she went and picked it up and was like
he'd it and like it was like fucking,

3426
01:36:44,521 --> 01:36:44,910
this is,

3427
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:46,500
these are hundred dollar bills.

3428
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:50,170
This sounds like a movie in the 1980s
and you would wind up sleeping with her

3429
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,080
that night and then she would regret it
because you were in a band and you were

3430
01:36:53,081 --> 01:36:53,651
in a Boston.

3431
01:36:53,651 --> 01:36:53,770
Yeah.

3432
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:57,520
Runs right into throwing
hundreds of her face.

3433
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:00,441
Yeah.

3434
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:00,681
I've,

3435
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:01,220
I've bought,

3436
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:02,570
bought a bar before,

3437
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,070
but the whole bar around the drinks,

3438
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,901
I used to kick everybody.

3439
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:06,500
When I kick anybody out
of the comedy store,

3440
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:07,970
I'd buy the whole audience
around the tracks.

3441
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:09,050
I S oh,

3442
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,900
they still love doing that because
the comedy store never had any,

3443
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:12,410
um,

3444
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,670
there's no one watches the crowd.

3445
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:17,060
Like if you go to a legitimate comedy
club and people start mouth and off,

3446
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,010
the security guy will
come over and tell him,

3447
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:19,131
look,

3448
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:20,840
you're going to have to leave
you disrupting the performance.

3449
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:21,771
The company store,

3450
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:22,640
there's no security.

3451
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:23,960
I used to go there all the time.

3452
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,570
The dog on Monday nights.

3453
01:37:26,571 --> 01:37:27,980
We used to go there and just get nuts,

3454
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,551
but yeah.

3455
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,050
Well what is the open,

3456
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:31,040
Mike night is a Sunday.

3457
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:31,340
No,

3458
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:32,120
Sunday and Monday.

3459
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,020
Sunday and Monday.

3460
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:33,350
Yeah.

3461
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,890
Yeah.

3462
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,920
There was a night where it
was like if you went in there,

3463
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,960
you'd see a bunch of shit comics,

3464
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:41,900
but you are guaranteed
almost that some large cat.

3465
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:43,460
We'd walk in and do something like,

3466
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:44,690
it was like Monday I was at like a tree.

3467
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:45,170
It was like,

3468
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:47,600
this is like almost 15 yeah,

3469
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:48,930
back there.

3470
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:50,330
I think it's still probably like that.

3471
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:53,630
Murphy might pop in and
do a set or you know,

3472
01:37:53,631 --> 01:37:55,240
last week I was Mike Tyson.

3473
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,190
It's like every week

3474
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,670
it's somebody like the week before that
we Chapelle and Mike Tyson is actually

3475
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:00,620
doing stand up there.

3476
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:00,840
Yeah.

3477
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,730
It just crazy.

3478
01:38:01,731 --> 01:38:04,520
You imagine that one of the fucking
car story you see Mike Tyson doing was,

3479
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,580
I want to see somebody heckle a,

3480
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:08,250
that's what I don't think
they're going to ask.

3481
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:09,084
What I want to say.

3482
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,473
Are you taking it?

3483
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:11,783
We

3484
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:15,001
did.

3485
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:17,820
You see in the jackasses when they
let that butter bean dude punch him.

3486
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:19,163
Oh

3487
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:20,941
man,

3488
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,020
that guy's going off.

3489
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:26,160
But I wanted like to talk to him
about how badly that fucked him up.

3490
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:27,190
He never been in no,

3491
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:27,420
no.

3492
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:30,160
I don't know me here
cause I loved that I'd be,

3493
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:31,920
I'd be listening to that multiple times.

3494
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,420
Butter bean tee off on him like,

3495
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,100
oh,

3496
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:35,970
like his dick.

3497
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:38,940
Literally that was after
he was a movie star.

3498
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:39,790
Yeah.

3499
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:40,330
After he's moved,

3500
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:40,611
we started,

3501
01:38:40,611 --> 01:38:41,730
puts a fucking blind fold on.

3502
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,560
Let's in there with a bullet.

3503
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,580
It's the scenes over and he's like,

3504
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:45,414
is this okay though?

3505
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,610
He's crazy.

3506
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,290
Those guys are ridiculous.

3507
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,530
But that butterbeans shit was,

3508
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,570
he just stood in front about her being
my bottom have been just chaos him.

3509
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:53,960
Yeah.

3510
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,830
There's another one where the,

3511
01:38:54,831 --> 01:38:55,170
uh,

3512
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:59,790
one of the party boy guy gets punched
by by PR guy recognized it was an MMA

3513
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:00,470
fighter.

3514
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,750
Yeah,

3515
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:01,471
I remember that one.

3516
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:05,760
Did he actually like tried to have an MMA
fight with a real guy from England and

3517
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:06,151
he fought it.

3518
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:08,720
The shit out of Schick whipped
the shit out of him too.

3519
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:09,640
Oh Donna,

3520
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:10,523
I think done.

3521
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,431
Done right.

3522
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:11,701
Done.

3523
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:12,400
Fought him right.

3524
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,233
Done.

3525
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,560
Died in the car accident or a man.

3526
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:15,811
Yeah.

3527
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:16,860
Those guys are nuts.

3528
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,080
Guys are living on the edge man,

3529
01:39:19,081 --> 01:39:19,914
you know?

3530
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:20,520
Yeah.

3531
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,650
But we get and dude's punch
you in the head like that.

3532
01:39:22,651 --> 01:39:23,670
That is no Bueno.

3533
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:24,780
I bet you all them dudes.

3534
01:39:24,781 --> 01:39:25,411
I mean it's sad.

3535
01:39:25,411 --> 01:39:27,890
Is that Ryan done thing
is I wonder if he gave if,

3536
01:39:27,891 --> 01:39:28,230
if,

3537
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:28,980
if,

3538
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:31,200
if like in the scheme
of the story of life,

3539
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:34,620
if that's the better death or if you
would have made it to 90 and been boring

3540
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:37,260
and decrepit or cause they live that life,

3541
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:38,094
you know what I mean?

3542
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,720
As much as they get paid to do that shit.

3543
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:41,180
There was a time when they weren't right.

3544
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,870
I think one of the
first things either Bam,

3545
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:43,770
I think it was Knoxville,

3546
01:39:43,771 --> 01:39:46,140
didn't he shoot himself with a 44 magnum,

3547
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:48,660
we put a belt bulletproof vest
on and somebody shoot him,

3548
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,091
shoot him.

3549
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:51,390
So he,

3550
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,480
I think he wound up doing it.

3551
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:55,130
I'm pretty sure like,

3552
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,420
and that was for like Rainer nit mag
when the Internet wasn't anything.

3553
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:01,470
That's a silly bitch.

3554
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,950
So you know those guys
live for that charge,

3555
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:06,000
that rush.

3556
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:06,721
Well,

3557
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:08,310
the problem is he killed
somebody over them.

3558
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:10,860
It must be nuts.

3559
01:40:10,861 --> 01:40:13,940
And why I would think it should
be a more explored topic is uh,

3560
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,300
uh,

3561
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,560
Rodeo clowns.

3562
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:21,390
Those dudes who like fucking
stop it levels the chase him.

3563
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,000
Like,

3564
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,240
like what kind of nut
do you have to beat her?

3565
01:40:25,241 --> 01:40:25,860
Be that guy.

3566
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:26,970
That's a hard living man.

3567
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:28,320
That's a hard way to pay your bills.

3568
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:30,420
You let it can be about the money.

3569
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,340
No,

3570
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:31,590
no,

3571
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:32,460
it can't be about the money.

3572
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,380
It's gotta be about the
money and the thrill.

3573
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:35,190
The bull.

3574
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:35,911
That's unless,

3575
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:36,691
I mean you're not,

3576
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:38,730
so people were saying
about this tornado thing,

3577
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,540
you know,

3578
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,010
sometimes people,

3579
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,260
they say stupid shit when it comes to,

3580
01:40:43,261 --> 01:40:43,680
uh,

3581
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,720
why do people live in these tornado areas?

3582
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:46,860
They can't fucking leave.

3583
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:47,760
They don't have any money.

3584
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:48,301
You know,

3585
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:50,350
people are born and really
pouring and lived there.

3586
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:50,820
Yeah.

3587
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,020
They barely get by.

3588
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:53,350
And for the most part,

3589
01:40:53,351 --> 01:40:54,460
everyone they know is there.

3590
01:40:54,461 --> 01:40:56,110
Like it ain't that easy to just move.

3591
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,363
But,

3592
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:59,440
but it costs fucking money,

3593
01:40:59,441 --> 01:40:59,890
man.

3594
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,970
And a lot of people,

3595
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:03,880
once you get a job when the big
one hits here and it's like,

3596
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:04,160
wow,

3597
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,580
how could you live there knowing
that was going to eventually come.

3598
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,271
But my point is,

3599
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:08,710
once you've got a job as a rodeo clown,

3600
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,910
that's how you pay your fucking bills.

3601
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,410
That's how you pay your fucking bills,

3602
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:11,651
man.

3603
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:14,290
It's hard to jump off
that Rodeo clown thing.

3604
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:14,920
Where are you getting,

3605
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,161
you know,

3606
01:41:15,161 --> 01:41:17,410
1500 a week or whatever the
fuck those guys are getting.

3607
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:20,650
And then tried to get a job where you
get 400 a week and then you miss that

3608
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,000
other 900 bucks.

3609
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:22,863
Absolutely.

3610
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:23,470
In the yard.

3611
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:24,303
You know,

3612
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:24,791
by the way,

3613
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:26,920
that gt three is what
done killed himself in,

3614
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,340
yeah.

3615
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,173
So yeah.

3616
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:28,691
Yeah.

3617
01:41:28,691 --> 01:41:32,110
He went around a turn and like missing
the exit went straight into the woods.

3618
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:32,960
You know,

3619
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,690
he was going ridiculously fast drunk.

3620
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:35,501
Yeah.

3621
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:37,980
That's the part of this amazing.

3622
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,823
I wouldn't never,

3623
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,521
my one,

3624
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:39,971
that's my,

3625
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:41,620
hey gimme gimme gimme a cab.

3626
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:42,220
Yeah,

3627
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:42,611
I got it.

3628
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:43,600
I got a couple of hundred bucks.

3629
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:45,400
And when you live in going
all the way across town,

3630
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:46,330
there was no caps.

3631
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,640
He was out in the woods who's
out in the woods of Pennsylvania.

3632
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,200
Crazy Fox.

3633
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,101
If you,

3634
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:51,530
uh,

3635
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,361
you really think about it,

3636
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:52,991
it's amazing.

3637
01:41:52,991 --> 01:41:56,530
There's not more crashes because alcohol's
everywhere and people are driving

3638
01:41:56,531 --> 01:41:57,150
everywhere.

3639
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:57,990
It's amazing.

3640
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,760
Something like on real sports or something
like that where they like went and

3641
01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:05,380
like really filmed and checked out a
football game and like how fucked up they

3642
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:07,030
are before and after going like that.

3643
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:08,260
The cops don't really do much.

3644
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:09,220
They just let all these people,

3645
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:13,690
like thousands of people leave those
football games inebriated driving their

3646
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:14,080
cars.

3647
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,010
That's a great point.

3648
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:17,140
I never even thought about
that because how many,

3649
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:17,591
what is it,

3650
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:19,590
50,000 what does a football stadiums?

3651
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:24,400
50 to 70,000 so 71% of them are drunk.

3652
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,270
Yeah,

3653
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:26,320
my God.

3654
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:26,861
Yeah.

3655
01:42:26,861 --> 01:42:27,641
Or concerts.

3656
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:28,271
And those people are,

3657
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:29,870
you usually have drugs on top of that,

3658
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,260
like acid football in particular.

3659
01:42:32,261 --> 01:42:33,520
We didn't say baseball.

3660
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,870
If you go to the dodger stadium,

3661
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:36,520
there's not people fucking
in the parking lot.

3662
01:42:36,521 --> 01:42:37,750
Fucking raging.

3663
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:38,260
Right.

3664
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,950
Barbecuing and having four cases
of beer sitting outside their RV.

3665
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,000
You know what I mean?

3666
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,720
Football.

3667
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,310
It's like a fucking hold.

3668
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:46,270
They get there in the morning,

3669
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:49,840
they barbecue and get their fucking
shit faced before the first quarter even

3670
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:50,674
starts.

3671
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:52,150
How much of footballs gambling?

3672
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:52,631
A lot.

3673
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:53,380
Write a lot.

3674
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:53,890
A lot.

3675
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:55,060
A lot of why people love it.

3676
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:55,780
It's gambling.

3677
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:56,340
Got It.

3678
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,110
What did it like when people in the
Midwest is there like bookies all over the

3679
01:42:59,111 --> 01:42:59,350
place?

3680
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:00,183
Is that what it is?

3681
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,250
Like secret bookies or they,

3682
01:43:01,251 --> 01:43:01,750
they know you,

3683
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,351
but there must be,

3684
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:02,831
there's bookies.

3685
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:03,651
I can give you five bucks.

3686
01:43:03,651 --> 01:43:04,484
He's right now.

3687
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,463
How dare you.

3688
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,510
This is a respectable program,

3689
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:08,030
sir.

3690
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:08,530
All right,

3691
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,910
let's bookies need to pay the taxes.

3692
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,140
That's what I say in my book.

3693
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:11,974
He's do pay their tax.

3694
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,470
Why do you a Saint Barts?

3695
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:15,413
Oh,

3696
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,680
it's something like that.

3697
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,550
That's a lot of those dudes that were,

3698
01:43:18,551 --> 01:43:18,821
you know,

3699
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:22,840
they're just starting to allow poker
again in the United States Internet poker.

3700
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:26,380
They're doing it in Nevada and the way
it works is you have to be in Nevada.

3701
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:27,070
When you,

3702
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:30,880
when you get online they have to do
it and actually gamble from Nevada.

3703
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:32,290
But as long as you do it from Nevada,

3704
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:33,124
it's legal,

3705
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:34,360
which is a strange thing,

3706
01:43:34,361 --> 01:43:36,380
but you can play poker.

3707
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,180
Hundreds of poker sites I hear about
or they're just free sites now.

3708
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:42,640
Well they're either free sites or they're
illegal sites and they were fine for

3709
01:43:42,641 --> 01:43:42,980
why,

3710
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,260
how could you be illegal and be like,

3711
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:44,770
you know,

3712
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:48,370
cause I would have heard of are all
over the television and stuff like that.

3713
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:48,641
Yeah,

3714
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:49,720
those are the free ones.

3715
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:50,050
Okay.

3716
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:52,220
But some of those guys got
trouble for doing illegal shit

3717
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:52,461
too.

3718
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:54,320
There was some famous
ones that got in trouble,

3719
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,470
but the majority of the people
who were involved in it,

3720
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,300
when it was making billions of dollars,

3721
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:03,260
they had to flee and they all had to go
to like the Canary Islands and Shit and

3722
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:04,490
the Cayman's and yeah,

3723
01:44:04,491 --> 01:44:04,701
the,

3724
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:05,450
you know,

3725
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:05,940
uh,

3726
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:06,773
what's that one?

3727
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:10,460
Not believes but a Costa Rica.

3728
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,440
Costa Rica is a lot of
them in Costa Rica too.

3729
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:13,400
And these poor guys,

3730
01:44:13,401 --> 01:44:13,640
they're,

3731
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,050
I mean they're essentially,

3732
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:15,980
they got the,

3733
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:17,780
they took their business away with law.

3734
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,320
People were spending money and people
were gambling and doing what they're

3735
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:22,011
wanting to do with their money.

3736
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:24,170
And these guys were collecting millions.

3737
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:25,310
They're making millions a day.

3738
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:29,000
And then all of a sudden they came
around with a new law that said,

3739
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:30,500
you know what pitches we're not,

3740
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,390
we're not happy with you
guys getting rich that easy.

3741
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,460
So you know,

3742
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:34,661
you've,

3743
01:44:34,661 --> 01:44:35,990
you've leached the profits.

3744
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,490
They essentially stop progress.

3745
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:39,620
They stopped the ability
to gamble on the Internet.

3746
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:42,080
Even though it's a sort of
a weird form of progress,

3747
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:43,730
it's still progress in a freedom sets.

3748
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,080
It allows you to do with your money,

3749
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:46,580
things that were unavailable before,

3750
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:48,740
whether or not you want
to gambling to be legal.

3751
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,870
I want you to be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

3752
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:53,150
I don't want to have any control of your
life cause I don't want you to have any

3753
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:53,984
control of her mind.

3754
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,670
So as soon as we allow
people to come in and say,

3755
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,350
you can't gamble on the Internet,

3756
01:44:57,351 --> 01:44:59,810
like why do you fucking
talking about like,

3757
01:44:59,811 --> 01:45:00,001
why?

3758
01:45:00,001 --> 01:45:02,000
Why would you tell me what
I can do with my 20 bucks?

3759
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:03,080
Why do you give a fuck?

3760
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:04,460
Why is this even a conversation?

3761
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:07,520
If you need to get some taxes
out of that sanction gambling,

3762
01:45:07,521 --> 01:45:09,080
like the lottery should be sanctioned.

3763
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,000
It should be sanctioned.

3764
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,150
It should all be taxable.

3765
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:11,811
But that's the point.

3766
01:45:11,811 --> 01:45:12,081
I was like,

3767
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:12,560
they needed that.

3768
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,970
That's what they're doing now.

3769
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,081
They're opening it up.

3770
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:16,100
I'm sure they're getting there.

3771
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,330
They're rake of that.

3772
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:17,781
Yeah,

3773
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:20,690
and I'm sure the local casinos probably
weren't very happy with it either.

3774
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:21,031
You know the,

3775
01:45:21,031 --> 01:45:22,880
the card casinos that were
making a lot of money,

3776
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:24,170
having people come in and play poker,

3777
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,140
all of a sudden you can be
naked playing poker at home.

3778
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:30,380
There's a couple right down here
like bell gardens and a few places.

3779
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,630
So I'm sure those people
must have lost money.

3780
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,400
And there's a,

3781
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:37,010
there has to be some reasons why they
would limit your freedom to gamble.

3782
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,630
But the ultimately crazy thing,

3783
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,940
it's just free to login
of poker in the last,

3784
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,650
let's say eight to 10 years.

3785
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,613
It's TV,

3786
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,301
TV,

3787
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:46,940
rope people in an amazing,

3788
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:48,143
it's hard.

3789
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,250
It's just makes me crazy.

3790
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:51,440
Then it's also TV combined with the the,

3791
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:53,120
that's the new American dream.

3792
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:53,690
That quick,

3793
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:54,111
easy.

3794
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:54,710
Yeah.

3795
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:55,580
Not only buck,

3796
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:56,990
but you're super famous.

3797
01:45:56,991 --> 01:45:59,870
Then you win the world series of
poker and you're the fucking man.

3798
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:03,350
You know Mike Goldberg just interviewed
some dude on the last UFC and he was,

3799
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:07,340
he won $18 million in a poker tournament.

3800
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:10,370
Cheese and you're fighting,

3801
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,380
nobody makes that much money in a fight.

3802
01:46:15,381 --> 01:46:16,880
I mean maybe Floyd Mayweather does,

3803
01:46:16,881 --> 01:46:17,571
but that's about it.

3804
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,510
As far as like human beings
has an insane amount of money,

3805
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:22,700
$18 million in a fucking poker tournament.

3806
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,670
They make real money
because people love it.

3807
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:28,130
If you get enough people that love it
and they're willing to throw their chips

3808
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:28,460
in,

3809
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,710
I mean how many people had
to be in that for you to win?

3810
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,600
I mean that's very expensive.

3811
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:33,800
People tournament or something.

3812
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,450
I think it's an expensive by until,

3813
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:37,040
cause those guys are worth so much money.

3814
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,010
They'll do that by end.

3815
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,590
Big World series one.

3816
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:43,090
The big one in the bag is like they get
up to like 8,000 people now starting

3817
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:43,551
those things.

3818
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:43,820
Right.

3819
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,061
You know,

3820
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:44,900
we should not Bruce buffer.

3821
01:46:44,901 --> 01:46:47,810
Come on and explain all the w Bruce,

3822
01:46:47,811 --> 01:46:49,770
I've been meeting the meeting
to get buffer on here.

3823
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:50,270
Anyway.

3824
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,170
We'll have him come in here
and explain that shit to us.

3825
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:52,771
Cause Bruce Buffer.

3826
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:53,970
It's like a serious poker player.

3827
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:54,480
Oh is that right?

3828
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:54,781
Yeah,

3829
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:55,471
he's legit.

3830
01:46:55,471 --> 01:46:56,940
Like he goes to the world series of poker.

3831
01:46:56,941 --> 01:46:58,690
He makes the final table like he's legit.

3832
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,810
Bruce spot was one tournaments and shit.

3833
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:01,644
He wins.

3834
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:04,300
You know poker is a tricky
game at Ari Shaffir he,

3835
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:06,260
he used to make a living doing poker when,

3836
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:07,990
when everything's sucked
for him as a comedian.

3837
01:47:07,991 --> 01:47:11,490
I remember it like seeing him like
on a few shows with Ari Shaffir when,

3838
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:13,060
when things were sucking
for him as a comedian,

3839
01:47:13,061 --> 01:47:14,760
it was making 30 grand
a year playing poker.

3840
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:18,420
Just go into the local casinos winning
tournaments because he's smart because

3841
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:20,340
he's a smart dude and
he can calculate shit.

3842
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:20,731
He knows,

3843
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:24,150
he knows how to play the game and he's
disciplined and it would just make cash

3844
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,200
and you've got to be able to keep,

3845
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:25,440
you know,

3846
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:25,681
your,

3847
01:47:25,681 --> 01:47:25,951
your,

3848
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:26,370
your,

3849
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:27,203
your face,

3850
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:27,691
you know,

3851
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,060
stolen to a certain degree.

3852
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:29,580
Yes.

3853
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:29,970
Yeah.

3854
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:30,630
That's a big deal.

3855
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:30,871
Yeah.

3856
01:47:30,871 --> 01:47:31,121
There's a,

3857
01:47:31,121 --> 01:47:34,350
there's a something and not giving
it away to any kind of psychological

3858
01:47:34,351 --> 01:47:34,921
giveaway,

3859
01:47:34,921 --> 01:47:35,140
you know?

3860
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:35,460
That's,

3861
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,000
that's what,

3862
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,960
that's what I like watching,

3863
01:47:36,961 --> 01:47:37,794
like who,

3864
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:38,850
how that stuff works.

3865
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:39,600
Yeah.

3866
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,510
I wonder if you get to play all the time,

3867
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,130
you can figure out the math is fine.

3868
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,100
Most people can learn it.

3869
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:44,521
There's that,

3870
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:46,170
that's where the talent really comes in,

3871
01:47:46,171 --> 01:47:47,910
is that whole psychological side.

3872
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:48,870
I mean,

3873
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:50,220
knowing math is talented,

3874
01:47:50,221 --> 01:47:50,851
but you know,

3875
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:51,370
what I'm getting at?

3876
01:47:51,370 --> 01:47:53,730
Is it more artistic part of it and when,

3877
01:47:53,731 --> 01:47:54,600
if you play it all the time,

3878
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:56,940
if you get really good at
just smelling bullshit,

3879
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,540
you know,

3880
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:57,781
I mean,

3881
01:47:57,781 --> 01:48:00,060
it's like you get good at
everything like you get,

3882
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:00,990
you would think.

3883
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:01,211
Yeah.

3884
01:48:01,211 --> 01:48:04,680
You get mean people get better at all
the subtle nuances of anything they

3885
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:05,370
attempt,

3886
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,620
whether it's standup comedy
or playing music or anything.

3887
01:48:07,621 --> 01:48:11,220
I would imagine that you interact with
people playing the card game for high

3888
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:12,540
stakes for a long period of time.

3889
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:14,910
He probably smell some shit on
people when they are full of shit.

3890
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:19,140
It's just smell a something
little intangible green light

3891
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,000
or not or just kid yourself
and blow your fat water.

3892
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:28,110
I mean you would naturally just get
a sense of it of like that movie true

3893
01:48:28,111 --> 01:48:30,890
romance where Christopher Walkin's
talking about the tells of a,

3894
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,250
you would think you would
at least have more of a no.

3895
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:37,020
What a crinkled Brower like when you know,

3896
01:48:37,021 --> 01:48:39,980
cause there's people that say
psychologically like if you're lying,

3897
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,360
you look a certain way or if
you're trying to recall something,

3898
01:48:42,361 --> 01:48:43,290
you look a different way.

3899
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:43,760
Like your,

3900
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,850
the way your brain works.

3901
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:45,421
Like yeah,

3902
01:48:45,421 --> 01:48:48,150
you can figure out some of
that stuff legitimately.

3903
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,880
And when people know that I
don't trust them from then on,

3904
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:51,870
now you know the moves.

3905
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:53,160
Oh you know it's left to right.

3906
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:53,940
You know?

3907
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,121
Yeah.

3908
01:48:54,121 --> 01:48:55,050
You cheat motherfucker.

3909
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:57,780
Looking up to your left when you know
you should be looking down to your right,

3910
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:02,610
whichever one that only works if you're
amongst unsuspecting people and you

3911
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:03,030
have,

3912
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:05,630
nobody can have knowledge
that you have that you know.

3913
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,750
I think people are,

3914
01:49:06,751 --> 01:49:10,170
everybody is scared of losing
privacy and I agree it shouldn't.

3915
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,020
Someone shouldn't be able to
access your privacy random,

3916
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:13,720
someone's [inaudible].

3917
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,740
You should be able to access your
email or see what's in your computer,

3918
01:49:16,741 --> 01:49:20,880
but I do believe that eventually it's
going to be a good thing for the world to

3919
01:49:20,881 --> 01:49:21,720
have no privacy.

3920
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:22,710
It sounds stupid,

3921
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,740
but I think that a lot of the problems
that we have is that you can get away

3922
01:49:25,741 --> 01:49:26,550
with shit.

3923
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:30,180
A lot of the problems that we have
with as far as like committing crimes,

3924
01:49:30,181 --> 01:49:33,960
doing bad deeds to people is that
people can't literally read each other's

3925
01:49:33,961 --> 01:49:34,590
minds.

3926
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:36,510
I think that's ultimately
where we're going.

3927
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:37,373
I think we're going to be,

3928
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,880
there's going to be no line anymore.

3929
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:44,120
I think a lot of people's emotional and
problems stuff is not realizing that

3930
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,990
everybody's exactly like you.

3931
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:46,330
Yeah.

3932
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,870
You think your thing or whatever's wrong
with you or whatever you think or that

3933
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:50,530
crazy,

3934
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:50,830
whatever.

3935
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:53,500
Everything that happens to you is only
happening to you and you're embarrassed

3936
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:53,771
or you know,

3937
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:53,881
I mean,

3938
01:49:53,881 --> 01:49:57,250
there's a lot of things like that that
people don't realize every single what he

3939
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:01,210
has experienced on some
level insecurity band.

3940
01:50:01,211 --> 01:50:05,310
You're talking about a one consciousness
almost like single consciousness for

3941
01:50:05,311 --> 01:50:06,190
the crazy people,

3942
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:07,000
that's a problem.

3943
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,151
Well,

3944
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:08,590
you can eliminate them easier.

3945
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:09,250
You got to,

3946
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,460
you got to find them and kill him.

3947
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:13,990
But who's who's willing to make
that call from notify them?

3948
01:50:13,991 --> 01:50:14,910
You can notify them,

3949
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,580
hand them up,

3950
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:16,241
box them up,

3951
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:18,820
but then they get out and it becomes
a God Damn Stephen King movie.

3952
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,211
Yeah,

3953
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:22,300
well you know it's going
somewhere someday is it?

3954
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:23,560
Something's going to happen.

3955
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:24,341
What do you,

3956
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:25,091
if you look at,

3957
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:25,590
I mean you're,

3958
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:26,560
you're a thoughtful guy.

3959
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:30,010
When you look at society and you look
at Shit what's going down in Turkey and

3960
01:50:30,011 --> 01:50:33,070
the clamp down on the Internet where the
government's worried about people being

3961
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:34,710
able to rise and,

3962
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,930
and the,

3963
01:50:35,931 --> 01:50:38,530
the second amendment debates and
all the shit that's going on.

3964
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:39,340
How do you,

3965
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:40,270
how do you see this,

3966
01:50:40,271 --> 01:50:40,660
this,

3967
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,070
this fucking thing turning out?

3968
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:43,270
When you look at our world?

3969
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:46,030
I don't think a lot of it matters,

3970
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:46,790
man.

3971
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:48,520
You don't think so in a weird,

3972
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,630
I just think eventually,

3973
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:50,171
you know what I mean?

3974
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:53,770
Like the lights are
gonna go out and for you,

3975
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:54,610
for everybody,

3976
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:55,241
for everybody,

3977
01:50:55,241 --> 01:50:57,400
I'm talking about literally
like not our lives.

3978
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,480
I'm talking about sooner or later,

3979
01:50:58,481 --> 01:50:59,710
a lot of this is going to go wrong.

3980
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:00,311
We're going to use it.

3981
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:01,240
I don't know how much fuel,

3982
01:51:01,241 --> 01:51:02,410
I mean I'm not an expert,

3983
01:51:02,411 --> 01:51:07,240
but it fuels gotta be all the fuels
that we use so rapidly right now.

3984
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:08,920
Can't be infinite.

3985
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:09,880
You want to hear something interesting?

3986
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:10,600
I talked to,

3987
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:10,810
uh,

3988
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:11,643
whether scientists,

3989
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:12,460
and uh,

3990
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:15,310
he told me that even if we chopped
down every tree in the world,

3991
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:16,840
we'd still have a couple
of million years of air.

3992
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:18,760
Do you know that?

3993
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,060
There's like,

3994
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:20,790
everybody's worried about
like losing all the air.

3995
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,450
What are we going to do?

3996
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:22,283
I was like,

3997
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,353
you know what I mean?

3998
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:27,490
But the world is far more durable then.

3999
01:51:27,491 --> 01:51:28,770
Then we pretend it is.

4000
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,250
I'm not talking about
the world or the planet

4001
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:32,440
within it,

4002
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:32,861
you know what I mean?

4003
01:51:32,861 --> 01:51:33,900
And our use of like,

4004
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,520
you know,

4005
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:34,660
I,

4006
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,200
you know,

4007
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:35,471
I don't,

4008
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:35,801
again,

4009
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:36,880
I just said I'm no expert,

4010
01:51:36,881 --> 01:51:39,670
but like fossil fuels cannot be infinite,

4011
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:40,653
no county.

4012
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:41,501
So eventually,

4013
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:42,100
you know what I mean?

4014
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,170
It's not gonna if the lights are going
to go out and we're all going to be

4015
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:44,741
swamped people,

4016
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:44,891
man,

4017
01:51:44,891 --> 01:51:46,240
that's funny because I don't think so.

4018
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:49,060
I think that I would've never figured
out how to make you want to know.

4019
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:49,361
Honestly.

4020
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:52,120
That's what I hope I would have never
figured out how to make a regular engine

4021
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:54,750
and I'm never going to figure out how
to make a fucking electric engine and

4022
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,790
shoot my gun and I can,

4023
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:57,640
I can reload bullets for sure.

4024
01:51:57,910 --> 01:51:58,361
For sure.

4025
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:01,420
There's some people way smarter than me
that are looking at all these problems

4026
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,510
and the same sort of genius that allowed
people get to the point where we have

4027
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:09,070
flying metal tubes to take you from New
York to Paris and five hours you did

4028
01:52:09,071 --> 01:52:11,550
Howard saying we're going to
have the same kind of shit with,

4029
01:52:11,551 --> 01:52:12,570
with everything it would.

4030
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:15,430
People are going to eventually
innovate pass where we're at.

4031
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:18,850
I have a full family from
that because the nine one day,

4032
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:20,043
I don't think so.

4033
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:20,770
I think,

4034
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:21,880
I think it's going to change,

4035
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:22,521
but I don't,

4036
01:52:22,521 --> 01:52:23,740
I don't think lights are going to go out.

4037
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,930
They might go out for a little
while and then come back on.

4038
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:30,040
I mean at any point in time that could
be a series of colossal disasters,

4039
01:52:30,041 --> 01:52:31,060
natural disasters,

4040
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:34,210
and we just look at the history of
the world that we know about for sure.

4041
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:35,044
There's been some,

4042
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:39,310
at least I think there's four or five
extinction events that had been marked

4043
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:43,540
throughout history that we know of right
now and pretend that we know everything

4044
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:46,700
that happened over the four
point whatever billion years

4045
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,760
of the Earth's time at this point is,

4046
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,220
you know,

4047
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,031
that is a lot of shit.

4048
01:52:50,031 --> 01:52:50,450
They don't know.

4049
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,610
There's 12,002 Asian aliens.

4050
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:52,890
Again,

4051
01:52:52,890 --> 01:52:53,580
are we not,

4052
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,760
are we going in to the
fact that people been,

4053
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,270
you know,

4054
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,740
lucky that we made it to this point,

4055
01:52:57,741 --> 01:53:00,030
but we could go just bite
the dinosaur wet this.

4056
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:01,160
It's really my point.

4057
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:02,143
Fuck yeah,

4058
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:06,060
but that will another society
eventually rise up and I believe,

4059
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,390
yeah.

4060
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:06,711
Okay,

4061
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:06,951
okay.

4062
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:07,311
Whatever.

4063
01:53:07,311 --> 01:53:08,540
But like as far as I'm concerned,

4064
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:08,990
like my,

4065
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:10,310
I got my daily problems.

4066
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:11,144
I don't,

4067
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:13,850
I don't the government and the
clamp down in the Internet,

4068
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:14,540
fuck the Internet.

4069
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:15,410
I honestly told,

4070
01:53:15,411 --> 01:53:16,041
I've said many,

4071
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:18,680
many times if I could
get rid of one thing,

4072
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:21,000
like I think for every great
thing to Internet's done it.

4073
01:53:21,001 --> 01:53:22,130
There's a thousand slimy,

4074
01:53:22,131 --> 01:53:24,980
he's coming fucking awful
rotten things about it.

4075
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:25,491
Wow,

4076
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:26,210
that's interesting.

4077
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:27,770
I look at it a completely opposite.

4078
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,631
I think for every one.

4079
01:53:28,631 --> 01:53:29,700
I mean it changed my house,

4080
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:30,451
you know what I mean?

4081
01:53:30,451 --> 01:53:30,621
It did.

4082
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:32,660
I change the trajectory
of a whole business that,

4083
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:32,930
you know,

4084
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:33,890
I depended on to,

4085
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,170
you know,

4086
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:34,300
man,

4087
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:39,020
I think Dan took the carpet enabled on
delivery on levels that I never would

4088
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:44,021
have imagined in like 1995 it thievery
meaning people illegally downloaded

4089
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:44,900
songs.

4090
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,171
Yeah.

4091
01:53:45,171 --> 01:53:45,681
Not only that.

4092
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:45,951
Okay.

4093
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:47,240
And then let's just go with the,

4094
01:53:47,241 --> 01:53:47,600
you know,

4095
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,500
small things like,

4096
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:48,711
you know,

4097
01:53:48,711 --> 01:53:49,041
back,

4098
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:49,281
you know,

4099
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:53,450
maybe in the 90s if there was
a guy who liked fucking pigs,

4100
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:54,351
you know what I mean?

4101
01:53:54,351 --> 01:53:56,870
He'd be alone fucking wolf somewhere that,

4102
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,171
you know,

4103
01:53:57,171 --> 01:53:58,580
would never really act on it or anything.

4104
01:53:58,581 --> 01:53:59,390
Now there's probably,

4105
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:01,300
you could probably find a
website dedicated to that.

4106
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,630
Oh,

4107
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:05,300
this is most certainly if people
gather and they fuck pigs,

4108
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,140
that's mine.

4109
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:07,030
That's bad for society.

4110
01:54:07,031 --> 01:54:07,310
Yeah.

4111
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:08,480
Why is it okay to eat pigs?

4112
01:54:08,481 --> 01:54:09,510
But it's not okay to fuck them.

4113
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,430
That's what I want to know.

4114
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,500
I mean,

4115
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,333
I feel like,

4116
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:15,150
I still feel like I love you dude.

4117
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:17,780
Podcast is might be over after that.

4118
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:19,223
I don't feel like,

4119
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:22,040
I don't know if I have any
response to that legitimately.

4120
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:23,360
I don't feel like that makes any sense.

4121
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,381
I feel like,

4122
01:54:24,381 --> 01:54:24,740
uh,

4123
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,300
if you,

4124
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:25,640
you know,

4125
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,880
if you will fuck people and we,

4126
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:28,863
and eating them is wrong.

4127
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:29,840
Uh,

4128
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,650
well it's not wrong if you're trapped
like car crashed in the Andes mountains

4129
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:35,270
and just eating a person.

4130
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,980
Well people have done it.

4131
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,690
I mean the whole bond or party,

4132
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:40,610
those people that got
stuck in the Rockies,

4133
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:45,230
people done it and it's a
notoriously fucking like bad story.

4134
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:46,700
Like it's not cool.

4135
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:49,640
It's not like things you
should do on a regular basis.

4136
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:51,380
But I mean fucking pigs,

4137
01:54:51,381 --> 01:54:52,550
let's just apply the same,

4138
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:53,840
probably the same logic.

4139
01:54:53,841 --> 01:54:56,270
How about you're stuck on an island
and there's no people to fuck,

4140
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:59,090
but you got a think and they
come back after all these years.

4141
01:54:59,091 --> 01:54:59,201
The,

4142
01:54:59,201 --> 01:54:59,571
hey man,

4143
01:54:59,571 --> 01:55:00,250
what were you doing?

4144
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:00,440
Like,

4145
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:01,760
well I raised pigs and a,

4146
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:03,410
and I killed him for food.

4147
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:03,850
Oh,

4148
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,131
okay,

4149
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:04,730
cool.

4150
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,660
What would you do for sex?

4151
01:55:05,661 --> 01:55:06,590
He just beat off a lot.

4152
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:07,070
No,

4153
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,210
I just fucked my pigs.

4154
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,171
They'd be like,

4155
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:09,940
Whoa,

4156
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:10,773
cool.

4157
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:11,870
Not Cool.

4158
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:12,720
He did something.

4159
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,120
Should have just kept that to yourself,

4160
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:14,331
man.

4161
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:15,164
You know?

4162
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:16,700
That's really what it is.

4163
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,060
Would it be worse if he
made love to the pig?

4164
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,470
I don't think either one is bad.

4165
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:22,611
I think honestly,

4166
01:55:22,611 --> 01:55:23,720
if you're going to kill an animal,

4167
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:24,380
fucking it,

4168
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,720
as long as you don't
like fuck it to death.

4169
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:30,430
That's kind of a crazy way
to kill something and we
just go anal with the pig or

4170
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,273
vagina.

4171
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:32,600
She'd have to see the setup.

4172
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,070
You have to see what you deal with,

4173
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:34,700
you know,

4174
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,121
condom,

4175
01:55:35,121 --> 01:55:35,781
no condom.

4176
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:36,614
It's about a question.

4177
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,030
Internal organ lies.

4178
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:39,950
Pigs are supposed to
be very similar to us.

4179
01:55:39,951 --> 01:55:40,940
So you don't,

4180
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:43,320
you definitely don't want to go
anal without a little cleanup first.

4181
01:55:43,321 --> 01:55:43,880
I mean,

4182
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:44,010
you

4183
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,650
get some pig shit through the
tip of your deck for sure.

4184
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,520
That can be a problem.

4185
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:47,671
Well,

4186
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:48,510
I'm not sure if I ever,

4187
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:49,500
if this correct,

4188
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:49,831
but it is,

4189
01:55:49,831 --> 01:55:52,240
isn't there like a pig's extra excrement?

4190
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:52,520
His,

4191
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:52,810
his,

4192
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:53,120
his,

4193
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,120
his entire,

4194
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:58,500
she think her story system
is basically expelling waste.

4195
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:02,070
Like the sweat to a certain
degree is oh really?

4196
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:02,910
Yeah,

4197
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:03,690
that makes sense.

4198
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,230
Yeah.

4199
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:05,100
Pigs are disgusting.

4200
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:06,420
They're strange animals,

4201
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:06,631
man.

4202
01:56:06,631 --> 01:56:07,590
They're smart as fuck though.

4203
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,660
It's one thing that's
weird about killing pigs.

4204
01:56:09,661 --> 01:56:10,341
They're smart man.

4205
01:56:10,341 --> 01:56:11,340
A smarter than dogs.

4206
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:12,300
They know what's going on.

4207
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:12,790
Oh,

4208
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:15,030
you know the whole animal farm thing,

4209
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:15,900
man.

4210
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,070
Well if you still have that book,

4211
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:18,300
I can make a pick squirt.

4212
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:19,860
You ever see that documentary?

4213
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:20,850
A my brother's keeper,

4214
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:23,910
it's documented about
these dudes were like,

4215
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:28,110
they were like a little slow and they
lived on a farm and one of them I think

4216
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:31,230
was accused of murder and it was like
real weird whether or not they could

4217
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:32,640
defend themselves in court,

4218
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:33,240
whether they could,

4219
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:33,540
you know,

4220
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:34,890
there were there a little
mentally challenged,

4221
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:35,941
but they uh,

4222
01:56:35,941 --> 01:56:38,520
with running this farm and there's a
scene in the farm where he has to kill a

4223
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:41,250
pig and he pulls out the
shotgun and the pay goes fuck.

4224
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:44,280
And the pig just scrambles left and right.

4225
01:56:44,281 --> 01:56:48,060
That pig knows exactly what the fuck
is going on to pick saw the shotgun.

4226
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,100
And I saw that and that
kept me from eating,

4227
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:52,890
begging or any pig for
like at least two days.

4228
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,670
It was like a month
just silent for a month.

4229
01:56:56,671 --> 01:56:57,180
I was like,

4230
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:57,721
Oh man,

4231
01:56:57,721 --> 01:56:58,440
I think I'm not,

4232
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,970
I'm not going to need
anything that's smart.

4233
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:01,413
Kind of

4234
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,713
delicious.

4235
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,890
But then I found out what cops,

4236
01:57:04,891 --> 01:57:08,610
pigs are you fall into if you like feeding
pigs and you fall in there that eat

4237
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:08,850
you.

4238
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:11,150
That's like number one
way that farm was dying.

4239
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:12,640
One of those Dr. Barton,

4240
01:57:12,641 --> 01:57:16,050
the autopsy things where they did this
whole thing on this lady that had a pig

4241
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:18,950
farm and just murder husbands
and throw their butts in the pit.

4242
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:21,000
That was a great show.

4243
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:26,440
That guy was the best that doctor Paten
I lift a love the HPL autopsies show it,

4244
01:57:26,441 --> 01:57:27,300
but we bought that.

4245
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:28,290
Challenged your,

4246
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:30,450
your view of the world
before the Internet,

4247
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:31,561
before the Internet.

4248
01:57:31,561 --> 01:57:32,940
That was the first freak out show.

4249
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,040
Well you realize how crazy people are.

4250
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:36,120
They one dude,

4251
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,400
he took a woman and she died.

4252
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:40,580
She was like a very beautiful
woman and she died all,

4253
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:44,040
he made a doll out of her
like put a little rubber,

4254
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:48,210
whole downward her vagina once we could
fuck her covered with like cases and

4255
01:57:48,211 --> 01:57:53,100
cases of perfume cause she was rotting
fix parts over with wax and what's he

4256
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:55,470
like a doctor or a doctor.

4257
01:57:55,471 --> 01:57:58,460
I remember he was so in love
with her that he took her,

4258
01:57:58,461 --> 01:57:59,680
bought his wife wasn't,

4259
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:03,270
I don't remember it was either his
wife or it might've been his ex wife.

4260
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,470
I don't remember what it was,

4261
01:58:04,471 --> 01:58:05,520
but he took,

4262
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:06,780
it might've been just a patient,

4263
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:11,430
but he took her and he was just
perfect during his Rafkin her body.

4264
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:13,260
You need to know that man.

4265
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,700
We need to know that dude's out there.

4266
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,450
Yeah,

4267
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:16,590
it's important because you can,

4268
01:58:16,591 --> 01:58:19,170
you could have a really distorted view
of the world will know where all those

4269
01:58:19,171 --> 01:58:19,531
dudes are.

4270
01:58:19,531 --> 01:58:21,570
When that single
consciousness comes around,

4271
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:22,200
it's coming.

4272
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,033
We'll all be like,

4273
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:27,023
well don't you think?

4274
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:30,980
Don't you think with what you're
talking about with like you know,

4275
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:32,670
people realizing that you know,

4276
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:36,990
one consciousness realizing that doing
to others as you would have them do to

4277
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:37,321
you,

4278
01:58:37,321 --> 01:58:38,250
you lead a healthy,

4279
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:42,700
happy light and y'all were all like
calming down and connecting in this thing.

4280
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:42,851
It all,

4281
01:58:42,851 --> 01:58:46,650
it's all building toward this crescendo
and if it reaches that one state where

4282
01:58:46,651 --> 01:58:47,021
all of a sudden,

4283
01:58:47,021 --> 01:58:51,190
whether it's a technology or whether it's
just the human body evolving to a next

4284
01:58:51,191 --> 01:58:51,870
level,

4285
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:54,340
maybe that's a few generations
away and mean who the fuck knows?

4286
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:58,660
But that's what I feel like the one thing
that's going to stop all the bullshit

4287
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:00,900
because when everybody
knows the bullshit stage,

4288
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,230
you think we're going to get to that.

4289
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:05,380
I think we're going to get to a
connectivity very similar to the Internet,

4290
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,000
but it's going to be in your own brain.

4291
01:59:07,090 --> 01:59:07,923
That's what I think.

4292
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:11,980
I think that the connectivity of the
Internet gives you through social media.

4293
01:59:11,981 --> 01:59:15,040
I think it's almost like
sticking your finger through.

4294
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:15,340
Like,

4295
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:15,611
you know,

4296
01:59:15,611 --> 01:59:19,330
you can't get to the outside but you can
like poke your finger through this like

4297
01:59:19,331 --> 01:59:23,110
gelatinous sort of shield
that separates the two worlds.

4298
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:24,850
You can't quite break through,

4299
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:25,661
but it's close.

4300
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:26,411
So the Internet is like,

4301
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:27,940
you're exchanging information,

4302
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:28,783
it's free.

4303
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:31,780
The whole cut into the girl right there.

4304
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:32,380
Same,

4305
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,213
similar.

4306
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:35,140
We're using computers in order to,

4307
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:35,411
you know,

4308
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:38,500
we're sending like ones and Zeros
to each other and we're connecting.

4309
01:59:38,501 --> 01:59:40,600
But we're doing all this
through this artificial shit.

4310
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:42,370
I think eventually this artificial shit,

4311
01:59:42,371 --> 01:59:45,340
this is just a bridge to some
sort of technological freedom.

4312
01:59:45,341 --> 01:59:47,260
This is a bridge towards some next step,

4313
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:50,110
whether it's saying
something will be implanted.

4314
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:50,973
We couldn't be,

4315
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,670
it could be that I'm going to this,

4316
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:54,410
uh,

4317
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:54,971
you don't have to,

4318
01:59:54,971 --> 01:59:56,530
you can just die off like the fucking,

4319
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:57,190
you know,

4320
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:58,023
like all the other,

4321
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:59,440
my nothing wrong with that man.

4322
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,630
This is a romantic thing
to that they'd go out,

4323
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:02,590
Johnny Cash style,

4324
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,420
all old singing hurt,

4325
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:05,493
you know,

4326
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:05,921
fuck.

4327
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:06,430
Yeah.

4328
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:07,420
There's nothing wrong with that.

4329
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:08,020
I mean,

4330
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:08,860
we all go to sleep.

4331
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:09,200
No,

4332
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,490
just I just know the fucking history
of corporations in the world.

4333
02:00:12,491 --> 02:00:14,410
And Shit and I'm not letting
anybody putting it in my fucking,

4334
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,280
that's the question though.

4335
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:15,430
What?

4336
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:19,210
What does that eliminate all the
bullshit that corporations do when,

4337
02:00:19,211 --> 02:00:21,070
when everyone's accountable
for their own actions?

4338
02:00:21,071 --> 02:00:23,620
Is that the thing that the manufacturer
or the thing that goes in your brain?

4339
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,130
I mean,

4340
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:25,450
maybe it's inevitable progress.

4341
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,710
Maybe it's the inevitable progression
of where technology is heading.

4342
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,081
So Joe,

4343
02:00:29,081 --> 02:00:30,340
you have such a great outlet,

4344
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,790
man.

4345
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:31,990
I do occasionally.

4346
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:33,790
I'm way too suspicious of people.

4347
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:34,390
I know that.

4348
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:38,380
I know that the true nature of
a lot of motherfucking people,

4349
02:00:38,381 --> 02:00:38,951
that's true,

4350
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:41,020
but don't you know great people as well.

4351
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:43,630
Just the fact that those
beautiful people exist.

4352
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:45,340
I know enough beautiful people,

4353
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:47,200
beautiful personalities,

4354
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,011
friendly,

4355
02:00:48,011 --> 02:00:48,371
healthy,

4356
02:00:48,371 --> 02:00:48,971
happy people.

4357
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:53,470
I know enough of them now to be convinced
that it's not like an aberration.

4358
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:53,761
There's,

4359
02:00:53,761 --> 02:00:57,820
there's a whole population of
likeminded happy people out there.

4360
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:00,760
The problem is there's
separated from each other.

4361
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,050
That's not necessarily true.

4362
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:05,290
Even the evil people themselves are
surrounded by other either evil people.

4363
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,790
That's a big issue with evil people.

4364
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:08,170
You're growing up around evil people.

4365
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,580
You respond to your environment,

4366
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:10,780
you imitate your atmosphere,

4367
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:11,590
you're a cunt.

4368
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:11,951
You know,

4369
02:01:11,951 --> 02:01:13,510
and sometimes it's not
even your own fault.

4370
02:01:13,511 --> 02:01:15,640
You just stuck in a shit
spot with a Douchebag,

4371
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:18,730
dad and a mother who's a fucking
cocaine addict or whatever,

4372
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,800
fill in the blank with your
own troubles and dilemmas.

4373
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:24,640
But I think that ultimately there's so
many cool people and so many nice people

4374
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:28,000
and people that want other people to
be happy that I just feel like that's,

4375
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:30,340
that's the trend of where
they live in that world.

4376
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:30,881
Then that's,

4377
02:01:30,881 --> 02:01:32,470
that's the world we should all live in.

4378
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,120
It's not impossible.

4379
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:38,080
That's the fact that there's so many
of them means it's not impossible.

4380
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:39,380
It's just at point.

4381
02:01:39,381 --> 02:01:40,470
Do I have to give up my guns?

4382
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:41,480
You have to give up shit.

4383
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:42,141
Why don't I don't,

4384
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:43,550
that's I'm not giving up.

4385
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:45,440
I don't think you should give up guns.

4386
02:01:45,441 --> 02:01:46,310
I think it's ridiculous.

4387
02:01:46,311 --> 02:01:47,840
I don't think you should
give up your car either.

4388
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:50,000
I don't think you should give up
your ability to buy lighter fluid.

4389
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:52,060
I don't think he should
give up your ability to,

4390
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:54,020
to buy a fucking helicopter.

4391
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:56,240
I don't think you should limit
your ability to do anything.

4392
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:59,570
I think freedom is the most important
thing and then be responsible for your

4393
02:01:59,571 --> 02:01:59,931
actions,

4394
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:04,340
but stop people from doing country
shit by making them aware of one

4395
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:04,970
consciousness,

4396
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:09,320
making them aware that we all are
experiencing this together and if you fuck

4397
02:02:09,321 --> 02:02:09,741
with people,

4398
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:11,030
if you send out some bad shit,

4399
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:12,980
that bad shit comes back to you too.

4400
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:13,371
It's,

4401
02:02:13,371 --> 02:02:14,204
it's possible.

4402
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,640
It's a met so many nice people.

4403
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:17,810
It's just,

4404
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:21,800
it needs to be like when you were talking
about Islam and about the messages of

4405
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:22,281
Islam,

4406
02:02:22,281 --> 02:02:26,480
they rang true in your mind and they made
sense to you and you felt like it was

4407
02:02:26,481 --> 02:02:29,270
a this conglomeration of wisdom,

4408
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:29,961
so to say.

4409
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:30,240
Right.

4410
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,073
I thought of it still does.

4411
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:31,491
Yeah,

4412
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:32,121
and it's still,

4413
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:32,954
it should,

4414
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,320
I think that we're just
missing a new version of that.

4415
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:37,243
That's all it is.

4416
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:38,650
It's not that people,

4417
02:02:38,651 --> 02:02:42,380
I could feel that and I think
that with technology at the helm,

4418
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:45,710
I think it's possible for
that to influence it as well.

4419
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,341
I think the,

4420
02:02:46,341 --> 02:02:46,550
the,

4421
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:51,080
the connectivity that we all share
and the inevitable it bill ability to

4422
02:02:51,081 --> 02:02:53,840
exchange information
freely without a computer,

4423
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:54,501
without anything,

4424
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:55,670
just connect to people freely.

4425
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,380
We could have never pictured this.

4426
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:57,761
No one,

4427
02:02:57,761 --> 02:03:00,770
no one in George Washington's
time saw a laptop coming.

4428
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:05,300
I mean there's no way and I think that
we have no fucking idea what's waiting

4429
02:03:05,301 --> 02:03:06,500
around the corner in a hundred years.

4430
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:08,030
I don't think we can,

4431
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:09,110
but I think if you look at the,

4432
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:09,944
where it's going,

4433
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:12,350
it's going towards just a full separation.

4434
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:14,670
I speculate closer to 20 and 30 years.

4435
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:15,050
I think.

4436
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:16,130
So no I don't think,

4437
02:03:16,131 --> 02:03:18,560
I think what you're saying is going to
happen in there and I'm saying but that's

4438
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:19,394
my,

4439
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:22,970
I don't speculate out farther neck
cause I don't expect to live longer than

4440
02:03:22,971 --> 02:03:23,360
that.

4441
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,780
You know this part of me that thinks it's
fascinating that like what if society

4442
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:29,690
got like just close to
ignite enlightenment.

4443
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:34,610
Just close like almost there
like breakthrough technology
walls dissolving every

4444
02:03:34,611 --> 02:03:36,050
second and then an asteroid.

4445
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,740
That's money we have to
start all over again.

4446
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:45,200
That's it brought me right
back to the lights going out.

4447
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,300
Well you paint with a dark brush.

4448
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:47,691
My brother,

4449
02:03:47,691 --> 02:03:49,110
that's where I came with a dark prod.

4450
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,831
That's why I love it.

4451
02:03:49,831 --> 02:03:50,840
I like your world.

4452
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:51,860
Yeah,

4453
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:55,400
well my world is your world
that we exist in the same space.

4454
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:56,510
Well I like the window.

4455
02:03:56,511 --> 02:03:57,770
You're looking through your world.

4456
02:03:58,970 --> 02:03:59,900
I need to get me one.

4457
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,810
I think you're doing this podcast
has helped shape that window.

4458
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:06,980
[inaudible] when that window that those
ideas I've always sort of had somewhere

4459
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:10,030
in the back of my mind and then slowly
reinforced by other people that have

4460
02:04:10,031 --> 02:04:12,980
meant that shared or and even
more evolved version of that idea.

4461
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,290
But doing this podcast,

4462
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:15,620
we're running into so many nice people,

4463
02:04:15,621 --> 02:04:16,700
so many cool people,

4464
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:19,640
so many people that are just
genuinely like happy and like,

4465
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21,110
like if you were my neighbor,

4466
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,240
you know that that would
be a beautiful thing.

4467
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,550
Like if you are my neighbor and
he was one of my other neighbors,

4468
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:27,830
I would want him like two houses down.

4469
02:04:27,831 --> 02:04:28,310
Right?

4470
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:29,570
That motherfucker is a screamer,

4471
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:30,501
but you know what I'm saying?

4472
02:04:30,501 --> 02:04:33,680
Like like to have a real
community like that.

4473
02:04:33,681 --> 02:04:37,650
If you really look at it like if everybody
was like the f your favorite people,

4474
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,600
boy the world would be fucking amazing.

4475
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:42,480
The world would just be a bunch of
people being friendly with each other,

4476
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,081
you know,

4477
02:04:43,081 --> 02:04:44,100
exchanging things,

4478
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:44,761
doing work,

4479
02:04:44,761 --> 02:04:45,521
doing whatever the fuck you,

4480
02:04:45,521 --> 02:04:45,961
you have to do,

4481
02:04:45,961 --> 02:04:47,400
you pay me for this and I do that for you.

4482
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:49,020
But if everybody was,

4483
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:54,060
if that is kind of be a way where at
least on a mass scale that that can be the

4484
02:04:54,811 --> 02:04:55,920
majority of people.

4485
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:57,540
I don't see that.

4486
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:58,530
That's not possible.

4487
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:01,080
I don't think it's inhibited by finances.

4488
02:05:01,081 --> 02:05:02,820
I don't think it's inhibited by resources.

4489
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:06,120
I think it's inhibited by
people understanding that
they can live a different

4490
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:06,954
kind of life.

4491
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:11,580
And I think that's where something like
a guy like you talking out about it and

4492
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:13,710
a guy like you expressing your ideas.

4493
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:16,890
Like some kid right now is a big
Everlast fan is in his car and he's,

4494
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:17,520
you know,

4495
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,850
listening to this and he's hearing your
take on things and maybe he'll pick up a

4496
02:05:20,851 --> 02:05:21,601
book on religion.

4497
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:23,280
Maybe he'll pick up a book on philosophy.

4498
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:23,970
Maybe he'll,

4499
02:05:23,970 --> 02:05:24,720
you know,

4500
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:29,150
maybe he'll stop one pattern of thinking
and introduce himself to a couple of

4501
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:32,040
other patterns and those in turn will
shape the future of his thinking.

4502
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:33,341
Well,

4503
02:05:33,341 --> 02:05:34,174
don't be like me.

4504
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,721
Dot.

4505
02:05:34,721 --> 02:05:35,554
Full Shit.

4506
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:37,960
But you weren't,

4507
02:05:37,961 --> 02:05:38,231
you,

4508
02:05:38,231 --> 02:05:39,490
you wouldn't be making this,

4509
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:42,070
this beautiful dark music man.

4510
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:45,190
You know that this is something
I love about that man.

4511
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:46,270
What does that song,

4512
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:46,891
what was the,

4513
02:05:46,891 --> 02:05:47,010
uh,

4514
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:48,130
the song that you played,

4515
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:49,263
um,

4516
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,130
the last time you were here,

4517
02:05:51,131 --> 02:05:52,260
how many different songs did you play?

4518
02:05:52,261 --> 02:05:53,530
The American girl,

4519
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,060
Miss America.

4520
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:57,010
Miss America has that little Miss America.

4521
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:58,480
God Damn Son,

4522
02:05:58,870 --> 02:06:00,070
I can't think like that.

4523
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:01,223
I'll start crying.

4524
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:02,111
I can't,

4525
02:06:02,111 --> 02:06:03,280
I could never write something like that.

4526
02:06:03,281 --> 02:06:04,114
I would just start crying.

4527
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,470
But I love hearing it,

4528
02:06:05,471 --> 02:06:05,891
you know,

4529
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:06,270
like,

4530
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:08,620
well that's kind of where I
take it about is what makes me,

4531
02:06:08,621 --> 02:06:09,070
like,

4532
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:10,060
when I'm writing it,

4533
02:06:10,061 --> 02:06:10,510
you know,

4534
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:11,291
after it's written,

4535
02:06:11,291 --> 02:06:11,501
you know,

4536
02:06:11,501 --> 02:06:12,370
and I can perform it,

4537
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:13,350
you know,

4538
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:14,710
I don't get as emotional,

4539
02:06:14,711 --> 02:06:16,600
but that's what I try and do.

4540
02:06:16,601 --> 02:06:18,280
I try and make myself upset a little bit.

4541
02:06:18,281 --> 02:06:20,870
Like feel something because I'm,

4542
02:06:20,871 --> 02:06:21,551
I'm hard.

4543
02:06:21,551 --> 02:06:22,031
Honestly.

4544
02:06:22,031 --> 02:06:22,864
I'm like,

4545
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,040
I'm hard to get to,

4546
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:25,211
you know,

4547
02:06:25,211 --> 02:06:26,044
react.

4548
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:27,160
You're a big teddy bear.

4549
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:28,781
Probably truth,

4550
02:06:28,781 --> 02:06:30,220
but it's hard to get past the,

4551
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:30,560
the,

4552
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:31,390
the for,

4553
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:31,541
well,

4554
02:06:31,541 --> 02:06:32,980
you just dealt with a lot of Douche.

4555
02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:34,600
Douchebags it's normal.

4556
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:35,613
It's normal,

4557
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:37,150
you know,

4558
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:38,200
search reason,

4559
02:06:38,201 --> 02:06:39,010
life say no,

4560
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:39,450
you've,

4561
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:39,790
you know,

4562
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,980
you're about to sing right there.

4563
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:41,833
Those,

4564
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,730
let's get to have a nub
and surgeries and alive.

4565
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:46,170
Go right into sampling.

4566
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:48,760
Yeah.

4567
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:49,241
You know?

4568
02:06:49,241 --> 02:06:51,700
But ultimately you're a nice guy.

4569
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:52,090
I mean,

4570
02:06:52,090 --> 02:06:52,690
you know,

4571
02:06:52,690 --> 02:06:53,830
I'd like to think so.

4572
02:06:53,930 --> 02:06:54,150
Yeah.

4573
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:54,881
He's a nice guy.

4574
02:06:54,881 --> 02:06:55,301
You're fun,

4575
02:06:55,301 --> 02:06:56,100
you're fun to be around.

4576
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:57,490
And if you use your blinker,

4577
02:06:58,660 --> 02:06:59,493
you know what I mean?

4578
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:01,210
Yeah.

4579
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:02,290
There's nothing wrong with that,

4580
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:07,210
but you've also dealt with a lot of
Douche bags were we live in douchebag

4581
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:09,500
central and we work amongst douchebag.

4582
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:10,060
Fucking,

4583
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:10,320
you know,

4584
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,140
in the Douche bag.

4585
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:11,380
Yes.

4586
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:12,370
Industry there is,

4587
02:07:12,371 --> 02:07:12,740
you know,

4588
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:13,531
people will never know.

4589
02:07:13,531 --> 02:07:13,690
There's

4590
02:07:13,690 --> 02:07:14,330
dental douchey.

4591
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:15,190
It can possibly be.

4592
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,540
And especially the music business.

4593
02:07:16,541 --> 02:07:17,860
I think it's probably the Douchey,

4594
02:07:17,861 --> 02:07:22,510
just how to all the potential running
into dickheads running any musicians.

4595
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,250
Like you got a lot of brilliant,

4596
02:07:24,251 --> 02:07:25,240
beautiful people out there,

4597
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:29,110
but God damn things way worse
than musicians and Tish bags.

4598
02:07:29,111 --> 02:07:29,261
Yeah.

4599
02:07:29,261 --> 02:07:32,830
Cause even a shitty musician is
actually probably somewhat decent.

4600
02:07:32,831 --> 02:07:34,750
Has shitty actors this fucking,

4601
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:35,470
yes.

4602
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:36,070
That's a good point

4603
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,160
because most actors are gross to begin
with and you have a shitty went on top of

4604
02:07:39,161 --> 02:07:39,300
that.

4605
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:40,150
I would say they're pretty close.

4606
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:41,770
I've met a lot of douchey musicians,

4607
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:42,611
but yeah,

4608
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:44,410
I think ultimately you're probably right.

4609
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,010
I think men do.

4610
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:46,930
Musicians requires more discipline to,

4611
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:48,220
you know,

4612
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:48,550
does it?

4613
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,383
You have to actually,

4614
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,830
especially if you play an instrument,

4615
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:52,560
you have to actually learn discipline.

4616
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,473
You got to practice.

4617
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:53,980
Yeah,

4618
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,820
that's a big thing.

4619
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,260
Answers on best act is shit.

4620
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,283
Investment in time.

4621
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:01,060
Acting as easy as fuck too and they
like to pretend it's really difficult.

4622
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:02,800
It's easy as well.

4623
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:04,780
I think there's a level of it that's hard,

4624
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:05,081
right?

4625
02:08:05,081 --> 02:08:06,280
I mean Daniel Day Lewis,

4626
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:10,030
the general most things done in the
acting world are relatively easy.

4627
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:12,520
It's not like playing guitar
and singing at the same time.

4628
02:08:12,521 --> 02:08:13,870
That's tricky as fuck isn't it?

4629
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:17,500
And actually it took a long time
for me to be able to do both.

4630
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:17,900
Yeah,

4631
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:18,581
watch you do it.

4632
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:18,820
And I'm,

4633
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:19,110
I'm,

4634
02:08:19,110 --> 02:08:19,311
I'm,

4635
02:08:19,311 --> 02:08:21,360
I'm perplexed by the dam,

4636
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,450
but the one can,

4637
02:08:22,490 --> 02:08:22,811
you know,

4638
02:08:22,811 --> 02:08:23,950
the one thing that's bad is,

4639
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:24,491
like I said,

4640
02:08:24,491 --> 02:08:25,720
if that one kink in the road,

4641
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:27,370
it's a train wreck,

4642
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:27,641
man.

4643
02:08:27,641 --> 02:08:30,510
It's like I should have never
opened my eyes on that one.

4644
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:32,020
Well that's different than a joke.

4645
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:32,381
You know,

4646
02:08:32,381 --> 02:08:32,771
a joke.

4647
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:35,920
You could fuck up in the middle of it
and sorta like re rail it and it'd be,

4648
02:08:35,921 --> 02:08:39,430
and you even go on a tangent
about the fuck up and you're okay,

4649
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:40,630
but we'll not get set on me.

4650
02:08:40,631 --> 02:08:42,900
It's all pictures and one
kind of cross circuit.

4651
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:44,540
And so honestly what happened was,

4652
02:08:44,541 --> 02:08:49,150
is my hand started playing one song and
I was saying words from another and then

4653
02:08:49,151 --> 02:08:49,550
it was all,

4654
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,970
it was like just jumbled garbage.

4655
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:56,470
How would we really be fascinated if
someone who was a memory expert could talk

4656
02:08:56,471 --> 02:08:57,700
to you about,

4657
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:58,060
uh,

4658
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:00,020
how you organize thoughts like how you,

4659
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:00,401
how many,

4660
02:09:00,401 --> 02:09:01,150
how you memorize things.

4661
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:02,980
I bet people could learn
a lot because you're,

4662
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:03,880
you're,

4663
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:04,121
there's,

4664
02:09:04,121 --> 02:09:05,860
you've got and just not just words,

4665
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:10,660
you got words that correspond to Melanie's
correspond to musical notes and you

4666
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:13,870
have it all like arrange and
I'm sure you've morphed it.

4667
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:17,950
So you've probably had several versions
of each song as if sort of evolved

4668
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,030
inside your head.

4669
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,930
I bet that would be.

4670
02:09:19,930 --> 02:09:21,790
How many fucking songs do you
have in your head right now?

4671
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:24,130
Like how many songs
could you reliably play?

4672
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:30,090
A hundred just mean without
like rehearsing like without
a company and just you?

4673
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:32,351
Well,

4674
02:09:32,351 --> 02:09:34,250
I kind of eliminate all
the rap songs if you,

4675
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:35,860
cause that wouldn't be playing too.

4676
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:37,143
So,

4677
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:38,093
um,

4678
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:41,410
probably most songs off of
most of my records if I,

4679
02:09:41,530 --> 02:09:42,040
you know,

4680
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:42,873
what's the number?

4681
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,830
60 60 or 60 think about all that shit.

4682
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:49,240
60 Times what?

4683
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:52,510
Five minutes for four minutes.

4684
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,700
That's a lot of fucking shit to memorize,

4685
02:09:54,701 --> 02:09:55,534
son.

4686
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:56,920
A lot of shit inside your head.

4687
02:09:56,921 --> 02:09:59,330
Just spinning around and
you're calling upon another,

4688
02:09:59,331 --> 02:09:59,690
you know,

4689
02:09:59,690 --> 02:10:03,490
three albums of wraps and
stuff I've never even used yet.

4690
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:04,540
You know.

4691
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:07,630
Do you think you get to bust those out
as well or would you need to a wrap

4692
02:10:07,631 --> 02:10:08,170
mindset?

4693
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:09,000
Um,

4694
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,510
I like the classics.

4695
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:11,344
I could bust out.

4696
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:16,180
Did you take any shit when you moved from
rap to like this sort of bluesy style

4697
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,014
of music?

4698
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:17,740
Nah,

4699
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:20,770
cause I think some people are growing
up with me and I've never really,

4700
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:20,991
I,

4701
02:10:20,991 --> 02:10:24,070
I was part of the cocoa notes for this
was that was a little rap collective,

4702
02:10:24,071 --> 02:10:24,311
you know,

4703
02:10:24,311 --> 02:10:24,700
and all,

4704
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:27,340
every one of my records has
something hip hop related.

4705
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,250
I still kind of consider
myself hip hop artists,

4706
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:30,520
you know,

4707
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,230
I just evolved into what I'm doing.

4708
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,880
You know,

4709
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,030
it's anybody who's downloaded

4710
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:35,900
la Coka nostra just that name.

4711
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:38,000
I don't want to get in an
argument with any of those dudes.

4712
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:41,510
I don't want to be an argument
with anybody who was in
something called La Coka.

4713
02:10:41,511 --> 02:10:43,880
Nostra that seems like a lot,

4714
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:45,410
a lot of drama that would come with that.

4715
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:46,960
Just the names.

4716
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:50,810
I'll just kinda cheat coco
cafe powerful cookbook.

4717
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:54,710
I think something that came from one
day like where before I had joined the

4718
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:55,041
group,

4719
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:58,100
there was a couple of the guys who
like to a little bit and you know,

4720
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:58,934
and,

4721
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,070
and they were talking like
in the studio one day like,

4722
02:11:01,071 --> 02:11:01,401
Yo,

4723
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:02,240
we're getting along great.

4724
02:11:02,241 --> 02:11:04,130
It's like La Cosa Nostra and Danny boy.

4725
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:05,630
Like he was sober and he was like,

4726
02:11:05,631 --> 02:11:05,841
yeah,

4727
02:11:05,841 --> 02:11:07,250
more like La Coka Nostra and

4728
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:12,710
coined the name right there that
cocaine's a mother fucker man,

4729
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:14,720
that Buck Cherry Song.

4730
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:16,220
That's a bad ass jam.

4731
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:17,540
You know like that song.

4732
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:18,470
I love the cocaine.

4733
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,323
Yeah.

4734
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:22,160
That's the best cocaine
song next to the uh,

4735
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:23,060
I've never really heard,

4736
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:26,690
clapped wanting to have the
issue come up cause of each,

4737
02:11:26,691 --> 02:11:27,590
steered away from that shit.

4738
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,330
I mean I did a couple of times in my life,

4739
02:11:29,331 --> 02:11:30,320
but like it never became,

4740
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:31,760
I always knew I had a little hard thing.

4741
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:32,930
So I always kind of was like,

4742
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:33,231
you know,

4743
02:11:33,231 --> 02:11:33,830
those kinds of,

4744
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:34,161
those,

4745
02:11:34,161 --> 02:11:38,630
the maths and the in the cocaine's and
even the ecstasy and stuff like that.

4746
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:40,260
I stayed heavily away from it.

4747
02:11:40,261 --> 02:11:41,094
About Caffeine.

4748
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:42,981
I don't drink the shit.

4749
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:44,500
I think I'm a coca cola fiend,

4750
02:11:44,501 --> 02:11:44,721
man.

4751
02:11:44,721 --> 02:11:45,510
I drink too.

4752
02:11:45,510 --> 02:11:45,660
Well,

4753
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:46,221
that's my bit.

4754
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:46,861
If I dressed,

4755
02:11:46,861 --> 02:11:48,540
if I stopped drinking coca cola alone,

4756
02:11:48,541 --> 02:11:48,751
Joe,

4757
02:11:48,751 --> 02:11:50,700
I'd probably lose 15
pounds just from that.

4758
02:11:50,910 --> 02:11:53,190
Why don't you stop fucking love it,

4759
02:11:53,191 --> 02:11:53,581
man.

4760
02:11:53,581 --> 02:11:54,414
Really did.

4761
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,411
You didn't even do coke.

4762
02:11:55,411 --> 02:11:55,920
Zero.

4763
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,410
You Go.

4764
02:11:56,410 --> 02:11:57,243
No,

4765
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:59,580
I only drink coke out of a glass bottle.

4766
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:00,290
Mexican coke.

4767
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:00,750
Yeah.

4768
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:01,740
This is what I tell people.

4769
02:12:01,741 --> 02:12:02,580
Think about it this way.

4770
02:12:02,610 --> 02:12:03,130
If you want,

4771
02:12:03,130 --> 02:12:04,920
they make American coax the little sorry,

4772
02:12:04,921 --> 02:12:06,680
but the little eight ounce
or Americans learn it.

4773
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:07,740
You can find Mexican ones,

4774
02:12:07,741 --> 02:12:09,630
but I'll drink the
little American ones too.

4775
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:10,440
If you want it.

4776
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,710
You really change what you drink and
you really want to drink a lot of water.

4777
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:17,490
Just think about how delicious water
would be if it was rare as fuck.

4778
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:19,210
If water was difficult to come.

4779
02:12:19,211 --> 02:12:19,771
Most delicious.

4780
02:12:19,771 --> 02:12:20,820
Now I love ice.

4781
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:21,930
Cold bottle of water.

4782
02:12:21,931 --> 02:12:22,511
Just pound.

4783
02:12:22,511 --> 02:12:23,060
Just take,

4784
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:23,300
yeah,

4785
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:23,520
go.

4786
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,250
It's this.

4787
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:28,440
There's that fucking monster in my brain
that tells you to get that Coca Cola

4788
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:29,730
water.

4789
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:33,930
I've gone on kicks where I kind of stopped
and what I do is I get club soda and

4790
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,760
cause it's the bike that bike,

4791
02:12:35,761 --> 02:12:40,761
that cold bite back and that carbonated
goodness and that sugar rush and Oh

4792
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:42,270
there's cups out to bad for you.

4793
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:44,520
Is it bad carbon ended shit.

4794
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:48,080
I heard there's something about carbonated
water that's not supposed to sodium

4795
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:48,780
in it.

4796
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,600
Is that what it is?

4797
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,433
There's sodium in it.

4798
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:50,761
Yeah.

4799
02:12:50,761 --> 02:12:51,900
And it might be a lot of sodium in it.

4800
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:52,860
Yeah.

4801
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:53,610
Coca Cola.

4802
02:12:53,610 --> 02:12:55,580
Fuck you up at that corn syrup man.

4803
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,640
That corn syrup some and
that's why the Mexican ones,

4804
02:12:57,641 --> 02:12:58,201
they're a little better.

4805
02:12:58,201 --> 02:13:00,390
They're made with real sugar cane sugar.

4806
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:01,140
How do you get those?

4807
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:02,850
You're going to date sending
them all around California.

4808
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:03,060
Yeah.

4809
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:03,491
Oh really?

4810
02:13:03,491 --> 02:13:06,830
Getting California and when you get
out of California or Arizona Anyway,

4811
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:07,561
it touches Mexico.

4812
02:13:07,561 --> 02:13:11,520
You can pretty much get them in Ohio
before they started selling the small

4813
02:13:11,521 --> 02:13:13,160
little ones because they stopped selling.

4814
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:14,010
Sell the tall ones.

4815
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:14,670
Yeah,

4816
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:16,140
they stopped selling him like in Ohio.

4817
02:13:16,141 --> 02:13:19,860
They stopped selling all bottles for
awhile and they just recently like maybe

4818
02:13:19,861 --> 02:13:20,970
like seven years ago,

4819
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:23,430
brought back like the
little baby bottles in Ohio.

4820
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:28,620
So I used to go to antique stores and
buy the old bottles and then fill them up

4821
02:13:28,621 --> 02:13:32,220
with coke and put my my
refrigerator cause I'm a psycho.

4822
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:32,790
Wow.

4823
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:34,780
Why just because you like
drinking out of those bottles?

4824
02:13:34,781 --> 02:13:35,051
Yeah,

4825
02:13:35,051 --> 02:13:35,910
I'm the same way with him.

4826
02:13:35,911 --> 02:13:37,700
I love fucking coconut bar,

4827
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:38,790
but some reason it just brings,

4828
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:39,511
pour it in there.

4829
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:40,740
Then I killed all the fizz.

4830
02:13:40,741 --> 02:13:41,190
Right.

4831
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:43,380
No night if you'd like drink
it the same day or two.

4832
02:13:43,650 --> 02:13:44,280
Oh

4833
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:44,490
we are.

4834
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:44,821
First of all,

4835
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:47,670
it's just something about it
the way glass chills it too.

4836
02:13:47,671 --> 02:13:48,630
It's better than than to me.

4837
02:13:48,631 --> 02:13:49,260
I don't like them.

4838
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:51,660
I feel like I can taste metal
when I drink out of aluminum.

4839
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:51,920
Okay.

4840
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,240
Well when cans first came out
you could taste the difference.

4841
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:55,083
Remember going like,

4842
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:56,160
Oh this tastes weird.

4843
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:56,881
Do you remember that?

4844
02:13:56,881 --> 02:13:58,560
Like when when [inaudible] first came out?

4845
02:13:58,740 --> 02:13:59,370
I don't,

4846
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:03,990
but I do remember the people were
like really into this Mexican coke,

4847
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:05,183
Mexican coke.

4848
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,150
Like people were saying,

4849
02:14:06,151 --> 02:14:06,984
it's actually,

4850
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:08,550
it just tastes better.

4851
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:09,413
And it's cane sugar,

4852
02:14:10,180 --> 02:14:10,830
colas,

4853
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:15,220
the original cocacola cause it the
actual sugar before all the corporations

4854
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:16,800
bought into the corn syrup thing.

4855
02:14:16,801 --> 02:14:18,510
And that's all we use now in America.

4856
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:21,650
Do you know the Coca Cola
is the number one like the,

4857
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,740
as far as like important.

4858
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,810
Like who who takes
cocaine in this country?

4859
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:25,683
Coca Cola,

4860
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:25,981
they,

4861
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:30,600
his medical cocaine and they get medical
cocaine from processing the coca leaves

4862
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,220
that they used to make Coca Cola.

4863
02:14:32,610 --> 02:14:36,720
Like they're connected with medical
costs and not know that one of the active

4864
02:14:36,721 --> 02:14:38,140
ingredients in Coca Cola,

4865
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:38,870
they're sanctioned.

4866
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:42,260
Like they were part of all these
sanctioned assassinations and Southwire,

4867
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:43,410
oh my God,

4868
02:14:43,410 --> 02:14:44,490
go to a documentary.

4869
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:46,850
I haven't dot com no joke.

4870
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:48,120
Nicole's evil and,

4871
02:14:48,121 --> 02:14:48,954
and,

4872
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,000
and uh,

4873
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:53,790
I think it's called the Coca Cola
files or the Coca Cola cases.

4874
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:56,940
And it's about how their
involvement in some like,

4875
02:14:56,941 --> 02:14:57,241
you know,

4876
02:14:57,241 --> 02:15:00,270
nefarious activities down
there in South America.

4877
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:00,811
Well,

4878
02:15:00,811 --> 02:15:02,780
if you're going to be a coke,

4879
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:05,840
I'm surprised I didn't hear about
that inside that little documentary.

4880
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:07,461
They don't,

4881
02:15:07,461 --> 02:15:07,711
I mean,

4882
02:15:07,711 --> 02:15:08,850
they don't sell coke,

4883
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,230
but they do sell to,

4884
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:15,000
they take the process of
converting whatever the fuck is,

4885
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:15,350
uh,

4886
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:18,360
in the coca leaves into
some sort of a flavonoid,

4887
02:15:18,650 --> 02:15:20,250
some sort of a plant based,

4888
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:21,084
a taste.

4889
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:24,570
And they take that and it's one of the
ingredients of coke that makes it taste

4890
02:15:24,571 --> 02:15:24,931
weird.

4891
02:15:24,931 --> 02:15:26,910
And for the longest time
was actually cocaine.

4892
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:27,390
Oh yeah.

4893
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:27,961
Back original.

4894
02:15:27,961 --> 02:15:29,520
Coca Cola was cocaine.

4895
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,850
But when the process that
they use to make cocaine,

4896
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:34,173
yeah.

4897
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,880
The actual process today,

4898
02:15:35,881 --> 02:15:37,150
and this is in 2013,

4899
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:37,801
they used to make,

4900
02:15:37,801 --> 02:15:39,390
Coca Cola involves cocaine.

4901
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:41,250
It doesn't give you a cocaine high,

4902
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,850
but there's a flavor aspect of it that
actually comes from the coca plant.

4903
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:45,540
Yeah.

4904
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:48,810
And then they take that shit and they
sell it and they process it and they take

4905
02:15:48,811 --> 02:15:52,620
the cocaine out of it and make medical
cost counties because gang of shit used

4906
02:15:52,621 --> 02:15:53,454
to have cocaine.

4907
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:55,200
All these little Ho you're nit Vicks.

4908
02:15:55,201 --> 02:15:57,450
NYQUIL would have been like
loaded with cocaine back.

4909
02:15:57,451 --> 02:15:58,830
Codene or Cody.

4910
02:15:59,100 --> 02:15:59,401
Yeah,

4911
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:00,300
that stuff was bad.

4912
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:01,020
How's,

4913
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:04,140
why remedies like all those like cure als
where like had a little bit of cocaine

4914
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:04,974
in them and say,

4915
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:08,970
did you ever have the old school
nick walls with the codeine in it

4916
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:11,463
some the other day?

4917
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:13,180
Did you really get it?

4918
02:16:13,210 --> 02:16:14,050
You can still get it.

4919
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,760
You get the Nyquil with coding?

4920
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:16,061
Yeah.

4921
02:16:16,061 --> 02:16:17,260
You just have to get it prescribed.

4922
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:18,600
Oh,

4923
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:18,931
okay.

4924
02:16:18,931 --> 02:16:19,141
Yeah.

4925
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:20,890
I know they have prescription cough syrup,

4926
02:16:20,891 --> 02:16:21,241
but coding,

4927
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:24,240
but I didn't know if it was nick went
on math method and it used to be able to

4928
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:28,950
just go to cvs and he'd go to cvs and
you would get Nicole and I got sick once

4929
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:30,070
and I'll never forget

4930
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:30,221
this.

4931
02:16:30,221 --> 02:16:31,300
I had never taken it before,

4932
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:34,060
but I got sick once and I was so happy.

4933
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:34,901
I was like,

4934
02:16:34,901 --> 02:16:36,790
my pillow was like massaging me.

4935
02:16:36,791 --> 02:16:40,120
I was like call into this
pillar watching TV I've done.

4936
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:41,380
I felt I never felt better.

4937
02:16:41,381 --> 02:16:41,621
I was like,

4938
02:16:41,621 --> 02:16:42,131
oh my God,

4939
02:16:42,131 --> 02:16:42,550
I could get it.

4940
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:44,020
That can be a little chunky on this.

4941
02:16:44,530 --> 02:16:47,540
One of those big bottles of
that medical grade concert.

4942
02:16:47,710 --> 02:16:51,010
And like I kinda got into it
stretch where I was fucking with it.

4943
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:54,520
And then like within a year or so,

4944
02:16:54,521 --> 02:16:54,920
a couple,

4945
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,140
like at least three rappers,

4946
02:16:56,141 --> 02:16:56,450
I knew,

4947
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:57,283
God,

4948
02:16:57,700 --> 02:16:59,980
it makes you feel like
you're coming for hours.

4949
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:00,581
They forget,

4950
02:17:00,581 --> 02:17:01,810
you forget to breathe and you're sleeping.

4951
02:17:01,811 --> 02:17:02,420
You just stopped.

4952
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:02,710
Yeah.

4953
02:17:02,710 --> 02:17:03,160
Whoa.

4954
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,090
That's how it just slows you down so much.

4955
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:05,931
People just like,

4956
02:17:05,931 --> 02:17:06,910
we go to sleep and die.

4957
02:17:07,550 --> 02:17:08,383
That's when I was like,

4958
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:09,910
there was a gang and that shit was like,

4959
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:10,271
oh,

4960
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:12,580
the bottle I had was like a couple grand.

4961
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:14,830
I wonder if that I was going
to do with sleep apnea.

4962
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:16,650
I bet it has to do with Scott out.

4963
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:19,120
Cause some guy I knew like that
was a sneaker freak like me.

4964
02:17:19,121 --> 02:17:23,230
He worked for Sparkletts and he delivered
a sparkless deliveries into this,

4965
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:24,071
to this,

4966
02:17:24,071 --> 02:17:24,904
uh,

4967
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:25,661
to,

4968
02:17:25,661 --> 02:17:25,910
uh,

4969
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:28,390
a dentist or a doctor's office.

4970
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:29,750
And like as he was delivering it,

4971
02:17:29,751 --> 02:17:32,500
he went out the bat and he saw they had
a fucking case over him and he grabbed

4972
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:33,334
like,

4973
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:34,230
wow.

4974
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:36,670
One wow,

4975
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,050
that stuff is powerful.

4976
02:17:38,051 --> 02:17:38,680
It's fuck,

4977
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:42,640
there was one time I spent like five
days in my house like fuck up on my shit.

4978
02:17:43,130 --> 02:17:43,430
Playing.

4979
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:44,460
Playing socom too.

4980
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:48,311
Yeah,

4981
02:17:48,311 --> 02:17:49,360
that stuff's legit.

4982
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:52,510
There's a lot of pain stuff
that's addictive as fuck.

4983
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,470
It's amazing today.

4984
02:17:53,471 --> 02:17:56,350
Five days after that we're fucking hell.

4985
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:57,040
Oh I bet.

4986
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,980
What is the withdrawal?

4987
02:17:58,210 --> 02:17:59,380
Headachy body.

4988
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:00,214
You're just,

4989
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:01,510
yeah,

4990
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:02,021
you're sick.

4991
02:18:02,021 --> 02:18:03,020
You're basically like flu.

4992
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:05,020
You feel like you got the
flu for like three days.

4993
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:05,943
Wow.

4994
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,903
So then you get more.

4995
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:07,930
What does it make you want to,

4996
02:18:07,931 --> 02:18:11,110
is it one of those things where it makes
you want to get home after that five

4997
02:18:11,111 --> 02:18:12,520
day man I did it a few times after that.

4998
02:18:12,550 --> 02:18:15,460
Lightly within a drink or something but
like that five days I was going like

4999
02:18:15,461 --> 02:18:16,294
straight.

5000
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,433
Wow.

5001
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:19,680
Oh my God.

5002
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:21,490
It's like never stop and being drunk.

5003
02:18:21,491 --> 02:18:26,040
It's like being drunk for days like your
brain is getting all that visual like a

5004
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:28,600
firm cause I was like heavily
into that video game for a time.

5005
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:30,050
We had like a whole team of people on it.

5006
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:31,810
What it was when online shit first,

5007
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:32,980
like really good,

5008
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:33,560
like you know,

5009
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,360
it was working well and so,

5010
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,673
um,

5011
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:39,880
we would just get fucked up
for days and like the Vit,

5012
02:18:39,881 --> 02:18:43,360
your brain's getting all this
like happiness from the visual.

5013
02:18:43,361 --> 02:18:44,021
And like you said,

5014
02:18:44,021 --> 02:18:45,190
I was in my chair just like,

5015
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:46,390
oh dude,

5016
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:47,080
game.

5017
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,050
And for days I just talked
to another dude who,

5018
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:50,320
uh,

5019
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:52,650
had a back injury and got
hooked on Oxycontin's.

5020
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:57,070
I've probably talked to maybe 10 people
that have told me that exact same story

5021
02:18:57,370 --> 02:18:59,110
that another dude who had
a hard time kicking in.

5022
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:00,100
I just wonder,

5023
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:00,371
I'm like,

5024
02:19:00,371 --> 02:19:01,510
how many people out there?

5025
02:19:01,511 --> 02:19:02,740
There's 300 million people.

5026
02:19:02,741 --> 02:19:06,710
How many people out there or hooked
on oxy cause a commercial right now.

5027
02:19:06,711 --> 02:19:08,230
And to me that's telling people about,

5028
02:19:08,231 --> 02:19:08,441
you know,

5029
02:19:08,441 --> 02:19:09,850
if you're hooked on opiates and this,

5030
02:19:09,851 --> 02:19:10,001
that,

5031
02:19:10,001 --> 02:19:10,690
and the other,

5032
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:11,740
they're not advertising it.

5033
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:14,180
Like 1% of the people
know they're advertising.

5034
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:15,160
It's primetime.

5035
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:16,150
It's like herpes meds,

5036
02:19:16,151 --> 02:19:16,391
Yo,

5037
02:19:16,391 --> 02:19:17,050
it's out there.

5038
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:18,940
People in droves.

5039
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:22,630
They're not advertising on
TV because it's like not,

5040
02:19:22,930 --> 02:19:23,710
not around.

5041
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:24,040
Right,

5042
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:24,700
exactly.

5043
02:19:24,700 --> 02:19:26,230
It's not like they're malaria pills.

5044
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:26,591
Right.

5045
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:27,020
You know what I mean?

5046
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,980
You don't ever hear that on

5047
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,311
TV.

5048
02:19:28,311 --> 02:19:29,690
Come back malaria pill.

5049
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:31,251
Yeah.

5050
02:19:31,251 --> 02:19:32,870
Do you need a malaria pills?

5051
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:34,970
Fix Your boner pills.

5052
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:36,630
Herpes meds.

5053
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:39,830
There's a lot of problems out there.

5054
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:41,510
There's a lot of people hooked on pills.

5055
02:19:41,511 --> 02:19:41,721
I mean,

5056
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:42,170
that's a man.

5057
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:43,730
That's why everything else is illegal.

5058
02:19:45,070 --> 02:19:45,990
Of course,

5059
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:48,170
pharmaceutical corporations,

5060
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,910
they wanted us hooked on their drugs.

5061
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,560
It's amazing how it's happened.

5062
02:19:51,561 --> 02:19:53,810
I mean that really is almost
like a science fiction movie.

5063
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,940
When you look at how many
people are dependent on,

5064
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:56,780
and then not only that,

5065
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:59,240
how many jobs are dependent upon
the production of these things.

5066
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:03,350
Young was medicine something even
advertise besides a cold medicine,

5067
02:20:03,351 --> 02:20:04,820
like a Nyquil or something like that.

5068
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,370
Did you ever see advertisements
on TV for like prescription pills?

5069
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:12,830
Nail fungus tell you so
many commercials that say,

5070
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,660
ask your doctor about this.

5071
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:16,820
You never used to go ask
your doctor for medicine.

5072
02:20:16,821 --> 02:20:18,530
They told you what fucking
medicine you needed.

5073
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:18,801
Yeah,

5074
02:20:18,801 --> 02:20:20,600
because if you have a psychosomatic thing,

5075
02:20:20,601 --> 02:20:21,291
you can go in and say,

5076
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:21,741
you know doc,

5077
02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:22,630
I saw this commercial on that.

5078
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,310
Everybody have enough on TV?

5079
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,353
Hey Dee Dee,

5080
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:27,320
your arms hurt.

5081
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:28,183
Can you move them?

5082
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:28,521
Fuck,

5083
02:20:28,521 --> 02:20:28,971
I can't remember.

5084
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:29,840
Does your hair grow?

5085
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:30,561
Fuck it stopped.

5086
02:20:30,561 --> 02:20:31,610
Maybe you have this.

5087
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,593
I might have it.

5088
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:34,200
Look at all the symptoms like God,

5089
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:34,911
I think I got it.

5090
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:35,600
Shit.

5091
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:38,090
And then they run really
quickly by may cause vomiting,

5092
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:39,580
anal bleeding and then
you know what he was like,

5093
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:40,431
what the fuck?

5094
02:20:40,431 --> 02:20:41,750
Who's going to actually take this?

5095
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:42,501
What's so unfair?

5096
02:20:42,501 --> 02:20:43,850
If you know the history of people too.

5097
02:20:43,851 --> 02:20:47,840
It's not like they didn't know that
people have been like Roos by charlatans,

5098
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:50,660
all these fucking late night preachers
that are trying to get people to donate

5099
02:20:50,661 --> 02:20:50,841
money.

5100
02:20:50,841 --> 02:20:52,310
They've been doing it for
years and years and years.

5101
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:52,880
They didn't,

5102
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,130
they already knew that there was a
certain percentage of the population that

5103
02:20:55,131 --> 02:20:57,020
were like super easily manipulated.

5104
02:20:57,230 --> 02:21:00,010
So to make them responsible for,

5105
02:21:00,011 --> 02:21:00,500
you know,

5106
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:04,050
their own judgment and
having a commercial on that,

5107
02:21:04,051 --> 02:21:05,090
selling prescription drugs,

5108
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,410
that's really ridiculous.

5109
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:10,280
That's not just the guys you got now you
got guys coming in asking for stuff and

5110
02:21:10,281 --> 02:21:11,930
how many doctors are just sleazebags.

5111
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:12,111
I mean,

5112
02:21:12,111 --> 02:21:14,780
we've learned how many doctors
used to be when we were young.

5113
02:21:14,781 --> 02:21:15,141
That was a,

5114
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:15,681
somebody like,

5115
02:21:15,681 --> 02:21:16,130
uh,

5116
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:17,030
you were told policemen,

5117
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:17,541
firemen,

5118
02:21:17,541 --> 02:21:18,021
doctors,

5119
02:21:18,021 --> 02:21:18,980
these are good people.

5120
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:19,521
We know.

5121
02:21:19,521 --> 02:21:20,440
Now that's not true.

5122
02:21:20,441 --> 02:21:21,271
There are people there,

5123
02:21:21,271 --> 02:21:23,330
they're just as dirty and
rotten as everybody else.

5124
02:21:23,331 --> 02:21:24,230
So how many of them are like,

5125
02:21:24,231 --> 02:21:24,411
yeah,

5126
02:21:24,411 --> 02:21:24,651
sure,

5127
02:21:24,651 --> 02:21:26,270
I'll prescribe you all that shit.

5128
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:26,481
Oh,

5129
02:21:26,481 --> 02:21:27,200
it's happening.

5130
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:27,730
For sure.

5131
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:28,551
I could go out right now,

5132
02:21:28,551 --> 02:21:30,050
legitimately right now with,

5133
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:30,890
by the end of,

5134
02:21:30,890 --> 02:21:31,101
well,

5135
02:21:31,101 --> 02:21:31,761
it's probably late today,

5136
02:21:31,761 --> 02:21:34,580
but by the end of day tomorrow I can have
pri five prescriptions for painkillers

5137
02:21:34,581 --> 02:21:35,414
if I really want them.

5138
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:36,410
Well,

5139
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:38,510
today in California there's a database,

5140
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,180
so you could probably go to different
doctors and maybe get different things

5141
02:21:41,181 --> 02:21:41,721
prescribed.

5142
02:21:41,721 --> 02:21:42,170
Sure.

5143
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:42,381
Yeah.

5144
02:21:42,381 --> 02:21:43,220
Not the same one.

5145
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,391
But in Florida,

5146
02:21:44,391 --> 02:21:45,440
they don't have a database.

5147
02:21:45,441 --> 02:21:45,681
I mean,

5148
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:46,700
they might've changed it now,

5149
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:47,420
but they had that,

5150
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:48,141
that show,

5151
02:21:48,141 --> 02:21:50,780
the oxycontin express that they aired.

5152
02:21:50,781 --> 02:21:50,961
If you,

5153
02:21:50,961 --> 02:21:52,640
you can just Google that online,

5154
02:21:52,641 --> 02:21:53,474
you can watch it.

5155
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:53,781
It's,

5156
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:54,614
um,

5157
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:54,860
the,

5158
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,670
what does that,

5159
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:57,200
I think it was on true TV,

5160
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:58,071
but either way,

5161
02:21:58,071 --> 02:22:01,520
whatever it was on the
Oxycontin Express van guard,

5162
02:22:01,521 --> 02:22:04,280
that was the show they went and they
showed how you could go to Florida.

5163
02:22:04,281 --> 02:22:05,091
You can go to a doctor,

5164
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:05,361
say,

5165
02:22:05,361 --> 02:22:06,051
oh my back hurts.

5166
02:22:06,051 --> 02:22:08,150
They give you a prescription and you
go down the street to another doctor.

5167
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:09,800
He gives you a prescription
for the same shit.

5168
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:11,150
Nobody talks to anybody.

5169
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:11,690
They don't,

5170
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:13,130
there's not a database that they can say,

5171
02:22:13,131 --> 02:22:14,000
hey Mr. Wilson,

5172
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:18,590
I see you've had 10,000 oxycontin
prescriptions from different doctors this

5173
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:18,980
year.

5174
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:20,000
So because of that,

5175
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:23,960
Florida sells more oxycontin
then the whole country,

5176
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:26,130
like literally think that the numbers

5177
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:30,180
for how much the part of your whole
explanation of Florida's crazy.

5178
02:22:30,181 --> 02:22:31,290
Now it's absolutely,

5179
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,020
let me make sure that that's true
because someone told me that,

5180
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:34,441
uh,

5181
02:22:34,441 --> 02:22:38,340
Florida uses more oxy
than the whole country.

5182
02:22:41,450 --> 02:22:42,283
Yeah.

5183
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:44,260
Cause there's a doubt in my mind,

5184
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:45,131
Brian,

5185
02:22:45,131 --> 02:22:45,671
when he thinks that,

5186
02:22:45,671 --> 02:22:46,504
right?

5187
02:22:46,570 --> 02:22:46,900
Yeah,

5188
02:22:46,900 --> 02:22:47,560
that's right.

5189
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:48,393
I think it's right.

5190
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:50,593
Yeah.

5191
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:51,040
Uh,

5192
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:51,930
it doesn't sound wrong.

5193
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:52,950
It doesn't sound wrong.

5194
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:53,850
Yeah.

5195
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:55,280
Well either way I'll,

5196
02:22:55,330 --> 02:22:55,981
I'll look for it.

5197
02:22:55,981 --> 02:22:56,814
While we're talking,

5198
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:57,361
but the,

5199
02:22:57,361 --> 02:22:57,930
uh,

5200
02:22:57,930 --> 02:23:01,620
the reality is that there's a lot of
fucking people that take that shit and

5201
02:23:01,621 --> 02:23:02,400
they're gone.

5202
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,711
It's,

5203
02:23:02,711 --> 02:23:03,000
it's,

5204
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:03,750
it's opiate.

5205
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,390
It's really dangerously
addictive and they just,

5206
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:08,820
they just toss and I never took it.

5207
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:10,650
Somebody gave me some once and I just,

5208
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:12,030
they actually frightened me.

5209
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:15,000
I threw them away because I knew so many
people that just got caught out there

5210
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:15,990
so quickly on them.

5211
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:16,291
Well,

5212
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:17,124
you ready for this?

5213
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,240
In Florida alone,

5214
02:23:18,241 --> 02:23:23,000
almost 3000 people died
of an overdose in 2009.

5215
02:23:23,010 --> 02:23:23,843
2010.

5216
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:27,540
The majority of these people
had legal prescriptions,

5217
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:28,261
medications,

5218
02:23:28,261 --> 02:23:29,700
and their systems at the time of death.

5219
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:31,290
Wow.

5220
02:23:31,980 --> 02:23:33,210
That's Nutty Shit,

5221
02:23:33,211 --> 02:23:33,541
man.

5222
02:23:33,541 --> 02:23:35,400
They're just dropping like flies.

5223
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:37,950
3000 people,

5224
02:23:37,951 --> 02:23:38,360
man,

5225
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,390
that's nine 11.

5226
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:40,740
That's nine 11.

5227
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:41,280
And it's,

5228
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:41,580
it's,

5229
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:42,870
it's happening all the time.

5230
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:44,430
It's nine 11 and it keeps going.

5231
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:49,650
People just dropping this show was really
scary because one of the guys on the

5232
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:49,921
show,

5233
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:53,550
his wife had died of an overdose and
he got high before you called the cops.

5234
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:55,260
His wife was lying next to him,

5235
02:23:55,261 --> 02:23:58,680
cold and blue and this motherfucker got
high before he called the ambulance.

5236
02:23:58,950 --> 02:23:59,670
Hmm.

5237
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:00,840
That's how crazy it is.

5238
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,380
Yeah.

5239
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:02,940
That shit honestly scared me.

5240
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:03,960
It's terrifying.

5241
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:06,740
I had a period where I was like heavy and
they're like taking like biking in and

5242
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:07,950
drinking a few whiskeys.

5243
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:08,813
Oh,

5244
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,870
why don't you like to do that?

5245
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:11,140
What does that feeling made me feel.

5246
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:16,230
I would take like half a viking
and my rule was a half a Vicodin

5247
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:18,630
and then I can have a few
whiskeys and it'd be like,

5248
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:20,130
it'd be almost the same feeling as that,

5249
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:21,300
that crop syrup.

5250
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:23,340
Like you ever do that by
if I get into and Whiskey,

5251
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:23,611
yeah,

5252
02:24:23,611 --> 02:24:24,690
I've done Vegan is alcohol.

5253
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:25,873
What does it like?

5254
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:27,233
It's

5255
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:30,040
really slow and yeah,

5256
02:24:30,041 --> 02:24:30,431
it's like,

5257
02:24:30,431 --> 02:24:31,190
it's kind of like,

5258
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,370
yeah,

5259
02:24:31,370 --> 02:24:32,230
it's like comfortable.

5260
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:34,570
It's like tripping on
the Robo trafficking.

5261
02:24:34,810 --> 02:24:38,500
I had a buddy who was a guitar player who
said that vicodins made him like super

5262
02:24:38,501 --> 02:24:41,560
creative love vicodins maybe?

5263
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:42,550
No,

5264
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:43,110
maybe.

5265
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:43,390
No,

5266
02:24:43,390 --> 02:24:43,870
you don't think something.

5267
02:24:43,870 --> 02:24:44,910
It's never happened to me.

5268
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:45,880
Viking I've signed,

5269
02:24:45,881 --> 02:24:47,480
it makes me pretty lazy on them.

5270
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:48,850
I was pretty lazy on them.

5271
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:49,750
Wow,

5272
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:50,381
that's interesting.

5273
02:24:50,381 --> 02:24:51,280
We just wanted it like,

5274
02:24:51,281 --> 02:24:51,880
yeah,

5275
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:52,710
I'm good.

5276
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:53,543
Okay.

5277
02:24:53,710 --> 02:24:54,041
Some,

5278
02:24:54,041 --> 02:24:54,281
you know,

5279
02:24:54,281 --> 02:24:55,530
call up abroad or something.

5280
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:01,480
Rod [inaudible] from the fifties Calib
Rudd scally cap on calling up abroad

5281
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:07,810
while I listened to see if I watch
those old movies where dudes of backhand

5282
02:25:07,811 --> 02:25:08,380
bitches.

5283
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:08,740
Yeah.

5284
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:09,131
And you're like,

5285
02:25:09,131 --> 02:25:09,800
whoa.

5286
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:12,820
They go off and that was that going
on where you can put it in a movie.

5287
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:15,190
We get to the Moon Alice.

5288
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:15,660
Yeah.

5289
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:16,030
We,

5290
02:25:16,030 --> 02:25:17,410
well that he never actually hit her.

5291
02:25:17,770 --> 02:25:18,780
He was threatening her.

5292
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:19,733
It was,

5293
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:21,580
he was right when you think about it,

5294
02:25:22,150 --> 02:25:23,650
pow to the out,

5295
02:25:23,651 --> 02:25:24,070
right in

5296
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:24,730
the kisser.

5297
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,330
Yeah.

5298
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:28,140
He was gonna Punch her kid a
mood and he was a big guy too.

5299
02:25:28,141 --> 02:25:28,630
The nose,

5300
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:32,590
I'm going to punch you in the face
and Jackie Gleason seemed like cyber.

5301
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:33,650
Do we punch a check?

5302
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:36,790
Do you ever see that Sean Connery
interview we talked about,

5303
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:38,860
sometimes women need a slap
cause they keep pushing.

5304
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,300
Sometimes you have to slap him.

5305
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:41,771
Everybody was like,

5306
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:42,604
Whoa,

5307
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:44,200
God Damn Sean Connery.

5308
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:46,390
But the way he was saying is like,

5309
02:25:46,391 --> 02:25:46,760
listen,

5310
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:48,760
never had a broad pushing
that button on you.

5311
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:50,051
Oh yeah.

5312
02:25:50,051 --> 02:25:50,560
No,

5313
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:52,150
I don't think he meant every,

5314
02:25:52,151 --> 02:25:52,831
I mean that's the,

5315
02:25:52,831 --> 02:25:53,790
that's probably asking me.

5316
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:54,290
Yeah,

5317
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:54,790
I'm asking.

5318
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:57,340
My Dad beat my mom and I had a very,

5319
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:59,090
very similar to that.

5320
02:25:59,150 --> 02:26:00,520
My father was an alcoholic.

5321
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:01,081
I'm,

5322
02:26:01,081 --> 02:26:02,950
I'm very scared of that.

5323
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,890
I have getting into any sort
of a domestic situation.

5324
02:26:05,891 --> 02:26:06,400
So No,

5325
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:07,233
I've never had,

5326
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,190
I had one.

5327
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:09,220
Have you ever hit what I'm just saying?

5328
02:26:09,221 --> 02:26:10,950
But it never had a broad come at you.

5329
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:16,010
Like she was pushing to a point where she
wanted you to slap the shit out of her

5330
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:17,560
or do something physical to her?

5331
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:18,280
No,

5332
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:19,180
I had to duck,

5333
02:26:19,181 --> 02:26:19,421
man.

5334
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:19,880
I just like,

5335
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:20,401
I've never,

5336
02:26:20,401 --> 02:26:21,850
it never got to the crazy rods.

5337
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,370
I've liked a lot of crazy birds too,

5338
02:26:23,380 --> 02:26:24,310
but I have a little bit,

5339
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:28,790
I have a little bit of a higher threshold
before I press the panic button and

5340
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:30,310
subscribe to the Chris Rock Dairy,

5341
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:31,001
which was,

5342
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:31,870
I won't hit a bitch,

5343
02:26:31,871 --> 02:26:33,090
but I'll shoot the shit.

5344
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:35,403
Yeah.

5345
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:36,490
Well,

5346
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:36,761
you know,

5347
02:26:36,761 --> 02:26:40,480
my whole life when I was a young man was
all dedicated to martial arts and the

5348
02:26:40,481 --> 02:26:44,560
last thing I ever wanted to do is getting
a violent altercation with a girl.

5349
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,180
But I had chick swing at me.

5350
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:48,780
I've had a couple of girls I
dated like make them the same.

5351
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,700
They know there's,

5352
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:51,730
there's broads who want that to happen,

5353
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:53,440
but I've never gotten even close.

5354
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:54,750
I'm not willing to enter.

5355
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:55,300
That's,

5356
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:57,000
that's the sign to get the fuck away.

5357
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:57,580
Right,

5358
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:58,780
and what have you like it?

5359
02:26:59,210 --> 02:26:59,430
Yeah.

5360
02:26:59,430 --> 02:27:02,710
What are some chick comes after you when
you fucking cracker and all of a sudden

5362
02:27:03,521 --> 02:27:03,881

5364
02:27:04,181 --> 02:27:05,260
well I started hitting you.

5365
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:06,213
Here we go.

5366
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:06,611
You know,

5367
02:27:06,611 --> 02:27:07,480
we're actually fighting now.

5368
02:27:07,481 --> 02:27:08,650
And then your plumbing or,

5369
02:27:08,651 --> 02:27:11,400
and Nina in the face and pounded
her into the ground mean,

5370
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,430

5371
02:27:12,431 --> 02:27:15,400
You gonna fight like what are you going
to get a halfway fight and you going to

5372
02:27:15,410 --> 02:27:16,120
shaker,

5373
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:16,990
you're going to slap her.

5374
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:18,040
How hard do you slap her?

5375
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:18,741
Can You punch her?

5376
02:27:18,741 --> 02:27:19,574
If she punches you?

5377
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:20,261
What'd she grabs you,

5378
02:27:20,261 --> 02:27:20,441
Dick.

5379
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:21,131
And she won't let go.

5380
02:27:21,131 --> 02:27:24,010
You're going to punch you then like what
happens then and then if she gets out

5381
02:27:24,011 --> 02:27:27,260
of it now you're asking questions and
know if you're going to ask me to pray and

5382
02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:29,550
I'm going to say I'm really
good at subscribe to like,

5383
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:33,790
I'll tell you the same way I heard him
say it in American pimp there a time and

5384
02:27:33,791 --> 02:27:36,250
a place to hit anyone.

5385
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:37,151
Yes.

5386
02:27:37,151 --> 02:27:39,280
In defending yourself
and defending your lab.

5387
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:41,290
So if you're saying if she grabbed
your Dick and won't let go,

5388
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:43,030
you're getting punched dead in your,

5389
02:27:43,650 --> 02:27:44,483
sure.

5390
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:47,500
Psychologically we tried
to torture me or something.

5391
02:27:47,530 --> 02:27:49,850
I'm going to do everything I can
to get the fuck away from me.

5392
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:51,710
That's when I just,

5393
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:54,100
I don't have a desire to hit anybody
when they're psychologically tortured,

5394
02:27:54,101 --> 02:27:55,120
but I come from the same thing.

5395
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:55,631
My father,

5396
02:27:55,631 --> 02:27:55,901
you know,

5397
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:56,321
he wasn't,

5398
02:27:56,321 --> 02:28:00,040
he was like a binge alcoholic like can
be find for nine months and then a bump

5399
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:01,420
in the road and he'd be gone for three,

5400
02:28:01,421 --> 02:28:02,254
four weeks,

5401
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:03,701
come home.

5402
02:28:03,701 --> 02:28:06,800
And by the time I hit 1617 I,

5403
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:07,420
you know,

5404
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:11,410
the data steer you away in any way
from alcohol or make you wary of it.

5405
02:28:11,710 --> 02:28:12,160
Well,

5406
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,490
yeah,

5407
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:13,510
very wary of it.

5408
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:14,650
I mean it never steered me away.

5409
02:28:14,651 --> 02:28:16,680
I was always drinking,

5410
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:18,220
but I just never,

5411
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:19,720
I never drank by myself.

5412
02:28:19,721 --> 02:28:21,040
It was always early on in my life.

5413
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:22,040
I was very aware of that kind

5414
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,371
of stuff.

5415
02:28:22,371 --> 02:28:23,990
Like don't be caught drinking at home.

5416
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:26,600
Don't drink because you're
sad or in a bad mood.

5417
02:28:26,601 --> 02:28:27,890
I know that's not my thing.

5418
02:28:28,470 --> 02:28:28,880
Yeah.

5419
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,080
That's never the good mood.

5420
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:30,980
Like drink it for me,

5421
02:28:30,981 --> 02:28:31,880
it's something I do like,

5422
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:33,140
oh we're going to go
out and have some fun.

5423
02:28:33,410 --> 02:28:34,370
Let's have a few drinks.

5424
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:37,610
That's cool that you were able to
overcome that even though your dad had an

5425
02:28:37,611 --> 02:28:38,070
issue.

5426
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:41,330
Because sometimes at that that thing is
either psychological but sometimes it's

5427
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:41,760
genetic,

5428
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:41,971
you know,

5429
02:28:41,971 --> 02:28:44,390
but like by the time I hit 1516 I would,

5430
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,610
my routine was like I
would when I knew those,

5431
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:46,941
cause they're,

5432
02:28:46,941 --> 02:28:47,301
like I said,

5433
02:28:47,301 --> 02:28:49,490
it was like it wasn't
an every night thing.

5434
02:28:49,491 --> 02:28:49,731
It's about,

5435
02:28:49,731 --> 02:28:50,780
I guess he'd be fine for a long time,

5436
02:28:50,781 --> 02:28:51,920
but when you knew he was on a binge,

5437
02:28:51,921 --> 02:28:56,270
I would stay up every night till either
he didn't come home or he came home,

5438
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,720
sit them down and give him some food
just to keep it from like fighting.

5439
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:00,650
And then like one time,

5440
02:29:00,651 --> 02:29:00,771
you know,

5441
02:29:00,771 --> 02:29:01,910
he started trying to fight with my mom,

5442
02:29:01,911 --> 02:29:03,880
but I was saying I was
about 1617 and I just,

5443
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:04,970
that's when I stepped in and

5444
02:29:06,530 --> 02:29:07,011
fucked up.

5445
02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:08,660
So we had a fight and you know,

5446
02:29:08,750 --> 02:29:10,160
I woke up on the couch later.

5447
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:12,530
My Dad was a big construction work in man.

5448
02:29:12,531 --> 02:29:13,250
So,

5449
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:13,460
you know,

5450
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:14,630
he wasn't easy to fight,

5451
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:18,680
but that was the last time flew
out to when me and him squared off.

5452
02:29:18,681 --> 02:29:20,200
It was the last time it
ever happened to him.

5453
02:29:20,201 --> 02:29:21,080
He never did it again.

5454
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:23,330
And then they finally split
up a little while later.

5455
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:24,861
Yeah.

5456
02:29:24,861 --> 02:29:25,850
That's not good man.

5457
02:29:26,210 --> 02:29:29,120
Being around crazy big drunks that
can beat the fuck outta here was never

5458
02:29:29,121 --> 02:29:29,954
willing to,

5459
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,903
you know what?

5460
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:31,960
Before he passed though,

5461
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:33,080
I think he got it together.

5462
02:29:33,081 --> 02:29:33,750
He was,

5463
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:34,740
he came,

5464
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:35,210
you know,

5465
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:36,620
his life lessons were learned,

5466
02:29:36,621 --> 02:29:37,454
you know what I mean?

5467
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:37,821
Well,

5468
02:29:37,821 --> 02:29:42,110
the alcohol one is such a fucked up one
because it seems some sort of a chemical

5469
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:43,520
thing goes off and some folks,

5470
02:29:43,521 --> 02:29:45,830
and then he died at 63 I
know it shortened his life.

5471
02:29:46,010 --> 02:29:46,580
Of course.

5472
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:46,880
Yeah.

5473
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,870
There's no doubt about it.

5474
02:29:47,871 --> 02:29:48,530
It's poison.

5475
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:49,930
I mean it feels good because it's poison.

5476
02:29:50,050 --> 02:29:50,300
Poison.

5477
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:51,133
You know your shit.

5478
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:52,750
But Damn,

5479
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:53,121
it's fun.

5480
02:29:53,121 --> 02:29:54,390
Sometimes whiskeys good.

5481
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:58,110
And the relief,

5482
02:29:58,150 --> 02:30:02,060
the relief from the burdens of thinking
about all the subtle nuances of the

5483
02:30:02,061 --> 02:30:02,570
world,

5484
02:30:02,570 --> 02:30:02,871
you know,

5485
02:30:02,871 --> 02:30:03,591
when did you just like,

5486
02:30:03,591 --> 02:30:04,520
who gives a fuck?

5487
02:30:04,550 --> 02:30:05,540
Let's do another shot.

5488
02:30:05,570 --> 02:30:08,960
You clink glasses and you know that
everybody's all in on it with you.

5489
02:30:08,961 --> 02:30:09,770
That's good stuff.

5490
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:11,780
It's good stuff when it goes
the other way from there.

5491
02:30:11,781 --> 02:30:12,230
If you're not,

5492
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:13,400
if that's not how you're doing it,

5493
02:30:13,401 --> 02:30:14,234
you shouldn't be doing it.

5494
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:15,291
Exactly.

5495
02:30:15,291 --> 02:30:16,190
But again,

5496
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:17,750
it boils down to who you're doing it with.

5497
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:20,390
Unless you're an alcoholic,

5498
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:21,740
then it pause down there.

5499
02:30:21,741 --> 02:30:22,041
Sorry,

5500
02:30:22,041 --> 02:30:23,180
you got a shitty gene.

5501
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:26,300
He got some American Indian and Irish.

5502
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:27,591
I shouldn't,

5503
02:30:27,591 --> 02:30:28,010
you know what I mean?

5504
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:28,843
I kind of,

5505
02:30:29,330 --> 02:30:32,300
I'm sure there's some genetic
level of connection to it,

5506
02:30:32,301 --> 02:30:33,260
but it's choice,

5507
02:30:33,261 --> 02:30:33,651
man.

5508
02:30:33,651 --> 02:30:34,880
There's a big choice there.

5509
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,073
You can choose,

5510
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:36,913
you can,

5511
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:38,480
you can choose not to.

5512
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:39,051
If I,

5513
02:30:39,051 --> 02:30:42,860
if I really suspected I was like
fucked up like my father was,

5514
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:44,630
I would've just chose to never drink.

5515
02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:45,883
You know what I mean?

5516
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:48,020
Because I was so hyperconscious I,

5517
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:49,760
cause I was able to see also the pattern.

5518
02:30:49,761 --> 02:30:50,690
My father's father was,

5519
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,120
my father was a good father
compared to his father.

5520
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:54,111
You know what I mean?

5521
02:30:54,111 --> 02:30:57,050
My father made improvements so I can see.

5522
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:57,741
I said,

5523
02:30:57,741 --> 02:30:58,011
okay,

5524
02:30:58,011 --> 02:31:00,770
so it's my turn to make that improvement.

5525
02:31:00,771 --> 02:31:02,420
That's exactly the same with my father.

5526
02:31:02,450 --> 02:31:05,180
My father's father was
even more of a savage.

5527
02:31:05,210 --> 02:31:09,890
He came over from Ireland
during the depression and
my mom told me that when she

5528
02:31:09,891 --> 02:31:10,640
was young,

5529
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,860
my dad's dad tried to fuck her.

5530
02:31:13,390 --> 02:31:14,660
Like she was,

5531
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:16,880
she was like when she'd already had me,

5532
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:19,070
like she'd be over the house
and my father would step,

5533
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:20,210
I'm gonna go down the corner

5534
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:21,210
and my dad would be like,

5535
02:31:21,211 --> 02:31:22,320
in my dad's father would be like,

5536
02:31:22,321 --> 02:31:22,800
what's up?

5537
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:23,100
What's up?

5538
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:23,933
You want some of this?

5539
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:24,601
And she'd be like,

5540
02:31:24,601 --> 02:31:25,530
what the fuck?

5541
02:31:25,531 --> 02:31:30,531
Kind of crazy family is this just
drunk savages from the depression?

5542
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:34,110
Those were people that were
worried about starving to death.

5543
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:36,930
Those are people that would take
a piece of pussy in a heartbeat.

5544
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:37,710
They were,

5545
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:38,071
they were,

5546
02:31:38,071 --> 02:31:39,690
they were rapist and savages.

5547
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:40,771
There were animals.

5548
02:31:40,771 --> 02:31:43,110
They took a fucking boat
ride across the world.

5549
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:46,770
The wind up in some place where
they never even saw a picture of it.

5550
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:49,950
They had no idea what was going
to be like landed on a boat,

5551
02:31:49,951 --> 02:31:51,570
God out and we're hey,

5552
02:31:51,571 --> 02:31:52,380
made their way.

5553
02:31:52,380 --> 02:31:52,591
Yeah,

5554
02:31:52,591 --> 02:31:53,221
we're hated.

5555
02:31:53,221 --> 02:31:54,054
Hated,

5556
02:31:54,450 --> 02:31:55,260
made their way.

5557
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:57,780
This is so much closer to animals.

5558
02:31:57,990 --> 02:32:00,360
Hence the back fest woman Schmuck,

5559
02:32:00,890 --> 02:32:01,200
you know,

5560
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,390
that's from the 1950s
that she was acceptable.

5561
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:04,560
People were crazy back then.

5562
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:06,360
They were fucking animals.

5563
02:32:06,570 --> 02:32:07,350
The crazy now,

5564
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:07,861
but the better,

5565
02:32:07,861 --> 02:32:08,694
right.

5566
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:09,620
Hopefully,

5567
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:11,660
I figured there's no Rogan's any sign.

5568
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:14,220
If he has any proof that
culture is evolving.

5569
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,840
It's the proof in our record of culture.

5570
02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:16,800
I'm our songs,

5571
02:32:17,070 --> 02:32:17,350
our,

5572
02:32:17,350 --> 02:32:17,691
our,

5573
02:32:17,691 --> 02:32:18,011
our,

5574
02:32:18,011 --> 02:32:18,844
our movies.

5575
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:19,860
You know,

5576
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:20,850
our standup comedy,

5577
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,271
you know,

5578
02:32:21,271 --> 02:32:22,200
you want to see the,

5579
02:32:22,210 --> 02:32:24,660
the evolution of culture in the,

5580
02:32:24,661 --> 02:32:25,690
in standup comedy.

5581
02:32:25,710 --> 02:32:26,970
So a good microcosm.

5582
02:32:26,971 --> 02:32:28,620
It's good way to look at
the evolution of culture.

5583
02:32:28,621 --> 02:32:32,670
Go back and try to watch like some old
comedy from the 1950s and sixties it's so

5584
02:32:32,671 --> 02:32:33,504
dated.

5585
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:36,330
Even if you can put yourself into that
mindset and see the brilliance of it.

5586
02:32:36,331 --> 02:32:37,350
It's so dated,

5587
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:38,610
you know,

5588
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:40,920
watch some Lenny Bruce tried to laugh.

5589
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:42,400
That's how as edgy as he was,

5590
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:43,771
he was the greatest.

5591
02:32:43,771 --> 02:32:44,670
He opened up all the doors,

5592
02:32:44,671 --> 02:32:46,050
but you can't wash that shit today.

5593
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:48,750
It's weird in Carlene's still some of it,

5594
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:49,800
some of it,

5595
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:50,940
some of it is still dated though.

5596
02:32:50,941 --> 02:32:53,130
If you go to the really old stuff priors,

5597
02:32:53,131 --> 02:32:55,200
the first guy to me that's universal,

5598
02:32:55,410 --> 02:32:55,981
like he's,

5599
02:32:55,981 --> 02:32:57,490
he stands the test of time he's at,

5600
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:58,373
he's evergreen.

5601
02:32:58,740 --> 02:32:59,130
His,

5602
02:32:59,130 --> 02:32:59,810
his shit.

5603
02:32:59,810 --> 02:33:02,460
His shit was so like raw.

5604
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:06,750
Like when he would talk about his life
and the way he would describe things was

5605
02:33:06,751 --> 02:33:09,450
so raw that I think to
this day still resonates.

5606
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:10,920
Yeah.

5607
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:13,440
I remember the first time watching
it live on the sunset strip.

5608
02:33:13,441 --> 02:33:14,340
Fuck yeah.

5609
02:33:14,341 --> 02:33:15,690
It wasn't supposed to be watching it.

5610
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:16,553
Exactly.

5611
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:17,431
Yeah.

5612
02:33:17,431 --> 02:33:18,810
It was in the movie theater.

5613
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:22,320
The guy was just talking and
everybody was dying laughing.

5614
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:22,891
That was a,

5615
02:33:22,891 --> 02:33:24,420
that was a game changer
for a lot of people.

5616
02:33:24,421 --> 02:33:28,020
That was the first time a lot of people
got to see comedy like that created a

5617
02:33:28,021 --> 02:33:30,000
whole generation of comics,

5618
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:30,271
man,

5619
02:33:30,271 --> 02:33:31,070
that sure.

5620
02:33:31,070 --> 02:33:31,903
A little era.

5621
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:33,600
He was the first really honest guy.

5622
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:33,760
Well,

5623
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:34,531
him and Lenny Bruce,

5624
02:33:34,531 --> 02:33:36,330
Lenny Bruce was the first
really honest guy too,

5625
02:33:36,331 --> 02:33:37,164
but,

5626
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:40,320
but not when it came to
his personal life prior.

5627
02:33:40,321 --> 02:33:43,200
Took it to a completely different
level than anybody had before.

5628
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:43,951
You know?

5629
02:33:43,951 --> 02:33:44,840
I love that movie too.

5630
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:45,310
Joe.

5631
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:46,143
Joe Dancing.

5632
02:33:46,710 --> 02:33:51,710
We got to wrap this up with
one with one or two more.

5633
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:53,250
Which ones do you want to play?

5634
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:53,491
Well,

5635
02:33:53,491 --> 02:33:54,210
it's up to you.

5636
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:55,820
I want it told you I play one.

5637
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:56,431
Yeah,

5638
02:33:56,431 --> 02:33:56,691
I want,

5639
02:33:56,691 --> 02:33:57,690
I got to hear that one.

5640
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:00,570
And then maybe one more
that you want to do.

5641
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:01,350
Is that cool?

5642
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:01,950
Figure it out.

5643
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:02,550
Okay.

5644
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:03,383
Beautiful.

5645
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:08,850
And if any little punks on Twitter
complaining that he's playing music,

5646
02:34:08,851 --> 02:34:10,830
I need you to go fuck yourself right now,

5647
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:11,580
okay.

5648
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,440
And listen and get your mind straight,

5649
02:34:13,441 --> 02:34:14,274
bitches.

5650
02:34:14,480 --> 02:34:15,440
We're so backed.

5651
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:16,980
Oh Gee.

5652
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:18,130
Everlast follow

5653
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:18,963
him on Twitter.

5654
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,733
Uh,

5655
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:41,720
[inaudible]

5656
02:35:58,690 --> 02:35:59,523
ain't

5657
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:03,013
you

5658
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:11,240
don't

5659
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:15,233
mind.

5660
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:16,973
Yes

5661
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:23,320
ma'am.

5662
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:52,423
Shy

5663
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:56,333
that

5664
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:00,983
style.

5665
02:39:34,490 --> 02:39:35,090
Fuck yeah.

5666
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:35,923
Fuck yeah,

5667
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:37,123
indeed.

5668
02:39:37,550 --> 02:39:37,971
Powerful.

5669
02:39:37,971 --> 02:39:39,110
Everlast Ladies and gentlemen,

5670
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:40,380
I'm getting my Mojo back.

5671
02:39:40,830 --> 02:39:42,650
Bitches now from their last one.

5672
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:44,480
It's still bothered.

5673
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:45,260
Gotta let it go,

5674
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:45,700
my friend.

5675
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:45,980
Oh,

5676
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:46,820
we've got to move forward.

5677
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:49,093
I'm there.

5678
02:39:49,490 --> 02:39:50,323
I'm there as well.

5679
02:39:50,650 --> 02:39:51,051
What?

5680
02:39:51,051 --> 02:39:51,884
Let me do,

5681
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:54,350
what does it,

5682
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:54,671
what is it?

5683
02:39:54,671 --> 02:39:55,850
Like black on black coffee.

5684
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:56,220
Okay.

5685
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:57,110
We do that yet though.

5686
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:58,093
Did I do that?

5687
02:39:58,400 --> 02:39:58,960
You know what,

5688
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,020
today we'll wrap it up,

5689
02:40:00,021 --> 02:40:01,520
but this will take it home with this.

5690
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:02,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

5691
02:40:02,480 --> 02:40:03,320
thank you for tuning in.

5692
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:06,740
God bless you all and in
your own special burger.

5693
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:07,191
Beautiful,

5694
02:40:07,191 --> 02:40:07,820
perfect way.

5695
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:08,653
We're going to do this.

5696
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:09,950
Go fuck yourselves.

5697
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:11,210
Uh,

5698
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:12,043
why people are mad.

5699
02:40:12,070 --> 02:40:12,903
Be Cool.

5700
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,211
No,

5701
02:40:13,211 --> 02:40:13,351
no,

5702
02:40:13,351 --> 02:40:13,471
no.

5703
02:40:13,471 --> 02:40:13,921
Fuck God.

5704
02:40:13,921 --> 02:40:14,130
Damn.

5705
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,341
Show.

5706
02:40:14,341 --> 02:40:15,390
Tell him to go fuck themselves.

5707
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:16,843
That's not a bad,

5708
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:18,540
I don't even pay attention to that stuff.

5709
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:20,911
No one's mad,

5710
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:21,744
man.

5711
02:40:22,130 --> 02:40:22,963
Oh one.

5712
02:40:25,310 --> 02:40:25,451
Yeah,

5713
02:40:25,451 --> 02:40:26,284
we go

5714
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:35,920
yes.

5715
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:36,810
Today.

5716
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:38,050
Just a dream.

5717
02:40:38,051 --> 02:40:39,460
I don't remember.

5718
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:44,150
Marow Stylo Barb yet to

5719
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:49,560
Matt of town out of Ram.

5720
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:50,820
Anna Marie's

5721
02:40:52,850 --> 02:40:54,270
seasons change.

5722
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:56,070
Leave me out in the cold

5723
02:40:58,340 --> 02:41:02,730
stone is old man is Skyler's

5724
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:05,443
Dallas

5725
02:41:06,990 --> 02:41:07,823
pocket

5726
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:11,943
cry

5727
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:16,013
trying to sell,

5728
02:41:16,970 --> 02:41:18,800
but no one's by

5729
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:22,230
