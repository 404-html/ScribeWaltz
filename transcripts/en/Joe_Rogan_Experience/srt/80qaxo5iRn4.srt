1
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,451
Oh,

2
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,040
a lot of this shit's in your head,

3
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:38,670
man.

4
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,990
Let it go and if you do let it go to
my website and in the code name Rogan,

5
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,630
and you get 15% off when you click
on the link for the flashlight.

6
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,943
Oh,

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,023
there you go.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,420
We're also sponsored by Onnit,

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,380
O n n I t.com.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,060
The makers of Alpha brain,

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,210
a cognitive enhancing
supplement and new mood,

12
00:00:57,211 --> 00:01:00,660
a five HTP supplement that
actually boosts your mood.

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,291
You know,

14
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,790
it's a funny thing about
this new mood stuff,

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,980
but people who are on antidepressants,

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,240
their doctors are telling them not to
take five HTP because they say it's like

17
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,890
taking two antidepressants,

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,670
which is really fascinating to me because
that means that this natural vitamin

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,470
is actually an antidepressant.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,270
I don't know enough to comment on it.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,270
Maybe Bruce slipped and he'll help
us out once we get this podcast.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,530
Absolutely rolling.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,930
We're also the makers of shroom tech,

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,200
which is a quarter [inaudible]
mushroom endurance supplement,

25
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,130
which is wicked.

26
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,150
If you work out hard,

27
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,530
if you don't want to work out really hard,

28
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,364
don't bother with this.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,100
But if you're someone who does anything
like really difficult and you know,

30
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:39,450
football or wrestling or Jujitsu
or something like really strenuous,

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,940
like Mrs Rogan likes it
and she's in a cycling,

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,510
you know,

33
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,310
if you get on this stuff,

34
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,490
it really does give you like
a nice little endurance boost.

35
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,480
You feel it's good stuff.

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,621
Yeah.

37
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,520
I don't appreciate it based on science.

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,031
I don't,

39
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:51,610
I don't,

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,050
nothing.

41
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,390
Nothing.

42
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:52,710
Right.

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,810
There's no reason for me to
take any of that shit at all.

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,180
Now you're completely sedentary.

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,050
Now I'm good at or I lasagna tech.

46
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,850
You're very happy being sedentary though.

47
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:01,050
A lot of people would say they're like,

48
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,350
this kid is in denial and he really
wants to know your fucking fine with it.

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,700
Right.

50
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,410
And there is the less uh,

51
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,190
activity I have to do the better.

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,163
You're like a turtle.

53
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,053
You are.

54
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,320
That's why I chose were so long.

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,163
That's right.

56
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,471
You know,

57
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:13,981
I heard something,

58
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't know if it's true,

59
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,110
but that every animal essentially from
the moment it's born to the moment dies

60
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:19,944
of old age,

61
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,550
has the same amount of
heartbeats like are very similar.

62
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:24,120
At least,

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,391
you know.

64
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,540
And so like you only have a certain
amount of heartbeats and like no

65
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,670
professional athlete has ever
lived to be more than a hundred.

66
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,450
Yeah.

67
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,283
Her feet,

68
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,110
you'll burn your body out.

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,291
You're,

70
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,011
you're going nutty.

71
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:35,340
Me.

72
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,640
You,

73
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,230
you'll be around to the fucking Martians.

74
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,270
Come back to people on
cold weather live longer.

75
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,523
That's a good question.

76
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,363
I don't know.

77
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,541
Cold weather,

79
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,670
like make her heart beat
slower because you're real.

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,180
I would think that you use some way too
many resources and cold weather to just

81
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,110
try to stay alive.

82
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,441
Oh yeah.

83
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:52,710
You shiver [inaudible] acids going nutty.

84
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,903
Anyway.

85
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,450
Uh,

86
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,970
so shroom tech now for you Brian,

87
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,400
but you can benefit from new
mood and from brain and no,

88
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,060
this ain't like,

89
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,580
it's not like something
from the movie limitless.

90
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,170
Is that what it was?

91
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,480
Yeah.

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,190
It's not gonna make you
smarter if you're stupid,

93
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,850
but it does make you know,

94
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,770
like a lot of different substances too.

95
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,450
They're called nootropics
and they actually can give
you like a little bit of a

96
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,284
mental boost,

97
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,191
research it.

98
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,060
And as I always say,

99
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,150
if you're interested in this stuff and
we think what we sell is too expensive,

100
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,830
go online and steal the recipe,

101
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,310
steal the recipe and go buy your
stuff in bulk and save some money.

102
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,911
And if you like,

103
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,540
and I hope she,

104
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,090
I hope you do.

105
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,220
I hope it helps you.

106
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,450
You don't have to buy our stuff,

107
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,920
but if you want to buy our stuff,

108
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,390
go to Joe rogan.net.

109
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,150
Click on the link and turn the
code name rogue and get 10% off.

110
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,291
All right,

111
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,124
freaks.

112
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,740
Have we got that out of
the way through slips?

113
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,290
Isn't that Bruce Lipton's excuse me.

114
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,390
Their symptom is in the house.

115
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,033
Hit the wind.

116
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,170
I don't know when a cow,

117
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,840
she doesn't ask [inaudible]
with a serious man hair.

118
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,570
Can we get our shit together?

119
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,671
Bruce Lipton,

120
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,150
the author of the biology of belief and a,

121
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,470
we're going to learn some shit today.

122
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,130
Freaks.

123
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,480
Cause I talked to Bruce Lipton for about
30 seconds before this podcast started

124
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,310
and I already was like too anxious to get
the commercials out of the way because

125
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,831
I,

126
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,660
this is a a fascinating,

127
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:17,950
fascinating subject to me and you are a
guy who actually has like letters next

128
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,760
to your name.

129
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,110
So like people are gonna listen to you.

130
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,280
It says Phd,

131
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,930
this guy that was the
fuck he's talking about,

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,201
right?

133
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,130
It's not like when I,

134
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:24,851
if I write a book,

135
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:25,720
the biology of belief,

136
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,110
Joe,

137
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,943
Joe Rogan,

138
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,030
comedian,

139
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,141
a fear factor.

140
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:29,340
I was,

141
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,370
nobody's going to give a fuck.

142
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,150
All right,

143
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,870
but you,

144
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,321
you sir,

145
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,330
you command respect with your eyes.

146
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,540
I tell you,

147
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,060
I am the happiest guy ever because
all of this stuff was new to me.

148
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,310
I never believed in it when
I was doing my research.

149
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,400
So to find out things like,

150
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,270
like the concept of a spirit and an energy
and a and how the mind controls life.

151
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,390
When I was teaching genes
control life and it was like,

152
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,691
boy,

153
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,410
is that an error or is
that wrong out there?

154
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,370
So consciousness,

155
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,370
you believe control slides,

156
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,660
I believe consciousness actually does
control life and it's very simple to

157
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:00,494
understand it.

158
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,860
And what you really start
to find out is that,

159
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,730
uh,

160
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,350
our consciousness either enhances
us like a placebo effect or the same

161
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,450
consciousness can take away
your strength and kill you.

162
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:11,660
What,

163
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,220
which is called a no CBO effect.

164
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,330
And it's actually a name for that.

165
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,470
So it's the power of your thinking
and the thinking is who are we?

166
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,070
And,

167
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,640
and we've been programmed to believe
that we're frail and vulnerable,

168
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,061
you know,

169
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,360
like all kinds of things are out
there to get us and we have to protect

170
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,141
ourselves and all that.

171
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:31,700
And it's like this is a totally insane
because we are so powerful that we even

172
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:32,534
don't believe it.

173
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,370
It's just,

174
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,460
it's just amazing things like,

175
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:34,881
okay,

176
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:37,700
you can say something simple
like walking across hot coals.

177
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,271
Okay.

178
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,300
It's like you can walk across hot
coals if you believe you can do it,

179
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,550
but you can't do it if you don't believe.

180
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,470
You can't walk across the coals.

181
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,810
And so belief comes into it.

182
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,541
Or Joe,

183
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:47,680
you,

184
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,840
I mean you're a big health
guy and all this stuff.

185
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,411
So I asked you,

186
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:50,960
can you,

187
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,460
if we go out here in the parking lot,

188
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,600
can you lift up a car?

189
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,700
I mean you got a lot of
training and stuff like that,

190
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,050
but you think you could lift up a car?

191
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,620
No.

192
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,921
Well,

193
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,754
interesting.

194
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,300
So many articles from around the world
about women lifting up cars when a,

195
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,570
when a baby or their child
is trapped under the car.

196
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,550
And this is all true cause stories too,

197
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,630
but I never really googled them.

198
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:08,881
No,

199
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:09,080
no,

200
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,261
they're,

201
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,720
they're absolutely true in
those large numbers of them.

202
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,770
And what does that mean?

203
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,000
It means like this untrained unathletic
woman could go out there and lift up the

204
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,750
car.

205
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:17,940
Ah,

206
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,261
okay.

207
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,041
And so that's like,

208
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,671
that's pretty neat.

209
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,200
But here's when I really think is cool.

210
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,310
Um,

211
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,550
down south there,

212
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,840
those baptist fundamentalist
kind of people that get into,

213
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,370
in a religious ecstasy state,

214
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,390
and they do what they called
testify that God protects them.

215
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,880
So they believe that God protects them.

216
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,990
And so what did they do?

217
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,100
They do strange crap,

218
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,570
like a handle snakes like
rattlesnakes and copperhead snakes.

219
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,340
There's they Candler's so
they get bitten by the snakes.

220
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,730
Nothing happens when they're in
this and the state of a belief.

221
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
But that's,

222
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,860
those are the light waste.

223
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,040
The serious ones.

224
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:55,041
So the ones they drink strychnine
in toxic doses to demonstrate,

225
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,030
to show the proof that God protects them.

226
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,400
They drink this absolute poison,

227
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,930
no harmful effects.

228
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,770
Wow.

229
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,760
No harmful effects,

230
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,151
Brian.

231
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,050
And it's the most,

232
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,093
I mean,

233
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,810
they're insane looking
people when they do it,

234
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,630
but the fact is they drink poison,

235
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,830
but it's in the belief system.

236
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,860
So this is all stuff
that's been documented,

237
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,001
right?

238
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:16,790
Yeah.

239
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,830
Your initial background as a scientist,

240
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:19,880
what did you uh,

241
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,940
I trained as a cell biologist and um,

242
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,863
um,

243
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,780
I started doing cell cultures back.

244
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,860
I'm stem cells in 1967 and I was like,

245
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,950
that's so long ago.

246
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,040
That was 40 some years ago.

247
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,670
Right?

248
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,480
And the thing was there
was just a handful of us,

249
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,800
the entire world working
on stem cells at that time.

250
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,220
And the results from those studies were
so completely different than what I was

251
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,380
teaching medical students
about how life worked,

252
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,640
about how genes control life,

253
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,000
because it showed the genes
did not control the biology.

254
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,530
Genes do not control it.

255
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,890
The control is how a cell or an
organism responds to the environment.

256
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,140
So it's a,

257
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,431
the,

258
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:06,020
an organism becomes a compliment
to their environment and you say,

259
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,111
well,

260
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,801
why is that important?

261
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:06,951
I said,

262
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:07,310
well,

263
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,490
if you'll live in a crappy environment
than your biology becomes crap.

264
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,470
And the issue is,

265
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,640
is that the real environment,

266
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,110
it's actually the mental environment.

267
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,170
So that's why it's so important
and everyone sort of knows this,

268
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,320
but it's so important to surround
yourself with positive people and not be

269
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,740
around a bunch of energy vampires because
there's people that are caught in a

270
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,910
downward spiral.

271
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,110
And if you were with them,

272
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,690
they're gravity can bring
you into a shitty place.

273
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,860
That's an absolute truth.

274
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,860
That's a quantum quantum
physics aspect to or who we are.

275
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,790
There's more than this
physical reality and,

276
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,510
and an energy is actually who we are.

277
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,810
So the flow of energy
determines how we are.

278
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,771
Isn't it funny though,

279
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,630
that that idea so easily dismissed?

280
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,090
It seems like such a woowoo idea.

281
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh,

282
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,100
I can tell you why.

283
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,990
It's more scared of it.

284
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,650
It's money.

285
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:51,771
Well,

286
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,810
it's also fear that,

287
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,331
well,

288
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:53,901
it might be fear,

289
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,711
but I'll tell you more.

290
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,544
So is

291
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,560
very simply the science that we have in
the textbooks today is more or less a

292
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,570
product of paid advertising
from the pharmaceutical
company and the significance

293
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,400
why mean that is the,

294
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,150
let me ask you questions all day.

295
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,980
Obviously.

296
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,370
Are you aware there's much more effective
ways to create energy besides burning

297
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,204
fossil fuel?

298
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,261
I mean,

299
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:16,441
you know,

300
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm not really aware of all
the options that there are,

301
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,411
aren't there?

302
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:19,681
I mean,

303
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:19,950
I'm,

304
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,060
I mean solar and all
this other kind of stuff.

305
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,381
I mean,

306
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,071
I know about solar,

307
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,550
but I don't know if so unnecessarily
generate enough energy to replace it right

308
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,150
now.

309
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,800
Well,

310
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,770
that's our technology.

311
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,604
But the question is,

312
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,830
we have all this new
technology and the question is,

313
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,750
why are we still so preoccupied
with burning fossil fuel?

314
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:39,751
Because it's not in the interest of the
petroleum company to support anything

315
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,420
that would take away the
sale of their product.

316
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,171
They sell oil.

317
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,004
What good is it?

318
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,963
And then I say,

319
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,500
now here's the exact parallel.

320
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,930
It's like you can heal
yourself with energy.

321
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,670
You can heal yourself with thoughts,

322
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:54,600
you can hear yourself with
the right vibrational food
and everything else around

323
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,160
it by dealing with the vibration park.

324
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,001
So he said,

325
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,690
well,

326
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,400
we know this for a thousand years.

327
00:09:59,401 --> 00:09:59,641
Why?

328
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,620
Why isn't it recognized by the world?

329
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,480
And the answer is it's not in the
interest of an industry that sells drugs.

330
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,570
Because if I can heal you for free,

331
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,190
then what are you going to
do with the drug market?

332
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,301
Do you think that's,

333
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:12,541
I mean,

334
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,690
do you think they're suppressing it or
do you think there's just never been any

335
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:19,800
evidence demonstrated that I'm like I
on any sort of a large measurable level

336
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,520
where there's,

337
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,720
there's quite a bit of evidence,

338
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,350
but it's really evidence that's not
talked about in the public and it's very

339
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,184
difficult.

340
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,851
I'm sure there is,

341
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,280
but what I mean is it's not like it's
in their face and they're trying to

342
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,001
suppress it.

343
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,571
You know what I mean?

344
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:31,380
I think it's just,

345
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,900
I think a lot of people are
just ignorant to the idea.

346
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,440
I don't know if it's being suppressed
as much as just a lot of people really

347
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:38,880
don't know how things work.

348
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,780
I absolutely,

349
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,711
absolutely,

350
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:43,470
but then the limitation of
what are we being program with,

351
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:43,741
you know,

352
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:47,520
what are the beliefs that you wrote
blues did you get program with about your

353
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,930
life for very simple reason.

354
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,980
If you get down to the
simple understanding how your
mind controls your genetics

355
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,870
and your biological behavior,

356
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,010
then you have to recognize them.

357
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,370
The question is what programs
have you been programmed with?

358
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,680
Because those are the programs
are going to shape your life.

359
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,120
And the belief system is,

360
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,750
Ken,

361
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,220
can you drink strychnine Joe,

362
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:05,730
yes or no?

363
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,563
The answer is,

364
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,590
well,

365
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,160
if you don't believe you
can then don't go there.

366
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:11,521
You now,

367
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:14,550
or if you have any doubts
at all the belief like that,

368
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:15,361
it's like pregnancy.

369
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,790
You either believe it
or you don't believe it,

370
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,451
but there's no like,

371
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:18,661
Geez,

372
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm,

373
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,110
I almost really believed
this is not gonna work.

374
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,070
So you think it's fascinating that a
lot of the people that are pushing that

375
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,420
belief are actually,

376
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,760
they actually are caught
up in it themselves.

377
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,770
You know the people that
are suppressing information.

378
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,040
Yes.

379
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,860
People that are,

380
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,520
you know,

381
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,110
they,

382
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,580
even if they're aware of it,

383
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,450
yes.

384
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:36,790
You know,

385
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,621
they're actually,

386
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,750
they're doing it to themselves as well.

387
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,250
That's the,

388
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,620
that's why you can't say there's
a conspiracy at some level.

389
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:43,800
No,

390
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,633
that's not a conspiracy.

391
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,890
There's self interest.

392
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:47,701
This is my interest.

393
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:48,421
This is my belief.

394
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:48,750
Look,

395
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,840
there are a lot of religious people out
there trying to shape my behavior today.

396
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,190
Right,

397
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,560
right.

398
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,830
It's like that's their behavior.

399
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,310
You know,

400
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,720
they're trying to shape my behavior.

401
00:11:55,721 --> 00:12:00,070
Whether it's sort of like the science
people that tell their science or almost

402
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,570
like religious people that say this
is our story and the fact that shit,

403
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,130
but there's a bigger story
than what you saw in the book.

404
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,650
And so was it just that
it's not measurable?

405
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:08,981
I mean,

406
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:09,101
well,

407
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:09,281
no,

408
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:09,851
it's measurable.

409
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,540
I can show you a hundreds of papers on
all kinds of things about electromagnetic

410
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,541
fields that vibrational fields can do
control every function of the cell.

411
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,830
They can control the synthesis of DNA.

412
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,080
It can control the cell division.

413
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,260
It can control what we call
differentiation where uh,

414
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,050
uh,

415
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,280
uh,

416
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,980
like an embryonic cell becomes
a muscle cell or a bone cell.

417
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,500
It controls the organization of cells.

418
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,870
There are demonstrations
of this all the time,

419
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,670
vibrational frequencies with the exact
frequencies cause cells to have very

420
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,340
specific biological responses.

421
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,080
So if it was up to you,

422
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:47,790
would this be something that they would
be teaching kids in school like on a,

423
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,910
on a regular basis to try to
explain absolutely very early age,

424
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:55,810
how important it is to think in a positive
way and absolutely in a positive way.

425
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,700
And surround yourself
with positive people,

426
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,830
that it's not just a
luxury that you're looking,

427
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,121
oh,

428
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,450
I just want to settle down.

429
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,284
It'd be around,

430
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,580
you know where it's quiet.

431
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,450
It's not that,

432
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,270
but it actually is like you
can establish your environment.

433
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,180
You have comes down with simple point.

434
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,870
We are creating this life that's
in front of us at this moment.

435
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,750
This is a creation and a,

436
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,000
and this is a nature of
what quantum mechanics,

437
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,190
quantum mechanics came up with
a very simple problem and say,

438
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:22,690
wait,

439
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,210
is the fundamental particle
that makes an atom?

440
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,670
Is it physical or is it vibrational?

441
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,840
Is it a particle like,

442
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,350
like a piece of something or
is it just a vibrational field?

443
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,990
And the answer came out
because it can't be both.

444
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,520
One solid.

445
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,810
The other one's an energy wave,

446
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,040
right?

447
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,590
It's like,

448
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,450
and yet it comes out when
they did the experiment.

449
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,290
If you think it's a particle and you
design the experiment to see a particle,

450
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,340
you see a particle.

451
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,750
If you think it's a wave and design
an experiment to determine a wave,

452
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,550
then you see it as a wave.

453
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,511
And the question of,

454
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,020
well,

455
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,300
how can it be a wave and a particle?

456
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:55,631
They there,

457
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,464
they're there.

458
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,210
You can't be both at the same time.

459
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,730
The conclusion of the physicists,

460
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,020
and this is fundamental,

461
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,660
is that it's The observer
that determining that reality.

462
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,400
It's the way you look at it.

463
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,050
If you look at it like an old Fart,

464
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,620
does that go?

465
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Does it go [inaudible] and you know
ultimately attacks being so we created,

466
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
well this is a co participation,

467
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,710
so we're really,

468
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,820
we're creating,

469
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,210
but we're also participating in the
creation so it's not a single van.

470
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,041
I maybe there's a single vendor.

471
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:26,560
I say,

472
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:26,831
okay,

473
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,071
and hey,

474
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,490
let's send all this roar and crap and
let's clean up this place that's have a

475
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,324
good time.

476
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,920
My voice is a single voice.

477
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,480
Obviously just didn't change anything.

478
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,750
But if you get enough
voices say the same thing,

479
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,000
then what you're doing is
you're amplifying the field.

480
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,340
The more people that are in
tune with the same voice,

481
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,020
it becomes a crowd response.

482
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:44,530
It's like,

483
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,920
even like in Soccer Games in
Europe when they get crazy,

484
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,111
they,

485
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,890
they always break out into these
big fights and stuff like that.

486
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,460
A pacifist

487
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,450
sitting in the middle,

488
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,313
you know,

489
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,410
what are those vegan pacifist
guys sitting in the middle?

490
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,900
If there's a fight that
breaks out all around,

491
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,410
they'll be caught up in the energy of
a crowd response and it won't be their

492
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,010
consciousness that's controlling them.

493
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,770
Then now they're just caught in the field
and they will pick up a chair in club,

494
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,690
somebody over the head with it.

495
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,550
Like anybody else in that field.

496
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:17,120
Even though at that moment when they
were being conscious they were pacifists.

497
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,320
But once they got caught in the field,

498
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,700
that became part of the field.

499
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,830
So the issue is what field are we living
in right now in the field is in a state

500
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,664
of flux.

501
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,640
And this is really critical,

502
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,510
uh,

503
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,510
because your audience is so involved
with this upheaval that's happening right

504
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,231
now,

505
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,540
changing the fields that,

506
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:38,931
uh,

507
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:43,931
there's an evolution going on and it
really is going to be a fine subdivision

508
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:47,330
between like the forties and
unders and the people over 40.

509
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,280
I think you're going to be
a separation at some point,

510
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,370
except there are a lot of
wonderful old people like myself,

511
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:53,204
old people.

512
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,960
Uh,

513
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,950
do you think the Internet has anything
to do with the Internet age group at the

514
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,281
Internet?

515
00:15:58,281 --> 00:15:59,780
The Internet has everything to do with it.

516
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,750
The Internet is the nervous
system of a new service,

517
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,060
a new organism.

518
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,980
And what's evolving?

519
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:07,850
Here's what's important.

520
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,171
Sometimes we think,

521
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:09,291
oh,

522
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,370
when humans evolve with it,

523
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:10,491
oh,

524
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,480
how are they going to be involved with,

525
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:12,710
are going to get bigger heads?

526
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,220
And,

527
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,840
uh,

528
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,151
you know,

529
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:14,961
change their bodies.

530
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,201
It's like,

531
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:15,321
no,

532
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:15,470
no.

533
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:15,980
Look,

534
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,260
the human evolved that's done.

535
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,580
Cockroach evolved.

536
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,410
The cockroach involves
600 million years ago.

537
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,000
It's still the same cockroach.

538
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:23,840
The human evolve.

539
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,250
It's going to stay the same human.

540
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,800
The evolution is not of the human.

541
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,650
It's of the community of humans.

542
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,130
Each human is the equivalent of a cell
in the body of a super organism called

543
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:38,864
humanity.

544
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,730
The evolution is the evolution,

545
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,050
Manny.

546
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,410
That's why the Arab spring,

547
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,410
that's why the breakdown of
politics all over the place.

548
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,610
That's why the thing falling apart.

549
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,790
People all over the world are recognizing
we're all people and the same thing

550
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:57,101
called humanity and and so we have to
break free of the limitations that we have

551
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,640
been programmed with.

552
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,520
And in that breaking free,

553
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,680
which means changing the thoughts,

554
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,820
changing the beliefs,

555
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,500
getting into a new understanding,

556
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,560
we are on the threshold of a,

557
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,360
an evolution that's so amazing.

558
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,210
And what's interesting is that people
look around right now they're scared to

559
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,030
death and I'd go and you don't understand,

560
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,090
this is the most important stage.

561
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,830
The simple reason is this.

562
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,520
The institutions that have
provided for us up to this point,

563
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,570
they help get us here.

564
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,160
They were important for a period of time.

565
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,850
Uh,

566
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,683
economics,

567
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,740
education,

568
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,833
healthcare,

569
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,840
politics,

570
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,763
religion,

571
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,920
all those things were helpful to
get to this to a certain point.

572
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,250
Now they're destructive because their
belief systems and having us destroy the

573
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:43,670
planet.

574
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,503
So a as a,

575
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,550
this is a simple fact that this is not,

576
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,570
I'm just saying,

577
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,830
it is a fact.

578
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,050
Science has recognized we are deep into
the six mass extinction of life on this

579
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:56,850
planet.

580
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,820
Five times in the history of this planet,

581
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,550
life got essentially wiped out
and started all over again.

582
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Those are called mass extinctions such
as like a common or asteroid hitting the

583
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:08,941
planet,

584
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:09,930
destroying the environment,

585
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:10,561
wiping out life.

586
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,460
Start all over again.

587
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,930
This is the sixth one.

588
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,771
This is a fact.

589
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:18,210
We are losing species of organisms faster
than recorded history or unrecorded

590
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:18,511
history.

591
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,470
As we know right now,

592
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,670
meaning we're accelerating the
loss of the biosphere right now.

593
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,080
Why is this important?

594
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,390
Is because we're part of that extinction.

595
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,790
And now here's the neat part about it.

596
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,800
The source of our extinction
is human behavior.

597
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,870
Simple as that.

598
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,200
We are so undermining the environment.

599
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,651
We,

600
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:40,800
uh,

601
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,380
we were created from the environment.

602
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,861
You know,

603
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,940
religious people will tell you,

604
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:45,460
oh,

605
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,810
oh,

606
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,530
they created an environment and they
stuck humans on top genesis kind of story.

607
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,581
Scientists will say,

608
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,330
oh,

609
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,780
it was just an accident of
genetics mutations that were here.

610
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,614
And it's like,

611
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,453
no,

612
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,730
every organism was an integral part
of the evolution of a larger con.

613
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,840
The biosphere is the living organism.

614
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:04,674
We're part of it.

615
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,993
Well,

616
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,400
if we're part of the biosphere
were derived from the biosphere,

617
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,080
then this is a simple logical question.

618
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,330
If you destroy the biosphere,

619
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:11,881
what they all are,

620
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:15,360
your chances of surviving
and the answer's no.

621
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,580
And that's exactly what
science has shown us,

622
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:20,620
that we are now have passive,

623
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:21,630
a very critical point.

624
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,800
And destroying the environment,

625
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,540
threatening our own survival.

626
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,640
I mean the simple fact that scary,

627
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:27,474
if you think about it,

628
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,580
within 30 years there will be no fish in
the ocean at the rate we're going right

629
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:32,820
now.

630
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,920
It's like that's almost
like science fiction story.

631
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,760
It's crazy.

632
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,270
Yeah.

633
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,920
So why is it important?

634
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,230
Because the conclusion as
human behavior is causing it.

635
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,820
And Einstein,

636
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,960
he had a great saying.

637
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,301
I said,

638
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:43,860
I said,

639
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,860
you can't solve the problems with the
same thinking that created the problems of

640
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,850
the institutions that we are living
by today or the cause of the problem.

641
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,480
So the crash of the institutions is
unnecessary step in the evolution because

642
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,240
you can't build a sustainable world.

643
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,260
And those belief systems,

644
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,094
they're the,

645
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,700
they're the systems that are causing the
destruction of the environment that we

646
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,001
live in.

647
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,834
Now.

648
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,740
Do you ever consider the
possibility that all behavior,

649
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,390
all life on this planet is,

650
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:20,391
is natural and that there's a reason
why people are so selfish and so

651
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:25,731
destructive and yet so also so
ambitious and so prone to technological,

652
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,360
uh,

653
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,810
you know,

654
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,980
creations and,

655
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,401
and,

656
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:29,611
and,

657
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:29,831
and,

658
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:30,664
and pushing,

659
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,250
pushing things forward.

660
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,330
It's almost like,

661
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,700
it's almost like that's
what we're supposed to do.

662
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,780
It's a strange thing.

663
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:41,430
It's almost like to be as ambitious as
people are to create for technological

664
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,710
innovation is like the,

665
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,360
there today,

666
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,621
they're,

667
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,720
they're announcing that they may have
spotted the Higgs Boston park or Boson

668
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,400
particle.

669
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,240
They may have spot it.

670
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:49,631
They don't know.

671
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,640
They have like evidence
they have to go over.

672
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,840
I mean this is,

673
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,040
this is right at the,

674
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,620
at the peak of human innovation.

675
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,454
It seems like,

676
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,020
it almost seems like we have to be
this fucked up to do it this way.

677
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:02,651
You know?

678
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,120
And this is what we're driven to do.

679
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,631
Do you,

680
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:08,110
is that possible that it seems like
every other animal has like a natural

681
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,280
pattern of behavior.

682
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,690
Is it possible that the human animals
natural pattern of behavior is to almost

683
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,630
like give birth to some
technological creation?

684
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,080
Okay.

685
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,430
There's two parts to that question.

686
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,840
The answer to technological innovation
is indeed the evolution process itself.

687
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,920
Think about this.

688
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,700
Um,

689
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,210
we have a tendency when we're humans to
look down at everything less than human

690
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,440
is not being as intelligent.

691
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,220
Right?

692
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,911
And then I'm going to tell you,

693
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,610
you're made out of 50
trillion cells like Amoebas,

694
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,810
50 trillion Amoebas,

695
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:35,740
living in a community.

696
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,100
They created a technology
to make a human body.

697
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,770
They created technology.

698
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,990
We named as did the Amoebas,

699
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:44,400
did they?

700
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,450
They created the structure for us.

701
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,330
The body was created by,

702
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,540
by the cells.

703
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,200
Okay?

704
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,550
We can't even reproduce the technology
of the cells because they're far greater

705
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:55,440
efficient than we are.

706
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:55,931
Matter of fact,

707
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:59,170
that would be our direction of
evolutions is to see what they've done.

708
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,820
But why is this important?

709
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,550
Because the technology's
part of the evolution.

710
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,730
The idea of technology as
simple can we live in the,

711
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:07,380
so called,

712
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,570
you know,

713
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,530
if you want to use like a garden of Eden
that there was a garden here before we

714
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,364
destroyed it.

715
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,430
And in fact he's uh,

716
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,960
you know,

717
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,320
uh,

718
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,630
if you want to live in the garden
without destroying the garden,

719
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:21,070
technology's a requirement because it
reduces the footprint so we can live here

720
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:23,740
without devastating the
environment around us.

721
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:24,041
Okay.

722
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,530
So that technology is a built in drive.

723
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,980
Is the behavior that we're
expressing during this part of that?

724
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,810
No,

725
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,830
the behaviors programmed.

726
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,190
What you're talking about is the
manifestation of Darwinian theory as a

727
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,390
scientific fact,

728
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,373
which it isn't,

729
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,220
but it,

730
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,430
but what's the base is theory says
life is a struggle for survival with a

731
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,930
competition for fitness.

732
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,840
And what does it mean is that every day
you go out there and struggle a beat?

733
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,351
The other guy.

734
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:47,561
Why?

735
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:51,790
Because the co this theory says if
you don't struggle with the other guy,

736
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,750
they'll be you.

737
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,250
So you have to beat them first.

738
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:55,084
And that's,

739
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,460
we've been playing that
game for since Darwin.

740
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:57,971
Right.

741
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,440
And that's the competition game.

742
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,900
That's the competition
game and the garden was,

743
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,770
if you think about it,

744
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:04,390
a garden doesn't survive by competition.

745
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,760
The garden a supervised by cooperation.

746
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,811
As a matter of fact,

747
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,020
that's what the evolution is all about.

748
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,840
Cooperation in the biosphere and we're
the most uncooperative life form in the

749
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,170
garden.

750
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,310
Isn't the argument to that,

751
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,500
that the competition is
what breeds the innovation?

752
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,293
Um,

753
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,560
well that's why I said that I don't
know and I don't want to say yes or no,

754
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,170
but I will say this,

755
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,120
that there was a good reason for living
this way to a certain point because it

756
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:32,350
got us to a certain point,

757
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,070
right?

758
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,220
But continuing that process is
where the problem comes from.

759
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,210
You see that that is the,

760
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:41,920
the recognition of that is why the whole
human race seems to be like putting the

761
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,530
brakes right now on this
conventional culture,

762
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,260
putting the brakes and this can decide
society that we've accepted up to this

763
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:48,890
point.

764
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,750
It doesn't seem like people
won't accept it anymore.

765
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,040
It seems like people were sustainable.

766
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,311
Yeah,

767
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:52,551
they're,

768
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,070
they're seeing that it's ridiculous and
they're seeing that our leaders aren't

769
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:55,851
really leading us.

770
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,910
And I seen that everyone seems to be
bought and paid off and everyone's hitting

771
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,600
the brakes.

772
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,171
Everyone's going,

773
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:00,531
stop,

774
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,364
stop this thing.

775
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,061
Stop it.

776
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:02,480
Stop it.

777
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,870
Stop it.

778
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,470
Yeah.

779
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,950
Because it's time to build something
that that takes into consideration.

780
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,790
Not the,

781
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,440
the few that possesses the power.

782
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,573
You see,

783
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:10,971
look,

784
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,804
we can talk about,

785
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,420
when I talk about the biology and the
nature of the mind controlling the

786
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,650
behavior in the biology,

787
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,310
women lifting,

788
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,611
cars,

789
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:16,881
drinking,

790
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:17,391
strychnine,

791
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,590
the powerful nature you are.

792
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,480
Do we know what actually physically,

793
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,800
when is it adrenaline?

794
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,250
What is the actual physical thing that
happens to their body that allows them to

795
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,180
do amazing things?

796
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,860
It's exactly the same thing that,

797
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,130
uh,

798
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,180
the strychnine drinker has absolute
belief that there's no Mike child is under

799
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:32,510
this car.

800
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,040
There's not even a concept though.

801
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,270
Can I lift the car?

802
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,820
She never asked that in her head it was,

803
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:40,700
I'm lifting the car because
my babies under the car.

804
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,590
It's absolute belief is the same
as walking across the hot coals,

805
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,820
the drinking district,

806
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,320
nine lifting the car,

807
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,130
the things you have that
absolute belief in you.

808
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,250
You can do powerful things beyond
anything except that's where I said,

809
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:56,480
go back and look at our programming.

810
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:00,020
Our programming is we've been programmed
to perceive ourselves as frail and

811
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:00,854
vulnerable,

812
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,460
in fact,

813
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,220
were farthest thing from
that except for this,

814
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,730
and this is an interesting story about
the upheaval and that goes like this.

815
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,350
You look at the world and you say,

816
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:09,920
look,

817
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,670
am I powerful?

818
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:10,911
Maybe.

819
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:11,181
Okay,

820
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:12,050
I'm not so powerful.

821
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,351
Boy,

822
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:15,170
there's some very powerful people
over there and then you may say,

823
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:15,291
well,

824
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,330
how did they get to be so powerful?

825
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,240
This is the joke and it's on us.

826
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,060
They didn't get more powerful.

827
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,250
They just took away the power from us.

828
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,520
We've been programmed to be disempowered
and the fact is that's what you think.

829
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,930
This has been a conscious thing.

830
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,790
It's been propagated.

831
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,360
Look,

832
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
but I'll give you,

833
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,371
here's a fact.

834
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,270
Think about it this way.

835
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,810
The Jesuits have boasted for 500 years.

836
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:42,201
They said,

837
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:46,250
give me a child until it's six or seven
and it will belong to the church for the

838
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,360
rest of their lives.

839
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,680
What did they know?

840
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,560
They already knew that if I get
the first six years of programming,

841
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,540
I own your life.

842
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,850
They knew that they boasted about it.

843
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,780
And why is that important?

844
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,670
Well,

845
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,310
it's,

846
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,580
you think that's a minor thing that just
would have slipped away in history that

847
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:04,960
you can control the population
by programming the first
six years of their lives

848
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,730
to think is,

849
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,380
are you kidding me?

850
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,950
That's,

851
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,410
that's fundamental to
the leadership of the,

852
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,870
of whoever's in leadership capacity.

853
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,500
Uh,

854
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,890
and,

855
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,210
and if you want to reference,

856
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,021
think about this.

857
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,070
There's a book rich Dad,

858
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:16,904
Poor Dad,

859
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,650
and this is a book about power,

860
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:19,850
empowerment and disempowerment.

861
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:20,684
And what's the point?

862
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,040
People from poor families will grow up
and remain poor and people from rich

863
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,470
families will generally
grow up and remain rich.

864
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,790
Is it genetics?

865
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,450
No,

866
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,300
it's the programming that the
rich give to their family,

867
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,900
which is completely the
opposite of the programming.

868
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,800
The poor give to their family.

869
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,430
It's not the individual,

870
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,890
it's not the person.

871
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,600
It's the programming,

872
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,550
and this is not new.

873
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,100
This is 500 years of boasting.

874
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,791
That fact.

875
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,420
Not much.

876
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,661
I mean,

877
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:49,620
they didn't keep it a secret.

878
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:50,454
They actually said this,

879
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,140
you just give me the kit for six years,

880
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,240
belongs to the church
for the rest of its life.

881
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,074
They knew.

882
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,830
It's kind of like this whole,

883
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,790
this whole theory.

884
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,781
I'm sorry,

885
00:26:58,781 --> 00:26:59,680
I'm gonna interrupt you real quick.

886
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:00,710
It's really fucking loud.

887
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:01,271
None other room,

888
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:01,481
man.

889
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:02,261
It's picking up on this.

890
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:04,640
Mike and Matt stirred.

891
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,410
That's,

892
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,280
I mean it sounds fine,

893
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,050
but you don't hear it.

894
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,040
It wasn't a distracting.

895
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,620
It's distracting me.

896
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,110
Turned on in your headphones or
your headphones are really loud.

897
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,443
How do we do that?

898
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,970
But I follow the string.

899
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,560
The whole thing with it
kind of follows the uh,

900
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,040
uh,

901
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,210
fish and the fish tank or like
how big is the fish tank and how,

902
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,130
how big the fish is going to grow almost.

903
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,610
It's like kind of the same thing.

904
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,001
You know,

905
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:30,870
like we're like in some ways like it,

906
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,860
the fish nose is a environment,

907
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,690
so it's going to grow.

908
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,410
I mean,

909
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,030
does it have anything
to do with that at all?

910
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,190
It was basically they know their world
and they read their world and we're

911
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,650
having problems recognizing our own world.

912
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:44,821
We,

913
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:47,170
we've been programmed not to
be sensitive to the experience.

914
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:48,730
That's why indigenous people,

915
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,030
the Indians,

916
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,120
so the aborigines,

917
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,880
all these people,

918
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,151
man,

919
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:53,590
they can tell you what the water is.

920
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,900
Even if you can't see it,

921
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,670
it's under the ground that they can
tell you what's going on in their world

922
00:27:57,671 --> 00:27:58,480
around them.

923
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,160
We are so disconnected.

924
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:01,090
We have no idea,

925
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,230
but how did this happen?

926
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:05,500
Do you think that this is a natural
occurrence is you think that this was that

927
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:10,210
this all happened because this is
the way we would be so innovative.

928
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:11,980
This is the way we would push forward,

929
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,130
push forward regardless of the health and
safety of each other and of the planet

930
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:18,244
itself.

931
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,570
Yeah.

932
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,120
It's an unfortunate situation
because you have to go back and say,

933
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:22,510
when did,

934
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,240
when did this group of individuals,

935
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,920
which is another large group at that
decided at one point they were helping us

936
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:30,880
as parents.

937
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm helping you guys.

938
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,870
I know more

939
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,950
than you so I'm going to,

940
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,630
I'm going to help you become better.

941
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,553
Okay,

942
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,710
but there is a point where
maybe their knowledge is not,

943
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,850
it's so limited that they,

944
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,470
they're thinking inside the box when
the knowledge is outside the box.

945
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,500
So the question is is it a conspiracy
because they want to control this.

946
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,540
There was a conspiracy not as such,

947
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,250
but like a parent saying,

948
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,960
look that people don't know
what the hell they're doing.

949
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:54,771
We got to help them.

950
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:56,240
We've got to guide them and all that.

951
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,060
It's a tossup.

952
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,510
Was this conspiracy or helping?

953
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,320
I have no,

954
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,120
you know all ideas this they're
involved with either either of those two

955
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:05,481
reasons.

956
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:10,481
They are the problem that we have right
now because their thinking is not up to

957
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,600
the current awareness
of science and you said,

958
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,840
well why is that relevant?

959
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,861
The answer is simple.

960
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,720
It's like the world we live in,

961
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,810
cs truth based on weather
science says it's true or not.

962
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,711
This is true.

963
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:22,950
Oh Science said over Yo,

964
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:23,784
it must be true.

965
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,350
Well,

966
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,160
if the science is limited
then the knowledge is power,

967
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,750
lack of knowledge,

968
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,650
lack of power.

969
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,380
If the science is not fully knowledgeable
and limits it to that little narrow

970
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,214
knowledge,

971
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,190
then we've limited our power and the fact
is there's new science that undermines

972
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:43,690
all this stuff that you learned in school.

973
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,900
All this stuff I taught in medical school
that sciences in the last 15 years,

974
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:54,091
man is a revolution and the
revolution is the rebels in the front.

975
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,611
The the,

976
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:57,880
the old guard is still stolen.

977
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:01,000
The back where the old textbooks
with outdated information,

978
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,290
it's totally outdated.

979
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,010
Does it become an ego issue at that point
with people are teaching one thing for

980
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,350
their whole life and then
they don't want to change?

981
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,490
I don't know if it's,

982
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:10,324
it's a habit.

983
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,110
It's a habit.

984
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,891
This is the way I know.

985
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:12,970
It's the only way I know what I mean.

986
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,151
Look,

987
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,980
there was a time before quantum physics,

988
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,510
the only physicists were the,

989
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,680
the Newtonian physicists,

990
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:22,420
the ones that only saw the mechanical
material world as real and didn't consider

991
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,040
the invisible realm as anything.

992
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,730
Quantum physics comes in and says it's
the invisible realm that is actually

993
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,740
shaping the physical realm.

994
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,090
Energy shapes matter.

995
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,410
And it's like,

996
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:32,561
well,

997
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,270
if you're a Newtonian physicists,

998
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:37,640
up until let's say 1924 and 90 25 the,

999
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,680
the belief change is 1924 year teaching
the world is a mechanical machine.

1000
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,030
You've done this for 30 years,

1001
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,140
and then all of a sudden,

1002
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:44,960
a few minutes later he say,

1003
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,131
no,

1004
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:45,580
guess what?

1005
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,413
All that's wrong.

1006
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,650
It's all completely different.

1007
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,460
And it's like you've spent
your whole career doing this.

1008
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,670
What are you going to change tonight?

1009
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,893
It's not going to happen.

1010
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,880
So what do those guys do?

1011
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,770
They just put the perhaps on everything.

1012
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:56,941
They,

1013
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:57,220
they,

1014
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,270
they squash it down.

1015
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,320
They keep it repressed.

1016
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,860
And it's interesting
because I'm so disgusting.

1017
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,570
Oh,

1018
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,180
Eh,

1019
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,110
there's a statement,

1020
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,060
there's a statement that the answers
that it says progress in science is

1021
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,980
measured tombstone by tombstone.

1022
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,360
Wow.

1023
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,910
Meaning you have to offer that die
before you can get the new thought.

1024
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,371
Amazing.

1025
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:18,730
And it's just the ego,

1026
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:19,150
right?

1027
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,871
Absolutely.

1028
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,220
And the money nor the money,

1029
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,660
the money is big.

1030
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:23,494
The money is,

1031
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,400
the money is big.

1032
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,630
Healthcare costs,

1033
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:29,800
the United States are sinking the
entire country just on the bells of that

1034
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,634
alone.

1035
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,160
And that's totally in U Maine.

1036
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,670
It's in you mane by by definition it is
and it's a business entity and medicine

1037
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,690
is a business entity.

1038
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,340
It is not a healing entity.

1039
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,630
If you got healed,

1040
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,730
the whole business would collapse.

1041
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,721
So guess what,

1042
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,630
how come with all the money and
all the technological advances,

1043
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:53,620
we're spending more money now than we've
ever done having more healthcare than

1044
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:56,500
we ever had and we have the
sickest population we ever had.

1045
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,900
This is the sickest
population we've ever had.

1046
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,330
Yeah,

1047
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,860
yeah.

1048
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,693
The population.

1049
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,100
The issue just as to any of us.

1050
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:03,790
Is that what it is?

1051
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,121
No,

1052
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,020
it's just a we're,

1053
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:05,890
we have been,

1054
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,570
we misunderstand how our lives work.

1055
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:08,290
We're think we're,

1056
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,890
we're like machines and you go to the
pharmacy guy and he puts a medicine in

1057
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,230
there and all of a sudden you've
got some new parts and it's like no,

1058
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,300
you there,

1059
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,460
there is a part like aspect of your body,

1060
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:20,230
your body's like a vehicle for sure.

1061
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,660
But the mind is the driver.

1062
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,630
So the driver has been
left out of medicine.

1063
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:28,000
All they talk about is all the
vehicles broken is you know,

1064
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,140
keep fixing the vehicles.

1065
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:30,860
Like there's a driver in there.

1066
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,520
If the drivers got some
shitty driver education,

1067
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:33,671
man,

1068
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,320
he's going to destroy the
vehicle and the answer,

1069
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,110
that's where the problem came from.

1070
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,280
So is what we're experiencing really

1071
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,270
a step in the evolution of
what we're going to become.

1072
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:44,931
And so this,

1073
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:45,764
all this,

1074
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,350
this,

1075
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,750
these problems and all this is rebellion
against the standard behavior that

1076
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,050
we've,

1077
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,883
you know,

1078
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,890
fed into for so long is all of this
like a step in an evolution to some,

1079
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,690
one of the most important steps
in the world for simple reason.

1080
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,680
If the institutions that we are living
by now have created the problem,

1081
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,440
then there's a simple understanding.

1082
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,630
You cannot build a sustainable
future on those institutions.

1083
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,550
So you think this is a consciousness dap?

1084
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:10,971
Is that what it,

1085
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:11,750
absolutely,

1086
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,710
it's a people waking up to who
they are as people stop being the,

1087
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,220
the blind sheep that are being led to
the slaughter every day by those people

1088
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,150
who know who they are.

1089
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,493
The fact is,

1090
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,760
if I program you to be
weak and ineffective,

1091
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:25,670
I program you.

1092
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,270
Yeah.

1093
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,320
Here's an interesting fact.

1094
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,360
Being black in this country
is a totally negative aspect.

1095
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:32,491
They,

1096
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:32,960
they,

1097
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,140
they took black students and
that's where I played basketball,

1098
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,060
all of this an issue about that too.

1099
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:38,411
But the,

1100
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:38,671
and the,

1101
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:41,330
and that's part of an ass
part of the problem of a,

1102
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:42,440
that's a trade off,

1103
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,040
uh,

1104
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,561
when,

1105
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:43,670
uh,

1106
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,220
when you grow up in a
threatening environment,

1107
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,181
uh,

1108
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,770
the fetus will develop,

1109
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:49,430
um,

1110
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,730
uh,

1111
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,700
bigger arms and legs and
a much better hindbrain,

1112
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,390
uh,

1113
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,210
because this is what's
necessary for defense.

1114
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,930
Wow.

1115
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,060
And if you grow up in a
very loving environment,

1116
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,340
then the goes into the forefront of Jelly.

1117
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:02,000
Man.

1118
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,670
No,

1119
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,560
I agree with that.

1120
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,560
They're always trying to
reach for their dreams.

1121
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:06,740
You know,

1122
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,880
said they have longer arms.

1123
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,980
I like Michael Irvin
actually told me this,

1124
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:15,380
I was on a plane with him once
and he was explaining to me,

1125
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:15,561
you know,

1126
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:16,161
he does,

1127
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:16,670
uh,

1128
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,031
a lot of,

1129
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:17,181
you know,

1130
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,870
he's a famous football player and
he does a lot of work with kids,

1131
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,201
you know,

1132
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:21,890
that uh,

1133
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,310
you know,

1134
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,350
grow up and have like
a lot of anger issues.

1135
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,820
And he sort of explained to me that when
you were a baby and you're growing up

1136
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,440
inside of a woman's body,

1137
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:30,711
you know,

1138
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:35,570
you're developing in a
horrible environment where
there's no father and his

1139
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:36,950
violence and as you know,

1140
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,000
crime and all this,

1141
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,950
the fetus will like,

1142
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:43,040
become like programmed to act quicker,

1143
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,570
to be more violence to me.

1144
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah.

1145
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,471
Literally.

1146
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:45,691
Yeah,

1147
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:47,310
that's exactly what the is.

1148
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,290
Try to stick them in a fucking
cubicle that this whole thing,

1149
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,310
this whole thing is so screwed that way
because then we propagate that and we

1150
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:55,461
say,

1151
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:55,970
look,

1152
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:56,151
well,

1153
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:56,391
okay,

1154
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:56,571
look,

1155
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,500
blacks are great athletes.

1156
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:57,711
I said,

1157
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:57,831
yeah,

1158
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:58,970
look where they all come from.

1159
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,050
They all come from,

1160
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,351
you know,

1161
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:00,921
essentially,

1162
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:01,101
uh,

1163
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,320
an environment that is
totally not supportive,

1164
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,580
which means biologically they have to
acquire the ability to fight to survive.

1165
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,180
So their bodies are designed
much healthier in that regard.

1166
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,220
That's pretty crazy
when you think about it.

1167
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,470
It's like nature to suppressing of the,

1168
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:15,801
you know,

1169
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:15,901
the,

1170
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,870
the black man has made the
black men stronger than,

1171
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:18,704
than the suppressor.

1172
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,340
Well,

1173
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,950
[inaudible] is a logical,

1174
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:21,420
physical,

1175
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,280
physiological sense.

1176
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:23,114
Yes.

1177
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,990
Wow.

1178
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,740
Because you have to,

1179
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,240
they have to struggle to stay alive.

1180
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,550
So they're designed to be in struggle.

1181
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,140
Is it true that shit that Jimmy the Greek
got fired for when he said that black

1182
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,670
people have been bred,

1183
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,181
you know,

1184
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:35,871
as slaves,

1185
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,100
the biggest ones they would breed
with the other biggest ones.

1186
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,730
Is that why so many black people or big
or do you believe that it's a stress and

1187
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:42,550
environment issues?

1188
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,470
An environment issue.

1189
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,190
Wow.

1190
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,380
Totally stretched and environment.

1191
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,340
And,

1192
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,760
and this is why we have to recognize
biological organisms or designed to be a

1193
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:52,290
compliment to their environment.

1194
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,990
So really like boxing promoters,

1195
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,840
they should go to like horrible
neighborhoods and scout talent.

1196
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,291
Yeah.

1197
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:58,441
Well,

1198
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,140
that's the toughest kids in a block are,

1199
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:00,974
aren't they?

1200
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,351
Yeah.

1201
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,370
So that's what you're going to find them.

1202
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,653
So yeah.

1203
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,093
Wow.

1204
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,050
That's a fascinating statement.

1205
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,820
It's fascinating to think that so much
is controlled by environment and by

1206
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,440
thinking and by energy.

1207
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,530
But we all know that we gravitate
towards those things naturally.

1208
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:16,951
You know,

1209
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:19,050
you gravitate towards good times.

1210
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,300
He gravitate towards people
that make you feel good.

1211
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:21,990
You know,

1212
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,351
your,

1213
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,750
your unconscious drive
is to seek out harmony,

1214
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,690
eh,

1215
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,730
your vibration.

1216
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,511
So first of all,

1217
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:29,100
we see ourselves as physical reality,

1218
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,680
but a physical reality is an illusion.

1219
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,530
Adams or vibrational units there,

1220
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:34,920
there was no physicality to it.

1221
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,020
So you a vibration.

1222
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,790
And the significance is when you get
other vibrations that are in harmony with

1223
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:41,941
you,

1224
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,680
that's called constructive interference.

1225
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,150
That means good vibes.

1226
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,020
When you find your itself
with other people that have
the same vibration as you,

1227
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,790
your energy gets enhanced.

1228
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,624
It's good vibes.

1229
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,230
If you find yourself in a
threatening environment,

1230
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,880
the energy gets canceled and that's
why you feel all of a sudden drained,

1231
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,660
weak.

1232
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,200
You feel very vulnerable and it's because
you're in an environment where the

1233
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:07,260
energy of the environment is
not in harmony with who you are.

1234
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,410
So organisms unconsciously will move
to environments that strengthens their

1235
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:14,184
vibration.

1236
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,150
They'll seek it out.

1237
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,210
That's so that's why we're
naturally designed to,

1238
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,100
to seek out harmony in the world.

1239
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:20,400
That's,

1240
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,233
that's our intention.

1241
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
If that's our intention,

1242
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:28,191
than why do we do so much destructive
shit because there's conscious intention,

1243
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,214
conscious mind,

1244
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,911
and this is,

1245
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:31,290
this is the big issue that we have to,

1246
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,430
that people have to understand.

1247
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,960
The mind has two parts.

1248
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,780
There's the conscious part
and the subconscious part.

1249
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,430
The conscious part is you,

1250
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,750
your personal identity.

1251
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,070
It's creative,

1252
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,810
it has your wishes and desires.

1253
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,170
The subconscious part is like
a record playback mechanism.

1254
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,310
It learns experiences,

1255
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:47,911
push the button,

1256
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,080
place experiences back.

1257
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:49,771
Okay,

1258
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:50,640
so now I say,

1259
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,061
well,

1260
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:51,810
okay,

1261
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,520
our personal drivers are conscious,

1262
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,354
wish and desire.

1263
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,280
And then I'm going to tell you a fact,

1264
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,510
and this is the freaky fact.

1265
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,930
Science has shown that we only run our
lives 5% of the time with our conscious

1266
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:04,230
mind,

1267
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,250
our creative mind,

1268
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,600
the mind with your wishes.

1269
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:08,010
And what you want out of life.

1270
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,340
95% of our life comes from
the subconscious automated
programs that play when we

1271
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,300
don't even pay attention.

1272
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:15,750
You don't.

1273
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,550
You can drive the car
without paying attention.

1274
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,810
It's an automatic program.

1275
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,180
You can do your job
without paying attention.

1276
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,410
It's an automatic program.

1277
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,640
So why is it important?

1278
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,850
Only 5% of our life
comes from what we want.

1279
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,640
95% comes from the subconscious programs.

1280
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,870
And then here's the catch.

1281
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,460
As we mentioned earlier,

1282
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the first six years you downloading
behavior from your environment and those

1283
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,080
become your fundamental programs.

1284
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,280
You Watch your parents,

1285
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:42,971
your family,

1286
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:43,930
your community,

1287
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,720
and this is why I said the
church saw that and they said,

1288
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,040
give me the first six years,

1289
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,750
whatever program I put in that six years
will become the fundamental programs in

1290
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:53,860
the subconscious mind.

1291
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,790
The operating system.

1292
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,840
That's the basic operating system in 95%
of your life is going to play from that

1293
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,500
program.

1294
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,850
So who are we?

1295
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,710
Whatever we've been programmed to be.

1296
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,940
What do you want to be?

1297
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,650
Not necessarily the program,

1298
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,250
but when you try and
exercise your conscious mind,

1299
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,330
like positive thinking,

1300
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,970
conscious mind 5% of the time,

1301
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,830
as is dealing with so much
unconscious program around,

1302
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:18,001
it's,

1303
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,210
it's thinking about the future.

1304
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,440
It's thinking about the past.

1305
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,580
It's so what do you propose?

1306
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:22,151
Do you propose?

1307
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:22,720
It may be like,

1308
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,001
oh,

1309
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:28,001
a standard of thinking be established or
a way of thinking where you teach kids

1310
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:33,571
in school how to overcome like these
subconscious thoughts and how to overcome

1311
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,680
this gospel.

1312
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,150
You can't,

1313
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,420
oh,

1314
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,070
absolutely can reprogram
these if you could,

1315
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,530
and this would be a crappy world because,

1316
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:39,801
and I say,

1317
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:39,971
well,

1318
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,110
that just like James,

1319
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:41,300
oh,

1320
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,850
you're stuck with your
programs your whole life.

1321
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:43,560
Sorry.

1322
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:43,790
No,

1323
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:43,960
no,

1324
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,141
no.

1325
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:47,950
You can change your programs and change
your life virtually instantaneously,

1326
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,830
but you have to know
what you're trying to do.

1327
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,030
And that's the whole
idea of nobody knows a,

1328
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,940
that they're even behaving from there.

1329
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,260
They're unconscious programs.

1330
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,130
They don't even believe that.

1331
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:57,371
They think,

1332
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:57,790
oh,

1333
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:57,911
oh,

1334
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,880
I'm running my life with my
intentions and my wishes.

1335
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,110
It's like what they're thinking.

1336
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,970
And I say that's 5% but I,

1337
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,290
in my lectures I give,

1338
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,460
I say to people,

1339
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:06,701
I said,

1340
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:07,300
look,

1341
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,840
I know sometime in your life
you had a very close friends,

1342
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,360
you knew your friend's behavior and you
happen to know your friend's parent.

1343
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,780
And at some point you may have seen
that your friend had some of the same

1344
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,530
behavior.

1345
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,010
So you,

1346
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,640
you volunteered,

1347
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,050
you go,

1348
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:19,811
you know bill,

1349
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:23,860
you're just like your dad and the
first guy you back away from his bill,

1350
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,450
he's going to go ballistic and say,

1351
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,120
how can you compare me to my dad?

1352
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,960
And I tell people that that's so
profound a story for what reason.

1353
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:32,794
Here it is.

1354
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,530
Everyone else can see that
bill behaves like his dad,

1355
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:37,630
the only one who doesn't see it as bill.

1356
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,390
And,

1357
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,730
and we're all bill.

1358
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,330
Meaning we play behaviors that don't even
harmonize with our wishes and desires.

1359
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,740
But when we played them,

1360
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,890
we don't see them because they're
automatic and unconscious.

1361
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,490
And then we wonder why our life
isn't going where we want it to go.

1362
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,850
And we didn't realize fundamentally
we were the ones that we're shooting

1363
00:40:57,851 --> 00:40:58,571
ourselves in the foot.

1364
00:40:58,571 --> 00:40:59,530
And the first place.

1365
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,400
And it's because we didn't understand
that the control can be controlled by the

1366
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:06,994
conscious mind.

1367
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,000
But when the conscious
mind's thinking about stuff,

1368
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,520
then the default is the subconscious.

1369
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,490
But the subconscious
program by other people.

1370
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,010
Do you think that people are
starting to realize this?

1371
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:18,461
Because you know,

1372
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:19,181
if you think about it,

1373
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,020
like on Twitter,

1374
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,570
you'll see people even like
dumb people say something,

1375
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,141
you know,

1376
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:26,920
today just going to be all smiles
and they're like Hashtag positivity,

1377
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,000
you know,

1378
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,241
you know,

1379
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,410
it's like there's the,

1380
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:29,861
you know,

1381
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,020
that wouldn't have happened in 1930.

1382
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,980
No guy would have left his house with,

1383
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:34,250
you know,

1384
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
one of those little fucking knit
caps on and shit and positivity.

1385
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:39,830
You know,

1386
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,820
they didn't think that Franklin Roosevelt
used to read the Sunday comics to the,

1387
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,420
to the,

1388
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,811
to the,

1389
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,560
on the radio to the country
and that depression on Sunday,

1390
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,520
he'd read them the comics,

1391
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:49,701
like,

1392
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:50,091
come on man,

1393
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,220
it's time to take a break and
laugh and stuff like that.

1394
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:52,831
So,

1395
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:52,920
uh,

1396
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,141
he,

1397
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:53,690
he was,

1398
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,640
he was the guy that he had the answer we
back then he said this was his motto or

1399
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,474
statement.

1400
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,840
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

1401
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,011
What did he know?

1402
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:06,800
He knew that it was the fear
that will immobilize you,

1403
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,690
not the thing you even
were thinking about.

1404
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,230
Just having the fear of
something and mobilized issue.

1405
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,910
If people have so much control,

1406
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,700
if thoughts and ideas and
consciousness has so much control,

1407
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,720
what is the,

1408
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,020
what's the cause of things
like the Great Depression?

1409
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:25,880
What's the cause of these giant
hiccups in the historical process where

1410
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,080
something terrible happens,

1411
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,630
like the Holocaust or
something along those lines?

1412
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,463
Like what is it?

1413
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,393
Is it just,

1414
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,920
is it like push and pull?

1415
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:34,191
I mean,

1416
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:34,761
is it that,

1417
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,560
is it a natural process of,

1418
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,910
of evil and good,

1419
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:41,900
constantly battling it out
so that good does evolve?

1420
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,690
I did not sin.

1421
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,520
I accomplish that,

1422
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:45,830
that,

1423
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,670
that easy to say.

1424
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,011
I have,

1425
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,140
I can't say that for sure,

1426
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:49,010
but I could tell you this.

1427
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:53,900
Every one of them by by definition is
a learning experience for the organism

1428
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:54,770
called humanity.

1429
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,900
It wasn't not for the individual man.

1430
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,190
I mean it's like you
were in the Holocaust,

1431
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:58,550
you don't know.

1432
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,430
I didn't want to participate
in a play but that,

1433
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:04,250
but what did the Holocaust
teach civilization?

1434
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,670
What did these big upheavals in
these things that are happening,

1435
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,410
it's we're supposed to be learning.

1436
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:10,341
I mean,

1437
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,930
that's what the whole
concept of humans are.

1438
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,520
We learn while the learning,

1439
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,900
if you see a pattern,

1440
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,330
you better start
responding to this pattern.

1441
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:17,780
Bro.

1442
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,340
We have learned a lot of lessons.

1443
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:20,174
I said,

1444
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,730
we've come to the end of
the way of living that way.

1445
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,500
That's what we led to.

1446
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,720
We were through a simple point.

1447
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,880
You Take Darwinian theory and you
make politics out of Darwinian theory.

1448
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,320
That's Nazi Germany.

1449
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,310
That was Nazi Germany was science
right to the line just said,

1450
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:37,671
hey,

1451
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:39,680
there's a master race
and all the other ones,

1452
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:40,700
the genes are no good.

1453
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,534
Get rid of them.

1454
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,510
And they were cleaning out the
population according to Darwinian theory.

1455
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,390
That was science
politicized at that point.

1456
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,200
And now it's uh,

1457
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,590
like I had to tell you,

1458
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:55,520
but I think a pharmaceutical company is
still got its roots back in that time

1459
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:56,270
period.

1460
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,740
It's a manipulation of people.

1461
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,330
The drugs are toxic.

1462
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,131
I love to,

1463
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,020
I love this is a fact that it's fun.

1464
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:03,854
A fun fact,

1465
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,843
fun fact.

1466
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:11,050
The third leading cause of death in
the United States as recognized by the

1467
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,900
American Medical Association
is medicine itself.

1468
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,030
I attra genic illnesses.

1469
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,770
What they give a Latin term to it.

1470
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,870
It is the third leading cause of death.

1471
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:22,820
According to the medical industry.

1472
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:24,470
They are the third leading cause of death.

1473
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,930
But it was based on conservative
SMS because a paper,

1474
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,170
when you see the medical industry,

1475
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,200
yeah.

1476
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,033
When you say the medical,

1477
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,820
are you talking about pharmaceuticals?

1478
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,300
Pharmaceutical is primarily
a medicine does miracles.

1479
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,940
[inaudible] knocked medicine down
because medicine does miracles,

1480
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:39,510
man.

1481
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,100
Anything physical with a body,

1482
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:41,934
mechanical,

1483
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,120
they are miracle makers.

1484
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,390
You want to transplant a heart,

1485
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,590
you want to cut the pieces,

1486
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,424
fix them,

1487
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,560
go to them,

1488
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,393
right?

1489
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,210
You want to deal with cancer,

1490
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,290
Alzheimer's,

1491
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,250
diabetes,

1492
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,084
obesity,

1493
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,990
depression.

1494
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,920
They have no idea what the hell they're
talking about because they know the

1495
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:00,420
mechanical biology,

1496
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,500
which gives them the opportunity
to work on the body as a vehicle,

1497
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,270
cut out parts change parts.

1498
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,310
But how do the parts necessarily work?

1499
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,770
Ah,

1500
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:12,420
there's some missing information because
there's the new science undermines the

1501
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,890
existing belief system.

1502
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,500
So that's why the failure of the system.

1503
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,500
And it turns out that when
you do the statistics,

1504
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,970
medicine actually becomes the leading
cause of death in the United States today.

1505
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:28,260
And the pharmaceutical company is one
of the major elements behind that.

1506
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:29,983
That's amazing.

1507
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,290
That's a fact of science.

1508
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:31,591
You know,

1509
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,330
it's even more creepy as cigarettes.

1510
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,020
So here's the secret.

1511
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,280
Instead of taking oil of
Olay smoked cigarettes,

1512
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,110
just go to toys r us
once a week and a sucker,

1513
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,300
your thumb every night you'll sleep.

1514
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:43,134
Well,

1515
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,040
I don't even know what you just said.

1516
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,310
I have no idea what you just said.

1517
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,470
What was that?

1518
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,860
Is that a Brian train wreck?

1519
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,131
No,

1520
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:51,341
no.

1521
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:52,174
I mean,

1522
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:52,830
no,

1523
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:53,581
it's still entered.

1524
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:53,881
He,

1525
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,460
this is so interesting to me
because I've always thought that,

1526
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:56,730
you know,

1527
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,290
one of the secrets to life,

1528
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:58,560
uh,

1529
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,860
to,

1530
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,221
to,

1531
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,060
to feeling,

1532
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,020
looking young,

1533
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:03,990
being young is to don't
ever change what you,

1534
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:04,861
you're used to.

1535
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,081
So I,

1536
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:08,580
that's why I still play with toys
and that's why he was too young.

1537
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:08,911
Well,

1538
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:09,091
no,

1539
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:09,271
no.

1540
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:09,961
You just like,

1541
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:10,380
I'm,

1542
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,850
I feel like I'm a little kid still.

1543
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,530
I'm tricking with my mind and my,

1544
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,570
my health and everything and to
feeling like I'm a little kid.

1545
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:17,670
I've always thought that a
pack of cigarettes a day.

1546
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:18,900
What the fuck are you talking about?

1547
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,340
But I go to toys r us once a week.

1548
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,160
[inaudible] Huh?

1549
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,440
Absolutely.

1550
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,121
It changed that.

1551
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:26,880
You're really talking
about positive things.

1552
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,133
Your cigarette.

1553
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,360
Of course my body thinks I'm a kid.

1554
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:32,490
A lot of heat about those cigarettes.

1555
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,573
Is it an amazing,

1556
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,940
that's his strategy,

1557
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,803
his strategy.

1558
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,470
I don't want to not usually get
lung cancer from cigarettes,

1559
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,070
but because that's the same strategy
says strychnine just not poisonous.

1560
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,980
Exactly.

1561
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,620
Yeah.

1562
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,380
[inaudible] cancer that didn't think
they were going to cancel and there's

1563
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,730
nothing cops smoking cigarettes.

1564
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,861
I don't believe you.

1565
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:53,730
Believe it enough.

1566
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:54,211
How about the,

1567
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:54,990
Oh yeah.

1568
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,100
Have you seen my apartment?

1569
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,540
I haven't seen this office.

1570
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,830
I don't even know what that means.

1571
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,290
Don't even know what that means.

1572
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,330
You smoking cigarettes.

1573
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,173
Stupid.

1574
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,890
Ridiculous.

1575
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,120
They're candy cigarettes.

1576
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:06,661
Oh,

1577
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:07,494
I didn't know that.

1578
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,413
That's awesome.

1579
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,440
Smoker's Pixie dust.

1580
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,274
Right.

1581
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,940
It's amazing is it becomes such an issue.

1582
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,391
I look at him,

1583
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:15,961
he's lighting up.

1584
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:16,920
Stop talking about cigarettes.

1585
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:17,700
Don't like,

1586
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,570
oh my God.

1587
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,413
No,

1588
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,710
that's gross.

1589
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,550
Why don't lighten up indoors
when nasty motherfucker,

1590
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:27,050
we stink.

1591
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:27,880
You have it.

1592
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,440
We're going to.

1593
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,273
Isn't that amazing?

1594
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,310
We're talking about positive

1595
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,880
thinking and beliefs and how you can
structure the world and change it for the

1596
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,300
betterness.

1597
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,551
Fuck.

1598
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:37,390
Head lights up a cigarette
just to prove a point,

1599
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:37,900
Brian.

1600
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,111
No,

1601
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:38,621
it's cause he,

1602
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,454
that's how he is.

1603
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:40,763
So he is,

1604
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,293
I can't help it.

1605
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,590
I just like the smoke
effect in the studio.

1606
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,460
That's right.

1607
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,300
That's what you like.

1608
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,433
Just like when you,

1609
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,580
you know,

1610
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,110
when you used to say go
to comedy clubs like the,

1611
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,070
like Texas,

1612
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,030
before they banned cigarettes,

1613
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:56,150
he used to always say that and states
how cool it was to go into like that.

1614
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,750
That just adds to the
whole like sitting around,

1615
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,490
but not in a podcast.

1616
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,850
When you talking to a gentleman talking
about positivity and you go and do the

1617
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,370
exact opposite of what he's selling you,

1618
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:06,790
fuck,

1619
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,140
you just became the problem,

1620
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:08,974
Brian.

1621
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,420
You are the problem.

1622
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,550
You're the fucking,

1623
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:18,090
whatever percent of it is you can't go
99% of 1% I know that they can do that

1624
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:18,911
financially,

1625
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:20,470
but when it comes to morons,

1626
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,390
so much more complicated scale,

1627
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,643
we can't just,

1628
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,850
it's not just two groups,

1629
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:25,684
man.

1630
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,300
People are probably have
feet in both groups.

1631
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,530
That's also an issue.

1632
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,670
How do we fix this?

1633
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,211
You're,

1634
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:31,931
you're a smart guy.

1635
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:32,501
You obviously,

1636
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:35,410
instead of knowing just
knowing these things,

1637
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,110
you must have some sort of
an idea of how it can be.

1638
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:38,944
Absolutely.

1639
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,341
How do we,

1640
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:42,250
how do we implement a
positive move forward?

1641
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,580
The first thing that's happening right
now that's really critical as occupy Wall

1642
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:45,970
Street.

1643
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,601
It's just saying,

1644
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:46,990
look,

1645
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,520
we're finished with this stuff and it
ends when enough people say it ends.

1646
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,020
That's basically what
are going to come down.

1647
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,860
Do you see happening
with this occupy wall?

1648
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:54,101
Shoot?

1649
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:54,421
What do you,

1650
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:54,701
you know,

1651
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:54,921
it's,

1652
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:57,040
it's obviously all over the world now.

1653
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:57,874
It's amazing.

1654
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,400
You see one of those occupy
maps and you see all,

1655
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,020
literally all over the world,

1656
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:03,070
people are protesting.

1657
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:03,700
But we're,

1658
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,630
where does this end?

1659
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,920
I think this sands,

1660
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,250
when,

1661
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,560
when the institutions that exist start
saying they're not able to handle the

1662
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:13,390
situation anymore and then we start
looking for a new way of handling life.

1663
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,340
I mean it was interesting when a governor,

1664
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:16,960
one of the places that I had really,

1665
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:20,260
I had a lot of trouble this occupy Wall
Street stuff cause I can't find anybody

1666
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,630
to talk to that's in charge.

1667
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:23,171
And uh,

1668
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:23,741
it was sort of like,

1669
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:23,921
yeah,

1670
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:24,630
because man,

1671
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,780
this is a new way of life.

1672
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,450
You're not going to have
that old dental game anymore.

1673
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,200
So all of a sudden the old guard will
not be able to communicate with a new way

1674
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:32,840
of life.

1675
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,420
And it's like the Internet.

1676
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,680
No one runs the Internet.

1677
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,620
There's not one person
that runs the intranet.

1678
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,380
You know,

1679
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,380
you could have one person that has
a show on NBC or a show on ABC.

1680
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:44,081
You know,

1681
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:44,770
you can have,

1682
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,660
you could have someone
who controls a network,

1683
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,190
but once you're on the Internet,

1684
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,660
it's just one thing.

1685
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,870
Just like would occupy Wall
Street is there's not one leader.

1686
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,410
Yes.

1687
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,560
One giant cohesive thing
all working together.

1688
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,150
That's very fascinating.

1689
00:49:58,151 --> 00:49:59,440
That's why I said this,

1690
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,310
the technology,

1691
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,320
the Internet was the final evolutionary
stage required for civilization because

1692
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:09,520
it's the nervous system
of a global civilization.

1693
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,770
And once that was put
into place in the cell,

1694
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:14,680
started communicating with each other
and once they started to do that,

1695
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,690
then look what's unfolding
in the world around us today.

1696
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,350
Once they,

1697
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,250
the groups of cells from every part of
the world started looking at the same

1698
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,540
dialogue in the same language.

1699
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,620
And for me it's exciting.

1700
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,090
I travel all over the place.

1701
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:25,841
I give lectures.

1702
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:26,220
I,

1703
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:26,580
uh,

1704
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,160
what me was a few years

1705
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,341
back,

1706
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,050
I was sitting in my living
room in Santa Cruz and a,

1707
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,840
uh,

1708
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,320
a video crew from Russia was there and
they were setting up for the video and I

1709
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:39,410
was just sitting there and looking at
him and I thought if you didn't hear them

1710
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,244
speaking,

1711
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,260
if you just had a video without the sound,

1712
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,980
you wouldn't know where the,

1713
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,340
if they came from La or where
the hell they came from,

1714
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:50,000
they all of a sudden start to realize
all around the world people are beginning

1715
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:50,420
to,

1716
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:50,960
to,

1717
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,560
you know,

1718
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,010
start to act as one community of people.

1719
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,640
And it's real exciting because that
is what the evolution is all about.

1720
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,070
You can't have separate countries.

1721
00:51:00,071 --> 00:51:00,291
I say,

1722
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:00,561
well look,

1723
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,540
I'm well let,

1724
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,610
let's burn all this crap and put it in
the air because it's going to blow over

1725
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:04,761
there.

1726
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:05,960
And we don't care about it that,

1727
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:07,160
that those days are over.

1728
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,000
Every nation represents cells
of people coming together.

1729
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,820
It's like every country is
like an organ in the body.

1730
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:17,960
You need all the organs to work
together to create the wholeness of it.

1731
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:19,640
And that's what we're
beginning to recognize.

1732
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,800
Know Oregon is separate
from any other Oregon.

1733
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,600
We're all part of the same body.

1734
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,360
So your lungs are fucking
up your whole life son.

1735
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,150
I say,

1736
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,460
boy,

1737
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,211
he bikes on it.

1738
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,470
That one doesn't let go man.

1739
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,840
So I say your lungs are fucking up and
everything and marijuana and you're doing

1740
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:36,320
it too.

1741
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,890
No marijuana doesn't do the same
silly and he's smoking your lungs,

1742
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:40,310
does it?

1743
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,031
No it doesn't.

1744
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:41,864
You're wrong.

1745
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,771
What are you a doctor?

1746
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:47,771
You fuckhead he has never read a single
thing about when you have never read a

1747
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,590
single thing about a lung
is it has to say anyway.

1748
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,090
It's not like it's opposite smoke.

1749
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:53,511
First of all,

1750
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:57,470
I don't think you're inhaling nearly
as much smoke when you smoke marijuana

1751
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,260
cause you're only doing it like
maybe once or twice in a day.

1752
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,110
You're sucking on those stupid
things all fucking day long.

1753
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,190
And on top of that,

1754
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,590
those things have 500 and
you take one bond him.

1755
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,790
That's like a pack of cigarettes.

1756
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,421
The fuck it is.

1757
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:09,320
It's going through water.

1758
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:10,160
That's not a water pipe.

1759
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,210
Stupid as a cigarette.

1760
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,573
All right.

1761
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,150
Filters.

1762
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,751
Oh my God.

1763
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:16,940
Brian cigarettes are filled
with chemicals that kill you.

1764
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,400
No one's ever died from pot ever
in the history of the world.

1765
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:22,430
Do you do not get that if there's
a direct connection there,

1766
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,250
I'm sure.

1767
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,730
I'm sure there's people that
have died from marijuana.

1768
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:26,030
No,

1769
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:30,230
you might help with marijuana does
something stupid when you were high,

1770
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:30,921
but that's on you.

1771
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:32,060
That's not on the pots plant.

1772
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,601
That's like,

1773
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,021
you know,

1774
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:35,570
that's like blaming a corvette
because you crashed into a tree.

1775
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,610
It's not the car's fault
if you knew how to drive.

1776
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,810
When you say like there's
definitely been lung cancer,

1777
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:42,170
uh,

1778
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,420
cases that are probably
attributed to marijuana.

1779
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:44,631
No,

1780
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:45,430
there's none.

1781
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,860
No.

1782
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,580
I don't know that.

1783
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,910
They don't say it's marijuana,

1784
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,410
smoked pot and gotten lung cancer.

1785
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,851
It would be,

1786
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:53,870
there'd be cases of it.

1787
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,704
They would talk about it.

1788
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,090
Look there,

1789
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,050
there's freak instances in medicine.

1790
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:00,410
There's freak instances were people's
reactions to certain things and people get

1791
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,570
cancer from fucking all
kinds of weird shit.

1792
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:03,830
That doesn't bother you or me.

1793
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,560
But you look at the history of human use.

1794
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:07,730
Where's the fucking bodies?

1795
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:08,270
Dude?

1796
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,160
You can't say that pot smoke kills people.

1797
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,110
You can't because there's no evidence.

1798
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,030
There's no evidence that
anybody's dying from it.

1799
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,140
There's a lot of evidence of
people are dying from science.

1800
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:16,520
Right,

1801
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,430
but you're very strong on
this side of the case too.

1802
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,780
I don't want you to die Canada.

1803
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:20,930
No,

1804
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:21,150
no.

1805
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,760
I met a guy who was saying you're very,

1806
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,200
even though there's no
evidence that you seem you're,

1807
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,070
you've picked aside,

1808
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,700
but don't you,

1809
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:26,850
you're,

1810
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,890
you're just rolling out that,

1811
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:28,130
that,

1812
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,680
that there's no one that has got lung
cancer from marijuana smoke is that guy

1813
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:32,190
died.

1814
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,023
He's a pussy.

1815
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,880
I have one guy died.

1816
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,703
That's what I say.

1817
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,120
Jesus Christ.

1818
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,050
If we kills you.

1819
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:40,530
What?

1820
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,580
Cause we'd got there first.

1821
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,270
Dot.

1822
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:44,103
Sniffing glue.

1823
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,121
I just like,

1824
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:48,431
you do it.

1825
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:49,470
I don't want you to get cancer.

1826
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:52,080
And I know you're stuck in this stupid
thing and it's so ridiculous because you

1827
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:55,380
quit for a while and he'd talk about
how all smoke makes me sick now.

1828
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:56,580
And then your cat stubs,

1829
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,860
it's toe and you fucking
light right up again.

1830
00:53:59,340 --> 00:53:59,731
You know,

1831
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,700
and you eventually you're playing a
game that's going to catch up with you.

1832
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,741
And I think this,

1833
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:07,500
this message is to anybody's out there
smoking cigarettes is the most ridiculous

1834
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:08,320
fucking thing you can do.

1835
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,390
They taste like shit.

1836
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,620
They're terrible for you.

1837
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,370
This whole reward mechanism is just
because you're addicted to their chemicals

1838
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,720
and when you get that chemical,

1839
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:16,710
you get this reward.

1840
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,130
It's not even just to tobacco.

1841
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,170
And I will say if you give a get a law
that says that ban cigarettes from the

1842
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:22,621
United States,

1843
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,600
that 90% of the smokers will cosign it.

1844
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,550
That's right there.

1845
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:27,660
That's incredible.

1846
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,553
That's incredible.

1847
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,433
Yeah.

1848
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,010
I mean you don't understand what it's
like to be addicted to cigarettes.

1849
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,251
Oh,

1850
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:32,941
I imagine.

1851
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:33,840
I can only imagine.

1852
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,780
So when you talk about it to any,

1853
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,390
I want you to be strong son.

1854
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,030
I want you,

1855
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,850
I get it.

1856
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,150
Or do you think about total government
to stop smoking or Bruce Lipton?

1857
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,200
Me that you are creating your own life,

1858
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:48,471
dude.

1859
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:50,060
You're creating all your own problems.

1860
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:50,571
See,

1861
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:52,430
he just sucks cigarettes to me.

1862
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,530
What's happening to
you on a quantum level?

1863
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,170
I never cigarettes to me are making
me hat was perfect and boy you happy.

1864
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,760
We'll make the perfect foil
for this intelligent debate
we're having where Bruce

1865
00:55:01,761 --> 00:55:05,390
is explaining the nature of the
fucking universe and you're like,

1866
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:05,631
no,

1867
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:07,220
cigarettes are awesome.

1868
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,693
Not saying

1869
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,670
please ground so I can't stop.

1870
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:14,980
I'm a smoker in front of people.

1871
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:15,963
I don't care.

1872
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,180
I don't care if it sticks.

1873
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,223
It's like you.

1874
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,030
It's like if someone who
really likes to Fart,

1875
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:20,431
you don't care.

1876
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:23,420
You just fart all over everybody
he's wearing on people,

1877
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,171
lighting cigarettes,

1878
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:25,100
all over people.

1879
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,190
This stupidity in the air.

1880
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,180
It's just,

1881
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,140
and if she likes cigarettes,

1882
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:30,530
man,

1883
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,910
that's all cool and everything.

1884
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,451
That's all cool.

1885
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:33,020
And the gang,

1886
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,100
I'm just telling my friend here,

1887
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:34,963
don't be stupid,

1888
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,320
right?

1889
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,891
It's ridiculous.

1890
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:37,730
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

1891
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,380
If we're supposed to reengineer the world,

1892
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,240
I ain't supposed to call stupid shit out.

1893
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:42,074
When you see it,

1894
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,970
it's going to be great.

1895
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,950
You're going to be the king
who's going to be the case?

1896
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,221
No,

1897
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:46,850
I don't want to see it.

1898
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,320
I want to go back to the,

1899
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:49,880
no,

1900
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,720
I just want to be,

1901
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:50,960
you know,

1902
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,800
back in the woods.

1903
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,240
You want to go hide in the woods.

1904
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,610
I like that too.

1905
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:54,980
Yeah.

1906
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,320
Yeah.

1907
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,170
Do you and I are on the same

1908
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,270
you animals.

1909
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,160
Oh fuck him in the woods.

1910
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:00,640
You don't.

1911
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,570
If you're a sensitive

1912
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,041
person,

1913
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:04,860
if you're thinking all the time and you're
sensitive to other people around you.

1914
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,470
And I always believe that
people around you affect you.

1915
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:08,580
Their energy affects you.

1916
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,450
You don't realize how relaxing
it is when there's no one around.

1917
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,070
When there's literally no one around.

1918
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:14,341
Like you,

1919
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:15,240
you sit on your porch,

1920
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:15,811
you hear Chirp,

1921
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:16,111
Chirp,

1922
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:16,381
Chirp,

1923
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:16,680
chirp.

1924
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,370
You see a chipmunk walk by and you see
birds flying overhead and you see the

1925
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:22,380
wind slowly moving the trees.

1926
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:22,831
Fuck.

1927
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:23,710
That feels awesome.

1928
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:23,930
It's,

1929
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:24,140
that's,

1930
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,260
that's the east.

1931
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:25,610
Yeah.

1932
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,400
I had an experience.

1933
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,771
Yeah,

1934
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:29,050
you released from the hive briefly.

1935
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,730
That's why I don't
understand New York City.

1936
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,121
Well,

1937
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:34,210
you're just trusting all these
people's vibes around you.

1938
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,080
You know,

1939
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,810
you're just going to,

1940
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:40,000
to live in some giant fucking cement
box with a bunch of Weirdos and they all

1941
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,880
think weird shit and who knows
who's toaster doesn't work right?

1942
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,620
And lights the whole
fucking place on fire.

1943
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,620
You're going to trust these assholes
and you're just going to be around them

1944
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:48,101
every day.

1945
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:50,830
Stuck in traffic and just
breathing their energy.

1946
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,550
Right.

1947
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:51,940
Uh,

1948
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,151
I,

1949
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:54,280
I W I was one of the
lucky guys in the world.

1950
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:56,470
I ended up teaching the Caribbean islands.

1951
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,071
Whoa.

1952
00:56:57,071 --> 00:56:59,860
I taught there for
about three years and a,

1953
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,360
I want to talk.

1954
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,193
You married?

1955
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,381
Not back then.

1956
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:02,830
No.

1957
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,663
Oh yeah.

1958
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,380
You want to talk about a line?

1959
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,710
I offered this line and never,

1960
00:57:06,711 --> 00:57:07,660
it never really works.

1961
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,490
It was like a,

1962
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:08,950
it's like,

1963
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:09,131
Hey,

1964
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:09,820
do you want to yeah,

1965
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,541
you got nothing to do.

1966
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:11,830
I got a villa down in the Caribbean.

1967
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:12,664
You want to come down there?

1968
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,481
I had that great line,

1969
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:16,210
but I really never found
anybody know that was like,

1970
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:16,421
God,

1971
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:17,980
what a great line in and wasting it.

1972
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,410
That's a pretty baller line.

1973
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,090
Well,

1974
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,970
you know,

1975
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,800
you know you want to come into my
place down in the crib and I go there.

1976
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:28,330
Sometimes I fuck around with the
Caribbean and muck with that.

1977
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:29,700
Sometimes I got a villa,

1978
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,041
whatever,

1979
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:30,874
whatever.

1980
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,930
That's all of those things.

1981
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,390
As well as the things you
really should have used it.

1982
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:39,730
You should have forced yourself
to some sort of a bar situation.

1983
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,343
You know?

1984
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:42,921
It's why I was things,

1985
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:44,890
if you would think that
if you didn't have it,

1986
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,090
if you didn't have easy man,

1987
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:46,930
if I had that boat,

1988
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:47,823
I fucking use it,

1989
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,820
but then if you did have it,

1990
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:49,660
you probably wouldn't use it.

1991
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:50,110
Right?

1992
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:50,360
Oh,

1993
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,430
it seems so cheesy.

1994
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,840
The rejection could be so horrified by,

1995
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,810
it was actually to a couple of try that.

1996
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,370
He did try it and they rejected it,

1997
00:57:59,371 --> 00:57:59,901
rejected that,

1998
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:00,551
and it's just like,

1999
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:00,850
wow,

2000
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:01,481
that didn't work.

2001
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,314
I'm really bad.

2002
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,230
When you see something
really cheesy like that,

2003
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,610
you take a chance that it goes,

2004
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,130
you know the girls basically
in materialistic slut.

2005
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,890
Then final checks don't like that.

2006
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,101
Yeah.

2007
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:12,581
That's really,

2008
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,230
you're taking a big bold chance.

2009
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,170
It's like when Bill Clinton used to just
pull his dick out in front of girls.

2010
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:17,661
You know,

2011
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:17,920
like,

2012
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,431
man,

2013
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:20,230
I guess that works sometimes.

2014
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,490
He was holy shit,

2015
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,324
what a gamble.

2016
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,110
He represented the
testosterone or the country,

2017
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,040
so he was,

2018
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:27,251
you know,

2019
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:27,950
that's what he was.

2020
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,530
Must have worked so many times.

2021
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,050
There's no way it didn't
work because all these,

2022
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,570
like the state trooper
woman that Jennifer Flowers,

2023
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:34,990
women,

2024
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,990
these women that would claim we would
just whip his dick out and it was not just

2025
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:38,470
one,

2026
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,771
you know,

2027
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:39,200
it was like,

2028
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:39,971
it had obviously,

2029
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:40,690
what's his Goto?

2030
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:40,870
Well,

2031
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,160
it was an unconscious behavior.

2032
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:43,330
He didn't see himself doing it,

2033
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:43,991
but I mean,

2034
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,560
I can't believe he did it with like women
and like professional environments and

2035
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:47,861
stuff.

2036
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:48,071
I mean,

2037
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:50,040
he wasn't like a loan
at his house to have it.

2038
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,150
A couple of drinks and
he just whips it out now.

2039
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,370
He would whip it out when the
first person left the room,

2040
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,241
you know,

2041
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:55,661
they'd be like,

2042
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:56,710
three people in the room.

2043
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:58,100
I'll be right back and
we'll go to the bathroom.

2044
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,190
And then one person
would go to the bathroom,

2045
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,100
he'd whip his dick out.

2046
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,260
I mean he was fucking crazy.

2047
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,310
It was king.

2048
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,090
He was king.

2049
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:04,540
Yeah.

2050
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,490
But is it natural to have
that kind of behavior?

2051
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:06,971
Like is that,

2052
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:09,910
isn't that what drives a lot of those
guys to get to that position in the first

2053
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:10,180
place?

2054
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,800
Absolutely.

2055
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,790
Because you're in that competition
out there in the field.

2056
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,660
And how do you know how you
succeed in the competition?

2057
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,540
How many toys do you own and what's
your position in the hierarchy?

2058
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:20,670
And so w when you driven
yourself to that level there,

2059
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,040
there was a reason why you

2060
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,850
want it to be up there.

2061
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,760
Not to just because there's something to
do for the week or something like that.

2062
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:26,990
There was a mission statement.

2063
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:30,590
So they that was playing the
game fallout going for that.

2064
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,180
This is why the Atlanta people
really identify with Ron Paul.

2065
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,420
And one of the reasons why
they identify with Ron Paul.

2066
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,551
He,

2067
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:37,790
no,

2068
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,020
he doesn't want to fuck anybody.

2069
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,220
Yeah,

2070
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,420
he's like an old dude.

2071
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:45,690
It's not like he's not like I'm
some crazy pussy prowl and you know,

2072
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,830
once he gets an office he'll
be playing golf every day,

2073
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,401
you know?

2074
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:49,671
No,

2075
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:54,650
he's done with everything and any thought
of anything masculine are dominating

2076
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:55,484
and you know,

2077
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,530
he's done with all that and absolutely.

2078
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,790
And it would be great to,

2079
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,090
I could,

2080
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,030
I could just see it happening
because of the Internet community.

2081
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,750
A third party could arise
within just several weeks.

2082
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,120
Do you think voting is real voting?

2083
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,010
I don't think it's not great.

2084
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,000
I think it's set up.

2085
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,020
Yeah.

2086
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,700
Especially with computer voting machines.

2087
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,180
Did you watch that
documentary hacking democracy?

2088
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,580
I've seen that and I know some of these
people in the industry and it's sort of

2089
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:19,821
like,

2090
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:20,251
yeah that's,

2091
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:21,290
that's just a given.

2092
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,400
But what's a gift?

2093
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,840
What's insane is that that wasn't followed
up on and chase down and beaten down

2094
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:27,580
in front of the press.

2095
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,050
Like,

2096
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,230
like that girl killed her
baby with the fuck's her name,

2097
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,873
Casey Anthony,

2098
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,800
that that got beaten down,

2099
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,170
you know,

2100
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,510
that got beaten down to the press.

2101
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:36,344
Why wasn't this?

2102
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,740
Because obviously anything that was
important doesn't play in the press.

2103
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,710
The press is owned by the
people that own the opinion.

2104
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,570
They'll play what they want.

2105
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:45,471
I mean,

2106
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:45,651
when,

2107
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:45,921
when,

2108
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:50,750
when to haven't they
done that disgust you,

2109
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,600
that's why the Internet is so,

2110
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,660
that's why they lost control all of a
sudden want to fuck up the Internet is

2111
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:57,494
Huh?

2112
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,900
It's pirate radio for the whole world.

2113
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:00,471
Exactly.

2114
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:01,430
You know what a disaster.

2115
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:01,740
Yeah.

2116
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,380
People think for themselves and the fun
stuff is that Rodney came to people,

2117
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,861
I don't remember,

2118
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:08,930
but Rodney King was the beginning of uh,

2119
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,670
everybody getting caught on camera,

2120
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:11,001
you know,

2121
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:11,531
and I love it.

2122
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:11,781
And like,

2123
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:12,081
yeah,

2124
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:12,611
you're right.

2125
01:01:12,611 --> 01:01:13,444
You know,

2126
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,690
once that opened up,

2127
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,250
once I opened up all
of a sudden it's like,

2128
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,371
oh,

2129
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,840
you mean you could expose the secrets?

2130
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,030
And everybody had cameras
like the UC Davis thing.

2131
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,720
That was a great,

2132
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,180
that's a great demonstration how they,

2133
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,030
they peaceably just push the
guys right out of the thing.

2134
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:29,780
But it was neat,

2135
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,950
was like 50% of the audience at their
hands up with cameras and everybody was

2136
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:34,311
shooting.

2137
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:36,170
His whole thing is sort
of like in this world.

2138
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,150
I don't think that guy thought
that that was going to happen.

2139
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:38,290
No,

2140
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,140
I don't think he was going to get,

2141
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,810
I think he never thought he
would get contacted about it.

2142
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,640
That's just police all thought that was
amazing to me that someone could think

2143
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:50,120
that it would be the right thing to
do to take some fucking kid who was a

2144
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:51,110
college student.

2145
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:51,770
Okay.

2146
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,280
And all they're doing is sitting there
protesting and you're going to spray some

2147
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:56,180
fifth whatever they are,

2148
01:01:56,181 --> 01:02:00,380
1920 year old kid in the face with
pepper spray and you're a cop,

2149
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:03,170
whatever piece a shit that and that,

2150
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:06,440
that reaction is completely
natural and important.

2151
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:06,980
Right,

2152
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,180
because that is verification that
there's a new process in place.

2153
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:11,811
Absolutely.

2154
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,810
And that's what I was so proud about
those people because they'd gotten into a

2155
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:17,090
situation where it could
have gotten into violence.

2156
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,680
And what they did is they,

2157
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:20,010
they just held the violence

2158
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,843
back and just,

2159
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,181
you know,

2160
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,320
there's just shame on you.

2161
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,101
And they shamed them,

2162
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:27,210
like push them back back until they were
off the campus and they got off and it

2163
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:27,540
was like,

2164
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,373
oh wow.

2165
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,250
Nonviolence,

2166
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,630
because what people have to understand
is that it's the violence that's being

2167
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,201
planted.

2168
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:39,201
I think most of it I would say a is
planted is to throw people against this

2169
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:41,640
occupy Wall Street movement.

2170
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,980
When and,

2171
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,420
and when they did a piece of leaves,

2172
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:44,671
like,

2173
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:45,030
wow,

2174
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,830
what are you gonna how are you
going to complain about that?

2175
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:47,420
Were,

2176
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:47,701
you know,

2177
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,001
it was like,

2178
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:49,470
that was a great demonstration of,

2179
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,071
uh,

2180
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:52,800
of how to handle this situation
because the moment violence comes in,

2181
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,980
then the,

2182
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,540
those,

2183
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:54,960
those,

2184
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,360
they're almost like Nazi
storm troopers out there,

2185
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,130
especially with all of that,

2186
01:02:59,370 --> 01:02:59,760
uh,

2187
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,170
homeland security,

2188
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,190
you know,

2189
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,360
all that crap.

2190
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:05,010
All their new guns and all that,

2191
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,720
that technology for crowd control,

2192
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:08,220
they're freaky people out there.

2193
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,293
And it's like,

2194
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,800
and they love the job.

2195
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,410
They love to go out there
and pound on those kids.

2196
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:13,930
That's what they,

2197
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:14,763
they train for.

2198
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,003
So,

2199
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,130
so ridiculous.

2200
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,680
It's very fascinating though.

2201
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:21,940
It's very fascinating the,

2202
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:23,470
the tone that the movement has taken,

2203
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:26,980
the fact that it's really
been amazingly nonviolent,

2204
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,600
considering the amount of resistance,

2205
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,830
that's what it needs.

2206
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,280
Because otherwise,

2207
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,110
if it's,

2208
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,370
if you're going to play the game of force,

2209
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:34,660
you're already out.

2210
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:35,560
You're not going to win the game.

2211
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,700
What do you think is going to happen?

2212
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,270
Or do you,

2213
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,370
do you sit down and prognosticate?

2214
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:41,320
Do you see a direction
that this is going to

2215
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,310
go do it there?

2216
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:47,310
There's two choices here around the
choices are we're going to survive this

2217
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:49,230
evolutionary thing or we're
not going to survive it.

2218
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:49,980
So,

2219
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,490
uh,

2220
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,990
we continued doing what we're doing.

2221
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:52,830
We already know.

2222
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:53,760
Science already said,

2223
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:55,480
it's already on the calendar manager.

2224
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:55,651
You're,

2225
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:56,610
you're going out.

2226
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,201
And the question is,

2227
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,360
can we mobilize and make the change?

2228
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,210
And I really think we can because it's,

2229
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:03,780
um,

2230
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,450
especially the younger
generation and the older,

2231
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:07,410
older generation,

2232
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,370
the ones in the middle lobe.

2233
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,480
But I'm a little concerned about,

2234
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:12,240
but there are a lot of old
hippies out there that,

2235
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:13,140
that uh,

2236
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:18,120
really are in total alignment with
the occupy Wall Street movement.

2237
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:18,781
That's who they are.

2238
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:21,720
They were there back then
when it all happened and so,

2239
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:22,230
uh,

2240
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,670
uh,

2241
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,560
I think there's this great
opportunity for this evolution.

2242
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,940
It's going to be fabulous,

2243
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,070
but you have to recognize like
anything when a child is born is there,

2244
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,983
there's blood,

2245
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,061
there's,

2246
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:33,510
there's,

2247
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:38,340
there's a pain and blood when it happens
and birthing this new civilization.

2248
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,160
We're going to go through this
little bit of this chaos here,

2249
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:43,020
which is going to be
painful for a lot of people,

2250
01:04:43,021 --> 01:04:47,040
but it's like we got to see pass
where we are and look to where we,

2251
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,290
isn't it amazing that no one would have
ever guessed 20 years ago that we'd be

2252
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:56,670
talking about tests that we'd be talking
about society eroding to the point

2253
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:59,880
where it really becomes
irrelevant or not irrelevant,

2254
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:00,750
but just it doesn't,

2255
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,650
it doesn't,

2256
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,670
it's not respected.

2257
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:03,903
Now,

2258
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,261
you know,

2259
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:04,361
the,

2260
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:04,521
the,

2261
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:04,711
the,

2262
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:09,660
the setup is we've accepted it
because it just is what it is.

2263
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,190
No one is happy with it.

2264
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,010
Everybody recognizes it's full of flaws.

2265
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,040
But it's almost like there's this attitude
that like this is as good as we can

2266
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:17,910
as humans.

2267
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,050
Oh

2268
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:18,450
No.

2269
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:22,300
I mean today there's complicated society
with the stock market and the exchange

2270
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:23,320
rates and so,

2271
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:23,501
you know,

2272
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:24,550
Saudi Arabian Oil,

2273
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,960
this is as good as we can get,

2274
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,800
but it's not obvious.

2275
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,920
Not because it's not perfect to keep
those people that have the haves to keep

2276
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:35,710
what they have and to keep
all the other people in,

2277
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,491
in that place.

2278
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,450
But instead of evolving,

2279
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,530
it's in fact evolving.

2280
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,161
Absolutely.

2281
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:41,590
But that's what's going
to cost to come to a head,

2282
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:44,870
come to a crisis point where something's
going to have to happen right here.

2283
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,440
I have to realize that the people that
are in power are not looking out for

2284
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:48,274
their interest.

2285
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,360
It's an obvious,

2286
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:52,450
it's obvious this do this new thing
that was passed in the Senate about,

2287
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:52,850
uh,

2288
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,330
the,

2289
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,150
the United States being a battlefield.

2290
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:55,870
Oh Man.

2291
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:56,301
Did you,

2292
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:56,921
you see this,

2293
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,940
that they're allowed to mobilize
troops now on American soil.

2294
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,680
Apparently Obama said
he's going to veto it,

2295
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,520
but what the fuck ever,

2296
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:03,970
man,

2297
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,650
the fact that it got that
far in the first place,

2298
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,484
that's horrific.

2299
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,490
It's just this manipulation by
very small number of people.

2300
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:09,880
Like,

2301
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,290
you know,

2302
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:10,750
Alyssa,

2303
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,250
we're going to extend unemployment,

2304
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,680
but you have to sign for the pipeline.

2305
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,650
And what point in time does that become
criminal for like the Senate and what

2306
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:18,610
point in time did we not say,

2307
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:18,821
hey,

2308
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:19,870
you fucking crux.

2309
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:20,650
Get outta here.

2310
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:20,771
Well,

2311
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:21,400
I'm waiting.

2312
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,600
I'm totally waiting for this.

2313
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:23,860
And it's really upsetting.

2314
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,960
And that's why I actually started looking,

2315
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:30,340
I even looked for a place in New Zealand
now it's going to be so hard to get rid

2316
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:31,180
of lobbyists.

2317
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,230
It's going to be so hard,

2318
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:32,920
that kind of shit.

2319
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,650
It's going to be so hard
to get all that stuff out.

2320
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,980
Look at the Internet,

2321
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:36,380
as I said,

2322
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,050
could overnight changed the entire
political spectrum overnight.

2323
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,590
They'd never counted on that.

2324
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:42,580
And if you do something,

2325
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,630
voting is real.

2326
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,590
If voting is real,

2327
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:46,960
but then the idea is you really
start to swamp the market,

2328
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,160
it's very hard to say that.

2329
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,001
Uh,

2330
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:49,331
you know,

2331
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:50,560
that's what these other countries,

2332
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:50,761
no,

2333
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:51,071
it's like,

2334
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:53,040
well obviously this didn't
conform to the people.

2335
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,320
Isn't it funny that we are becoming
a fucking banana dictatorship?

2336
01:06:56,321 --> 01:06:56,830
We are.

2337
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:00,850
We have become everything we fought for
for other countries and and freed other

2338
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:01,331
countries.

2339
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,460
We've imposed with a Patriot Act.

2340
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:08,590
We have taken her away personal liberty
and this whole country is to my opinion,

2341
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:12,910
would that person would that Patriot Act
and operation is as bankrupt as any of

2342
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:13,271
the countries.

2343
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:18,271
Like Chile was a under under
their leadership and their
dictators were whatever

2344
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:21,390
the government says they
can create wherever the hell
they want to take you Joe

2345
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:25,060
off the street and not tell anybody
for 90 days that you are even gone.

2346
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:28,630
They've just done incredible
like in America it's incredible.

2347
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,630
Like whoever's sign that you are traders.

2348
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,130
Absolutely guys are traders,

2349
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:34,150
just straight traders.

2350
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,070
They should be fucking
ashamed of themselves.

2351
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,890
To call yourself a representative
of the people and the past,

2352
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:39,760
something like that.

2353
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,100
What do,

2354
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:40,290
what do,

2355
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:40,930
what do you think?

2356
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,320
What if,

2357
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,550
what if everything at the
top is completely fucked up
and the right thing to do

2358
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:50,140
is to march in the street and to
block traffic and to stop this fucking

2359
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:51,370
tyrannical situation.

2360
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,890
It's that necessarily.

2361
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,580
If that is the case,

2362
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,923
then we're there.

2363
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,060
Anybody you poses that is treasonous.

2364
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:58,290
Yeah,

2365
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:58,510
look,

2366
01:07:58,510 --> 01:07:59,050
they,

2367
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:03,210
they already have the interment camps to
hold several million people and there,

2368
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,450
because this was not a new thing.

2369
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,293
A matter of fact,

2370
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,590
there was a guy at Stanford University
at this think tank called the Hoover

2371
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:09,424
think tank.

2372
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,091
Uh,

2373
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:10,930
in 1980,

2374
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:15,830
the government asked him to write a
report on a scenario if there's a big

2375
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:16,610
financial

2376
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,443
collapse,

2377
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,381
1980.

2378
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:19,490
They asked him to write this.

2379
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,031
He said,

2380
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:20,180
well,

2381
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:20,570
you know,

2382
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:20,831
the,

2383
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:21,111
the,

2384
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:22,190
these were game players.

2385
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:24,140
How would you play this thing out?

2386
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,131
And the thing was,

2387
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:25,851
it was real interesting.

2388
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,480
He said,

2389
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:26,781
uh,

2390
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:29,750
in this process of what they
were talking about in the future,

2391
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,171
uh,

2392
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:31,120
the guy who wrote it up said,

2393
01:08:31,121 --> 01:08:32,060
one of the things that was interesting,

2394
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:32,510
he said,

2395
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,190
people in this future period,

2396
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:37,940
you're going to become more conscious
and this is going to change the

2397
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,980
relationship of what's going on.

2398
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,630
But he also came to the conclusion,

2399
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:42,464
he said,

2400
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:46,640
inevitably we're still going to come to
a chaos period where there's going to

2401
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:47,600
have to be controlled,

2402
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:48,260
maintain.

2403
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,420
And I remember we put in
parentheses and he said,

2404
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,430
and I hope not for long,

2405
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:56,900
but what he was saying is if it comes
to a crunch issue like this for the

2406
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:58,460
government to maintain control,

2407
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,470
they'll have to put a lot of people away
and in German camps disease to keep it

2408
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:03,940
from,

2409
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,090
from burning up.

2410
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:05,841
And I mean,

2411
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:06,470
look,

2412
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,460
it's not very far now.

2413
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:07,941
I mean the,

2414
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:08,111
the,

2415
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:08,321
the,

2416
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:11,780
the essentially storm
troopers and Oakland and uh,

2417
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,300
and all these other cities
coming in there with,

2418
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:14,601
I mean,

2419
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:15,320
it's like,

2420
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,770
it's out of some other country's history
book and we're looking at a life.

2421
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:19,200
Yeah,

2422
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,033
it really is.

2423
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,063
It's terrifying.

2424
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,070
It's weird how quickly it happened to,

2425
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:23,580
you know,

2426
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,460
you remember a right after nine
11 when everybody was like,

2427
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:27,390
oh Rah Rah.

2428
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,620
I remember it was just,

2429
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:28,860
you know,

2430
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,900
week or so after the tragedy.

2431
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:34,440
I was driving down the street and
every other car had an American flag.

2432
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:35,650
Yeah,

2433
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,060
no,

2434
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:36,781
it's amazing.

2435
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:39,210
Everybody was all we blew it.

2436
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,770
Yeah.

2437
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,280
Cause there was an evolutionary moment.

2438
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,650
It was right on the edge
because all around the world,

2439
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,491
all the countries,

2440
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:49,491
that one started to say let's unite
together and stamp out this stuff.

2441
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:50,731
And then it was,

2442
01:09:50,731 --> 01:09:51,211
you know,

2443
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:52,080
a cowboy.

2444
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:52,711
George said,

2445
01:09:52,711 --> 01:09:52,951
no,

2446
01:09:52,951 --> 01:09:54,060
I'll do it myself.

2447
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:54,481
You know,

2448
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,231
and sort of,

2449
01:09:55,231 --> 01:09:56,190
I think Dick Cheney said,

2450
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:57,370
let's just go ahead and take the same

2451
01:09:59,070 --> 01:09:59,281
dick.

2452
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:01,260
Cheney just went in and stole everything.

2453
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,760
There's Darth Vader,

2454
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:03,541
real life man.

2455
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:03,980
So yeah,

2456
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,600
it's fucking hard.

2457
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,610
Doesn't even have a pulse.

2458
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:06,890
No,

2459
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:07,681
he doesn't have a policy.

2460
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:10,470
He's got some crazy pacemaker
in him to keep him alive.

2461
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,000
Like what doctor thinks?

2462
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:13,650
It's a good idea to keep that do it alive.

2463
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:14,630
Oh my God.

2464
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,980
And Hollywood animatronics.

2465
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,390
Yeah.

2466
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:17,191
Jesus Christ.

2467
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:19,400
What do you want them to be
around to influence John Horn?

2468
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,000
Make crazy decisions.

2469
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,500
He's had a long time and he's,

2470
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:23,161
he's done good.

2471
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:25,470
The fact that he managed to
get this far and still live,

2472
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,850
considering how many people,

2473
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:29,190
he's probably responsible for themselves.

2474
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:30,070
You know,

2475
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:30,540
that,

2476
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,670
that whole secret government
stuff with Howard.

2477
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,410
Damn.

2478
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,130
I remember when he was
always in the bunker to,

2479
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,270
he would always hide in the bunker.

2480
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,340
That was like the craziest shit ever.

2481
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,890
George Bush be out playing
golf mile underground,

2482
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:41,580
you know,

2483
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,031
cause they were,

2484
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:43,830
they didn't want to Dick Cheney to die,

2485
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:44,800
you know,

2486
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,050
was,

2487
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:45,883
it's a male,

2488
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,760
he's the guy pulling
the marionette strings.

2489
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,640
But isn't that like the first time ever
that we can recall that there was a

2490
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:51,001
real,

2491
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:54,240
like the vice president really was
sort of in control of the whole thing,

2492
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:54,930
you know,

2493
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:55,171
I mean,

2494
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:58,330
I don't remember that happening during
the Carter administration or ranking

2495
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,380
administration or,

2496
01:10:59,460 --> 01:10:59,611
well,

2497
01:10:59,611 --> 01:11:01,410
Reagan himself wasn't
in charge of anything.

2498
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:01,900
He was,

2499
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,880
he was a figure,

2500
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:03,960
but I remember he was,

2501
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:04,790
he was a,

2502
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,620
an an ad spokesman on television,

2503
01:11:07,621 --> 01:11:11,130
early days of television for things like
General Electric and big corporations.

2504
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:11,380
Yeah.

2505
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,160
Who was that guy that would
distinguish and they just

2506
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,490
bought him from the television set and
put them in front of the world and,

2507
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,020
and gave him the lines to read.

2508
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:19,741
He was an actor.

2509
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:20,850
He did all the lines.

2510
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,020
It's amazing though,

2511
01:11:22,021 --> 01:11:23,280
how many people respected him.

2512
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:27,150
It's like people that argue that Hulk
Hogan really did fight all those guys like

2513
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:27,331
this.

2514
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:27,631
People,

2515
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:27,991
you know,

2516
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,430
if you ever seen those
dudes on the Internet,

2517
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:30,330
like there's one,

2518
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,780
there's a very famous clip
of one guy and he's in a,

2519
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,250
he's in a high school auditorium or
something and he's talking to these

2520
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:38,520
wrestlers and he's crying
and he's literally crying.

2521
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,091
He's like,

2522
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:40,320
I just want to thank you.

2523
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,020
Oh,

2524
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,761
what you do?

2525
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:42,630
If you ever seen that clip,

2526
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:43,663
right?

2527
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,070
The coach talking to the players.

2528
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,160
This is real to me.

2529
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:47,994
It's real to me.

2530
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:48,810
No,

2531
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,070
he's a find that dude.

2532
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:50,461
He's a,

2533
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:51,840
he's a pro wrestling fan.

2534
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,820
It's fucking hilarious.

2535
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,800
So what should I search for?

2536
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,180
It's real to me.

2537
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,380
It's still real to me.

2538
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,110
But you gotta see this guy,

2539
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,041
this,

2540
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:02,341
this,

2541
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:03,150
this guy,

2542
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:03,541
man.

2543
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,380
You get to learn a lot,

2544
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,050
but it really is along the same lines,

2545
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,100
you know people that just,

2546
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,030
they don't want to hear it.

2547
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,880
That's most of the population
as far as I can tell.

2548
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,890
They can see it in front
of their faces and don't,

2549
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,850
don't even say anything.

2550
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,230
A lot of people are too busy too.

2551
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:17,070
That's another,

2552
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:22,070
it's very hard to even concentrate on
anything other than watching TV and eating

2553
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,280
after you work all day.

2554
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,181
It's fucking hard,

2555
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:24,600
man.

2556
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,430
And if you go to the gym too,

2557
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,151
oh Jesus.

2558
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:28,020
What do you have time for?

2559
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:28,351
You know,

2560
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:29,880
you take a spinning class or you know,

2561
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:30,440
you do,

2562
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:30,780
you know,

2563
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,930
whatever to some place of racquetball
or something and you know,

2564
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,691
after that's over,

2565
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:34,831
man,

2566
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:36,210
how much time do you
have to fix the world?

2567
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,111
You've got to go to bed,

2568
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:37,891
do it all over again.

2569
01:12:37,891 --> 01:12:38,580
Stupid.

2570
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,870
Put down a sign,

2571
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,360
you know,

2572
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,110
they'll get a job and be over with
everybody's gonna fall asleep.

2573
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:43,920
All right.

2574
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,460
Did you find him?

2575
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:44,851
There he is.

2576
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:45,091
Brian.

2577
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:45,660
That was it.

2578
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,260
Yes.

2579
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,093
Hold on one sec.

2580
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,390
Just isn't that,

2581
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,540
is that a problem that people are
working all the time and they're tired?

2582
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,150
It's very difficult to get a fucking
movement going with a bunch of people were

2583
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:54,984
tired from work.

2584
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:55,741
All right,

2585
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,510
here we go.

2586
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:56,661
Yeah,

2587
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:57,241
but I think guys,

2588
01:12:57,241 --> 01:12:59,940
how many people are not working
anymore so she got this poor guy.

2589
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,110
I want to thank each and every one he out.

2590
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:17,230
Thank you all guys.

2591
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:18,883
You're awesome.

2592
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:20,141
Thank you so much,

2593
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:20,750
Mr. Fuck,

2594
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,271
per se,

2595
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,170
of what needed to be.

2596
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,460
Isn't that amazing?

2597
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,400
That's how far the mind could wander.

2598
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,650
How do we bring that guy back?

2599
01:13:33,651 --> 01:13:36,320
How do we get turned that guy
into the coolest guy in the world?

2600
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,640
Oh,

2601
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:36,800
what?

2602
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,960
The mushrooms that would help it.

2603
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:39,920
That was going to hold them down.

2604
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,030
Now I'm thinking I got hold him down.

2605
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:42,710
Of course faith is brought out a funnel.

2606
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,670
It's like you're trying to make frog raw.

2607
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,260
I like those things they do at ducks.

2608
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:49,850
They force feed them to
make their living room,

2609
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,500
which by the way is delicious.

2610
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:56,270
You ever had that fog was going to be
illegal in California at the end of this

2611
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:56,660
month,

2612
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,160
people have decided they're going to
outlaw this fog while we've got Susan is

2613
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:00,711
wrong,

2614
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:03,290
what they're doing to these ducts that
they're eventually going to fucking kill

2615
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,280
and eat anyway.

2616
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,211
But meanwhile,

2617
01:14:05,211 --> 01:14:05,870
cigarettes,

2618
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:09,980
illegal whacking fucking
Douche bag government.

2619
01:14:09,981 --> 01:14:10,761
We have Joe,

2620
01:14:10,761 --> 01:14:13,270
did you see the architect
that just released?

2621
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,110
Dude for real team people.

2622
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:17,620
Okay.

2623
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,121
Did you see that,

2624
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,950
that architect that just released
those in the new building,

2625
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,220
uh,

2626
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,520
drawings that they're going to make a
building that looks just like nine 11

2627
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:25,691
here's,

2628
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:27,430
here's a picture of it
wrong on the screen,

2629
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,001
right behind you.

2630
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:28,660
Juiciness.

2631
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,280
I,

2632
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:29,810
it's,

2633
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:30,730
it's actually,

2634
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:32,230
at first you look at it and you're like,

2635
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:32,591
oh,

2636
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:33,940
that's just creepy looking.

2637
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:35,590
But then the more you look into it,

2638
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:36,700
it's actually really cool.

2639
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,510
Like it was like,

2640
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:37,810
oh,

2641
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,020
what was I kind of the clouds.

2642
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,100
The idea is that it sticks above
the clouds because it's so high.

2643
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,460
But it also looks like a fucking planes

2644
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,413
like,

2645
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,130
exactly.

2646
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:51,780
Yeah.

2647
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:56,240
But what kind of fucking
cloud is like a pixelated car?

2648
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:57,040
Yeah.

2649
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,090
It's kind of interesting though.

2650
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,080
It's probably a dope building.

2651
01:14:59,081 --> 01:14:59,621
Let them build it.

2652
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:00,454
Who gives a shit?

2653
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:00,920
What are they,

2654
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,480
you know,

2655
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:01,591
are,

2656
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:04,390
we are so sensitive to explosions
and buildings and you know,

2657
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:08,710
is it like Muhammad and now you can't
draw the nine 11 hours will go after you.

2658
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,573
You Fuck,

2659
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,780
oh no.

2660
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:13,000
Strange Place America.

2661
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:13,540
Yeah.

2662
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,291
The whole world,

2663
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:14,700
right?

2664
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:14,881
Yeah.

2665
01:15:14,881 --> 01:15:15,200
But,

2666
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:15,281
uh,

2667
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:15,551
we're,

2668
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:16,660
we're great leaders.

2669
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:17,351
Well,

2670
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:19,030
we're better than the Middle East man.

2671
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:20,140
Check out what the fuck they're doing.

2672
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,930
Blocks of people when they're
dancing and all that bullshit.

2673
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,990
We are less oppressive than them.

2674
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:26,943
Isn't that funny?

2675
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,270
That's like a badge of honor.

2676
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:28,631
You know,

2677
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:29,800
we fucked you less hard.

2678
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,801
Well,

2679
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:33,840
I've tried all we kiss you chartered yet.

2680
01:15:33,841 --> 01:15:34,051
You know,

2681
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:36,940
cause that's the one different to all
the other countries that they get in the

2682
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:37,391
revolution.

2683
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:38,980
They throw rocks and
bottles at each other.

2684
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:41,830
We've got AK 47 is automatic weapons.

2685
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:42,370
So,

2686
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:42,850
uh,

2687
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:43,930
a revolution here,

2688
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:45,460
it's going to have a whole
different name and we're not,

2689
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:50,470
we're also not under a religious
fundamentalists rule completely.

2690
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:51,820
Not completely,

2691
01:15:51,821 --> 01:15:53,590
but in process and process,

2692
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,120
you think you feel like it's
going in that direction.

2693
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:55,960
All the Republicans,

2694
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:56,351
that's their,

2695
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,530
that's their whole model just because
that's the best way to rape in the retards

2696
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,700
or rope in the retards,

2697
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:01,520
you know,

2698
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,230
gets a good pattern that they
can adapt and think that way.

2699
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:09,490
But if you believe like Rick Perry is
looking out for God and you know God would

2700
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:11,440
want that fucking dope
being the president,

2701
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,440
that guy,

2702
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,660
we never have.

2703
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:18,661
You seen a guy in a debate that forgot
like a primary part of being a fucking

2704
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:19,834
politician.

2705
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,560
Why?

2706
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,450
What do you stand for?

2707
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:21,941
Stupid.

2708
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:23,140
Do you have your shit and measure,

2709
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,191
memorize.

2710
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,600
You have it written down anywhere.

2711
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,160
He didn't even have
notes in front of them.

2712
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,530
You know,

2713
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,280
whether he's talking about the
three branches of government,

2714
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,940
who's going to get rid
of and he'd be blanked.

2715
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,890
It's amazing.

2716
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:36,220
And yet the first move he did after that
was to put out a thing about being a

2717
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:41,221
Christian and a about the gays don't
want you to celebrate the whole world's

2718
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:44,900
falling apart and all this stuff
and they want to see on her face.

2719
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,080
You guys,

2720
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,380
there's big issues here
and they don't want,

2721
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:50,560
they don't deal with any big as well.

2722
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:53,620
They're mining for low hanging fruit
and that's the best way to mine.

2723
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,090
That's an unfortunate situation.

2724
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,950
When I think I remember back
at some advertisements like,

2725
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,560
oh George Bush would be the
kind of president he liked
to go have a beer with at

2726
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:00,011
the bar,

2727
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:00,844
and I'm thinking,

2728
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,953
not really.

2729
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:07,660
I wouldn't have a beer with them just
to see how fucking guilty he feels.

2730
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,290
Oh,

2731
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:08,680
you know,

2732
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,040
just to see what it's like.

2733
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:11,450
I would definitely have
a beer with that guy.

2734
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:13,460
I think he's a spokesperson and the the,

2735
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:13,770
the,

2736
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,010
the thing that I always point to is the,

2737
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,230
the time when that dude
was throwing shoes at him.

2738
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,010
Yeah,

2739
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:19,280
no,

2740
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:19,580
that,

2741
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,281
he talked to me,

2742
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:21,200
he's like smiling.

2743
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,790
He had this look on his face.

2744
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,380
That to me was like,

2745
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,770
this is the first fund
this fucking guy has had,

2746
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:28,491
you know,

2747
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:29,151
in years.

2748
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:30,380
Finally he's having a good time.

2749
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:31,243
Well Tony Hsieh,

2750
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,900
just fucking work here.

2751
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,030
I am responsible.

2752
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:36,110
How much is big Mac is,

2753
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:36,801
you know,

2754
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:40,280
it's basically like he was behind the
counter at Mcdonald's and someone through

2755
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,114
their shoes at him.

2756
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:43,520
He probably hated that day.

2757
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:45,080
He probably had the worst night.

2758
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,711
No,

2759
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:46,521
I don't think that all,

2760
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:47,780
I think he's happy for a moment.

2761
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:47,980
Did,

2762
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,080
he's like secret service of following
them every day with bulletproof fast and

2763
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:53,240
fucking guns and tanks and cars.

2764
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,320
You can't blow up.

2765
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,400
He's having a good time.

2766
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:58,070
Once I was selling shoes out
of mass torts moment for him.

2767
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:58,761
Yeah.

2768
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:01,730
It was like something was
actually happening in his
life that they didn't plan

2769
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:05,480
out in advance and pull off to a t
where the whole world thought they were

2770
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,950
battling good guys starting fucking wars
over weapons that don't even exist and

2771
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:10,371
even those,

2772
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:12,020
it's been proven those
weapons don't exist.

2773
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:12,471
Oh,

2774
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:14,180
we're just going to stay for
another seven or eight years.

2775
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:14,331
Look,

2776
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:15,410
we got rid of a bad guy.

2777
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:15,960
You know,

2778
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,260
like this whole thing that's
going on in Afghanistan.

2779
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:18,501
I mean it's,

2780
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:19,670
it's amazing that people,

2781
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,080
anybody supports it.

2782
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,630
Who is a lot of people,

2783
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:23,840
man.

2784
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,040
And a lot of politicians support it.

2785
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:25,874
Obviously that's why we're the

2786
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,910
best government money can buy,

2787
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,630
but it isn't.

2788
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:30,910
It's amazing that anybody could,

2789
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,161
I mean,

2790
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:34,040
if you needed the best example ever of,

2791
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,880
of how the government and the military
are not looking out for your best

2792
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:40,790
interest and Afghanistan is it
to think that we didn't learn,

2793
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:43,310
not only do we not learn
anything from Vietnam,

2794
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,510
we learned less.

2795
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,800
This is a dumb or war.

2796
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:46,970
This is way dumber.

2797
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:47,630
Right?

2798
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,271
It's way dumb,

2799
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:48,371
right?

2800
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:49,460
Know probably last longer.

2801
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:50,600
The money was good though.

2802
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,470
You have to make the money was great.

2803
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:53,840
It's an amazing way to make some money.

2804
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,501
It's amazing.

2805
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,610
That was the whole motivation.

2806
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:57,140
It's just push the money around for that.

2807
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:57,351
Yeah,

2808
01:18:57,351 --> 01:18:58,000
I was looking at there,

2809
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,960
they had something in the
news the other day about the,

2810
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:02,870
the amount of heroin that's been produced.

2811
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:07,871
It's something like 61% more in
2011 then in 2010 it's incredible.

2812
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:10,310
And it's really a response
to the price increasing,

2813
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:12,800
so they're just making an insane,

2814
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:16,550
someone isn't making insane amounts of
money from that insane amounts of money.

2815
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,750
I invest in heroin.

2816
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:19,910
Do you?

2817
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,690
We're going to have that
Michael Ruper dot guy on Dj.

2818
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,760
Did you get that message?

2819
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,460
The collapse guy sits there and just says,

2820
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:25,911
we're fucked.

2821
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:26,361
We're fucked.

2822
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:26,841
We're fucked.

2823
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:27,650
We're fucked.

2824
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,740
Or that kind of documentary.

2825
01:19:28,741 --> 01:19:28,970
Yeah,

2826
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,511
he's going to do it.

2827
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,050
Yeah.

2828
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:30,201
Oh,

2829
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:30,550
wow.

2830
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,240
We're setting that up.

2831
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,730
You hear about the alarming toxins found
in the baby food like they're finding

2832
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:36,650
can baby food.

2833
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,880
They're finding in Japan,

2834
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:39,320
the monsters in Japan,

2835
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:39,501
they're,

2836
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,700
they're finding from the,

2837
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:41,241
that whole shit.

2838
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:43,470
There's fallout there,

2839
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,900
stuffing the baby food.

2840
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:45,861
Of course it is.

2841
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:46,730
It's probably in everything.

2842
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,810
It's probably in the ground.

2843
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:48,380
I mean,

2844
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,960
that's why when Shane was here and he
was telling us the Tokyo was two hours

2845
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:51,441
away and I was like,

2846
01:19:51,441 --> 01:19:53,330
I'm going to go two hours away from that,

2847
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,370
even going for a couple of days.

2848
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,420
That's terrifying for me.

2849
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,300
Those poor people have to live there
and that that stuff is going to get into

2850
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:01,580
their water and stuff's going to get in
their food and how many people are going

2851
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,980
to be irradiated before they
actually do something about it?

2852
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,280
You know,

2853
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,230
Dana White's going to come
back with a full head of hair,

2854
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:06,710
healthier.

2855
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,543
Your worst

2856
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,730
was no way do I think it actually
makes your hair fall out silly,

2857
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,890
but these are the lesson
back with no eyebrows.

2858
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,440
These are the lessons then
whether we learn them or not,

2859
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:17,930
that's this period.

2860
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,030
There's no way to fix that right there.

2861
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,030
That Fukushima,

2862
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:24,150
how do you say the name Fukushima
Focus Shayma you can't fix that,

2863
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:24,450
right?

2864
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:25,530
I mean that's gone.

2865
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,413
That's going fuck.

2866
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,640
And they can't even contain the,

2867
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,011
the,

2868
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:29,230
the,

2869
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:29,471
the,

2870
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:30,001
the core,

2871
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:30,241
right?

2872
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:31,960
Isn't it like melted terms of container?

2873
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,810
It'll be contained to planet earth.

2874
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,730
It probably won't go past planet earth,

2875
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,530
but it will stay on plan
it or isn't it amazing?

2876
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:41,400
It's amazing that people still will
say that we should have nuclear energy.

2877
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:41,760
It was like,

2878
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,640
what if one of these things
goes wrong every 20 years?

2879
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,130
Do you understand that in
the course of human history,

2880
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:48,150
the whole planet,

2881
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:48,984
it's fucked.

2882
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,160
It's like takes over a hundred thousand
years for people to be able to go

2883
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:54,840
anywhere near that without dying.

2884
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:55,230
Right.

2885
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,610
We have a short term memory problem,

2886
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,770
but I mean that's how
ridiculous calculation.

2887
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,400
Yeah.

2888
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,690
And yet the people,

2889
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:02,340
as long as it's in the
front of the newspaper,

2890
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:03,151
then it's there.

2891
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:04,550
And the moment it's not
in front of the newspaper,

2892
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:04,910
it's gone.

2893
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:05,440
He'd be like,

2894
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,061
Vino what?

2895
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,730
The nuclear power has an amazing record.

2896
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,301
No,

2897
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:09,840
it doesn't.

2898
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,040
I can tell you three times that I know
and I'm not even barely paying attention.

2899
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,560
Three Mile Island was that chemicals?

2900
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:16,820
No,

2901
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:17,160
no.

2902
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,510
Through my [inaudible] as well.

2903
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,770
Three Mile Island,

2904
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:20,640
Chernobyl,

2905
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,473
Chernobyl,

2906
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,403
and Fukushima.

2907
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,310
Kashima that's three.

2908
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,680
And each one got bigger than the last one.

2909
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,371
That's ridiculous.

2910
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:27,930
If you know three fuckups,

2911
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,940
you know three fuck ups in your life,

2912
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,930
that's amazing.

2913
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:31,021
Yeah.

2914
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:32,520
But we have here in California,

2915
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:34,560
our nuclear plants on
the fault line as well.

2916
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,210
What the fuck is wrong with us?

2917
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:36,870
Are we crazy?

2918
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,980
Are we doing this on purpose?

2919
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,070
I don't really like
playing chicken down dumb.

2920
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,950
We down dumbed ourselves so that we're,

2921
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,180
we're more easily control.

2922
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:46,014
We didn't do it.

2923
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:49,770
It's just like we're playing chicken w
w it seems like we're a guy or is your

2924
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:53,970
wife goes to the gym and you call a
prostitute into your house and it's like

2925
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:54,241
you're,

2926
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:55,290
it's a race against time.

2927
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,760
She back in and get the fuck out of here.

2928
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,560
It's like you almost
wanting to get caught.

2929
01:21:58,561 --> 01:21:59,640
You're a crazy person.

2930
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,330
You know when you're building a
fucking power plant on a fault line,

2931
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:03,990
you know,

2932
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,130
if I was your psychologist,

2933
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:05,401
I'd be like,

2934
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:05,670
Oh man,

2935
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,840
what the fuck are you doing man?

2936
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:07,171
Hey man,

2937
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:08,130
the land was cheap.

2938
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,050
You couldn't put that over here.

2939
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,060
Couldn't put that over
here where it never moved.

2940
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,830
It seems ridiculous.

2941
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:14,430
Yeah,

2942
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,390
it's a good spot.

2943
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,880
It seems to just as ridiculous
that we all live here though.

2944
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,780
Fuck [inaudible] man.

2945
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:25,680
That was my number one feelings for like
why does everybody have to live in this

2946
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:27,120
one spot is so stupid.

2947
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,510
And that's what I felt like when you
live in a place that only has a few

2948
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:31,920
thousand people and it's like woo,

2949
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,000
you get to breathe,

2950
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:34,260
you can fucking relax.

2951
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:34,890
Yeah.

2952
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:35,611
Why do we do this?

2953
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:36,660
Why do we group up like those?

2954
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,250
Cause we get things done easier this way.

2955
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:38,491
No,

2956
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:40,560
it's just a nature of a cell.

2957
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:44,190
Started to do that before we did that
sells lived in community and then they

2958
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:47,040
called we the unhealthy cells cause we
separate from the pack and want to hide

2959
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:47,600
in the woods.

2960
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:52,440
Well the whole idea is there's
definitely some a bad growth in the,

2961
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:53,274
in the colony.

2962
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,090
It's got cancer itself.

2963
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,500
System's got cancer itself.

2964
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,800
So when you look at the future and you
see with all the information that you

2965
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:02,131
have,

2966
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:03,240
which is far more than most,

2967
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:04,140
how do you see this ending?

2968
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,770
I think this the

2969
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,510
the greatest possible,

2970
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:08,890
most wonderful ending in the world.

2971
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,450
Let me just give example.

2972
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:13,570
For some people we talked about the
conscious mind and that we're being

2973
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:16,960
controlled by the subconscious mind and
that the conscious mind is a creative

2974
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:18,460
mind with your wishes and desires.

2975
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:18,851
Well,

2976
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:19,900
here's an interesting fact.

2977
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:23,140
Go back to a time sometime you,

2978
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:24,820
you fell head over heels
in love with somebody.

2979
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,110
I call it the honeymoon period.

2980
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:30,280
And then I say in that honeymoon period
where you healthy and almost everybody

2981
01:23:30,281 --> 01:23:30,461
wanted,

2982
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:31,600
I'm going to ask a big audience,

2983
01:23:31,601 --> 01:23:32,311
almost everybody goes like,

2984
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:33,220
exuberantly healthy.

2985
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:34,270
When I was in that pair and I said,

2986
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,221
did you have vintage?

2987
01:23:35,221 --> 01:23:35,501
He's like,

2988
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:35,681
yeah,

2989
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:36,640
we had so much energy.

2990
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:37,451
We made love for days,

2991
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:38,650
didn't even stop for food,

2992
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:39,190
man.

2993
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:39,800
And I say,

2994
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,200
it was life so beautiful that you couldn't
wait for the next day to have more of

2995
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:44,320
that.

2996
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:44,741
And everybody goes,

2997
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:44,951
yeah,

2998
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:45,560
yeah.

2999
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,393
And I go,

3000
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,101
just think about it.

3001
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:51,140
Is that tantamount to having
heaven on earth as it is that,

3002
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,750
would that be something like that?

3003
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:53,920
And everybody goes,

3004
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,431
Oh yeah.

3005
01:23:54,431 --> 01:23:55,264
And then I go,

3006
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,100
that was not an accident.

3007
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:58,870
That was a personal creation.

3008
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:03,250
And that the honeymoon was
the one time in our lives.

3009
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,520
And this is the interesting part because
neuroscience says the one time where

3010
01:24:06,521 --> 01:24:10,960
you operate strictly from the conscious
mind and don't revert to that default

3011
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:13,750
program in the subconscious mind where
you're operating from your wishes and

3012
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:15,700
desires is the time you're making love.

3013
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,080
When you're making love,

3014
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:18,910
the conscious mind stays
in the present moment.

3015
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:19,091
Well,

3016
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:19,924
why is that relevant?

3017
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:20,920
It's the conscious mind.

3018
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:22,420
It has all your wishes and desires.

3019
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:24,190
So if that mine stays in the front,

3020
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:24,790
guess what?

3021
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:27,220
Then you created a life
that was heaven on earth,

3022
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,720
but the moment life starts to get too
busy and your mind starts to wander and

3023
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:32,380
think,

3024
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,190
then you start,

3025
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,640
you go,

3026
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,680
you resort back to the
unconscious programs.

3027
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,300
While you didn't see you did that,

3028
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:39,040
but your partner does
and your partner goes,

3029
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:39,491
what?

3030
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:39,581
They,

3031
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:40,690
how can I behaviors that?

3032
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,620
Where'd that come from?

3033
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,500
And that's when this whole
honeymoon starts to come to an end.

3034
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:48,040
Because when you just said whatever
you did from your subconscious program,

3035
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,370
which may have been your father or your
mother and you didn't hear yourself say

3036
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:51,491
it,

3037
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:52,750
your partner heard yourself say,

3038
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:54,610
you didn't even hear yourself saying that.

3039
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,620
So that's where all of a
sudden a honeymoon starts off,

3040
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,910
starts to collapse is like,

3041
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,601
what do you,

3042
01:24:58,601 --> 01:24:58,870
you know,

3043
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:59,870
what are you talking about?

3044
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:00,880
I've always been this way,

3045
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:01,750
or whatever you want to say.

3046
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:05,830
It's like you start losing a dialogue
because you're now talking from your

3047
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:07,160
subconscious programs and,

3048
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,620
but the whole point was what?

3049
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:13,720
When we did operate from the conscious
moment when we did stay in that period,

3050
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,350
we created heaven on
earth both health wise and

3051
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:17,801
yeah,

3052
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:22,801
but then she got fat bitch at me about
shit and I'm tired of the fucking texting

3053
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,033
my friends,

3054
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:25,540
you've got a problem with me,

3055
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,470
talked to me.

3056
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,773
Isn't that what happens?

3057
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,060
They get tired of their own bullshit.

3058
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:31,950
Conscious mind started.

3059
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,870
Normally people too,

3060
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:33,870
you know traveling,

3061
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:38,050
it's a utopian concept because we were
talking about is this massive upbeat

3062
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,850
apprise of Serotonin too,

3063
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:39,980
right?

3064
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,691
Absolutely.

3065
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:41,261
Dopamine,

3066
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:43,720
Serotonin and easily happens
when you first meet someone.

3067
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:44,930
You want to fuck them
cause you're discussing.

3068
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,350
You know,

3069
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,600
because the question is,

3070
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:48,490
the question is why did it disappear?

3071
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:49,271
No disappeared.

3072
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:50,420
Because you,

3073
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,760
when you met that person,

3074
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:55,090
both of you were operating from
your creative wishes and desires.

3075
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,350
When did it fall apart?

3076
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,520
Is when the subconscious
mind started or to

3077
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:02,730
take over more of the operation because
life started to occupy your conscious

3078
01:26:02,731 --> 01:26:03,050
mind.

3079
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:03,883
Now traveling.

3080
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,520
Yeah,

3081
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,360
that's when it ended.

3082
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,240
So you hit this perfect moment
and then life got in the way.

3083
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,200
Yeah,

3084
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,010
and the guest one.

3085
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,940
But if you reprogram the subconscious
mind to have the same beliefs in wishes

3086
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:18,560
and desires at your conscious mind has
so that both minds have the same vision

3087
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:19,394
and destiny.

3088
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,400
Then there's a honeymoon
the rest of your life.

3089
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,610
It doesn't end then because you
put in your wishes and desires.

3090
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:27,230
So even when you're not paying attention,

3091
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:31,070
that's when your subconscious plane is
still going to play the same wishes and

3092
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:33,260
desires that you want in your life anyway.

3093
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:37,520
But right now it plays the programs that
you got from other people when you're

3094
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:38,390
not paying attention.

3095
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,910
That's why you lose
control over your life set.

3096
01:26:40,911 --> 01:26:43,430
I've always said that very few
people have their own opinions,

3097
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:46,490
that they simply have a conglomeration
of other people's opinions.

3098
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,050
It's sort of adopt it as their own,

3099
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:50,270
but they really haven't like audited.

3100
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,170
Every single one of them downloaded a
lot of them and try to figure out why is

3101
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:54,920
that in there.

3102
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,190
Yeah,

3103
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,120
and the problem,

3104
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,110
once it's downloaded,

3105
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:59,060
then you become a slave to the program.

3106
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,130
Even if you have no desire
to be in the program,

3107
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,170
it not your choice.

3108
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:04,040
Now it's unconscious.

3109
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:08,030
It'll take you there whether you're paying
attention or not and don't you think

3110
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:10,940
that same sort of thing has happened to
pretty much everyone who's in a position

3111
01:27:10,941 --> 01:27:11,391
of power,

3112
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:14,360
so they are in a certain sense
of victim of the same system.

3113
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:17,870
They've been told Randall of they were
program somewhere along the line to get

3114
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:20,630
to that power so that they were
being driven by the program.

3115
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,630
It's amazing when you really
think about it that you know what?

3116
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:28,790
One of the things I think is really
terrifying to people is that you're

3117
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,800
describing this and
people are realizing this,

3118
01:27:30,801 --> 01:27:31,551
I'm sure right now,

3119
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:34,580
but they're also realizing that this is
not a conventional idea that's really

3120
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,930
sort of pushed in the media.

3121
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,990
This is not something the president
United States addresses the nation about.

3122
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,090
And this is not necessarily
something that's,

3123
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:41,983
there's no money,

3124
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:44,300
there's no money for the
corporations in this process.

3125
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:45,170
And when,

3126
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:49,080
when the information is expressed and
you know and people know it to be true,

3127
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,870
sort of recognize it and think,

3128
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:51,590
oh my God,

3129
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:56,590
does this mean that there was no one who
has set this whole gigantic thing up,

3130
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,720
this human civilization?

3131
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,490
No one did it consciously,

3132
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,320
no one planned it out.

3133
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:06,330
They might have made the infrastructure
and planned out where the water was

3134
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,120
going to go this way anyway,

3135
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,290
it was going to go this way,

3136
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,870
planned out electricity in a pattern.

3137
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,970
We're playing a pattern
and here's the pattern.

3138
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:18,950
A civilization is a living organism and
animal and by its definition is going to

3139
01:28:18,951 --> 01:28:22,250
involve in the same characteristic
way than animals evolved.

3140
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,400
So there was a part we
went from let's say a fish,

3141
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:26,330
amphibians,

3142
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:26,931
reptiles,

3143
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:27,764
birds and mammals.

3144
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,020
The fish phase was when
human civilization,

3145
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,730
earliest phase mariculture culture.

3146
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:32,520
They lived at the sea.

3147
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,740
They had to live with the water.

3148
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:34,060
They,

3149
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,030
they couldn't live without water.

3150
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:36,650
They were stuck to wherever the water was.

3151
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:39,200
Agriculture was the amphibian phase stage.

3152
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:42,840
Why they took the water with them on a
land so they could go deep into the land,

3153
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,671
penetrating land,

3154
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:44,504
get the water,

3155
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,060
grow all the stuff and live
because you needed the water.

3156
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,073
Okay.

3157
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,700
The reptiles stage,

3158
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:50,630
um,

3159
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,720
reptiles are the only animals
that were first designed for land.

3160
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:55,160
They were almost like machines.

3161
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:55,401
They're,

3162
01:28:55,401 --> 01:28:55,671
they're,

3163
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:56,810
they're almost mechanical.

3164
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:57,800
Like when you see a lizard,

3165
01:28:57,801 --> 01:28:58,970
like it's almost digital.

3166
01:28:59,150 --> 01:28:59,990
The way it moves.

3167
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,070
The reptiles were the equivalent

3168
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,180
of the industrial age.

3169
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,040
That's when we became reptilian.

3170
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:08,790
And it's interesting cause we're still
in that age and guess what we're fueling

3171
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:10,170
this civilization with,

3172
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,400
with what they call the,

3173
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,960
the blood of the dinosaur.

3174
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:13,411
We're,

3175
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:14,640
we're fueling it with oil,

3176
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,140
which is the character of that,

3177
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,700
that reptilian phase.

3178
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,570
And so we're living a reptilian
phase of civilization.

3179
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,450
The lizards were like mom and pop shops,

3180
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,610
but they grew into dinosaurs,

3181
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,430
which are corporations and
the corporations evolve.

3182
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:31,020
And then here comes the cool part.

3183
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,510
The bird phase of human civilization
started in 1903 when Wilbur and Orville

3184
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:37,470
Wright started the fly.

3185
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:41,190
It changed the whole world because now
you can fly around in a few hours to

3186
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:41,850
change.

3187
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,230
The world was so massive.

3188
01:29:43,231 --> 01:29:43,681
At one point,

3189
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:44,580
nobody could imagine it.

3190
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:47,730
Now we can fly around it and put
a satellite around it and I say,

3191
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,400
so the birds evolved
from 1903 but guess what?

3192
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,380
They reached their fullest evolution.

3193
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:58,090
In 1969 1969 the Burj landed on the moon
and they took a picture of the earth

3194
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:06,140
and those hippies back then saw this
picture and created Earth Day within two,

3195
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,570
within a month or two of
of the picture coming back,

3196
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,320
number one.

3197
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:10,771
Number two,

3198
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:11,370
they said,

3199
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:11,881
Oh man,

3200
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:12,540
look at that.

3201
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,070
We got to take care of that.

3202
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,030
That's all we have.

3203
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,590
Got to take care of the water,

3204
01:30:16,591 --> 01:30:17,101
the air,

3205
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,360
take care of the kids and all that.

3206
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,200
Taking care is to
character called nurturing.

3207
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:25,560
Nurturing is the character of mammals.

3208
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:30,860
So in 1969 the mammalian phase of human
civilization was seeded with the hippies

3209
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:34,021
looking and say,

3210
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:34,411
oh my God,

3211
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:35,310
take care of each other,

3212
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:36,150
take care of the planet.

3213
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:38,250
We generation is what it was all about.

3214
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:42,000
But then go back in history and
recognize when the mammals first evolved.

3215
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:43,560
The dinosaurs were still here too.

3216
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,390
And the dinosaurs were,

3217
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:45,661
you know,

3218
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:46,230
the big,

3219
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:49,590
big killer things in a mammals
where the little meek furry guys,

3220
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:50,250
right.

3221
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:54,060
And the fact is they talk about
the meek taking over the earth.

3222
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:56,340
Well we're in that transition.

3223
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:58,020
The dinosaur is falling,

3224
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:00,150
the oil is running out.

3225
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,051
The the,

3226
01:31:01,051 --> 01:31:01,321
you know,

3227
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:06,321
the power that's been feeding this whole
reptilian phase of corporate dinosaurs.

3228
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,830
Nick is actually the individuals all
banded together against the United

3229
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:12,540
cooperation or absolutely.

3230
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,440
And see the young people that are taking
care of each other and recognize why

3231
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:17,390
this whole non,

3232
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:18,450
this really,

3233
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:21,210
this nonviolence movement
is almost prophetic.

3234
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:22,740
Absolutely will inherit the earth.

3235
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:23,574
That's what it's all about.

3236
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,140
That's what it's all about.

3237
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:25,640
And,

3238
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,190
and someone back then when who wrote
the Bible or wrote any of the religious

3239
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:29,760
texts that they,

3240
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,800
if they go through this already now,

3241
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:32,790
I don't know.

3242
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:33,031
You know,

3243
01:31:33,031 --> 01:31:33,490
there's a,

3244
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:35,550
there's interesting
things about that is a,

3245
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,960
I believe a lot of that,

3246
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:37,650
um,

3247
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:38,340
uh,

3248
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,780
we translate the Bible,

3249
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:44,550
whatever people think today an issue is
maybe they were writing about real shit

3250
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:45,000
back then.

3251
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,751
That really happened.

3252
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:49,500
Something happened here on this planet
or an upheaval occurred in that biblical

3253
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:53,010
time period globally and
things shifted on the planet.

3254
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:54,630
It's possible that this
has happened before.

3255
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:56,040
That we just fucked the whole thing.

3256
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:56,400
Yes.

3257
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,600
Almost start from scratch.

3258
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,080
Yes.

3259
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,650
Yes.

3260
01:31:58,650 --> 01:31:59,140
Oh Wow.

3261
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,500
It seems like it's manageable.

3262
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,470
Memoria Atlantis and,

3263
01:32:02,471 --> 01:32:04,690
and that was a natural disasters,

3264
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,200
right?

3265
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,033
That's what they,

3266
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:06,731
what we believe.

3267
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:07,730
But we don't know about the law,

3268
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:08,160
the law,

3269
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,870
the Maureen was more of
the natural disaster.

3270
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:13,360
What about the Atlantis when it's still
don't know what actually happened?

3271
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,201
It was a tsunami.

3272
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:15,520
They found it in Spain member.

3273
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:15,821
Well,

3274
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:18,670
they're finding pieces all over cause
there we're finding now every that the

3275
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:19,000
war,

3276
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,060
that the water level is much higher
than it used to be a long time ago.

3277
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:22,511
And so,

3278
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,750
and everything just like
now we live on the edges.

3279
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,570
So if the water level raises than anything
on the edges doesn't exist anymore.

3280
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,610
So we lost it all at some point.

3281
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:34,390
But there's a time that this
has happened before the,

3282
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:35,560
the Mayans,

3283
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,783
the INCAS,

3284
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,230
I mean they created buildings that
were completely earth proof designed

3285
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,273
earthquake proof.

3286
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,341
And they,

3287
01:32:43,341 --> 01:32:43,780
they are,

3288
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:44,980
they already knew that this was,

3289
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,440
this world was just going to shake
and do all this kind of stuff.

3290
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:49,900
Something was hot and they
make earth proof earthquake.

3291
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,890
If you look at these giant giant blocks,

3292
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,240
I mean they're so big,

3293
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,380
by human size,

3294
01:32:56,381 --> 01:32:57,940
I mean they're massive stones.

3295
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,220
They're cut with very intricate angles.

3296
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,030
And the point about it is they're
designed that if the wall shakes,

3297
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,350
the stones loosen up,

3298
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:09,670
but then they'll all settle back down
into the original resting position.

3299
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:10,930
Yeah,

3300
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:11,763
absolutely.

3301
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:15,550
So they designed this knowing full
well that these massive earthquakes,

3302
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:17,080
we're gonna move these boulders,

3303
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,340
size building blocks a and yet
they're designed so they're,

3304
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:25,660
their angles are cut so that they loosen
up in an earthquake and then fall back

3305
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,740
into everything.

3306
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,630
Slides back into the,

3307
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,513
the right,

3308
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:29,861
you know,

3309
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,330
the right structure was before.

3310
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,433
That's amazing.

3311
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,720
It's amazing that they somehow
or another figure that out.

3312
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:36,490
I was interested because they built a,

3313
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,790
when the Christians came in
into the Spanish and they,

3314
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:39,400
they,

3315
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,840
they took over the Sun Temple,

3316
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:42,730
which is this big Peruvian temple,

3317
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,010
uh,

3318
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,853
in Cusco.

3319
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,480
Uh,

3320
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,620
then the church that it,

3321
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:47,240
uh,

3322
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,390
and like dogs pee one
on top of the other one.

3323
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,240
They built their church on top of the,

3324
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,360
the foundation,

3325
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:55,240
which was the Peruvian temple
they built a church on.

3326
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:55,690
Wow.

3327
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:56,501
And it's interesting.

3328
01:33:56,501 --> 01:34:01,060
Three earthquakes have demolished the
church each time and in three earthquakes,

3329
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,670
not one thing happened to
the foundational building,

3330
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:04,930
which was the Peruvian temple.

3331
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,040
Wow.

3332
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:06,580
Yeah.

3333
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:07,413
That's amazing.

3334
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:07,571
Yeah,

3335
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:08,340
it's totally a,

3336
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,250
they knew all this stuff.

3337
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,450
There was great technology.

3338
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:12,070
There was a lot of stuff
happening in those,

3339
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,300
there's something that,

3340
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,000
there are civilizations that
we don't talk about in history.

3341
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,200
Books are history,

3342
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:18,010
book talks about,

3343
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:18,400
Oh,

3344
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,181
the Middle East,

3345
01:34:19,181 --> 01:34:19,360
uh,

3346
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,810
Babylon and all that kind of stuff.

3347
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:23,980
It was a source and it's like there were
civilizations that were here and died

3348
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:27,220
out that were much more
advanced before that.

3349
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:27,880
I believe that.

3350
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,260
Yeah.

3351
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:28,451
Oh,

3352
01:34:28,451 --> 01:34:29,480
they got enough archaeology.

3353
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,700
I'm just showing that now.

3354
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:31,691
There's,

3355
01:34:31,691 --> 01:34:33,610
there's definitely some
evidence that points to that.

3356
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,510
A new everything.

3357
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,440
Everything's being revised.

3358
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:36,550
That's the greatest thing about that.

3359
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:39,080
Every part of our
knowledge is being revised.

3360
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:41,110
And that's another thing that
people are fighting against.

3361
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:41,470
Um,

3362
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:41,741
you know,

3363
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:44,740
when you were talking about people who
are academics who have been teaching a

3364
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:45,251
certain thing,

3365
01:34:45,251 --> 01:34:46,084
most of their lives,

3366
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:46,391
you know,

3367
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:48,280
that happened with a lot of this,

3368
01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:48,610
uh,

3369
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:49,290
the train,

3370
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,860
the people that are trying
to predate the Sphinx.

3371
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:51,770
So you'll wear he,

3372
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,690
oh yeah.

3373
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:53,981
To me.

3374
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,200
That's a perfect example
because these people,

3375
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:57,530
these Egyptologists like,

3376
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:57,711
you know,

3377
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:57,980
where's

3378
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,690
this evidence of this culture and there,

3379
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,141
you know,

3380
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:00,501
and like,

3381
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:00,741
man,

3382
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:04,220
how much evidence you really think there
would be if you're really talking about

3383
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:07,130
34,000 years ago or something like that
and like how much evidence is there

3384
01:35:07,131 --> 01:35:07,964
going to be?

3385
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:10,160
What's really going to be anything
other than blocks of stone?

3386
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,240
I mean,

3387
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,320
when we let go of a city,

3388
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:14,840
how long did it take before their
things back into sand again?

3389
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:15,920
It doesn't take long.

3390
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:16,191
No,

3391
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:16,881
not at all at all.

3392
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:17,061
I mean,

3393
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:19,790
how long would a car last
and left a car outside?

3394
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:20,970
It will last.

3395
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:23,870
Even I'm old enough to have a few cars
I've left in the woods that are probably

3396
01:35:23,871 --> 01:35:24,590
not there anymore.

3397
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:25,191
Yeah,

3398
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:25,551
right.

3399
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:25,971
Yeah,

3400
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:26,800
right.

3401
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,190
You remember when kids used to do that?

3402
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,760
I remember when dudes used to have cars
that would just sit on blocks and you'd

3403
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:33,680
see fucking trees growing in their car.

3404
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,560
We had a,

3405
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,800
a mountain near where we lived
and we'd go by these junkers,

3406
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:38,130
you know,

3407
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:42,240
cars that were burning oil and people
didn't want really pay 10 15 bucks,

3408
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,430
drive him up to the top of this hill.

3409
01:35:44,431 --> 01:35:44,870
And then we,

3410
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:47,450
we use them like a dirt track and it just,

3411
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:47,940
you know,

3412
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:51,180
cut through the weeds and all kinds of
stuff like that and just random into the

3413
01:35:51,181 --> 01:35:52,050
ground until they finally,

3414
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:56,010
so it was like 10 or 15 bucks for the
investment and then spend a day or two

3415
01:35:56,011 --> 01:35:56,520
plane,

3416
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,120
you know,

3417
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:57,390
uh,

3418
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:57,750
bumper

3419
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:58,650
cars stuff up

3420
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,190
before we were aware that
we could hurt ourselves.

3421
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,290
When you're young and silly.

3422
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:08,390
I friend of mine had a van and
he parked it in his garage.

3423
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,810
He never fucking used it.

3424
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:10,081
Just,

3425
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:11,850
it was all broken down a junkie.

3426
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,390
And one day we went into it and there
was a plant growing out of his floor mat

3427
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,750
and almost like I was
looking at it as like,

3428
01:36:18,751 --> 01:36:18,991
dude,

3429
01:36:18,991 --> 01:36:19,940
nature's gonna eat this.

3430
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:23,310
Nature's going to slowly figure
out a way to eat your truck.

3431
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:23,850
It just,

3432
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:28,850
we're seeing like day 70 something
that's going to take a million days,

3433
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:33,060
but it'll eat this fucking thing
that's going to be nothing left to say.

3434
01:36:33,061 --> 01:36:34,170
What would there'd be leftover things.

3435
01:36:34,171 --> 01:36:37,470
It's like most of our stones stuff
will be gone in a short time.

3436
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:37,741
Yeah,

3437
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:38,570
just stone.

3438
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:39,403
That's about it.

3439
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:42,690
Which is really terrifying to me because
now we're moving into this digital era

3440
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:46,500
and everything is getting put down
on ones and Zeros data that you have,

3441
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:50,520
and we're also going to hit an air of
sunspot activity that's going to be

3442
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,421
courageous,

3443
01:36:51,421 --> 01:36:52,850
which means all that memory going to go,

3444
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:53,850
oh,

3445
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:54,930
that's so ridiculous.

3446
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:58,710
Could you imagine if that happened and
it was just some super big gamma burst at

3447
01:36:58,711 --> 01:36:59,700
fucking erased.

3448
01:36:59,701 --> 01:37:00,960
Everyone's hard drive.

3449
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:03,150
Everyone all over the world.

3450
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:03,571
Not,

3451
01:37:03,571 --> 01:37:03,871
not,

3452
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:04,091
you know,

3453
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:05,690
I didn't know it was a question anymore.

3454
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,950
We go right back to
fucking from Wikipedia.

3455
01:37:07,951 --> 01:37:10,350
We have to go find some
books in a library and Shit.

3456
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,101
Wander the desert.

3457
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:12,300
40 years in darkness.

3458
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,800
That's a God damn.

3459
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:15,061
If that happens,

3460
01:37:15,061 --> 01:37:16,110
I don't know what I want to do.

3461
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:16,981
I really don't know.

3462
01:37:16,981 --> 01:37:18,690
I don't know if I want
to get swept up in the,

3463
01:37:18,691 --> 01:37:19,081
in the,

3464
01:37:19,081 --> 01:37:19,621
in the,

3465
01:37:19,621 --> 01:37:23,370
in the fucking hurricanes that kill
people or if I want to try to help my DVD

3466
01:37:23,371 --> 01:37:23,890
player,

3467
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:24,161
my,

3468
01:37:24,161 --> 01:37:24,441
uh,

3469
01:37:24,441 --> 01:37:26,170
and my television keep working,

3470
01:37:26,171 --> 01:37:26,800
cause I'll,

3471
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,810
I'll just watch movies
as a sunset continues

3472
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,210
really just hanging out on a hilltop
and think you'd be comfortable.

3473
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:34,900
Hilltop by yourself.

3474
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:37,090
How long if you knew that the
rest of the world was dead,

3475
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,060
where the rest of you were like that dude,

3476
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:40,630
remember Ernest Borgnine?

3477
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,201
Oh yeah,

3478
01:37:41,201 --> 01:37:42,160
the twilight zone.

3479
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:43,031
I remember that.

3480
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:47,410
He was so happy that the exploded cause
he was inside of a vault and he came out

3481
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:47,970
and he's like,

3482
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:48,820
all these books.

3483
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:51,040
I could read these books and he
dropped his glasses and broke them.

3484
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:52,510
Oh know there's a problem.

3485
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,050
Yeah.

3486
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:53,350
Yeah.

3487
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:56,160
But he was so excited before that
he was so excited to be alone

3488
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,790
with books.

3489
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,290
Do you think you could rock it like that?

3490
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,460
I could do it for a period of time.

3491
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:00,600
I did it in the Caribbean a lot.

3492
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:01,600
So that was by yourself?

3493
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,060
Oh yeah.

3494
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,610
That's my line.

3495
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:04,530
Never got fulfilled.

3496
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:05,910
I am by myself.

3497
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:07,140
So what would you do down there?

3498
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:07,921
Oh Man.

3499
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:10,140
Well those first thing,

3500
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:13,350
I started living more outdoors than I
ever did before because I was always a

3501
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:14,340
laboratory scientist.

3502
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:16,710
So it was like by yourself down there.

3503
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,570
He didn't have any
interaction with people.

3504
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:20,280
You know I taught a class with,

3505
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:21,350
no,

3506
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:21,630
no,

3507
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,150
no.

3508
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:22,860
He got,

3509
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,320
when we're talking about like if
you were the last dude on earth,

3510
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:26,550
how long would be able to deal with it?

3511
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:26,760
He's,

3512
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,140
I know he's teaching that class.

3513
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:28,974
It's such a,

3514
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:30,040
it's such a big difference.

3515
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,350
It'd be like a Tom Hanks castaway thing.

3516
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,770
It probably wouldn't last
very long in a good state.

3517
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,161
Yeah.

3518
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:38,010
You would commit suicide
and be friends with a ball.

3519
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,083
You'd be angry.

3520
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,120
You get angry after a while.

3521
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:43,560
Don't you think it probably,

3522
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:44,670
yeah.

3523
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,750
I think the human animal,

3524
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,220
and that's a fascinating
thing about people,

3525
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:47,830
is that we,

3526
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:51,030
we need each other so much that we get
sad when there's no one else around.

3527
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:53,820
Actually in biological
understanding there,

3528
01:38:53,821 --> 01:38:54,900
it's inconceivable.

3529
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:55,561
It's just a quote.

3530
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:58,770
It's inconceivable to think of an
organism ever living by itself.

3531
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,491
No organism.

3532
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:00,630
Everlyn isn't it amazing though,

3533
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:02,670
because you definitely
need some alone time.

3534
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:03,720
You know?

3535
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,070
Why can't we balance that shit out,

3536
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:06,090
right?

3537
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:06,691
Because you know,

3538
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,440
I do like watching TV by myself when
everyone's asleep and I'm alone.

3539
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:11,274
I like it.

3540
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:12,840
If I'm staying at a hotel room,

3541
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:13,470
I'm like,

3542
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:13,771
Ooh,

3543
01:39:13,771 --> 01:39:16,650
I get to watch whatever the fuck I want
to watch and no one's going to talk to

3544
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:17,430
me right now.

3545
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:19,170
Like you liked that you liked being alone,

3546
01:39:19,171 --> 01:39:20,850
but if ultimately if it stayed that way,

3547
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:22,140
you would be miserable.

3548
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,561
You know?

3549
01:39:22,561 --> 01:39:24,930
But that's what makes coming
home even even the better.

3550
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:25,681
Yeah,

3551
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:27,990
it's a weird sort of a
pulsating back and forth thing.

3552
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,660
Just like everything
seems to be Mr Lipton.

3553
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:31,920
And why is it all go like that?

3554
01:39:31,921 --> 01:39:32,850
There's a pull and a push.

3555
01:39:32,851 --> 01:39:33,061
There's a,

3556
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:34,500
there's a battle going on right now.

3557
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:35,700
Everything is vibration job.

3558
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,080
How do we fix this fucking thing?

3559
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:39,000
Start thinking differently.

3560
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:44,490
You start thinking in a way of let's start
living in harmony with each other and

3561
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:46,290
let go of the stuff that's
easy for you to say that.

3562
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,900
What about people with bills and
people live in Shitty neighborhoods.

3563
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:49,261
They just,

3564
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:50,560
pretty soon all that said,

3565
01:39:50,561 --> 01:39:51,450
it's going to fall apart.

3566
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:52,250
This is the right,

3567
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:55,380
I really believe we are going
to go into a state of chaos,

3568
01:39:55,381 --> 01:39:56,580
not that far into the future.

3569
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,570
So my fear factor,

3570
01:39:57,571 --> 01:39:58,320
money fucked.

3571
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,980
It's no good.

3572
01:39:58,980 --> 01:39:59,910
No spend it now.

3573
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:03,180
One of the things you want right now
because it won't be worth anything soon.

3574
01:40:03,181 --> 01:40:04,740
Right now the money's not
going to be worth anything.

3575
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:07,200
When do you think money's going to not
going to be worth anything if you cause

3576
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:08,600
that's how we can manipulate it or not.

3577
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,470
But I'm saying like how much
time do we have left to buy?

3578
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:11,304
Shit,

3579
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,710
seven months.

3580
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:14,940
How much time do you think?

3581
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:15,631
I have no idea,

3582
01:40:15,631 --> 01:40:18,240
but it's surprising to me how fast
some of the changes have occurred.

3583
01:40:18,241 --> 01:40:19,074
So since like,

3584
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:19,590
uh,

3585
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:20,021
because the,

3586
01:40:20,021 --> 01:40:21,540
the book I'm an evolution that I,

3587
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:23,610
that I wrote was what,

3588
01:40:23,611 --> 01:40:23,850
uh,

3589
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:28,080
just a couple of years ago and stuff
that I was talking about is now beginning

3590
01:40:28,081 --> 01:40:29,040
to manifest already,

3591
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:31,230
especially with like occupy Wall Street,

3592
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:32,880
meaning people are
pulling out of the system.

3593
01:40:32,881 --> 01:40:33,720
And that's all it begins.

3594
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:35,870
It's once they start
pulling out critical level,

3595
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:36,750
the system will stop.

3596
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:37,501
Yeah,

3597
01:40:37,501 --> 01:40:39,740
but how are they pulling out
of the system by just like us?

3598
01:40:39,741 --> 01:40:40,440
They're not,

3599
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,180
they're not even being
able to participate.

3600
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:43,500
They can even get a damn job.

3601
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:44,820
How those people eating,

3602
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:46,500
how's that all working people,

3603
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:47,220
community,

3604
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:49,950
community or feeding them
and community is the,

3605
01:40:49,951 --> 01:40:53,040
is the necessary step of evolution
and that's what will keep people,

3606
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,010
if people

3607
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,270
learn to live in community,

3608
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:56,680
they'll always be a support system.

3609
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:58,270
But if they tried to do
it without community,

3610
01:40:58,271 --> 01:40:58,871
it's not going to work.

3611
01:40:58,871 --> 01:41:01,540
But that's what seems to be going on with
this occupy Wall Street thing is that

3612
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:01,781
there's,

3613
01:41:01,781 --> 01:41:04,690
this is the biggest number of people
that are willing to hang out together,

3614
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:08,200
outdoors that I've ever
seen and it has become,

3615
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:10,360
they are United in this like,

3616
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:10,680
uh,

3617
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:10,990
are,

3618
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:11,980
you know Jamie Kilstein,

3619
01:41:11,981 --> 01:41:13,690
you remember Jamie Kelsey
or for the podcast?

3620
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:14,381
My buddy,

3621
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:14,951
he's a,

3622
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:16,780
he's an auto every fucking day.

3623
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:17,471
I look at his Twitter,

3624
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:17,641
it's,

3625
01:41:17,641 --> 01:41:18,130
you know,

3626
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:18,990
it's pound sign.

3627
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:19,311
Oh,

3628
01:41:19,311 --> 01:41:19,781
ws.

3629
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:21,820
Like everything is occupy Wall Street.

3630
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,290
Even went to Australia.

3631
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:25,120
We was on vacation over there are working,

3632
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:25,901
I don't know what he was doing,

3633
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:28,720
but he went to occupy Melbourne and
we like to settle the fuck down.

3634
01:41:28,721 --> 01:41:29,620
It's not even your country.

3635
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,431
You know,

3636
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:32,020
you don't even know
what their argument is.

3637
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:32,291
You know,

3638
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,030
maybe you'd be on the
banker side over here,

3639
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,020
you know,

3640
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:35,320
I dunno,

3641
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,153
I'm just talking shit.

3642
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,050
But um,

3643
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:37,350
it's,

3644
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:40,630
it's amazing how much like
it becomes a community.

3645
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:41,710
It really becomes,

3646
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:42,011
you know,

3647
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:44,080
all these people that are
supporting occupy Wall Street,

3648
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:48,540
they're United in this thing and they
feel like they are the only thing that is

3649
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:49,850
going to stop the tyranny there.

3650
01:41:49,851 --> 01:41:53,620
The only thing that's going
to step forward and say
enough is enough and that's

3651
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:55,420
hopefully something comes out of it.

3652
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:56,210
But no one knows.

3653
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:58,120
Motion of humanity is community.

3654
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:00,190
It doesn't work if it's not community.

3655
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:03,040
So basically that's the
motivation and look at,

3656
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:05,470
look at the consequence of
this isn't the reason it is.

3657
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,710
We have been systematically
deprived of community over time.

3658
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:09,791
At first,

3659
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:10,121
you know,

3660
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,170
local neighborhoods.

3661
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:15,160
And then even in a family home when they
put the telephone and televisions in

3662
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:16,000
there and all of a sudden,

3663
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:16,750
uh,

3664
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:18,970
the families not even
working as a community,

3665
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,530
it was the last piece of it.

3666
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:22,480
And now all of a sudden there
was no community anywhere.

3667
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:23,190
And that's why.

3668
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,810
So you think the television
families watching television,

3669
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:26,111
rob,

3670
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:31,111
some of the community at some point it
did because she's in blocking some of it.

3671
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:32,380
Can you watch like one show?

3672
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:32,591
Oh,

3673
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:33,360
I love it.

3674
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,230
I watch it.

3675
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:34,931
I watched the news.

3676
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:35,890
I watch John Stewart.

3677
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:36,430
Yes.

3678
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:38,560
My only tell them 30 rock.

3679
01:42:38,561 --> 01:42:39,590
I need to laugh every now and then.

3680
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:39,970
Well,

3681
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,411
John's tour,

3682
01:42:40,411 --> 01:42:40,901
it's hilarious.

3683
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:41,191
And that,

3684
01:42:41,191 --> 01:42:46,191
that shows the perfect example for me
of what up comic can do with just the

3685
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:48,010
regular real news,

3686
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:50,130
the real reality of this
world that we live in,

3687
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:51,090
in especially in,

3688
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:51,550
in,

3689
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:53,470
and do it dress like them.

3690
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:53,801
You know,

3691
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:55,930
where he suits sitting in
front of a death like them.

3692
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,830
I just tell him,

3693
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:59,170
just telling the truth has
become humorous at some point,

3694
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:00,004
isn't it?

3695
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:01,420
The way John's tour does it?

3696
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,513
Yeah,

3697
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:03,310
yeah.

3698
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:03,701
So,

3699
01:43:03,701 --> 01:43:04,534
uh,

3700
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,310
so what do you suggest that people do it?

3701
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:07,420
They have to change the way they think.

3702
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:08,800
They have to buy your book.

3703
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:09,191
No,

3704
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:09,670
no,

3705
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:09,851
no.

3706
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:11,830
They have to buy anything
just to work folks.

3707
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:16,870
Delis now it's called the biology
of belief by Bruce Lipton,

3708
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:17,801
phd.

3709
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:18,760
And that's very important,

3710
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:21,880
that phd part because there was
something there at one point.

3711
01:43:21,881 --> 01:43:22,181
All right.

3712
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:23,260
That was more than you stupid.

3713
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:24,693
Where'd you go to school?

3714
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:25,990
Uh,

3715
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:26,680
graduate schools,

3716
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,130
University of Virginia and was that in
the during the summer of love and all

3717
01:43:30,131 --> 01:43:30,480
that crap.

3718
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,021
So they,

3719
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:31,300
and,

3720
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:31,520
and,

3721
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,210
and so,

3722
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:34,930
so unfortunate because those
would like to see that happen.

3723
01:43:34,931 --> 01:43:38,380
Like Hunter Thompson had
that great line about,

3724
01:43:38,381 --> 01:43:38,651
you know,

3725
01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:40,000
seeing that,

3726
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:40,281
uh,

3727
01:43:40,281 --> 01:43:42,270
and then seeing the tide roll back,

3728
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,911
you know,

3729
01:43:42,911 --> 01:43:43,361
and seeing,

3730
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:44,380
seeing it the one time,

3731
01:43:44,381 --> 01:43:48,250
like being in during the 60s and San
Francisco and the acid culture and seeing

3732
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:50,910
what's possible and then
seeing it all pulled back.

3733
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:51,510
Yeah,

3734
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,950
it was,

3735
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,160
what

3736
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,000
is it like to you?

3737
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:55,760
It was the most exciting
time I can experience that.

3738
01:43:55,761 --> 01:43:58,520
I have experience on this planet because
every day we get up and we didn't know

3739
01:43:58,521 --> 01:43:59,620
what was something was,

3740
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:03,260
we knew something was going to happen
every day cause everybody's like,

3741
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:04,161
it was on the edge.

3742
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,480
It was like beginning to burn.

3743
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:06,800
So something was happening.

3744
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:08,400
It wasn't like to mean
to a person who didn't,

3745
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:08,730
you know,

3746
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:09,170
I'm,

3747
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:09,921
I don't,

3748
01:44:09,921 --> 01:44:14,510
I'm not that familiar with like what
it felt like when you say like that

3749
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:15,560
something was going to happen.

3750
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,461
What was going on?

3751
01:44:16,461 --> 01:44:17,630
This was the Vietnam War.

3752
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:20,720
The Vietnam War was going and there
were protests against the war.

3753
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:22,790
The first one was students,

3754
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:23,510
uh,

3755
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:26,600
congregated together against
parents and the community.

3756
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:27,441
Uh,

3757
01:44:27,441 --> 01:44:27,851
and uh,

3758
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:32,110
and so there was like occupy Wall Street
with a little bit more anger to it a

3759
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,953
little bit more,

3760
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,351
you know,

3761
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:34,490
real heavy,

3762
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:36,320
heavy protests going on much more.

3763
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:36,681
Oh,

3764
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:38,190
it was because of the,

3765
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:38,601
yeah,

3766
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:39,380
absolutely.

3767
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:42,620
And at some point is because
people start to wake up and say,

3768
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:42,801
wait,

3769
01:44:42,801 --> 01:44:42,951
wait,

3770
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:43,290
this is,

3771
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:43,610
you know,

3772
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,020
what's this war all about?

3773
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:46,280
There was no reason for the war.

3774
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:49,110
And then was the reason
that the Vietnam War,

3775
01:44:49,111 --> 01:44:51,400
who was the real oil oil oil yeah.

3776
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,180
And control of the drug trade,

3777
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,760
which is part of a CIA thing.

3778
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,080
And this was on television.

3779
01:44:57,081 --> 01:44:57,830
In fact,

3780
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:58,520
this guy,

3781
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,360
Bill Moyers,

3782
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:01,520
one of the best news guys,

3783
01:45:01,521 --> 01:45:02,930
cause he was like a real honest guy,

3784
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:03,530
you know,

3785
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,580
he had a program on,

3786
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:05,240
that was years ago,

3787
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:05,901
people don't remember.

3788
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:06,820
And it was like a,

3789
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:08,300
it was called the shadow government.

3790
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:11,480
And as you can see it on the web and
it's great because it's play right now,

3791
01:45:11,481 --> 01:45:12,410
it's the exact same thing.

3792
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,100
And it turned out the CIA was a
funded organization of the government.

3793
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,090
It was like on a budget.

3794
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:17,810
Right.

3795
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:22,790
But then they found out that they could
precipitate a war in a place and have

3796
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:24,770
all the local people by
all the guns from them.

3797
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:25,761
But then you say,

3798
01:45:25,761 --> 01:45:25,941
well,

3799
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:26,091
yeah,

3800
01:45:26,091 --> 01:45:28,400
but the local people in
these places in the jungle,

3801
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:29,560
where the hell did they get all the money?

3802
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,020
In fact,

3803
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:30,860
they didn't have any money.

3804
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:31,311
Oh,

3805
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:31,491
what?

3806
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:32,600
They had coke,

3807
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:33,920
morphine,

3808
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:35,300
marijuana.

3809
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,790
And so the exchange was not,

3810
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:38,551
and this was on the,

3811
01:45:38,551 --> 01:45:38,751
uh,

3812
01:45:38,751 --> 01:45:39,980
on bill Moyer show.

3813
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:43,670
He had a CIA guy there say that
they've linked up with the Mafia.

3814
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,421
And so this was,

3815
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:44,661
you know,

3816
01:45:44,661 --> 01:45:49,460
this is on the show on PBS and they'd
linked up the mafia with what the CIA

3817
01:45:49,461 --> 01:45:51,080
would carry the guns to this country,

3818
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:51,681
make money,

3819
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:54,020
sell it to the both sides essentially.

3820
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:56,330
And then because they didn't have money,

3821
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,590
they were getting paid in all,

3822
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:57,800
uh,

3823
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,401
all this,

3824
01:45:58,401 --> 01:45:58,940
you know,

3825
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,770
like coke or whatever the hell it was.

3826
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:05,090
And then they'd fly that back in and
CIA planes into the states and then the

3827
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:06,980
mafia would take it from
there and pay him back.

3828
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:08,990
So they got in to a circle.

3829
01:46:08,991 --> 01:46:10,100
But the point was this,

3830
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,330
they ended up making more money
from the guns and drug trade.

3831
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,410
Then the budget,

3832
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,460
what was the point?

3833
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:18,020
They need the budget anymore.

3834
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,820
They started operating independently.

3835
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:20,654
They were making,

3836
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,910
that's what Halliburton and
all this stuff came from.

3837
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:25,670
They started operating independent of
the government because they were making

3838
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:26,504
more money,

3839
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:27,770
creating the wars and,

3840
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:28,521
and,

3841
01:46:28,521 --> 01:46:30,200
and getting involved with the drug.

3842
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:31,130
And the gun trade,

3843
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,330
and this was,

3844
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:34,610
this was explained to
people and it's like today,

3845
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,720
the same issue with me.

3846
01:46:35,721 --> 01:46:36,230
It's like,

3847
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,063
oh my God,

3848
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:38,810
what are we gonna do about it?

3849
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:39,803
Nothing.

3850
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:40,963
It was just like,

3851
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:42,500
that's the way it is.

3852
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:43,400
And everybody walked away.

3853
01:46:43,401 --> 01:46:44,234
He's like,

3854
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,790
it's just the same thing today
with these things I hear.

3855
01:46:46,791 --> 01:46:47,001
It's like,

3856
01:46:47,001 --> 01:46:47,834
what are we gonna do about it?

3857
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:48,830
I'll think,

3858
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,020
well,

3859
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:49,801
Micah Rupert,

3860
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:50,040
the guy

3861
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,910
who we're talking about,

3862
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:53,490
who's the guy who was a
star of that movie collapse,

3863
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,700
you know,

3864
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:57,330
you know when we're talking about he
was a cop and he actually caught them

3865
01:46:57,331 --> 01:46:58,590
selling drugs,

3866
01:46:58,620 --> 01:46:58,920
uh,

3867
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,251
in,

3868
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:04,251
in bad neighborhoods and was told to drop
the whole case and testified about it.

3869
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,340
That's why,

3870
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,410
that's why marijuana is illegal.

3871
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,780
There's more money for the industry.

3872
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:10,673
If it's illegal,

3873
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,221
it's legal,

3874
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:12,690
the whole damn thing collapses.

3875
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:13,090
So,

3876
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:13,890
uh,

3877
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:16,920
there's so much money that's
being paid at every level,

3878
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:17,371
of course,

3879
01:47:17,371 --> 01:47:19,020
to the police and every other level.

3880
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:19,680
Yeah.

3881
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,000
Marijuana is one of my favorites.

3882
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,390
Yeah.

3883
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:21,800
The Fed,

3884
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,940
the fact that that's illegal
and cigarettes are legal.

3885
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,121
Oh,

3886
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:24,611
there you go.

3887
01:47:24,611 --> 01:47:26,580
It's logic falls out the window.

3888
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,031
Well,

3889
01:47:27,031 --> 01:47:29,220
the best evidence whatsoever
that you're being fucked.

3890
01:47:29,330 --> 01:47:30,163
Absolutely.

3891
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,751
Absolutely.

3892
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:32,280
It's more money at it
and making it illegal.

3893
01:47:32,281 --> 01:47:33,060
Then legal.

3894
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,790
So is there a book you recommend?

3895
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:39,840
Is there a pattern of thinking and he
recommended me and how can people sort of

3896
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:44,790
a wake themselves up out of the state
they're in now and and sort of evolve past

3897
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,550
the situation that we're at now together.

3898
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:47,220
Knowledge.

3899
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:48,150
Knowledge is power.

3900
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:50,900
We've got to start looking at the
knowledge that we got to burn.

3901
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:53,220
Also like you have to have an ethic.

3902
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:54,540
You have to have a way of thinking.

3903
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:54,951
Yeah,

3904
01:47:54,951 --> 01:47:57,020
and you have to look for the knowledge
because it's not the knowledge you're

3905
01:47:57,021 --> 01:47:58,100
going to get in conventional school.

3906
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,170
In the conventional textbook
that's selling a program.

3907
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:03,740
We've been playing that program for
years and that's why war after war we all

3908
01:48:03,741 --> 01:48:03,981
go,

3909
01:48:03,981 --> 01:48:04,161
oh,

3910
01:48:04,161 --> 01:48:07,190
another war and other wars like
somebody has been playing us.

3911
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:09,920
It's so beautifully and
it's time it stopped.

3912
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:13,280
It's not working anymore
because they the the the tap,

3913
01:48:13,281 --> 01:48:14,420
the system dry.

3914
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:16,100
Now we've got masses of people with,

3915
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:17,390
there's no money for them.

3916
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:18,373
What are you going to do?

3917
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:20,900
That means that you're going
to have a movement of people,

3918
01:48:20,901 --> 01:48:24,320
that it's just like the haves and
have nots and there are so imbalanced.

3919
01:48:24,321 --> 01:48:25,250
99 one man.

3920
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:26,180
And so eventually,

3921
01:48:26,181 --> 01:48:27,380
somehow or another,

3922
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:30,320
it's going to work itself out
probably when the old people die.

3923
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:33,860
And that's one of the best
ways of making the change.

3924
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:36,530
And you notice that just in the last,

3925
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,760
I think it was eight years,

3926
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:38,001
six,

3927
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:38,834
eight years,

3928
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:39,930
uh,

3929
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:40,280
the,

3930
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:40,731
the,

3931
01:48:40,731 --> 01:48:41,290
uh,

3932
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:42,123
um,

3933
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:47,000
survey of people wanting
legal marijuana went from 36%,

3934
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:47,200
uh,

3935
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,320
about six or eight years ago.

3936
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:49,940
It's up to 50,

3937
01:48:49,941 --> 01:48:51,410
51% right now.

3938
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,150
So it says she's in a few years.

3939
01:48:53,151 --> 01:48:53,331
You know,

3940
01:48:53,331 --> 01:48:57,110
we're the older group that's
got their claws onto the system,

3941
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,621
uh,

3942
01:48:57,621 --> 01:48:58,311
are dying,

3943
01:48:58,311 --> 01:48:58,611
you know,

3944
01:48:58,611 --> 01:48:58,930
like,

3945
01:48:58,930 --> 01:48:59,390
like,

3946
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,710
like Cheney kind of people,

3947
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:04,870
because that's the most
successful way to get rid of it.

3948
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:05,150
But,

3949
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:09,380
but the best thing that's going to happen
is recognizing if you stop playing the

3950
01:49:09,381 --> 01:49:10,430
economic game with them,

3951
01:49:10,431 --> 01:49:11,600
get out of their game,

3952
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,130
they can't survive.

3953
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:13,880
Right?

3954
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,110
And so that's why a whole new economy
and a whole new way of communicating in a

3955
01:49:18,111 --> 01:49:22,910
whole new way of community is what is
the evolutionary point of disconnect from

3956
01:49:22,911 --> 01:49:25,430
the structure and a rebuilding
of something new and better.

3957
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,570
How long is this going to take?

3958
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:27,441
A few years.

3959
01:49:27,441 --> 01:49:28,041
Not very many,

3960
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:29,270
I'd say within a decade.

3961
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,150
Wow.

3962
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:30,451
Yeah,

3963
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:31,284
it's going to happen.

3964
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,300
We're going to have a
total new government,

3965
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:36,580
something that was going to be such an
upheaval that something it will not,

3966
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:38,990
it will not be anywhere of what
it is right now within a decade.

3967
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:39,991
Well listen man,

3968
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:41,960
I know you have a a
that you have to catch.

3969
01:49:41,961 --> 01:49:42,240
Yeah.

3970
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:42,631
So,

3971
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:42,980
uh,

3972
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:45,810
we're gonna we'll come back cause I
have to talk about some other stuff,

3973
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:49,210
but I want to thank you very much for
coming on the podcast and I want to tell

3974
01:49:49,211 --> 01:49:50,200
people to buy your book.

3975
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:52,120
It's called the biology of belief.

3976
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:54,040
Bruce h Lipton,

3977

no.

3993
01:50:10,211 --> 01:50:11,470
This is another community.

3994
01:50:11,471 --> 01:50:11,780
And,

3995
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,320
