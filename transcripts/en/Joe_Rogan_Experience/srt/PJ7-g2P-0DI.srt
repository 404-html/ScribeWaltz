1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,060
I had my wisdom teeth pulled,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,020
same kind of thing.

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,960
Excellent doctor,

5
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:05,251
right?

6
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,860
He prescribed me like 60 vicodins.

7
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,570
The next day I was eating burritos.

8
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:09,961
It was like,

9
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,201
wow,

10
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:10,441
this is.

11
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:12,300
I was expecting this
worst pain in my life.

12
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,040
Everybody told me it was going
to be the worst thing ever.

13
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,990
The wisdom teeth getting pulled was I was,

14
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,750
I was prepared for hell
and I woke up the next day.

15
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,351
It was like,

16
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,280
this is great.

17
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,060
And I literally had those pills in my,

18
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,100
in my cabinet forever until I figured out,

19
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,500
and this was like 20 something years ago
that a half a vicodin and a and a glass

20
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,260
of whiskey is so good time for awhile,

21
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,253
you know what I mean?

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,400
And so I came very close to becoming
like kind of strung out there on pills

23
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,110
until I caught myself literally like,

24
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:40,591
wait a minute,

25
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,490
this is getting out of hand.

26
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,893
And I was able to just,

27
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,511
you know,

28
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:43,820
I was.

29
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,450
I luckily have that kind of personality.

30
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,700
I've never been really
super addictive personality,

31
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:51,240
so I've been able to recognize a few
times when I got close to like this could

32
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:51,860
get out of hand.

33
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,190
Yeah.

34
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,460
The luckily man,

35
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,500
I tell people that I smoked crack once.

36
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,023
What was that like?

37
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,900
It was,

38
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,890
it was bananas.

39
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,510
It was like the craziest,

40
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,610
greatest rush for like 35,

41
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:07,611
40 seconds and then it was gone and it
was like I wanted more and a guy I used

42
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,330
to live with,

43
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,330
he was a crack so I won't
even call it dealer a seller.

44
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,820
He just kind of sold it.

45
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,190
He wasn't even dealing because he wasn't
even doing very well with crack and

46
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:17,580
that's,

47
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:17,820
you know,

48
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,631
I don't even understand,

49
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,320
but.

50
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,830
So like one night I was just kinda chipped
off a piece and as I smoke some crack

51
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:22,981
man,

52
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:23,814
I was curious man.

53
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,520
But I recognized right away though.

54
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,800
I guess I know why people lose
their lives behind this shit.

55
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
New Small crack.

56
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,660
Yeah.

57
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,493
What was that like?

58
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,640
I didn't like it.

59
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,630
I thought it was just,

60
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,550
it smelled weird and smell is off.

61
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,290
Putting taste is not good,

62
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:37,981
but like the rush,

63
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:38,491
I got it from it.

64
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:38,731
I was like,

65
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,720
Whoa,

66
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,220
for like a few and literally 30 seconds
and then it was kind of like gone.

67
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,290
But you wanted it to happen
again and I was just like,

68
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,730
Nih fucking go in there again,

69
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,060
man.

70
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,320
It was address rather.

71
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,990
I remember thinking I would rather
do cocaine because they like took,

72
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,900
we took our cocaine made crack
and I forget how to do it.

73
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,830
Like baking soda and

74
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,770
Freebase freebasing yeah,

75
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,780
that'd be crack is just like automatic,

76
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,470
like premade.

77
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,470
Freebase crack is I freebase we're so
concerned with what kind of clothes we

78
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,320
were people who were
like really into style.

79
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,640
They're always annoying,

80
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,570
annoying when they start
talking to you about,

81
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,380
this is a,

82
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,310
this is Gucci,

83
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,290
this is and this is a,

84
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,400
this is a ralph lower end artist friend.

85
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:21,740
Somebody else.

86
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,620
There's all these older artists,

87
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,720
others get a little successful
and they have like sleeves,

88
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,140
but they're like,

89
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,291
oh,

90
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,700
I only wear these types of shoes.

91
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,880
Being into clothes,

92
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,500
there's nothing wrong with enjoying.

93
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,870
I think are closer artwork though,

94
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,770
don't get me wrong,

95
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,070
but this people that are like really like
obsessive Lee into style and like kind

96
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,310
of snobbish about it.

97
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,740
That's like a weird thing
to give a fuck about.

98
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,050
You give a fuck that this
guy has paint on his pants.

99
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,540
Like if you and I are hanging out
and you have pain in your pants,

100
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,800
I could give zero fucks.

101
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,640
Is that like a better thing?

102
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,110
Whatever.

103
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,780
You know.

104
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,270
I'm just saying if you choose
to wear a type of shoe,

105
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,300
were you choose to where
I can make fun of time.

106
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,121
Portland,

107
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:00,520
you can wear anything you want to
wear anything you want to everywhere.

108
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,300
But someone who's like
into like rigid style.

109
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,521
Oh,

110
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,600
that's out of style.

111
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,434
That's my style.

112
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,580
Says fucking who fucking who.

113
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:14,581
You tell me what the hell board decides
what's in style and not instyle wear.

114
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,420
Whatever the fuck you want.

115
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,180
If you want to wear some sweatpants,

116
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:22,120
where's some fucking sweatpants
and anyone who cares is an idiot.

117
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,720
You fool.

118
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,530
You can that.

119
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,520
That guy's walking around in sweatpants
and why don't you give a fuck?

120
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,020
Why would anybody care even slightly
if someone's walking around wearing

121
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,760
sweatpants in the office,

122
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,850
in the board room,

123
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,090
what do you give a fuck?

124
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,811
What you have to wear?

125
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,351
That weird,

126
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,280
stupid outfit that you wear
with these stiff corners,

127
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,550
these sharp edges and a
tire around your neck,

128
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,670
enough and cuff links that
are so fucking stupid.

129
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,680
You have to stick some metal,

130
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,390
extraneous pieces in there and tighten
up better with the links because your

131
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,130
scholar folds over.

132
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,360
Get the fuck Outta here.

133
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,440
That's ridiculous.

134
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,580
We just Shiny,

135
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,181
stupid,

136
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,770
hard soled shoes.

137
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,690
What do you have wood in your shoes?

138
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,600
The bottom of your shoe is would really.

139
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,160
There's wooden your shoe.

140
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:09,971
What is it?

141
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,930
Fucking 18.

142
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,450
12.

143
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,540
Are you living in Denmark?

144
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,750
You have clogs on you fuckhead.

145
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,020
It's ridiculous.

146
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,390
Why would you have leather?

147
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,150
Shiny leather on the bottom of your toes?

148
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,010
They all slippery and stupid.

149
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:24,710
That is,

150
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,990
I guess scuffling at all.

151
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,040
What's with the tassels?

152
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,150
You fucking halfway tassels
on the funnier shoes.

153
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,380
What is that extra fancy
you fucking retard.

154
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,130
A leather tassel and silly and ancient.

155
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,950
Retarded and dum de dum,

156
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,820
de dum.

157
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,680
Who cares how you dress?

158
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,170
Remember how we started Joe,

159
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:46,531
you know,

160
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,041
it wasn't.

161
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:47,611
Everyone goes,

162
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:47,761
yeah,

163
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:48,600
there are no rules.

164
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,510
One man enter six men leave
whatever we were saying,

165
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,500
but you know,

166
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,640
we couldn't figure out how to put the
different fighting sports together.

167
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,130
So whose rules to use.

168
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,770
Right?

169
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,700
And so really the basis
of the UFC was always,

170
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,673
you know,

171
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,050
no rules became this huge thing,

172
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:11,880
but it was also whose rules to use mean
now you're going to get a boxer against

173
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:12,714
did you Jitsu Guy,

174
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,130
what are you going to use?

175
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:14,580
You can't,

176
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,960
there's no rules you can use.

177
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,940
Did anybody try to gouge eyes?

178
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,640
Was that it was illegal in the early one.

179
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,480
Well,

180
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,260
you know what I mean,

181
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,900
I always would hear about
these wing Chun Masters.

182
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:29,100
They had 50 ways to pop your eye out
with their thumb and I kept calling them

183
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:29,341
going,

184
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:31,470
bring your thumbs and do it man.

185
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,390
Don't talk about it.

186
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,141
Come and pop it.

187
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:33,870
But I am.

188
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,190
What would you have done if
a guy lost an eye though?

189
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,210
Would you have done it?

190
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,120
Would we'd pick it up?

191
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,020
It was fun until it wasn't.

192
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,500
And you.

193
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:43,791
I mean,

194
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,061
you know,

195
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:45,260
the story we were,

196
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,170
we had backed off that
marketing and where,

197
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,770
you know,

198
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,870
the unified rules,

199
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,111
you know,

200
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,040
were coming into place and you know,

201
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:52,874
it was

202
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,150
well for a lot of folks who don't
know what we're talking about.

203
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,860
When the UFC first came out,

204
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,160
there were no way classes

205
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,290
and there were no rules and you could not,

206
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:00,861
you know,

207
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,660
the fighter could tap,

208
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,150
they could,

209
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,790
but no one could throw in the towel and
the referee couldn't stop the flood.

210
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,110
That was on one at changed by two.

211
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,160
That was insane.

212
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,790
But anyway,

213
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,150
yeah,

214
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,970
that was insane.

215
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,000
So what is this sort of highlights it.

216
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,250
So that's the first episode,

217
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,300
the first UFC,

218
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,470
and then from there,

219
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,310
slowly but surely rule start
becoming implemented strategies,

220
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,540
change rounds,

221
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,340
weight classes,

222
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,030
gloves.

223
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,170
Things got really interesting,

224
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,750
really fast and I'll think a lot
of people were unaware of it.

225
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:32,660
If you think about the
difference between 93 and 97,

226
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,010
I came in in [inaudible] 97
when Vito made his debut gloves.

227
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,180
We're still not mandatory.

228
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,680
They were optional.

229
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,150
Some fighters fought without gloves,

230
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,620
but it wasn't that the
case was against gloves.

231
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,360
After I saw tank knockout,

232
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,261
what's his name?

233
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
Man to a

234
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,830
tank was smart.

235
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,840
He figured out he goes gloves or a weapon.

236
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,674
I'm bringing them.

237
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:54,931
Yeah.

238
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,910
You get getting your
nutrition from your diet.

239
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:57,031
Well,

240
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:57,900
that would be ideal,

241
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:01,560
but the reality is we have the National
Institute of Medicine that we're

242
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,630
conducting these surveys every five years.

243
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,370
They call them the nutrition.

244
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,470
In examination health surveys and hanes.

245
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,690
It's very notorious in
the nutrition field there.

246
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,690
We consider n hanes surveys to be pretty
accurate in determining what people are

247
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,570
getting from their diet and you know,

248
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,170
these surveys are telling us no,

249
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,630
people are not getting what
they need from their diet.

250
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,660
The majority of Americans are not
getting what they need in terms of

251
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,670
micronutrients.

252
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,091
Yeah,

253
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:32,091
it's really hard to do so and to do so
on a daily basis requires you to really

254
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,480
eat clean and healthy.

255
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:36,030
Mean you can get what
you need from your diet,

256
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:36,511
but boy,

257
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:39,330
you have to really mind
what you're eating.

258
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,750
You have to really work at it and it's.

259
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:41,971
Yeah,

260
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:42,870
it's a lot of effort

261
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,780
and there's also the difference between
the idea of you just surviving and not

262
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,570
getting a disease and you
being at optimal health.

263
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,630
Absolutely,

264
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,171
absolutely.

265
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,880
That's something that our lab works on.

266
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,680
You know,

267
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,680
where we've got this sort of theory that
it's hard to do aging studies in people

268
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:08,000
and particularly looking at different
vitamins and minerals and what effects

269
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,050
they have longterm.

270
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,150
But that's,

271
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,180
that's one of the theories in our lab
that we've shown some evidence of it is

272
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:17,830
that you know the,

273
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,930
a lot of vitamins and minerals there,

274
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,680
their cofactors for many different
biochemical pathways in your body.

275
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:28,070
Like if you were just gonna
go buy a biochemical pathways.

276
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,750
You'll see this like massive image
come up and it's just like holy crap.

277
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,990
Like and vitamins and minerals
are cofactors for enzymes.

278
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,991
Meaning they need to be there for the
enzyme to work optimally in enzymes and

279
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,610
proteins in your body
are doing everything.

280
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,490
I mean that's what's right and
what's doing everything our is doing.

281
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,740
And so if you don't have,

282
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:48,981
you know,

283
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,560
there's certain proteins that are
important to survive right now,

284
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,870
like your sodium potassium atpase,

285
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:54,051
you know,

286
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,370
you want to make sure your heart's
getting the right signals you want.

287
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:56,910
I mean,

288
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,691
if that shuts down,

289
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,524
then you're dead.

290
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,060
You know.

291
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,270
So I mean some of these,

292
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,340
some of these functions are not.

293
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,630
Yeah.

294
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,730
So that's the biochemical
pathways I'm talking about.

295
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,691
So these,

296
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,310
and that's just a snapshot,

297
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,660
that's just a snapshot.

298
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,610
So I mean all these different pathways,

299
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,190
they require vitamins and minerals,

300
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,960
essential fatty acids.

301
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,340
I mean these things,

302
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,810
it's complicated.

303
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,630
And so cheeseburgers don't,

304
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,150
don't give that everything it needs.

305
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,501
No,

306
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,334
they don't,

307
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,463
they don't,

308
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,040
they don't.
