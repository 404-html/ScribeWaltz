1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello. What the fuck
is going on? Everybody?

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,760
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
audible.com have you used audible.com?

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,150
What are you doing? Are you just sitting
in traffic like a fucking savage?

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,580
Just listening to nothing or making
yourself listened to those assholes on the

6
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,850
radio? They're not all assholes.
Some of them were very nice guys,

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,190
but I have to say that for the
purposes of this commercial,

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,140
I don't even have to say it,
I just did it.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,950
audible.com is the best resource for
audio entertainment on the Internet.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,010
They have over 150,000
titles, uh, audio books.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,940
And they also have this whisper
sync thing that you can use with uh,

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,920
the kindle fire HD. It's a pretty
dope where you listened to, um,

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,170
a audio book and then it
syncs up to your kindle.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,370
So then you can read like up to a certain
point and you get tired and you're

15
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:05,610
like, ah, but I want to finish this book.
You can listen to it on the way to work.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,860

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,300

53
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:17,050
Zoom is not a law firm.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,430
What they do is they provide self help
services at your specific direction,

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,810
but it's super easy to do. That's
how on it was incorporated. Uh,

You can incorporate, you can form an
LLC for just starting at 99 bucks.

58
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,680

take care of trademarks, copyrights,

59
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,450
patents,
all that legal shit.

60
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,310
If you've got a great idea
and you want to protect it,

61
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,840

76
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,860
really does translate
into athletic improvement.

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,210
There's a lot of exercises that people
do that don't translate really well into

78
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,044
sports.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,980
Like how you have it, like they have packs
now. They have the caveman pack. Yeah,

80
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,480
we've always had stuff like that. That's
so funny. Oh, this is the new one. Okay.

81
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:55,390
I haven't seen that. Where's
that under? It's a, I don't know.

82
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:58,510
It was under supplements and they
have like, like these packs nowadays.

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,800
Rickles David came, man Rickles
you fights in Beltour. Oh,

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,640
okay. I get it. Well,

85
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:10,730
it's not a caveman package really like
us fighter that you guys sponsor and you

86
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,530
got, you're trying to blow them up, right?
Yeah, yeah. No, he was his nickname's man.

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,090
So that's why it's a caveman pack. Oh, get
it. Yeah. No, I got Dave Rickles cave man.

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,010
It was like on it. We have a caveman pack.
We have a, you know, gladiator pack. No,

89
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,300
his name is caveman.

90
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,370
And since we sponsor
him pack by Agra Shit,

91

weight class. A tricky way. Class, man.

92
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,950

94

We also have primal bells,
kettle bells with awesome gorilla faces.

95
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,600
We gotta get you some for 10th Planet 10
plan of Bells. Yeah. You don't have, oh,

96
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,530
we have a new monkey too. We have a
new 18 pound monkey, a little baby,

97
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,640
a little howler monkey.

98
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,940
Plus we've got a Zombie coming
out and zombies should be best.

99
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,470
Tommy's going to be huge. I want to do
a Sasquatch, Sasquatch. It's 103 pounds.

100
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,970
You got to be cool is if you could
put hair all around that bar.

101
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:08,711
So when you look at it,

102
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,990
it looks like you're holding
like someone's hair and
like I turn around and the

103
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,470
edge of it, it's like someone
got to capitated. You're
doing, let me put the cap,

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,890
a sack.
It looks like you're just a fucking,

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,350
you got two of them and you're just
chopping heads off and shit with lab,

106
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,540
the impaler series and maybe we
can make a little wigs for them,

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,920
little wigs if you will.
That would be huge

108
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,300
wigs that you can put on.

109
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,360
And then the end has to be just
like skin hanging and stuff.

110
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,850
But it's got to be balanced though.
It's going to be hard.

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,460
Well really good kettle bell would be
one that had like a rubber skin around

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,060
that was super durable, but it was like a
rubber, like a runway, a year and a half.

113
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,040
And then you gotta get you gotta.

114
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,620
You gotta get it comes with cranes
that you put on at once a month.

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
You got to take care of it. Shit. So
the new howler monkeys, a 18 pounds,

116
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,570
so it's 18 pounds.
There's a 36 pound champ,

117
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,390
54 pound Orangutang and 72 pound gorilla.

118
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,460
They're all done in these
things called poons,

119
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,590
which are a Russian series of measurement,

120
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,660
which thank God they
don't only use anymore.

121
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,900
I used to just say like one pooed two
pood and everybody's like, what the fuck?

posted a photo of? Yes or no?

126
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,830
That was one of my regular ones.

141
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,460
Good googly Mowgli. Eddie
Bravo. Good googly Mooglie.

142
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,320
What does that mean? That's a Joey d is
this thing now everybody's saying it.

143
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,780
If people say it all the time when you
see something fucking crazy, he goes,

144
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,300
good googly Mowgli
duck.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I haven't heard that yet. That must be
brand now. It's a fairly recent one.

146
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:47,960
A Joey's been doing it for the past.

147
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,160
I'm sure it's an old saying like you
remember the Sasquatch, Hannah hat store.

148
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,040
He went off about the weed. What?
Hannah? We, we didn't know what the fuck

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,220
that meant. I bet. Good
googly Mowgli's like that.

150
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,740
It's probably something that dude's used
to say to each other. I remember that.

151
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,230
You remember good googly Mowgli?

152
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,440
I think they used to say going in
cartoons a lot, actually like old.

153
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,220
Now that you're saying that, I kind of
remember that. Googley can. Where did,

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,430
okay, let's Google the origin
of good googly Moodley.

155
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,250
You think that would, uh,
possibly everything comes up, man.

156
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,150
Yeah, right. Okay. Let's
say the origin of good,

157
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:29,700
good blue moon. Yup. Urban Dictionary.

158
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,830
Wow. Anywhere for awhile. What are
you, what are you doing currently?

159
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,990
What are you play on the commercial?
It has it on there. It's old.

160
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,770
They're not going anywhere
for awhile. Great. Currently

161
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,260
Mister Magoo would say something
like that. Yeah, I remember my,

162
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,200
I think my grandfather used to say it
or something or it used to be in the old

163
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,580
looney tunes or,
well,

164
00:09:55,581 --> 00:10:00,581
it's in the urban dictionary and if
phrase used when a real thick female walks

165
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,790
by and you want to say,
damn,

166
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,250
that's like an update.
They're basically co-opted it.

167
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,040
They hijacked it. Great. Googly movie

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,370
orange.
How long is it going to take for Jelly?

169
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:20,371
D has to be like an alias to act
or just a tremendous phenomenon.

170
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,960
Yeah,
exactly right.

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Here's the origin. Here's
the origin. Great Google,

172
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,610
good googly mcgleesy and Frank
Zappa's Song Nanak rubs it.

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The song was released in 1974 the term
is now used as an utterance of great

174
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:40,250
surprise.
Oh Wow.

175
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,580
I like the wonder years definition
better. Yeah. Well that's, it works today.

176
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,040
That's the urban dictionary.

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,260
So you see a girl. That's true. You can
say something out loud. Good. And Yeah,

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,160
you could, and it's not offensive. How
could a girl get pissed off at that?

179
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,440
Especially if you're not looking
at her. Yeah. You know what?

180
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,870
A [inaudible] hanging out with a couple
of Brazilian guys and there's one

181
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,470
Brazilian guy that he says
what his pickup line was.

182
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,390
My gotch like you would just go,
my God,

183
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,500
that works in Brazil. Great.
But not in the states.

184
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh my God.
That's all you need to Brazil.

185
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,960
That's all. Yeah, exactly. You just
grab them and you just take them.

186
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,910
Girls are used to that shit.

187
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,080
What is it about Brazil that's there's
way more girls in those countries?

188
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:33,081
Like Brazil and Argentina are very similar
and that there's way more girls than

189
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,960
there has guys. In the beginning when
we first started training Jujitsu,

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,861
the Machados,

191
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:42,090
we hear all these stories about Brazil
and we all thought Jujitsu was his

192
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:47,010
biggest soccer in Brazil based on what
they were telling us. And they'd say, man,

193
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:50,250
when you go to Brazil
at 11 girls fabric guys,

194
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,010
grant humble and what I what?
So these Americans

195
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,490
and should dudes it Carlos Machado's
guys, all the Texas guys, we gotta go,

196
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,030
we gotta go to Brazil.
So in 2000 we went to check it all out.

197
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,040
And uh, it's true, there is a,

198
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,760
you just see that there's more girls
like statistically it's gotta be,

199
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,980
cause you see it and you even
see it more in Argentina,

200
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,981
I was in Argentina three years ago and
you see just droves and gangs of girls

201
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:19,540
just all together.

202
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,250
But they react different to the situation
in Argentina and Brazil. In Brazil,

203
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,660
it's, it's a lot easier to
make moves on checks in Brazil,

204
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,670
but in Argentina it backfired.
So girls are in Argentina there,

205
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,100
they're just like, they don't trust
dudes. At all cause dudes can,

206
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,290
can easily have multiple girlfriends
and prostitution is totally legal.

207
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,580
So girls in Argentina pissed off and
they're like, why should I trust you?

208
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,760
You're going to definitely have other
girlfriends and, and if I pissed you off,

209
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:51,490
you're going to go right
to the whorehouses proved
to me that you, you know,

210
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:56,410
so they're pissed off the girls. That's,
that's my experience in Argentina.

211
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,790
That's the one argument,

212
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,110
I mean against the
prostitution is that it forces,

213
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,780
it allows rather guys to not
be forced into relationship.

214
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Like how do you develop
meaningful relationships and
have children and all that

215
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:15,970
jazz. There's legalized
prostitution everywhere because
if you've got a couple of

216
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:19,950
bucks and someone starts talking Shit,
you just go, I'm crying. You know,

217
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,120
like you start going, I don't
need this. I don't need,

218
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,880
I don't need someone in my life
yelling at me just so I can get my sex.

219
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,330
I could just go right over there. The guy
that was taking us around in Argentina,

220
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:29,164
we had a guide.

221
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,020
He said that it's very typical that
you go out on a date with a chick.

222
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,990
You're just, you know, you
try to civilians, you try
and say, well, you know,

223
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,970
the, the whore houses are
always going to be there.

224
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,530
So he said he would just take a girl to
a club and need to be dancing and if you

225
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,790
know,
he'd start putting his hands on,

226
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,090
on the dance floor and trying to grab
her ass. And if she wasn't intuitive,

227
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,160
she didn't respond.
He would just say,

228
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,790
I'm going to the bathroom and just go
right out and jump in a cab and go right

229
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,030
to the whorehouse he had
no patience is telling us.

230
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,730
So that's where the girls are so
pissed because girls are used to that.

231
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:04,440
Girls are used to guys just saying,
okay, I'm out. You know? Yeah.

232
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,750
They don't have to take any,
they don't have to beg basically.

233
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,530
What does that do to a culture that's
very strange when you stop and think about

234
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,010
it, you know, because I'm,

235
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm a person that believes totally
and personal freedom and I don't think

236
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,140
there's anything wrong with someone
being a prostitute if they want to be a

237
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:20,591
prostitute.

238
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:25,420
I think if you were working at Denny's
serving people food for fucking $3 an

239
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:28,390
hour, or someone says, Hey, you're
getting a hundred bucks an hour,

240
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,900
you could fuck a bunch of Nice guys.
You know why not? Why not do that?

241
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm not saying that it should
be something that people pursue,

242
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,050
but why is it okay to give someone a hug?

243
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,640
Why is it okay to give someone a massage
and it's not okay to suck their deck?

244
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,840
Why is they have a great point?
Hey, you can pay for a massage.

245
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,140
Someone who doesn't want to touch you,
rubs on you for an hour and a half,

246
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,770
but you,
you're me that the

247
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,431
first of all,

248
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:56,000
we both know there are crazy girls out
there that would probably love to blow a

249
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,870
bunch of guys all day. They exist. They do
porn. Yeah. I don't know why they exist,

250
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:02,390
but they exist. You could say
they exist because of the abuse.

251
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,080
He could say they exist
because of childhood neglect.
That's possible. I agree.

252
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,400
But they exist.

253
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,820
And it's not like you're supporting that
market by creating whorehouses like the

254
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:11,471
market that,

255
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:14,090
that those people are going to be there
no matter what you do unless you clean

256
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:18,560
up society. So you're always gonna have
people that are off the rails. Why not?

257
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,160
That's the,
is that the big one disease,

258
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,890
because you have to control the disease
with a back massage or not getting

259
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:25,990
fucking aids. Well, I,

260
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,630
you know what crazy that you would
think out of all the people on the,

261
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,340
on the planet,

262
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,470
hookers would be the first to get aids
and they're not really getting aids.

263
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,373
Isn't that crazy?

264
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,340
I don't know if anybody's really
checking on hookers going like, hey,

265
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:45,230
how you doing? Well, you
know, you listened to that
guy you had on your podcast,

266
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,140
dude.
Duisburg he said in Brazil,

267
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,290
virtually none of the hookers have aids.

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,990
I don't know if he's going down
there with the fucking pap smear.

269
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,990
That motherfucker, I don't know
about Duisburg man. I do not know.

270
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,610
Um,
I found his,

271
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,530
the conversation with him to be absolutely
fascinating and very confusing. And I,

272
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:11,210
you know, use the phrase, uh, I hate it
when I'm too dumb to know who is stupid.

273
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,470
You know,

274
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,310
I don't know if this one guy has it
nailed and all these other doctors are out

275
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,980
of their mind and they were all
chasing a disease. It doesn't exist.

276
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,570
That doesn't make enough sense to me.

277
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,290
It doesn't make enough sense when this
guy starts talking about HIV and that HIV

278
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,124
doesn't cause aids,

279
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,840
but yet everyone else thinks does like
this is like serious peer reviewed

280
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,740
scientists that think it does. So
that's just confuses the shit out of me.

281
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,110
He makes a lot of sense though.
It makes a lot of sense.

282
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:40,010
That's what even break it down were
another debate him and Callen had,

283
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,070
I mean it seemed at the very end of that
it seemed like as a skeptical is Brian

284
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:50,900
is it seemed like at the very
end based on your podcasts,

285
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,310
it sounded like he was starting to
believe that it's a bad situation.

286
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,660
First of all, it's unfair because
Brian is not a geneticist. He has no,

287
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,130
no engineering background or no
bio a engineering background.

288
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,790
He has no idea what
Duisburg does for a living.

289
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:12,470
Like his concept of like how it all
works is so rudimentary. It's like,

290
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,110
so for him to debate a guy like that,
it's not fair.

291
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,300
He shouldn't have been doing it. Um, I,

292
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,400
I wanted to have him on because he's a
smart dude and you should get something

293
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,920
to, yeah, I tried. Nobody wants to
do it. It's really hard. I hired,

294
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,930
one of the reasons why we started working
with Matt stags is that very reason to

295
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:34,280
be able to get guests like that,
to be able to get, um, you know,

296
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,400
use a publicist to reach out and let
someone know that this is a legitimate

297
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:41,060
showed we're trying to get to the bottom
of something. No one wanted to touch it.

298
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,780
No one will.

299
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,860
One guy wanted to touch it and then he
had all this backlash apparently from his

300
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,530
peers. People don't want
you even debating Duesberg.

301
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,930
They think that it's almost like
debating a holocaust denier. You know,

302
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,220
debating someone, uh, know who,
who believes really dangerous shit.

303
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,440
And so they think that his, what
his work has done, it's killed many,

304
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:05,130
many people. I don't buy that
though. My problem with, I don't buy,

305
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:08,790
I think the truth is somewhere in the
middle, but these, these people that say,

306
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,610
you know, doozer burgers responsible
for all these people in Africa,

307
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,380
not taking their medication and all dying.

308
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,350
His points about Africa
were really fascinating.

309
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,060
He was talking about how in Africa they
say that everyone has aids but they're

310
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,050
not testing for HIV.
They're,

311
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,280
they're assuming these people have aids
because their immune system is trounced,

312
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,960
but you're also dealing with people that
are exposed to a wide variety of other

313
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,140
disorders and diseases and
they have terrible, terrible,

314
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,960
terrible nutrition and it's,

315
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,840
these people were not getting proper
healthcare and when you see they're sick,

316
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,790
if they have aids in quote,

317
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,680
at least you know that that qualifies
for them to have funds for them to get

318
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:50,220
funding. If you're dealing with
an AIDS epidemic, you get money,

319
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,540
you get money from charities for an aids
epidemic, you don't get money. You know,

320
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,310
based on the fact that
people aren't eating right,

321
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,480
you don't get money based on the fact
that immune system sucks because they're

322
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,500
in a fucking tropical jungle. I
talked to this disease expert, um,

323
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,120
when I was doing that Scifi show and
he said that people live in jungles,

324
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:10,380
like people who live in
tropical environments. On
100% of them have diseases,

325
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,130
hundred percent. He's like,
they've all got something. He goes,

326
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,220
everyone has something. And I was like,
what do you mean like something he's like,

327
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:21,690
there's all sorts of different diseases.
There's under the undiagnosed diseases,

328
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,070
there's ailments and they just live with,

329
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:27,300
there's parasites that get in their
system. It's just, it just, they get it.

330
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,050
That's like the toxoplasma thing
that we talked about. Yeah.

331
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,610
That's why it's like that.
That kind of environment.

332
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,640
How does it chick that lives in the Amazon
jungle get into a river and not have

333
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,920
vaginal parasites?
How is that possible?

334
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,750
They got to be covered
with vaginal parasites.

335
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,190
That must be a problem in the jail.
We already have them from drinking water.

336
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,800
Does it make their pussy feel better?
No.

337
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:54,801
It gives you a buck and bumpy and
Dick Dick Parasites pick leeches,

338
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,870
little tiny microscopic ones that dude's
pull out on their own level and every

339
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:04,920
time they pull it out, it's not checking
the town. You're not joking around, man.

340
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,130
There must be. I'm just saying
there must be no listen man.

341
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:09,480
When dudes pissed in the Amazon,

342
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:12,690
they have to cover their dick
used to piss into your hand.

343
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,510
You gotta cover your Dick Because
fish will swim up your urethra tape.

344
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,120
Worms coming out of your penis hole.
That's not bullshit though.

345
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,840
They find your urine and they swim up
river into your deck and then they,

346
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,110
you have to cut them out.
Why do they need, isn't it?

347
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,960
Wouldn't it be easier if
they weren't pissing? Dude,

348
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,060
the world is trying to kill you.
No,

349
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,460
but if you weren't pissing
and young little lagoon,

350
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,300
isn't it easier but can't find the
hole and it follows the river of pis,

351
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,370
swims up the river.
It's evolved.

352
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:42,180
Like follow the river like
salmon swim up to your mind to,

353
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,180
I used to have a jury about that.
I used to have a joke about that.

354
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,250
I did know there was a
real disease that did that.

355
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,230
I used to joke about it being at a strip
club and peeing really hard cause I was

356
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,130
scared that the vd from the toilet was
going to swim up river and my Dick.

357
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,850
That's hilarious.

358
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,570
But I didn't know that they really like
got something actually does that free.

359
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:05,110
We'd Rogan right there.
It is 99 Rogan.

360
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,350
There's a rat actually fish that
does that. Like a parasite cleanse.

361
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,070
A call to your deck. Okay, let's find out.

362
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,990
Swims and Amazon chicks,
which it Amazon fish swims in music.

363
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,060
You know the kind of condom you
would need? You would need a fucking,

364
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,930
NASA would have to make that condom
made out of Levi's and have to be one of

365
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,650
those condoms that are actual shorts too.
It's one piece.

366
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:32,360
They're like booty shorts
and a condom all in one. Oh,

367
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,370
this thing is got the tape
that it'd be too hard.

368
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,260
It's called the Ken
Guru. The candy room, uh,

369
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,360
is a toothpick fish or vampire fish.

370
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,270
A species of parasitic freshwater catfish.
Ah,

371
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,790
native to the Amazon basin where
it's found in countries like Bolivia,

372
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,700
Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador,
and Peru. Jesus Christ. Oh,

373
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,630
just swims.
Wow.

374
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,110
The smaller species are known for a
tendency to Nva alleged tendency to invade

375
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:08,920
parasites and parasites,
the human urethra. However,

376
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,550
despite ethnological reports dating
back to the late 19th century,

377
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:19,000
the first documented case of the removal
of the candy row from a human urethra

378
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,070
did not occur until 1997 and even
that incident has remained a matter of

379
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:28,740
controversy. Huh. So it might be bullshit.
Did they might have anal catfish.

380
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,270
Well, look at that thing. How's that
going to get into tip of your Dick?

381
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,350
Unless you want it to my shifts. That
could definitely get into vaginas. Yeah.

382
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,650
Yeah. Of girls will be in there. Fucking
Amazon Shit. Wow. This is weird. Okay,

383
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:45,100
so this might totally be bullshit.
Historical accounts.

384
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,450
Earliest published reports of this can
dirus attacking a human host comes from

385
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,440
the German biologist,

386
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:55,330
CFP von [inaudible] in 1829
who never actually observed it,

387
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,700
but rather was told about it
by the natives of the area,

388
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:02,701
including that man would tie a ligature
around their penis going into the river.

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,690
Then this are happening.
You know what that meant?

390
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,220
That meant dude's where they
had cock rings on and they
got busted and then like,

391
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,680
no, no, no. There's a fish
to fry up your Dick. Dude,

392
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,080
you sound like a prophetic to take a
trip into the Amazon and one dude's all

393
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:21,130
into bang and Amazon chicks in here. Like,
Dude, look at this man. No, it's bullshit.

394
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,480
I totally believe it. It makes
sense. Yeah. All that kind of does,

395
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:28,330
but it seems like there was only one
case where one was pulled out of a dude's

396
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:29,710
Dick.
Maybe they just,

397
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,690
they're just comfortable with
them and they just live with them.

398
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,910
They just know him.
Well, let's go Google up.

399
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:38,380
Can dirus removed from deck is probably
a kind of put it in his dick. Yeah,

400
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,420
that's what they're saying.
That's what they're saying.

401
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:45,250
They're saying Amazon
girl vaginal parasite.

402
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,403
Ooh,
here's,

403
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,890
here's something on aol.com about an
eel that swam up somebody's penis and it

404
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:56,450
had to be surgically removed. Okay, well
hold on a second. There's a fucking,

00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,310
This fish really does swim in your Dick
and you got to send this dude in there

422
00:24:58,311 --> 00:24:59,600
with a vacuum cleaner,

423
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,380
a vacuum cleaner with a camera in the
end of it to suck it out of there.

424
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,390
And then the fish is
swimming away from your deck.

425
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,970
Is this in the Amazon or what it says,
what does this happen?

426
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,590
Um,
yes,

427
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,620
it said it lodged in the penis of Silvio
Barbosa after urinating in the air.

428
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,260
Amazon River, tributary, doctor and new,

429
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:25,190
our Ahmad removes the Kundera
fish in a two hour operation.

430
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,210
Dude, he's got to keep going in there.
Look at how many there are in there.

431
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,440
Oh my God. Oh my God. He's,

432
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,450
it's like his ass is packed with Dick's,
but it's not.

433
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,850
It's this penis Packwood fish.
Couldn't you just like put a poisoning,

434
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,150
killed them all, and then
would kill you dick. Too stupid

435
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,230
and had to be something I would
inject poison in your Dick.

436
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:46,280
What did it breaks your Dick?

437
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,100
You got to let the bad man with the
vacuum cleaner go in there and do his

438
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:52,460
business. How did they deal with
it before doctors? They didn't.

439
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,640
They would just die.
They just died.

440
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,850
They just have a official living in
that Dick, you're not getting it out.

441
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,100
What are you going to do? You're going
to send a fucking fish hook in there.

442
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,980
Maybe a Sharman could do something,
put it a little baby cash flow on. It.

443
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,470
Blows some that would
probably want a WASC a dust on

444
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,910
this last year, uh, this
last, um, uh, weekends, UFC,

445
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,200
you know, who'd see? Do you know
who is who? Yeah, he, the um, uh,

446
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,630
he's a AK striking coach.
No, you know that guy.

447
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,580
He's a bad ass striking coach
and it dies or something.

448
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,470
That's Javier Mendez. Yeah. He, he
did some stuff with them to his, um,

449
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,000
I forget his last name, but anyway, he uh,

450
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,120
does dude got k owed and he
was like singing a song forum.

451
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,330
Okay.

452
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,270
Was it as fighters? No, it was the other
day. Who's taking care of, you know,

453
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,030
corners and Chet and so, you know how
they have a bunch of different, um,

454
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,010
guys who are trainers or,
or a commission,

455
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,640
guys who washing guys and who are, you
know, taking care of various things.

456
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,230
Like cut man and stuff like that.

457
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:00,660
And they run in and take care
of corners doing various things.

458
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:05,190
So they're not that night. He wasn't part
of that wasn't with that guy. Exactly.

459
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,480
So the, um, I don't know, you know,

460
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,430
it was exact a business he was doing
there anyway when the dude was out,

461
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,080
he was singing them when the Iowasca
song and I, and I, and I, you know,

462
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:19,310
I talked to him about it and he's like,
he's in the place of the dreams. You know,

463
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,170
I tried to make them comfortable
comfort while he was there,

464
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,980
at least serious about it. It's pretty,
pretty intense. You know, he's a,

465
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,020
he's an Iowaska Shaman, so he'll, he do,
he does like ceremonies and shit. Damn.

466
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,140
Yeah. Yeah. So it was, it was
pretty cool. How often do you see,

467
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,280
when we see him all the time,

468
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,840
tell him I'm interested in
doing a ceremony with him.
He'll do it. Yeah, I'm down.

469
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,680
We'll come down, we'll bring them
down to a list or wants to do this.

470
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,553
I'm not doing that with him,

471
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,030
you know, too much
troubles. Troubles really

472
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,490
MMA fighter. He's like, I like
dean. He's a good dude, man.

473
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,690
Because he retired from MMA.

474
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,930
I don't know, but I was with him
all weekend in China for Abu Dhabi.

475
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:04,020
Did he can be, he did. How
did he do? He did great.

476
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,460
He had four or five heel hooks.
He didn't win the gold medal in anything,

477
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:13,461
but he may have gotten
third in his division.

478
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:20,040
Grappler, Dude's this year. Holy Shit.

479
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,550
China stinks.
And if I never go back there again,

480
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,010
I mean it stinks.

481
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:29,730
Like literally like my bathroom
and my hotel stunk. Like the sewer.

482
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,700
It was like the water, they turn off the
water and then they turn it on. But uh,

483
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,320
the people are beautiful in China.
They're beautiful,

484
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:41,820
but they just have a problem in Beijing
with their sewers. Man. It's just, whew.

485
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,170
You walk down the street and every block
and like, whoa, Jesus, what's your,

486
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,960
just too many people, someone die
or does someone take a shit? Um,

487
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,680
I don't know if it's that it's just old,
but Abu Dhabi was amazing.

488
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,730
The whole, the tournament. Jesus
Christ, I was so much. So, I mean, uh,

489
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,350
uh, you know, Amir alum,

490
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,520
one of my brown boats thought
in the heavyweight division
and he trained his ass

491
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,230
off man.
He was ready,

492
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:15,060
he was on fire and we get to an unknown
in the first round. So we're thinking,

493
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,450
awesome. We should beat this guy. We
didn't, his last name was dop, Jared. Dot.

494
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,220
We thought, okay, we should
be able to beat this guy this,

495
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,030
because he could easily had
cyborg in the first round. Right?

496
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,430
You could easily have [inaudible] on the
first round. That would have been, fuck,

497
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,490
okay, good luck. You know? But people

498
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,480
don't understand. There's a bunch of
Cyborg. You only heard of a Cyborg.

499
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:41,481
The woman fighter Cyborg turns out
her ex husband is an MMA fighter named

500
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,130
Cyborg,

501
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,120
but there's a Roberto I brew. Is
that how you say? Yeah, it bad ass.

502
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,360
She won the absolute,
he's amazing.

503
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:52,950
This guy impressed the shit out of me.
He's so big.

504
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:57,220
He's a fucking ox buddy.
Moves like a gazelle dude.

505
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,800
It was incredible. There's a couple of
passes that he did just blew my mind.

506
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,460
I'm like running it and I'm on the plane
on the way back going over that pass,

507
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:07,680
like I can't forget that pass.
I got to analyze it.

508
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,220
It was amazing tech that was at
least 10 different techniques, right?

509
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,810
Logged it in my brain. I got to go back
and check that one out. Like, yeah.

510
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,430
Cabrina the guy who wanted
all into lightweight,

511
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:20,790
he finally beat half a Mendez man,
have Amanda's one the last two years.

512
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,750
He's virtually indestructible.
Uh, and Cabrina.

513
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:28,440
We're in the finals again and Cabrina
one that he pulled it out a judge's

514
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:30,850
decision at the end. They couldn't
sport a score. Any points on the chart,

515
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,973
they just canceled

516
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,343
about those though.

517
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:38,090
Those are weird when the judges make a
score and I don't have a real problem

518
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:38,500
with that.

519
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,240
Well, the one thing I love about
Abu Dhabi is the chic is he's,

520
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,100
I mean,
he's such a bad ass.

521
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,210
The sheet just decides to put together
the Best Jujitsu tournament on the plan.

522
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,850
He just makes it happen. He
pays for it. It's all all,
all over the world. One year.

523
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:59,560
It's an Sao Paulo, one years in
Barcelona, it's an La to China.

524
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:03,490
It's amazing. The sheik just throws
down and he makes it happen. And he,

525
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,080
he created the rules,
Eh,

526
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:11,081
the format based on what he thought would
be best for the entertainment value.

527
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,360
So he's down to evolve over
the years. He's tweaked
stuff. He's like the Japanese,

528
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:19,920
the Japanese and pride. As soon as they
recognize a problem, the fucking chain.

529
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,370
True people have no idea what
we're talking about. The, uh,

530
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:27,300
Abu Dhabi is Abu Dhabi combat
championships, right? Combo club.

531
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,350
They have the biggest Jujitsu,
no Geek Jujitsu tournament in the world.

532
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,450
They have this huge thing
and it's put together by,

533
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,560
and he sees them talk noon. Yeah. He, uh,

534
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,040
is also part owner of the UFC and
he's a black belt in Jujitsu is a huge

535
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,630
[inaudible] fan.

536
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,300
So you put together like this enormous
grappling competition that's the most

537
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:49,360
prestigious grappling,
a event in the world.

538
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,410
And so Eddie was just there
in China with war fighters.

539
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,620
So how did he do it again?
Let's do it

540
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,370
well, well, let me finish what I
was talking about. The chic is a,

541
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,790
we're talking about, we're getting to the
format, the rules. Yeah. So, you know,

542
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,300
one of the coolest thing that he
changed was the same day, Wayne.

543
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,340
He changed that shit.
And not only is it because I generally,

544
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,710
especially in MMA and pro MMA,

545
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,450
you weigh in officially the day before
and then you have 24 hours to recover.

546
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:21,340
So that's huge in deciding what weight
category you're going to compete in and

547
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,440
how you're going to lose the weight.
How are you going? It's massive.

548
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,310
If you have to do a same day, way
in, Ooh, shit, everything changes.

549
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:31,870
Now you can't have that crazy diabolical
cut that you're, you're used to.

550
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:35,470
Now it's a little different.
And the IBJ I've changed it to,

551
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,110
they may get you weigh in right before
you step the mat and if you way,

552
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,290
uh, even a pound over, boom, you're
gone. So Abu Dhabi, the sheik,

553
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,280
he, he'd add, added did the same thing
you do. Not only is it same day wins,

554
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:53,630
but you've got to weigh in that you've
got to win the day before the day of and

555
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:56,750
the next day if you make it to
the third, uh, the third round,

556
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,670
you have to keep weighing in.
It's gonna say,

557
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,250
cause it seems kind of dangerous if you
just did it right before you went and

558
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:04,020
got some guys would still probably
push themselves too. Yeah.

559
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,340
What I mean it's risky because you,

560
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:09,290
you see these high level grapplers every
now and then you see them gas and they

561
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,170
try to cut too much weight and you
don't have that much time to recover.

562
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,550
So if you're going to do a same day way
in, especially Matt Sideway and man,

563
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,280
you just got to get in the best shape
of your life and figure out what weight

564
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,710
that is and you really,
you really can't cut really,

565
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,290
or you're going to pay for it.
You're going to gas out.

566
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,670
And some people still take the
chance to though. But with the rules,

567
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,150
the sheik decided the best thing to
do to ensure action most of the time,

568
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:38,570
because no matter how you put
together the rules, you're going to,

569
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,910
not every match is going to be exciting.
You have to accept that,

570
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:42,770
but you're always looking to make,

571
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,310
make the majority are just striving
for the majority of the matches to be

572
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,910
exciting. So in Abu Dhabi,
every tournament does shit
different. But and Abu Dhabi,

573
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,000
they're 10 minute matches,
the finals or 20 minute matches.

574
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:57,020
But in these 10 minute matches, the first
five minutes, there's no points at all.

575
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,020
They don't count anything.
And the second five minutes,

576
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:04,220
that's when the points started. And
if you pull guard, you lose a point.

577
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,570
So that,
that's huge when strategizing for a fight.

578
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,490
Because when you're competing in this,

579
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,740
explain to people why the first
five minutes, there's no point.

580
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,870
So that was something that was instilled.
Yeah,

581
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:19,430
that was instilled so that if there's
no points you'd be a fighter's would,

582
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,660
would take more chances.

583
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,910
Because generally if there's
points counting all the time,

584
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:25,490
you don't want to take any chances.
One wrong slip dudes up two points.

585
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,840
Now he's up,
he's just going to hold.

586
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,470
He doesn't really think
about the submission.

587
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,660
He's just trying to get to the next round.

588
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,680
So it changes the dynamics of your
strategy and and how it, how it plays out.

589
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,840
So the sheik thought, okay, let's, let's,

590
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,710
let's try to shake it up
first five minutes, no points.

591
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:43,711
So the fighters will take more chances
and that turns into entertainment for the

592
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:44,390
viewer.

593
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,740
So that happens sometimes with
some fighters and Jacques Machado,

594
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,620
he took advantage of that.
He went out there,

595
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:55,790
pulled guard and got the party rolling.
He's like, okay, I'm going to sit down.

596
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,320
You get on top,
let's go.

597
00:34:57,321 --> 00:35:00,500
I'm not going to spend five minutes trying
to take you down. I'm not a wrestler.

598
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,350
You wrestles your whole life. Let's
just get the party started. I'll get,

599
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,090
I'll let you get on top.
I'll kick the ball off to let you,

600
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,780
I'll let you receive first. How
about that? That's all that is.

601
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,670
So in the first round guys will do that.
They're like,

602
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm not going to spend all my
energy trying to take a deep down.

603
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,900
It's not a wrestling competition.
So they sit down,

604
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,400
the problem is in the second half of
the match, if you decide to sit down,

605
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,240
you lose a point.
So the ref goes points at five minutes.

606
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:27,920
So wherever you're at the next
transition that, uh, you know, uh,

607
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,320
like if you already have the guys
back at that five minute mark,

608
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,020
they don't give you the points. You have
to lose the back and then get it back.

609
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:37,530
So a lot of weird stuff that I didn't
understand, but, but gem, but again,

610
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,820
the point of this weird, uh,
format is to make it better.

611
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,280
So the chic is always
trying to make it better.

612
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:47,650
And the one thing I'm pretty
sure he's going to, he's,

613
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,110
he's got to change that.
Uh,

614
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,840
losing a point if you pull guard, cause
that changes a lot. We saw a lot of,

615
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,180
not a lot, but a couple of the finals
were both Jujitsu guys, worldclass,

616
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:02,850
Jujitsu guys. I Cabrina and Hoffa,
some of the two best guys in the world.

617
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,260
Very good at submissions.
Amazing at passing. Unbelievable.

618
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:09,900
Beautiful Jujitsu.
Well you hadn't,

619
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,830
and their match is nobody wanted to pull
guard cause in that in the finals you

620
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,800
lose a point right away. They don't
give you, it's not the first half.

621
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,370
No point in that really good. Those
come from God just having shitty guards.

622
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,100
It comes from people not realizing
how dangerous a guard is.

623
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:26,160
If a guys a real bad motherfucker
with it. Yeah. And we saw that too.

624
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:30,380
One of the competitors came in. He's a
22 year old kid. Him and his brother,

625
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,100
real famous.
They just got their black belts there.

626
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,860
The meow brothers are like
Machita like half Japanese,

627
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:37,270
half Brazilian from Brazil,
like the kitty cat.

628
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,540
But it's like Sao Paolo meow
meow meow cat. It could be,

629
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:47,400
but it's spelled I think am I,
why does she get Brian to design a shirt?

630
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,190
Totally.
Well these guys,

631
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:54,510
all they do is pull guard and play
della haven spiral guard relentlessly.

632
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:57,000
They don't stop. That's all
they do. They're relentless.

633
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:00,570
They have an infinite amount of
cardio and that's, that's his style.

634
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,860
He sits on his zero wrestling. So
that's why he lost, he lost because Bam.

635
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,020
So what ends up happening
with this rule set,

636
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,080
which was aimed at making
it more entertaining, but
what's happening now? Um,

637
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,160
and I'm sure the sheikhs going to see
this because everyone's talking about it

638
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,200
on the Internet. I'm not the
only one. Everyone's talking,

639
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,460
everyone as Deborah watching, everyone
came to the same conclusion and like, oh,

640
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:22,980
there's a problem here.
We've got a problem.

641
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,340
The chic is one of those
guys that will fix it and he,

642
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,180
and he's got to fix it because the problem
was we had co Breena and Hoffa in the

643
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:35,010
finals and they never,
they never try.

644
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,800
They just tried to take each other down
and they couldn't because they're not

645
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:41,880
wrestlers. The wrestling's decent,
you know, but, uh, according to,

646
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:45,150
due to no wrestling,
like due to wrestled in college,

647
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:49,860
they'll say they're at like a
high school state champion level,

648
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,570
you know, not d one, all
American Johnny Hendricks level,

649
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,310
whole different animal.

650
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,780
So we ended up getting is 20 minutes
of two dudes who have okay wrestling,

651
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,820
you know like d five rustling going at
it and we don't see any Jujitsu cause no

652
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,410
one want to anyone. They don't
want to pull guard. Oh yeah, yeah.

653
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,170
It's way easier to not get taken
down than to take someone down.

654
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,720
It's way easier.
Like if your whole focus is,

655
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:18,090
I'm not going to get taken down
and you're going to check me down.

656
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,040
Even if you wrestled in college and I
didn't wrestle him cause it's still gonna

657
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,300
be hard for you to,
of course I have to work on it.

658
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:29,301
But you can get that take down defense
a lot quicker than you can turn.

659
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,540
Exactly. Exactly. I take down ability,
man, that takes a no, no long time.

660
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,890
It's sprawling can come easier.

661
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,680
So what you end up having
as two dudes that uh,

662
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,870
were wrestling for a very long time,

663
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,010
they got to the ground briefly a couple
times and they went to double overtime,

664
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:48,160
triple overtime when Friday
at the very end, zero, zero.

665
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,870
The rough makes the decision and gave
it to Cabrina. So how does that work?

666
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,750
How can I make a decision like that?
That's what the initial,

667
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,480
that's how we got started off.
That doesn't make any sense to me.

668
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,140
I don't buy that. The how is that
going to walk away with a win? I mean,

669
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:03,970
I understand that they were,
you know,

670
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,390
they're the elite of the elite
and to have the best of the world,

671
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,970
I guess someone has to win, but that
doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah.

672
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,990
The rules need revamping and I'm quite
positive that the sheik is going to take

673
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:21,580
that because what you end up having, if
you don't lose a point for pulling guard,

674
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,940
it's, you know, losing a point for
pulling guard. It's like this. I,

675
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,990
I use a football analogy when I'm
trying to explain Jujitsu to someone who

676
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,520
doesn't know anything about Jujitsu.

677
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,270
I do you understand that the rules
of football and the strategy and most

678
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,670
Americans do,
so it's just like football.

679
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,420
There's generally a guy has
a ball and that the team has,

680
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,210
has the ball and they're marching down
the field and then a team is defending.

681
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:45,790
Try not to let them march down the field.
Same thing.

682
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Guy On top in Jujitsu is
trying to march down the field.

683
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,830
Gone bottom is playing defense.

684
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,440
He the guy on defense
can score but it's not a,

685
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,780
it's a lot easier to score when you're
on top and you can use your weight cause

686
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:59,920
you have, it's like you have
the ball, you're scoring,

687
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,280
but the defensive football team can
intercept and run back for a touchdown.

688
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:06,250
They can score.
Some teams are very high so but it's rare.

689
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,360
Same thing with the bottom.

690
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:10,360
It's rare that there's guys that
can score a lot off their back,

691
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:14,410
but generally you want to be on top, you
want to have the ball. If you're on top,

692
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,750
you're in someone's open guard.
It's like you're on the 20 yard line.

693
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,720
You get on to top half,
you're like at the 50 yard line,

694
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,930
you pass the side control.
You can score from side control,

695
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,970
but it's a lot easier if
you score from the back.

696
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,880
So I controls like the 35 yard line.

697
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,120
The amount is like the 20 yard line.
Now you're in the red zone.

698
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,260
And if you get the dude's back first
and go on the 10 that's basically,

699
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,120
it's the same thing.
You're marching down the field.

700
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,570
You're getting into scoring position.
Yes. You can score from midfield.

701
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,210
You know you could score from top half.
You could throw a guillotine,

702
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:46,990
you can throw Darcy's,
but it's easier when you're on their back.

703
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,310
It's easier when you're right there.
Hundred 10 yard line, so in football,

704
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,610
the way they start the game as
the ref flips a coin, someone,

705
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,190
one of the teams picks
heads or tails and a,

706
00:40:57,191 --> 00:41:00,310
I think it's the visiting
team and then if it's heads,

707
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,820
whoever wins the coin toss gets to
decide who receives and who kicks off.

708
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,900
Generally a large percentage of the
time. If you win the coin toss, you say,

709
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,330
we're going to receive and
you're going to kick off.

710
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,480
We're going to be on offense first.
You're going to be on defense first.

711
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,690
I'm going to be on top and you're open
guard. You're going to be on the bottom.

712
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,450
You flip a coin, you have to choose. Fuck.
Yeah. Generally I would do, I would say,

713
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,483
wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

714
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,660
So you're saying that you should do a
match where you flip a coin to say no, no,

715
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,960
no, no, no, no, no. What I'm saying
is what I'm saying is, so, uh,

716
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,340
sometimes a team will choose
to kick off and not receive.

717
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,550
That's kind of like if we're
going to grapple and I sit down,

718
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,060
I chose to play defense first.
That's what a guard pooler.

719
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,110
If it doesn't happen that often,

720
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:50,111
so it's penalizing someone one point for
sitting on their butt for letting the

721
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:53,600
guy get on top.
He's working to get on top of you.

722
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,480
Worked very hard on his wrestling
to get on top of the dude is saying,

723
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,870
I'm kicking off to you. You receive, I'm
going to let you go first. That's like a,

724
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,910
like a team saying we're going to kick
off to you and losing three points for

725
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:11,210
it. Like you, you are already giving
them an advantage. You're going to lose,

726
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,600
lose the advantage and points
doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,730
You understand what I'm saying?
Dude.

728
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,100
See I could see if so say
if they don't have points,

729
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:23,480
you know they don't score
points, you know, um, with
their, their idea of advantage.

730
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,340
Maybe you could say you could give someone
an advantage if a guy pulled guard.

731
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,140
It's still a point cause
she said it went like that.

732
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,560
If you give an advantage is still one
zero zero with the the guy who has the

733
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:36,650
advantage of [inaudible] algae
actually really it should be,

734
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,610
it shouldn't be laughing.

735
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,300
It should be like this and she
that'd be submission only. That's it.

736
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:44,420
And you have overtime rounds and I
could explain that if you want here,

737
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:48,050
but generally of submission
only, no points, no advantages.

738
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,090
It's all about who gets the submission.

739
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,530
The whole goal is to get some mission
because in a lot of that was epic matches.

740
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,930
There's incredible athletes.

741
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,570
I have respect for all of them.

742
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,410
But when you're under this rule set you,

743
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,740
there's a lot of times in these matches
where the submission wasn't even a

744
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:11,570
thought. Just the w there were matches
where there's like three minutes left.

745
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,950
Guys sat on his ass, he loses
a point. Now I'm on top.

746
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,010
I want to win that money at the end
cause the winner of each division wins

747
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,390
$10,000.

748
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,010
He's the guy on top automatically
is going to be very cautious,

749
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,870
reserved and not uh,

750
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:31,871
be aggressive and definitely
not even consider a submission.

751
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,610
It's all about the w.
So that changes the entertainment value.

752
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,380
And for me that's the most important.

753
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:42,680
Do you think that it should
be just submission only?

754
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,000
It either submission only or you really,

755
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:52,001
really break down a point system for the
way it should be and this is the way it

756
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:56,180
should be. Like um, uh, in
Dean listers match against,

757
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,790
I forget who he lost it.

758
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:02,791
It was so many matches but he was down
on points and at the very end he puts,

759
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,270
I think it was you Alesis
he put them in a triangle.

760
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,770
He had them in a sense triangle at the
very end and he was down by two points,

761
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,090
maybe three, I'm not sure on
the points, but he was down,

762
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,990
it was 30 seconds.

763
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:22,850
Put them in a triangle
and in my eyes a triangle.

764
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,210
You should get more. Anything
since like a triangle, a figure,

765
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:28,340
if your legs are sense,
like you have a guy in a triangle,

766
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,070
doesn't mean he's going to tap.
A lot of times some guys escape.

767
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,730
But if it's totally sent, that guy was
in deep, deep trouble. If he escapes,

768
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:36,900
he got lucky.

769
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,170
So that that sense triangle
should represent weigh more
than a pass or a sweep.

770
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,280
That's just common sense.
So in my eyes,

771
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,780
if you want to score, keep
the scoring system and you,
you're, you're in love with,

772
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,110
you're going to commit to
the scoring system. Really
think about this, the score,

773
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,680
how you score this.
If a pass is three points.

774
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,580
If a sweep is two points,
uh, cinched Doris,

775
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,470
which people escape half the time.

776
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,530
But if you cinch it all the
way up and as a referee,

777
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,480
you should see if it's a near sub, if
it's a cinch. Darce sense triangle,

778
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,680
essential arm triangle, um,
uh, straightened out arm.

779
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,170
Like you straighten the guy's arm and
he escaped by the skin of his teeth.

780
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,570
You straightened out
his leg like a knee bar.

781
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,840
He escaped by the skin of his teeth.
You can see that I wouldn't count.

782
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,640
He'll hook and toehold attempts
cause then that would, you know,

783
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,510
they're so easy to just to jump on and
then it turns into just a bunch of, uh,

784
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,130
footsies. But if you, I
would count in my world,

785
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,560
I would count straightened the bars,
straight arm bars,

786
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,570
anything sensed any kind of,
um, that should be seven points.

787
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,830
Yeah, I agree with you. Sorry. I
think it should five something.

788
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,770
It should be like football. Yeah.
A pass. What is it now? It's one,

789
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,760
do you know anything? It is not in
Abu Dhabi. There's nothing watts.

790
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,230
It means nothing. Wait a minute. It
means not. That doesn't make any sense.

791
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,630
It doesn't mean anything.
So if a guy's ascension triangle,

792
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:04,650
that's not an near submission. That's
ridiculous. Wow. You have that.

793
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,300
Those rules are terrible.
She going to be,

794
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:10,580
it should be worth way more than a
sweep. Uh, yeah. Without a doubt. Yeah.

795
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,750
Sweeps. You know, people
recover from sweeps. Uh,

796
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,690
but if someone has you
that close to being tapped,

797
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,690
like a cinch to rear naked or something
along those lines, that's like a goal.

798
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,910
You make a touchdown, you
got out of it. But God damn,

799
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,330
I got to got to an incredibly dominant
position. Exactly. That should be,

800
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,510
and Naga is into evolution.

801
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,960
And so as grapplers quest grapplers
quests are doing selected super fights,

802
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:34,110
submission only.
So submission only is starting to spread.

803
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,930
The Gracie nationals is submission only.
Gracie world,

804
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:41,640
a submission only sub league up in the
Pacific northwest is a a submission only

805
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,370
Midwest submission challenge, which
are doing submission only, uh,

806
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,140
tournaments all over the Midwest.
It's growing, it's growing.

807
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:52,630
But if you're still committed to points,
like Nog is nugget,

808
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,580
they did change up and tweak the
point system. They are getting,

809
00:46:56,581 --> 00:47:00,570
I think one point maybe
two for a near sub,

810
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,490
which they're on the right track.
You're on the whoever's running Naga,

811
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:05,850
you kip color,
you're definitely on the right track.

812
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,020
Let's turn it up a little bit more. Let's
make since Darcel ascension triangles,

813
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,550
seven points. It makes sense. That's like
a touchdown, a sweep as to, yeah, no,

814
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:18,000
I agree with you. We were both on
the same page. So besides that,

815
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,770
the the tournament, the Abu Dhabi ADCC
is the most prestigious on the planet.

816
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,950
If it wasn't for that tournament,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

817
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,440
That's for damn sure.
It just seems like those rules are just,

818
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,010
they need be revised. That's all.
Now tell me about kron Gracie.

819
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
That's what I was about to
tell you. You read my mind. No,

820
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm looking at a video of him crying.
Gracie versus Gary Tonin.

821
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,520
Gary Tonkins,

822
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,520
a 21 year old dude who he
shocked everybody that match
was probably the greatest

823
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,290
grappling match of all time.
Gary tone it and crying.

824
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:54,730
Gracie Kron Gracie gets his arm,

825
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,070
straightens it out and look, he looks
like he's going to break it. Alert. Well,

826
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,730
you don't want what? You don't
want to tell about it. Trust me,

827
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,360
it doesn't even matter. He straightened
his arm out. He wouldn't have,

828
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,290
they kept rolling. Straighten
his arm. Everyone's going
nuts. He's real. He's real.

829
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,790
Everywhere he rolls, the Ar Chron is
right there. Every angle with the arm,

830
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:19,330
totally straight. It looked like it's
going to break. Everybody's going, aw,

831
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,030
it didn't,
he didn't just hold it and escape.

832
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,210
Do they a rolling all over the place
and that arm should have broke off to he

833
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:29,620
survived. He didn't tab gets
on top, takes Crohn's back,

834
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,400
puts him in the truck,
almost has Cronin, a twister.

835
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,360
Oh my grand spins out. He goes back
to the bag, puts an Anaconda on,

836
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:42,520
I'm Aka triangle body lock
on them has cron face down.

837
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,720
It looks over Hixon sitting there going,
oh damn.

838
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,840
And in the first match, that was
cron second match in its first match.

839
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,940
Crown demolished, uh, Andy
when I love you Andy Wang.

840
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:58,870
But he went right through him like in
30 seconds and Hixon didn't even move.

841
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:02,560
He's sitting there and he went right
through Andy Wang and Hixon Denny move.

842
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,420
And I was like, we're looking
at Hixson. I'm like, man,

843
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:09,421
that's way doper than getting all excited
him not doing anything like he expects

844
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:13,690
it. It's no big deal. You, you went right
through him. The best possible outcome.

845
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,710
Hixon didn't and make a move like Yoda
and I, I, I admired that. I'm like, wow,

846
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:22,690
that's deep right there. He's
not even happy. Not even a
smile, but in this match.

847
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,040
Hickson was like visibly shaking.
You could see him going,

848
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:30,010
what you he's watching and
where's this kid come out of?

849
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,470
I think he's from the east coast.
I'm not sure.

850
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:37,471
But he was on a that Bjj Kuma Tay thing
with a Heenan Cornelius who also did

851
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:41,650
amazing at Abu Dhabi. But
anyways, back to Guerin. Dude,

852
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:44,560
there's a minute left and at this point,

853
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:48,420
a minute and a half in Chron is doing
everything to try and escape your,

854
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,810
you were watching cron be defeated right
now. We're watching him be defeated.

855
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:56,710
After you almost had that dude's
arm like five different times.

856
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,080
[inaudible] struggling.
He can't get out.

857
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:04,081
Gary tones back defenses
or or back control is
professional assassin like chron

858
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:08,920
cannot get out, but by the skin of
his teeth, I have to see it again.

859
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:12,850
I don't know exactly I got,
but he got out, they stand up.

860
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,200
Hixon looks at him and goes,

861
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,160
you got one minute chron turns
around to take some down,

862
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,640
passes this guard, it takes a
while. He gets his back. Dude,

863
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:25,600
he's schools with two seconds left.
Gary taps.

864
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,880
Ah,
it was the craziest

865
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,220
submission match I've ever seen.

866
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:35,660
It's really fascinating watching crime
for people who don't know his dad is the

867
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:37,940
greatest Jujitsu guy of all time.

868
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,540
There's one guy that's always thought
of above all others in the world.

869
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,150
That Jujitsu, it ticks and grace.
You've got to have them on this podcast.

870
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,220
I would love to have a bond. It
would be easy. Would it be simple?

871
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,290
He lives in Brazil now. Doesn't mean
he's here, right? He, I dunno, I do.

872
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,840
You're right. You're right. I
don't know. I'll figure it out.

873
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,250
I'll get in touch with chronic.
I would fly him in first class.

874
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,000
Last time I saw Cron, um, it was at the,

875
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,690
when he fought Matt Hughes in La,
he, uh, he had that was like, oh,

876
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:05,930
seven or six. Yeah, he was a
young kid. He was really young.

877
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:07,870
There was right after I had,
uh,

878
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,500
I had dinner with Hixon once and I went
to his house and watch fights and he

879
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,130
broke down. What people are doing
wrong, dude, you know crazy. That is,

880
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,360
you went to Hickson's house,
hung out with them and watched fights,

881
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,490
broke down fights.
I remember you telling me this,

882
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,330
you were telling me he broke
down cause fade or at the,

883
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,630
at the moment was the Mr indestructable.
He was on top.

884
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,050
Everyone feared him and wanted
to fight him. Yeah. And he, yeah,

885
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:36,590
he broke down how to beat fade
on his mind, right? Oh yeah.

886
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,640
Oh he thought he could be fade or he
thinks he can beat anyone. He's a monster.

887
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,520
He's a scary dude when
you're, well, he's a master.

888
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,960
He's a true master Jujitsu and
he's got like that Samurai mindset.

889
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:51,320
A lot of people talk that Samurai
mindset. Yeah. That fucking dude lives it.

890
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,810
Like that is his mindset.
Yeah.

891
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,930
The Gracie family is very large
and there's a lot of sections,

892
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,280
a lot of Gracie clicks. There's the
Carlson side, there's the car, low side,

893
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:05,120
there's the helio side else
inside the house, inside. Uh,

894
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,400
and a lot of them hate each other.

895
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,580
A lot of them talk a lot
of crap on each other. Uh,

896
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,330
but Hixon man ever.

897
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,780
I don't know how many times I've heard
people say fuck that grace a grace.

898
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:22,010
He said like fuck that Gracie a Brazilian
or someone from the old school like

899
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,860
all the old school guys.
But they'll, they'll never,

900
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,680
they'll always say except Hickson,
they make,

901
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:31,720
they tell you except Texan like Alan
goes man Alan goals. There's little,

902
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,610
he has a lot of problems with
people but he makes it clear.

903
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:38,020
He goes but Hickson's awesome.
Excellent cause they all say it.

904
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,500
They all agree that although
there's no roles on video,

905
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,330
like now everyone has
their roles on video.

906
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,750
You could get them on youtube like
you catch Marcello's rose all day.

907
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,640
The greatest Jujitsu player ever.

908
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:55,090
But Hixon not too many roles
but everyone sets all like myth.

909
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,790
That's all legend but you got to believe
it cause everyone says the same thing.

910
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,670
Even David Camereo when he went down
there and David Cameron has a worldclass

911
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:04,430
black belt, he said he couldn't
do anything with Exim. Yeah.

912
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,570
Even Paulo Filo said that Paulo Filo went
down there and came back and was like

913
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:11,930
Jesus Christ,
he's a master.

914
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,340
He has been doing Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu community. Hixon is a god.

915
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,930
He's the best Gracie hands down.

916
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,700
So he had two sons and
one of them Hawkson, uh,

917
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,190
died a few years

918
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,510
back and he was already on his way
to being a bad ass Jujitsu player.

919
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,050
And his youngest son Cron over the last
couple of years has just become this

920
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,500
fucking p six and son.
And I remember when he was 12,

921
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,900
outside of a Jujitsu tournament,

922
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:47,410
some Ibj JF tournament and Domingo
State Hills here in California. Uh,

923
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,150
me and John Jock, my master John
Jacques Machado, we were outside.

924
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:55,890
He was basically giving me a sermon like
he always does and like everything that

925
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:59,430
comes out of his mouth as Gospel and
everything's perfect and he just has,

926
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,900
he's like a superhero and we're walking
outside and Crohn's 12 at this time and

927
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,510
he's messing around on a skateboard,
jumping up,

928
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,380
doing the score skateboard tricks.
And John John,

929
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,480
John Jack looks over at him and says,
that's the one right there. I tell you,

930
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,050
that is the one he's going to be
unstoppable. I'll never forget that.

931
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:17,970
He called it out and John's talk also,

932
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:22,200
he's called out a lot of people who you
thought were going to be legends and

933
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:25,920
John Jack said he doesn't have what it
takes. He's going to break. And I'm like,

934
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:29,880
no way. John Jock. He's like, watch him
break. He's going to break. And Damn,

935
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:30,530
he was right.

936
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,840
And there was a couple that he called
out that broke and they just disappeared

937
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,980
and see things. Sean
Shock. It really is Yoda.

938
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,090
And he, he uh, called out cron.

939
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:45,420
He knew it and [inaudible]
he's,

940
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:49,080
he is now in a select group that man,

941
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,880
I don't know if there's
more than three or four,

942
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:54,240
but he submitted everybody
in his weight division.

943
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:58,200
He tapped everybody out. And here's
another Hixon store. Oh, well,

944
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,980
John Jacques Machado was the first the
tap everyone out back in [inaudible] 99

945
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,630
or 2000,
one of those,

946
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:07,710
Abu Dhabi's 98 99 John Jacques
Machado shows up to Abu Dhabi.

947
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:08,730
He's the first superstar.

948
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,550
Back then everyone was having
trouble with the submissions.

949
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,750
A lot of the key champions.

950
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,960
We're having a little trouble submitting
dudes without the g and the wrestlers.

951
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,790
They didn't want to pass the
guard or someone, anybody,

952
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:20,670
but they could throw you around and you
ain't taking them down. So a lot of,

953
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,490
lot of boring matches in the early Abu
Dhabi and that's why the sheet kept

954
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:27,550
changing the rules, trying to, trying
to work, work it all out. But uh,

955
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,570
then the next God who
came and just submit it,

956
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:33,090
everybody in 2003 was Marcello Garcia.

957
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,670
He was the second coming of John Shock.
First I was John,

958
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:40,260
John Marcella Garcia and now, you know,
there've been other guys that have uh,

959
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,940
have a bunch of submissions and I would,
I be to high grace.

960
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,740
He's done a tremendous job.
So many good guys out there.

961
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:50,490
But as far as coming in and just
submitting everybody in your division,

962
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,750
maybe Haji did it too, I don't know.
But Kron Gracie did it last weekend.

963
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,490
He went through everybody and you know,
the Gary Tone and fight,

964
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,280
that was a close one, man. He
escaped by the skin of his teeth.

965
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:06,780
But that showed how awesome he is and,
and how we can come back.

966
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,680
And in the final, you know,
first we have Hickson, the first,

967
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,320
first couple of matches,
he's just real chill zen.

968
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,110
And then when he beat Gary Tone and
you see Hicks and jumping up chronos.

969
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:18,860
Yeah,

970
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,800
I'd never seen Hixon so happy he was
trying to get him from the or without

971
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:24,580
actually

972
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,960
he was trying to get the twister before
he even got the lockdown on the back leg.

973
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,870
He was like,
he was thinking about it early.

974
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,450
He was thinking about
putting like as yeah.

975
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,820
As the body triangles wrapped around them.
He's thinking of grabbing a snack.

976
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,170
Yeah. Yeah. Where's this kid Trina?

977
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,960
Gary Talon. And Look, I'm a t. O. N. O. N.

978
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,710
Do that transition where you took
Crohn's back is insane. And not only,

979
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:47,120
you know what Gary and did,

980
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,020
he ended up doing the absolute and the
first round he went against the butcher,

981
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,200
which whose who won the heavyweight
division who is considered the best new

982
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,400
heavyweight dude moves like
a panther blue Shasha is,

983
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,320
I think his name is Marco
Elmeda. Man. You know,

984
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:09,680
some of these Brazilians, I know them
by their nickname, but the real name is,

985
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:14,690
is uh, it's hard to remember sometimes,
but boot will Shasha he, he wins his head,

986
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:18,770
the heavyweight division. Now he
signs up for the absolute first round.

987
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,800
It's Gary Tonin who's 170 pounds against
Boucher who just won the heavy heavy

988
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,010
weight.
That's the worst possible drop.

989
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:32,330
The smallest guy gets the biggest guy
and you know what Boucher can tap him.

990
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,980
It was a good match,

991
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:38,000
which just I got all sorts of position
on him but Gary kept recovery and Gary

992
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,620
kept attacking and this will,

993
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:44,420
he loses that right on point but he
didn't get put put, put away. And um, uh,

994
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,770
the guy was talking about earlier,
Jared dop, the guy who beat him here,

995
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,650
he ended up beating your mirror. We
were like, fuck man, we got an unknown.

996
00:57:51,651 --> 00:57:54,380
It was perfect. We should have
beat. This guy was a close match.

997
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,280
A Amir had his back for a
second but didn't get points.

998
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,210
He had them in a Kamora didn't get points
for any of that and the guy took him

999
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:05,800
down once it passes guard and I'm,
you're lost on points and,

1000
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,470
and it was kind of a shocker. I was the
first round, like, damn, we, who is,

1001
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,320
we got a guy, a guy that no one knows
that we should have beat him. Damn.

1002
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,220
Then he gets a Vinnie Maga last,
the next round. Jared. Dot.

1003
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,980
He Beats Vinny.
Whoa.

1004
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:24,010
So then we're like thinking any lost Vinny
got beat by the guy that beat a Amir.

1005
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,800
Why do you think that's because
Vinny, he's doing so much. I'm a man.

1006
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,760
I'm just not doing, Vinny was
not in shape for this. Vinny, he,

1007
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,030
he admitted it to me.
He didn't train very much at all.

1008
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,340
He just couldn't turn it down.
You know?

1009
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,210
I'm sure it had a lot to do with him
getting cut by the UFC and not really

1010
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:43,820
fucked with his mind for awhile
and last fire was hard. Yeah.

1011
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,580
Yeah. Knocked out like what's the first
punch that a homeboy through and he never

1012
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:53,530
expected that he fought. Um,
uh, Australian gentlemen.

1013
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,910
The fuck's his name? Uh, Anthony.
Yeah. Anthony [inaudible],

1014
00:58:57,911 --> 00:59:00,770
who's a black belt in Jujitsu.
And that's what a lot of people expected.

1015
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:04,010
They thought it was going to be a,
a Jujitsu versus Jujitsu Bell.

1016
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,860
And he caught Vinnie
like with the first one

1017
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,230
he got, he gets cut. He's
in a depressive state.

1018
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,010
He's not really training hard for
Abu Dhabi. And Jared dop beat him.

1019
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,080
He's from Rafael Lovato is camp. He's
a purple belt. That's incredible. Yeah.

1020
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:21,170
So he's just incredible specimen.
So he gets Cyborg next.

1021
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:25,460
He gets Cyborg next and he is winning.

1022
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,030
He's beating him all. He's gotta
do a survive for 30 more seconds.

1023
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:33,890
He would have beat Amir Olam, the
top 10 planet heavyweight, uh,

1024
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,670
Vinnie, Michael [inaudible] who won the
gold medal in the APIs absolute in 2011.

1025
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,360
And then Cyborg. He was going
to be Cyborg. He wouldn't,

1026
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:46,220
but at the very end, cyborg pulled it
off and he impressed the shit out of me.

1027
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:51,140
And cyborg ended up winning. Uh, he
ended up getting third in his weight,

1028
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:56,150
Boucher one, and in the absolute
Cyborg took it all. He beat Boucher,

1029
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:59,300
shot in the finals. It was PR. I
mean, what did Cyborg catch him with?

1030
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,930
He'd beat him on points. I'll catch
you if not, it's just points site.

1031
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:07,190
So he was losing it until the
last few minutes of Jared.

1032
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:11,450
Dot was beating him on points.
And then I forget how it went down again.

1033
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:16,280
There was a 50 batches, but so all I
remember Cyborg came back at the very end.

1034
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,920
The Gero dop couldn't hold up.
He had it,

1035
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:22,520
he just could hold on it and Cyborg
pulled it out of his ass, got some points.

1036
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:24,620
I think he took his back or
something, got some, some,

1037
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:28,310
some good points and barely pulled
it off. He was, he's, I mean,

1038
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:33,311
and then Jared dop did the absolute
and he beats his first guy and maybe a

1039
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:37,340
second guy. Then he gets hurt. He
asked the bowel out his shoulder shirt.

1040
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:41,750
He was gonna get a rematch with
Cyborg in the absolutes. But you know,

1041
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,100
since he couldn't go,

1042
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,640
Gary Tone in one 70 pounder
who'd lost against Boucher, who,

1043
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:51,440
who gave him a gay a great match.
They call him and go, dude, you're in.

1044
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:52,370
And he's like,
Oh shit.

1045
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:57,490
So now he's going to get Cyborg
240 pounds of pure leopard.

1046
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:02,570
You know what I mean? And like tiger
and he's built like a brick shit house.

1047
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,290
Oh yeah.

1048
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,760
It was videos of him training strength
and conditioning online pushing shit shit.

1049
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,960
And you know what he Gary
tone and look great man.

1050
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:16,550
He was given Cyborg fits. That is
going to be a superstar. My words. Yes.

1051
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:20,720
Just remember Gary Tonin [inaudible]
that big and he's given, it must be,

1052
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:25,520
how young is this kid? 21
strong shit. That's amazing.

1053
01:01:25,521 --> 01:01:29,270
Yeah. He's not even a big
guy. And I looked at the
video of him crying. He says,

1054
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:33,590
Dude, looks at a normal size guy.
He's out of control and he plays his,

1055
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:38,450
his best shit is a part of
the same style that I play.

1056
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,460
Gary Teton and plays
a lot of prison guard.

1057
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,490
I don't know if he calls a prison guard,
that's just what I named it. But it's,

1058
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:47,420
it's like, uh, uh, a head
and arm from the bottom.

1059
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,150
It's basically a Greco Roman
full guard game. That's what an,

1060
01:01:52,151 --> 01:01:56,770
I call it prison guard. There
was nothing brown belt. Yeah,
yeah. Crazy. Yeah. And Oh,

1061
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:01,040
the way he got Crohn's back, the way
he got it was through prison guard.

1062
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,510
And again, it's, it's not, uh,
something that I'm sure he names it,

1063
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:08,870
but it's something that I named and
it's a head and arm from the top,

1064
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,660
from the bottom, and you squeeze on it
and just shuck that arm that's caught, uh,

1065
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,620
in between your arm.
Just shuck it over your head.

1066
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:19,950
You've got to get really good at that.
And you get, you can go right to the back

1067
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,010
or you could transition to swim,
move to spiderweb,

1068
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,440
or if you can't shut
the arm over your head,

1069
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,630
you could transition right
into rubber guard beautifully.

1070
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,470
Or You could put the Pharcyde
butterflying in and get some sweeps.

1071
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:35,090
So it's a very, very strong
position. The actual position, uh,

1072
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,140
the whole style I call prison guard,

1073
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:41,610
but the actual positions called homie
control and homey control is the mission

1074
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:46,410
control of prison guards. So I play
it all the time, all the time. And,

1075
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:51,720
uh, watching Gary Tonin go to it
over and over, did it to Cyborg.

1076
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,120
He would decide it was too big.
It didn't really work on him.

1077
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:58,370
And then he did it on a Bouchet shock.
He kept trying. I'm like, I dunno,

1078
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,780
prison guard is going to work on a guy
that has a hundred pounds on you or

1079
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:04,950
something. But, uh, he kept going
to it. So I look out for Gary Tonin.

1080
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,580
Yeah. It sounds like kids
a beast. I love that.

1081
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:11,470
I love with all these new dudes are
just coming up out of nowhere. Yeah.

1082
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,880
That's one of the cool things about
Jujitsu is that there's so many guys out

1083
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,340
there practicing it now.
Yeah. I think someone,

1084
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,340
it's about time for
someone to put it on TV.

1085
01:03:20,341 --> 01:03:24,470
I think one of these days they're going
to figure out a format or the guys are

1086
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:28,080
going to get talented enough or scary
enough where you're going to be able to

1087
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:32,190
put it on TV. And it'll be something
that I think about that all the time.

1088
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:37,010
And I've had a invest, I've have a show
that, uh, it's, it's a concept. Uh,

1089
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:41,280
we had financial backers that were
interested and then they back out.

1090
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,430
We had a couple of other more than we're
interested in, they back out there,

1091
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:47,820
I'm not sure, but the whole goal of mine
with this show is a 16 man tournament.

1092
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,020
The whole goal is entertainment value
and everything is designed to score.

1093
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,580
It's a,
it's a submission only format.

1094
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,620
There's a few different ways
you can go with submission only,

1095
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:00,830
but the way everything in my mind was
all designed to create urgency for this

1096
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:04,950
submission. Like the,
the, like for example,

1097
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:09,420
the ultimate urgency would be you do a
submission only match between two guys

1098
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,600
and the winner gets $1 billion.
The loser gets nothing.

1099
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:17,050
You imagined urgency of that
and how exciting that would be.

1100
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,640
Obviously you don't really mean $1
billion, but I'm just saying I'm just,

1101
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,770
that's an example. If you could give
them a billion, that'd be great.

1102
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:26,310
But let's say realistically in 50 years,
a hundred years,

1103
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:28,530
two years Jujitsu's mainstream.

1104
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,830
There's like some reality show about
Jujitsu and it gets so big and people love

1105
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:32,940
it. But we, we,

1106
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:38,070
we have to figure out the right format
first to to make sure that there's a lot

1107
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:40,710
of excitement because right now, you
know, you got to Jujitsu tournaments,

1108
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,520
there's nobody there.

1109
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,400
The only people in the stands or the
actual competitors and their girlfriends

1110
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,330
and maybe their moms. It, we've been
having these world championships forever.

1111
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,350
Nobody's going to see it cause the
point system is developed to, uh,

1112
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,720
satisfy the competitor. Well,
it's a little bit of that,
but it's also the, just,

1113
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,060
it hasn't been introduced, right? Yeah. It
hasn't been introduced at all. You know,

1114
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:04,950
now that a spike is starting to put
glory on the highest level kickboxing,

1115
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:05,940
they're putting that on TV.

1116
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,000
I think one of these days someone's going
to realize that he watched like that

1117
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:12,890
Kron Gracie, Gary Cohn and fight that
kind of a match. It's very exciting.

1118
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,560
Let's say that, okay. Realistically, 50
years or whatever, Jujitsu is mainstream.

1119
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,010
You could

1120
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
do a show where there's a
16 man tournament submission
only and the winner one

1121
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:26,590
winner only.
It's just like a any kind of reality show.

1122
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:31,360
One winner gets $100,000 cash or whatever.
That's Matt.

1123
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:35,560
That unrealistic. Can you imagine
the excitement of those matches?

1124
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,570
You have a good match
maker you put together,

1125
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,940
you know you don't just throw
people together but the x,

1126
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,260
the amount of urgency that there
is going to be for the submission,

1127
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,000
the training would be totally different.

1128
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,110
People would be specifically training
their setups to the submissions.

1129
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:51,850
It would be all about the submission.

1130
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,950
Right now these guys getting the w and
winning by points is all that's necessary.

1131
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,240
So guys are specifically training
for to for the point system.

1132
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:05,620
And I'm guilty of it too. I mean, I
mean if that's, if that's the format.

1133
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,040
This is how I understand cause I
do the same thing with Amir alum.

1134
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,590
He wrestled his whole life.
He's one of my brown belts,

1135
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:13,600
but he's a wrestler through and through.

1136
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,360
So we were going to go in and
just say you're a wrestler.

1137
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,540
He worked on his wrestling.
Let's beat these guys by the point system.

1138
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,140
Let's get that w I was doing
that. I'm not like this. You know,

1139
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:26,950
you're forced to think like that based
on the system because you want the w so

1140
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:31,300
bad. So I'm guilty of it too. We were,
we were, we wanted to wrestle Jared. Dot.

1141
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:36,110
So, you know, you, uh, you
make it a 16 man tournament,

1142
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,880
eight man terminate.
You make it a reality show submission.

1143
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:43,100
Only one guy gets $100,000. I'm going
to do, did it. But I do, you know,

1144
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:46,150
if he did a million that would even
be crazier. The matches would be nuts.

1145
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,090
All you'd have to do is just
have guys who are really good,

1146
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:51,580
who are going for submissions and
going after it. And you would,

1147
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,170
it'd be a really exciting sport.

1148
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,640
A lot more excited than
a lot of shit that is on,

1149
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,380
on TV and just people just don't know
about, they're just not used to it. Yeah.

1150
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,590
It can be done. Someone just like
someone like to shake, you know,

1151
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,850
figuring out how to do it. Yeah.
You know, it's, it's uh, you know,

1152
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,030
and there's a lot of people that get,

1153
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,880
they look into Jujitsu and then they
watch a match and go, fuck this,

1154
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:13,900
this is boring. They're just the way
the gay sport is turning into now.

1155
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,200
It's like I'm a black belt in the
g and I look at the new stuff.

1156
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,800
I don't even know who's on top.
I have no idea who's winning that plan.

1157
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:23,800
Tug of war with the pants
and they're in this mangled,

1158
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:26,890
tangled position that I wouldn't
even know who has the advantage.

1159
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,950
Someone got an advantage very near sweep.
I who did,

1160
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,500
I'm considered one of the things
I wanted to ask you about cron.

1161
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,450
He doesn't do any new shit.
Like everything he does is old school,

1162
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:41,920
Jujitsu, old school, Hixon
Gracie style, the, the,

1163
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:42,870
you know that,

1164
01:07:42,871 --> 01:07:47,871
that real basic set of techniques and
just it just get some laser sharp.

1165
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,703
That's all he does.

1166
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,770
He has a incredible rear naked choke
and even more insane guillotine in the

1167
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:59,800
final,
he went against Oto Tavio Sousa.

1168
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,030
He's one of the top Gracie Baha
guy at that weight at one 70.

1169
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,850
And Oh, getting to this match. Right.

1170
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:11,650
So it's the finals Hixon Gracie sitting
there or on an o Tavio they're going at

1171
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:16,340
it. Oh. Tibio decides to
get inside crimes head.

1172
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:21,230
And the way he's going to do that is
keep staying away from them, not engage,

1173
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,060
slap him on the neck,
push him away. Frustrate.

1174
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:27,650
Because all cron wants a submission.
Right? He's like Marcella Garcia,

1175
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:31,830
he just goes forward. The submission
is on Crohn's. Mine, right. You know,

1176
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,460
for damn sure. That's what he wants.
And uh, he kept going forward. Oh,

1177
01:08:36,461 --> 01:08:39,340
Teva keeps pushing away him. He's
a bad motherfucker. He got pushed.

1178
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:43,160
He beat Leo Vr. I mean he's, he's
legit. One of the best. And he actually,

1179
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:46,820
they weren't against each other and
metamorris and Chron beat him in the Geeky

1180
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:47,720
armbar them.
It was a,

1181
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:52,010
it was an epic match and the match
before that at the world. Octavio one.

1182
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:56,870
So metamorris was a rematch.
He got revenge. Now the
rubber match in Abu Dhabi,

1183
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:00,860
in the vinyl, he smacking his head
and conflict and over at the ref gone.

1184
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,740
You know, what does he
doing? Just smacking my neck.

1185
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:06,680
And he keeps walking backwards.
I understood what I'll Tavia was doing.

1186
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,200
He was trying to frustrate them,
get inside of Santa. It was working.

1187
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,220
He was getting pissed off.

1188
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:14,980
But you know what it was also working
on Hixon to soon said, hey, uh,

1189
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,240
and this is according,
I didn't hear it personally,

1190
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,410
but this is according to what I
heard, the reports, the reporters,

1191
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:24,350
it's all over the Internet.
So I may be wrong,

1192
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:29,351
but it appears to be correct based on
the reports I read that Hickson was,

1193
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:33,160
at first he was like telling the ref.
He keeps, he keeps going backwards.

1194
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:34,940
He's not engaged and it
keeps going backwards. He's,

1195
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,480
he doesn't even want to fight. And then
he said, he's chicken, he's chicken.

1196
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:42,640
And then he starts making chicken noises.
He said, but God, bring up, bring up.

1197
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,810
You'll imagine doing that. Isn't that
crazy? You know what that tells you, man?

1198
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,780
You know, there's some people out
there that don't understand that.

1199
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,080
But as a father, I, I understand it.

1200
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:57,590
If I do, it's like
you're, that's your son.

1201
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,590
You're going to make sure I
got my son murdered somebody.

1202
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,210
I'm going to shelter him, I'm going
to hide him. You know what I'm saying?

1203
01:10:04,211 --> 01:10:05,190
I shouldn't talk about it.

1204
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:10,130
Know what I'm saying is know what I'm
saying is you'll do anything for your kids

1205
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,480
and what you're seeing even doing,

1206
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:16,540
making chicken noises that they could
easily make you seem like you're childish.

1207
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,680
Easy, but he don't care. All
they care is about macho.

1208
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:26,300
He was willing to do anything it took
to make Octavio engage and it worked.

1209
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,800
He engaged,
took a shot,

1210
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:32,000
chron guillotine them the fastest
guillotine ever soon as he took him down,

1211
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:35,330
cross sat down. Boom. It was over.
Man. I don't know if it's online,

1212
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:40,310
but it was over like in three seconds
or less. Less than three seconds. Boom.

1213
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,280
He won the world championship.
Submitted everybody.

1214
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,193
That's amazing.

1215
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:48,460
It's just amazing when you hear about a
guy who is the son of the great master,

1216
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:51,730
like the greatest master ever.
It's almost like a movie, you know?

1217
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,340
And when he was young,
you know,

1218
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:58,450
like I remember hanging out with him
over at Hickson's house. You know,

1219
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:01,480
she's just like a young kid.
He was talking about rap music and shit.

1220
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:04,870
And of course he trained Jujitsu.
He loved Jiu Jitsu.

1221
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:07,130
He loved the fact that his dad was this,
you know,

1222
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,740
I mean imagine if that's your dad.

1223
01:11:08,741 --> 01:11:11,320
He's just the greatest
Jujitsu guy of all time.

1224
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,780
He's got to be the coolest shit ever.
And he's right.

1225
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,790
He's currently the baddest
guy in Abu Dhabi for, it's
amazing. And he's young too.

1226
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:22,740
And you know what, no homo or anything.
But that guy's a, he's a beautiful man.

1227
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,810
Was Wife was beautiful. He
in his wife, she's beautiful
Hicks. It's beautiful. Yeah.

1228
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,960
Hixon married some supermodel back in
the day and they had a bunch of kids and

1229
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:33,570
all their kids,
even hawkson and their daughters,

1230
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:36,960
they all have perfect little
model faces and their Tam, he,

1231
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,460
he could easily be a movie star there.

1232
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:42,540
Their models is kids like
amber Abercrombie and Fitch
model so well when he was

1233
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:46,680
in that, that documentary
choke, if that documentary,

1234
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:50,640
it's really unfortunate that that didn't
become a huge documentary cause even

1235
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:54,330
people who don't appreciate martial arts,

1236
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:55,680
you just want to watch
something interesting.

1237
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:58,380
Like people keep telling me
about the Sushi documentary,

1238
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:01,680
Gen zero genes of Sushi or
whatever the fuck it's called.

1239
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,680
It's supposed to be amazing about a
guy who was like really into Sushi.

1240
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,630
But I'm not in the Sushi. I'm not an
about giant to be a Sushi chef. I hate it.

1241
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:14,160
But if you, even if you have no
aspirations towards martial arts,

1242
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,840
choke is an amazing documentary
because it follows this guy who's just,

1243
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,740
he's just the, he's legit. He's legit,

1244
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,680
masterful in everything he
does. I mean, they do it as a,

1245
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,720
he's meditating in the fucking
freezing icy rivers of Japan.

1246
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,900
He gets under water up to his
neck and he's, you know, he's,

1247
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:37,470
he's doing his meditation,
practicing and doing yoga,

1248
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:39,610
where does this weird shit
with his stomach. And yeah,

1249
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:45,210
it's cool when a guy like that exists,
when there really is a bad motherfucker,

1250
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:46,170
like a real,

1251
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:51,350
like mystical sort of a showman Brazilian
jujitsu master who's better than

1252
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,160
everybody else.
And that reminds me of the most surreal

1253
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,770
moment of my Jujitsu career.

1254
01:12:56,771 --> 01:13:01,771
Man Was Abu Dhabi at the first way
and hits and comes up to me and says,

1255
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:05,980
Hey Heddy, how are you doing? I shook
my hand, my head almost exploded.

1256
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:11,410
I couldn't believe him saying
Eddie. Yeah, very strange.

1257
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,290
It was that he knew who
you were because you know,

1258
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:17,380
Cron Cron and John John are real tight.

1259
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:21,130
John Joc is now a coral
belt under Hixon Gracie.

1260
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,340
So Hixon Gracie is John jocks master now.
And uh,

1261
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,550
he used to be Gracie Baha and under
Carlinos and on him, but now he's,

1262
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,750
he's under Hickson and John [inaudible]
always been tight with crowd.

1263
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,770
That's how he had that insight. That's
how he knew he was going to be a champion,

1264
01:13:35,771 --> 01:13:37,970
the champion that he is.
So John,

1265
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:41,230
Jack Brock Cron over to my
gym maybe two weeks ago.

1266
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,980
And that was the first time ever got to
hang out with chron and train with them.

1267
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,910
And it was, it was pretty
amazing to have Hixon son that.

1268
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,800
And anytime I have a Gracie there
with me that I could talk to,

1269
01:13:53,801 --> 01:13:54,550
my always,

1270
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:59,550
I always want to remind them that there's
a big misconception about what 10 plan

1271
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:00,850
of Jujitsu is all about.

1272
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:04,000
And to someone who really doesn't
know and hasn't done the research,

1273
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,380
it's easy to, it's easy to
kind of see that, oh, uh,

1274
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,220
or easy to believe that I say turned

1275
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,580
my back on Jujitsu. Once I got
my black belt, I threw the Goa,

1276
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,840
I'm disrespectful to them,

1277
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,990
understands this if they
don't follow Jiu Jitsu,

1278
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:24,880
but there's two camps of Jujitsu. There's
people who train with a Geek, you know,

1279
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,790
big bulky Kimono thing and there's no g,

1280
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,050
which is mostly guys where rash guards
or shorts and their training basically

1281
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,960
techniques that would work in mixed
martial arts because of the fact that the

1282
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:37,480
gooey is this big piece of cloth.

1283
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,010
People grab it and hold onto it and it,

1284
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:43,760
it really changes the entire nature of,

1285
01:14:43,761 --> 01:14:45,640
of grappling changes everything.

1286
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:47,980
Because if all you have all these
handles that you can hold onto,

1287
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,120
it becomes really annoying.

1288
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,890
Yeah. And a majority of the
Brazilian Jujitsu a community,

1289
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,120
they really liked the ghee.

1290
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:59,050
And I understand that it's like liking
long in your surfer and some people like

1291
01:14:59,051 --> 01:14:59,884
short boards.

1292
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:02,710
No Nogi would be like the short board
and Longboard we'd like the key.

1293
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,480
It's really traditional.
It looks cool.

1294
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:08,050
You grow up and you see these karate
movies and you want to wear that gain.

1295
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,850
You strap that black belt
on and you've got to key,

1296
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:14,470
you feel like a superhero
because that black belt is
real. I get it. I understand.

1297
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,850
But um,

1298
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,680
I got into Jujitsu because of the UFC.

1299
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:25,681
I became a fanatic of the UFC and Jujitsu
is the closest thing I could do to be

1300
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,640
kind of close to the sport and understand
the sport without getting hit in the

1301
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:33,670
face. I don't like boxing. I don't like
kickbox and I don't want to get hit.

1302
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,420
But Jujitsu is awesome.
It's safe, you know,

1303
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,460
all you're doing is practicing strangling
each other and getting really good at

1304
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:42,790
that and practicing breaking limbs.
Like who doesn't want to learn that?

1305
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,670
Anybody can learn that and you and you
don't get hurt. No one's punching you.

1306
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,400
I was sold right when I saw the UFC.

1307
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:51,910
It was oh a way for me to
be the be close to the UFC,

1308
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:54,210
the sport that I worship now.
Um,

1309
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:58,990
so when I see a Jujitsu
black belts in the UFC,

1310
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,950
great with the g, but all of a sudden
they're fighting in the UFC without a,

1311
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,320
and now they don't have
their handles and do,

1312
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:08,770
they're trying to punch them and their
elbows and all that stuff. To me,

1313
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,980
I thought the [inaudible] was the prompt.
Jujitsu wasn't looking that good.

1314
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,990
And the UFC man and those dark
ages like UFC 17 to ou like that.

1315
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,030
Even today, overall, the Jujitsu I
think could be a lot better if they,

1316
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:27,150
if everyone's focused on
Jujitsu techniques that
worked when specifically when

1317
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,520
dudes to trying to punch you or elbow
EU and you know, and there's no handles,

1318
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:32,980
it's different. So anyways, so I was,

1319
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:37,981
I loved Jujitsu so much that I was
tired of being let down by never seen.

1320
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:41,290
You rarely see sweeps in the UFC.

1321
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:44,320
You go to a Jujitsu class or Jujitsu
tournament where they're wearing a g,

1322
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,130
you see sweeps and submissions for off
your back from the guard when you're on

1323
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:52,120
your back all the time. But why
weren't you seeing it in the UFC? I go,

1324
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:56,860
you rarely see sweeps. And even today when
you see a good quality sweep, it's woo.

1325
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,350
It's a highlight reel.
That was an amazing sweet.

1326
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,380
But in the ghee that happened all the
time and submissions off the back happen

1327
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:06,070
all the time. So the differences,
it's just common sense in the gay,

1328
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,140
you don't have to worry about dude's
elbowing you and you've got all these

1329
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:10,040
handles and you

1330
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,850
develop all these techniques based on
pulling the collar and holding on the

1331
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:16,410
sleeve. And that becomes your
fighting stance. And when,

1332
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:20,270
if that's your fighting stance and all of
a sudden you do MMA and there's no fat,

1333
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,800
the fat fighting style
is totally different.

1334
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:23,630
You're clenching now cause you
don't want to get knocked out.

1335
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:29,150
You got to focus on that. So
for me, I thought, man, if
I ever opened up a school,

1336
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,570
I'm when I'm, I never liked the gate
to begin with. Personal personally,

1337
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,650
I'd rather train Gnocchi.
It's faster. I like it faster.

1338
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,750
I have no problems with the gay.
A lot of my students,

1339
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:41,630
they'll try in the geek personally,
it's just too slow for me.

1340
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,230
I needed to be faster.
So when I have, uh, um,

1341
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:49,070
so a lot of people in the Jiu Jitsu
community think that I turned my back on

1342
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:53,330
Jujitsu. Man, nothing could be further
from the truth, I don't think any, no, no.

1343
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,360
It was just a bunch of haters out there
and there's people that hate no matter

1344
01:17:56,361 --> 01:17:59,930
what, but there's no one to
focus on them. No, I just,

1345
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:03,830
I just wanted to make it clear. And when
Chron came to my school two weeks ago,

1346
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:04,970
I made it clear to him like,

1347
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,990
I just want to let you know that I have
all the respect in the world for the

1348
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:11,540
Gracies. Anybody that thinks
I don't is ridiculous. I mean,

1349
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:13,670
in my first book that came out in 2005,

1350
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:18,170
it opens up with a paragraph or two
on each Gracie and thanking them for,

1351
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:22,820
for creating me and creating the sport
and the UFC. So it, and that's over,

1352
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,310
that's like 10 years ago.
It's not anything that I'm trying to,

1353
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,470
I'm trying to do damage
control now or anything,

1354
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:31,710
so I just wanted to put that
out there that, that uh, um,

1355
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:35,030
you don't have to put that up there
and nobody believes that. Hey. Um,

1356
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,580
would you think about the
UFC this weekend? Incredible.

1357
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:40,800
Those are the craziest UFC ever. Yeah,
it was going on right when I would have,

1358
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:41,400
it was going on.

1359
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:46,400
It was going on at a
Saturday or Sunday morning.

1360
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:50,570
Was it Sunday morning and it was Saturday
morning here or something like that.

1361
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,430
It was like,
it was weird.

1362
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:56,060
So I didn't get to see it live and I don't
think it was possible to see it live.

1363
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:59,800
We ended up seeing it the next
day. Uh, Amir and Scott Palmer,

1364
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,130
another one of my students who went,

1365
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,700
they figured out how to
find it somewhere online.

1366
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,060
Online. Yeah. Yeah. The Diego Sanchez,

1367
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:11,270
Gilbert Melendez fire was the craziest
fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

1368
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,830
Yeah, it was madness.
Especially that third round.
God Damn, that was incredible.

1369
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,270
They just went off.

1370
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:22,300
They just went after it in a way like
you very rarely see and for Diego to drop

1371
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:27,570
Gilbert Melendez without uppercut after
all that damage he was taken. Yeah,

1372
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,020
man. There we saw some
serious heart that night.

1373
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:34,770
I mean junior dos Santos that talk
about heart. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

1374
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,520
Dee Diego Sanchez is a special dude.

1375
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,600
He's his belief in himself and his,
his ability to absorb punishment.

1376
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,030
It's crazy battles.

1377
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:46,820
He's bites down his mouthpiece and he
doesn't do a lot of slipping and moving,

1378
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:50,750
you know? He's taken a lot of them and
just charge and forward. He loves it.

1379
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,740
He's so crazy.
He had a giant cut over his iron man.

1380
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:58,340
It was bigger than his eyebrow. It was
like the size of his eyebrow was enormous.

1381
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,460
Yeah. There was a, there was
a whole wild fucking event.

1382
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:04,940
Did you see Hector Lombard and
Nate Marquardt? Yes. Holy Shit.

1383
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,480
I won 70 hectare. Lumbar going
to give, he'll give anybody fits.

1384
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:12,550
I could see him. He can be the champ.
Yeah, easily. Easily. Yeah. Yeah.

1385
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:16,320
He's terrifying at one 70
he's a freak athlete, man.

1386
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:20,850
Would GSP be able to take him down?
I don't know man. I don't know.

1387
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:24,750
He's a freak athlete. Well now I
use that term a lot freak athlete.

1388
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:29,130
But Hector Lombard really is a freak and
at one 70 that might be the strongest

1389
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:30,870
one 70 that's ever existed ever.

1390
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,350
He hits so fucking hard dude.

1391
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:38,490
He chased down Nate Marquardt who was
a strike force former champion. Okay.

1392
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,031
Nate mark,

1393
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:42,480
what was the Strikeforce welterweight
champion and Hector lumbar chased him

1394
01:20:42,481 --> 01:20:46,470
around like he was some kid that he
was going to assault. I mean it was,

1395
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:47,340
it was amazing.

1396
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:52,610
I mean he like almost like he had no
worry whatsoever about Nate Marquardt

1397
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:58,110
techniques. Just ran after him, ran
after him, kept throwing bombs at them.

1398
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,450
And then the last shocks amount last shot.

1399
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,200
Did you see what it did to Nate's body?
Yeah.

1400
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,140
It made him kind of like
hop and land on his,

1401
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:07,080
but I can see his leg slipped
out from under him when he,

1402
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:11,550
cause he was like kind of running away
and he got one of those uppercuts from

1403
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,860
behind and then boom,

1404
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:16,770
it lifted him up and he landed
right on his bud was pretty crazy.

1405
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:20,580
It was horrific. Yeah. He fucked
him up, man. It was, it was spooky.

1406
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,610
I didn't know that he was going to be
able to do that. I mean, I knew that he,

1407
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,820
Jake, Jake Ellenberger and
Nate Marquardt had a, uh,

1408
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,850
a real tough fight and
Nate got knocked out,

1409
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:33,030
but they were going after
each other, you know? I mean,

1410
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:35,880
Nate was going after him
too. It was a real, it was,

1411
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,270
he got caught with a big
shot by Ellenberger and
Ellenberger can take anybody

1412
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:43,620
out. But it was competitive up until
that, this was not competitive.

1413
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:47,520
This was a mugging. I mean, he
just came after Nate Marquardt,

1414
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:50,190
Nate Marquardt try to counter him
a couple of times at right hands.

1415
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,500
But mostly it was just trying
to get the fuck out of the way.

1416
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,410
And that dude just came at him like, oh,
like a monster. It was weird. It was.

1417
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,830
He's ridiculously strong.
Yeah. Is it's scary dude.

1418
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:02,910
At 170 pounds.

1419
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,600
I want immediately to see matches
with him against like Carlos condit

1420
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,434
immediately to see him.

1421
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:11,370
He him against guys like Johnny Hendricks
or George see AP or whoever wins the

1422
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:15,570
title. According to Eric
Paulson, I had him on my podcast.

1423
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:18,510
He's telling me some Hector
Lombard stories. Man,

1424
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:23,280
the guy is intense,
24 seven in the gym,

1425
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:28,050
wants to throw down him and Josh Barnett.
Throat threw down at least once.

1426
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:32,670
Yeah. Josh told me about Josh. Josh
mounted him and would never let them up.

1427
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:33,740
We just beating on him.

1428
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:37,380
He wouldn't let him up as apparently
he had an issue with something lumbar.

1429
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:41,130
Did someone else in the gym,
so Josh and him just went after it.

1430
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:44,880
Josh said the guy's a freak athlete.
He said he does those muscle ups,

1431
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,270
you know those things where you do a chin
up and then you push up from the top.

1432
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,110
They're really hard to do.
This is a motherfucker just,
he'd never done it before.

1433
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:55,020
I banged out like 10 in a row. Boom, boom.

1434
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,760
I don't think I'll ever be able to do one.
He's a freak athlete.

1435
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:03,960
Like when you look at his body, he's
five foot seven and five foot seven wide.

1436
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,610
You know,
he's so big.

1437
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,830
Mimi's probably probably about five nine
they probably a little taller than me

1438
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:09,370
think.

1439
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:13,840
I Dunno my hydro five maybe my either
my height or maybe slightly taller.

1440
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:17,440
I'm five eight but he's twice
as wide as man. I mean he might,

1441
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,890
he might and I'm pretty wide. You might
be like literally a foot wider than me.

1442
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,760
Yeah, he, I think it's an
illusion. He's actually,

1443
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:27,750
he might be five 10 but he says last
are so wide and the shoulders that it

1444
01:23:27,751 --> 01:23:30,470
appears that he's five fours,
he's so wide.

1445
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:35,250
I've never seen a dude his height
that wide before and the power that

1446
01:23:35,251 --> 01:23:38,280
motherfucker has, God damn, it's scary.

1447
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:44,030
Scary and just ultimate confidence
in his ability to knock guys out.

1448
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,640
Ultimate confidence. Like as he
charged in on Nate, it was just,

1449
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:51,060
he knew it was a matter of time. It
was weird. It was weird to watch.

1450
01:23:51,061 --> 01:23:53,580
I never thought I'd watched Nate get
steam steamrolled like that. You know,

1451
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,860
you think about Nate.
Nate fought Anderson Silva.

1452
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,640
It was a decent fight until Anderson a
reversed him on the ground and beat him

1453
01:23:59,641 --> 01:24:02,520
up and stopped him.
But it was a decent fight before that.

1454
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:06,930
Nate fought Tyron Woodley and knocked him
out. I mean, Nate is a bad motherfucker.

1455
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,870
He's a really good fighter. You don't
think of all the guys he's knocked out.

1456
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:14,010
He knocked out Martin and Martin Kampmann,
you know named mark. No fucking joke.

1457
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,610
He's been around a long ass time too.
He's really fucking gold bar.

1458
01:24:17,611 --> 01:24:21,750
It's got that Hendricks power. Just
boom. But he's got in both hands. Yeah.

1459
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:25,050
He's this terrifying, terrifying
Lombard's. Terrifying.

1460
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:30,360
He might be the motherfucker at one 70
men. It really might be. Yes, it might be.

1461
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,110
So these guys, man, sometimes it's
just a matter of making that weight.

1462
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,590
Getting minding the weight class. Yeah.
Look at Damien Maia at one seven eight.

1463
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,010
Yeah, no, but then Jake shields
beat him, which is crazy.

1464
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,200
I could have went either way.
Yeah, it was a, it was a,

1465
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:47,400
I think one of those fights that easily
could be a draw. You can decide who wins,

1466
01:24:47,401 --> 01:24:50,590
but my, it didn't happen. You know, that
a lot of people were saying to mio is,

1467
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:53,680
was going to dominate him the way he
dominated Rick story. Yeah, yeah. No.

1468
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:55,680
If people forget how good
a Rambo Jake shields. Yeah,

1469
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:00,220
yeah. He never really got close
to any submissions. And the, the,

1470
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,350
and Jake,

1471
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:08,250
he's probably top three if
not the best passer in MMA.

1472
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,650
His passing,
his incredible,

1473
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:16,240
him and Sean sherk incredible passing
and Jake almost passed so many times,

1474
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:20,710
God. And to have that kind of confidence
that tried to pass Maya's guard,

1475
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:23,440
most receptors we'll just say, okay,
in this fight or you get on top,

1476
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:24,580
don't even try to pass.

1477
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:28,290
But Jake kept trying to pass
and even though even though he,

1478
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:29,350
he didn't quite make it,

1479
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:33,190
it was very impressive that he had the
confidence to keep pushing and keep

1480
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:37,720
trying to pass. And Damen Meier really
can do anything off his back against Jake.

1481
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:41,870
Jake's Easter, having guys attack them,
you know, serious guys off their back.

1482
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:45,010
So man, that was a very, very close fight.

1483
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:48,910
I thought they would give it to
Maya base because it was in Brazil.

1484
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,010
I thought Jake's really
gonna have to beat him.

1485
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:54,640
He's decisively to get it in Brazil.
But, uh, that wasn't the case after all.

1486
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:56,350
So congratulations to Jake.

1487
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:57,860
Yeah,
that was a big win for him.

1488
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:01,610
Cause Maya was on the verge of a
title shot after the Rick Story fight.

1489
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,840
If they're beaten, John Fitch, he,
John Fitch, John Fitch, and then, uh,

1490
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,570
beat Rick story like that.
A lot of people like Jesus Christ.

1491
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:11,660
This guy might be the best grappler
in the division. No one can stop him.

1492
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,570
So Jake wins that fight,
derails his title,

1493
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:18,470
hopes that this is just so many
good fighters now, man, it's crazy.

1494
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:21,380
Robbie Lawler is about the fight.
Rory Macdonald.

1495
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:26,420
How fucking crazy is that fight?
Can at the Wahhabi, Laura at one 70.

1496
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:29,090
And this is another one at once 70.
It's fucking terrifying.

1497
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:34,520
He's absolutely terrified.
What 70 did you see? Um,

1498
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:38,540
uh, Ama golf and, uh, Tj walberger.
Robbie Lawler knocked out.

1499
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:42,160
I'm a God with a flying knee.
That's how scary Robbie Lawler,

1500
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,250
I'll never forget Dana white
at the comedy store years ago,

1501
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,490
telling you about Robbie Lawler for
the first time it was, I got this kid,

1502
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:52,640
Robbie Lawler bad knock
you out with both hands.

1503
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,250
I remember hearing that
and then he brought him up.

1504
01:26:55,580 --> 01:27:00,260
He did well in the beginning and then
he started fighting for Strikeforce.

1505
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:04,220
He was fighting an 85 you shouldn't have
been fighting in 85 we should have been

1506
01:27:04,221 --> 01:27:08,090
funny at one 70 and the whole time.
But he also needed to mature,

1507
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,260
come into his own,
you know,

1508
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:14,260
he's like 30 now and now he's like a
real legit professional, you know, he,

1509
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,780
he, he fights smart. He doesn't
just wing punches a guys,

1510
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:19,610
but it does still wing punches that guys,

1511
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,810
he's got a serious fucking Chin and
he goes after guys. Does that fight?

1512
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,300
That's November.
That's the George Saint Pierre undercard.

1513
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:34,070
Good googly Mowgli, dude.
Roy MacDonald and, and and

1514
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:40,010
I mean, think about that camp that
Tristar camp, Brian McDonald GSP.

1515
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,100
He got so many good guys out of that.
Can't that Francis car, Hmong guy.

1516
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,270
But Robbie Lawler is a mother fucker.
I don't know who's gonna win that fight.

1517
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:52,220
He's like, super technical. Doesn't take
too many chances. Works on that Long Jab,

1518
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:56,210
you know? But Robbie Lawler, we'll go
after a motherfucker. Yeah, he spooky.

1519
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:01,880
What'd you think of Roy Nelson core? Me
a Carmine's a fucking sick athlete, man.

1520
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:05,630
He's a sick, you're going to two oh
five yeah, he's going, he went to fight.

1521
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:09,620
Jon Jones was saying it. He was
saying, I'm going into a five. Yeah,

1522
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:12,950
he'll be at two oh five he was two
24 for this fight. You know, he'll,

1523
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:15,830
he'll go down to a five and he's
going to be a handful for everybody.

1524
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,930
He's that elite Olympic gold medalist,
caliber athlete.

1525
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,440
Those motherfuckers are rare dudes.
You know those dudes,

1526
01:28:24,441 --> 01:28:27,200
they break their hand and keep punching
you with it until it falls apart.

1527
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:30,260
He was thrilled. His throwing punches
at Josh Barnett with a broken hand.

1528
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:30,921
You know,

1529
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:34,790
he's taking Josh Barnett up in the air
with a broken hand slamming on the ground

1530
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:35,451
with,
you know,

1531
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:39,620
he's fucking bones are rattling against
themselves inside of his hand to do that.

1532
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:41,210
To Josh Barnett, man. Exactly.

1533
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,480
That's what I just had to be out of
this world and he's not even a legit

1534
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:45,314
heavyweight.

1535
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,860
He wrestled at two oh six I think he
wrestled it to a six it was definitely

1536
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:52,310
light because he had a cut weight to do
it and that's why he lost his bid at the

1537
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:55,960
Olympics because he had kidney failure
because he tried to make the weight.

1538
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:59,030
We try to cut the way, like cut a lot
of weight and he fucked himself up.

1539
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,160
A lot of guys have that man, you know, I'm

1540
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,200
Josie Aldo has kidney stones now.

1541
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,500
Had a kidney stone removed after
his fight with the Korean Zombie.

1542
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,680
That's from cutting weight.
Yeah.

1543
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,900
One of my students had
kidney stones and and since,

1544
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,970
since he went to the hospital,

1545
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,590
went through all the excruciating pain
and me hearing the stories, he said, bro,

1546
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,570
drink cranberry juice. Pure
cranberry juice. Don't drink
that cocktail every day.

1547
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:28,440
You do not want to go through what
I went through. I swear to God,

1548
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,740
I have pure cranberry
juice in my refrigerator.

1549
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:34,770
I make sure my wife keeps it
stocked and I drink it every day.

1550
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,920
Just hearing his story of excruciating
pain and the hospital does this guy.

1551
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:43,330
Who Was it? Which guy? Um, I don't know.

1552
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:47,850
I don't want to say is does
he cut weight? He, yes.

1553
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:52,560
He cuts massive white. Shut it down. Yeah,
he sure is. He's, is it cut weight to,

1554
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:56,880
to do matches? Yeah. Fuck
man, that Shit's bad for you.

1555
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,210
Cutting weight is not good,

1556
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:04,320
but if you want to be a great fighter
and just drink pure Granbury cranberry

1557
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:08,250
juice, not the cocktail. And you should
be fine every day. It tastes like shit.

1558
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:12,240
Tastes sour, but it's like a
shot at drink it every day.

1559
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,960
Get it to make it whole foods.
You can get it at a, anyway,

1560
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:19,560
any supermarket and it's a cranberry
pills. That's a, does the same thing.

1561
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,390
Does it do this? Just take
a shot. A shot of cramp.

1562
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,630
How could it do the same thing
though? It never does. You know,

1563
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:29,250
like you take those like, um, pills, green
pills, they're never as good as it was.

1564
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:32,730
Like real we to choose. It's kind
of sour, but you get used to it.

1565
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,030
It's actually not bad and you can't
drink that much of it. So it's perfect.

1566
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,420
It's like a way to quench your thirst and
you're not going to down like half the

1567
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:42,300
bottle. If it was grape drink or
something, shit, you kill half the bottle.

1568
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:47,150
But since it's so tart, you're forced
to only take a sip. And so that,

1569
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,220
what does that do? What? What's
in it that protects your deck?

1570
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:54,690
It's gotta be the acid in
it cause it's kind of sour.

1571
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:59,730
It's gotta be has something to do with
that and making sure that those stones

1572
01:30:59,731 --> 01:31:03,660
are always broken down. It's probably
just melt some or something. I don't know.

1573
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,540
I stayed this girl who used to
get 'em urinary tract infections.

1574
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:11,520
She seems to have to drink cranberry
juice to get rid of it. How weird is that?

1575
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:15,810
Cranberry juice is legit. It's weird that
there's foods though that cure things,

1576
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,780
you know, like do you have any stomach
ailments and think bothering your stomach?

1577
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:21,690
Take garlic. It's
incredible. Like, if you,

1578
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:25,830
if you eat some bad food and get some
sort of stomach like food poising shit

1579
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:27,420
like that,
eat some cloves of garlic.

1580
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:32,640
It's like sending in rabid Italian troops
to go down in there and just fuck off

1581
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:36,720
all the bacteria. It's incredible.
And people who don't like raw garlic,

1582
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:39,120
you don't know what you're missing.
Just eat cloves of that shit.

1583
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,260
That's fantastic for you.

1584
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,190
It's like an assault on all the
shitty things inside your body.

1585
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:49,140
How about that Tony Ferguson? Marce Damn.
Why is it called a Mars? Well, you know,

1586
01:31:49,141 --> 01:31:49,974
cause you,
you,

1587
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:55,150
you got a name every move
and every position and every
transition in my opinion

1588
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:57,960
to in order to teach at the highest level.

1589
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:00,100
So there's a difference between getting

1590
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,390
a dark when you're on top and you're
using your weight. He wasn't on top.

1591
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:07,630
He cinched it in and went
to his back and mark laymen,

1592
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:12,280
he's a very well known MMA jujitsu
coach. Uh, he used to do that.

1593
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:17,730
He's the one who actually called it the
doors when it was named after the first

1594
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:22,740
guy he saw use it. Joe, Doris, and
I think his name is DRC. That's,

1595
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:27,520
that's who mark layman is very similar
to me as we'd like to name everything

1596
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:32,200
that doesn't have names and lots of
Jujitsu moves didn't, so you got a name,

1597
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:35,800
there's a difference between the
marks cause the Marsis on your back.

1598
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:39,700
And that's how he used to do it. He,
he said that was his thing that he did.

1599
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:42,860
His squeeze was so tight that he didn't
need to be on top and he'd like rolling

1600
01:32:42,861 --> 01:32:45,300
guys and they didn't expect it.
And so he called it the marsh.

1601
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,380
There's also off a force,

1602
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:51,070
which I don't know if a guy
named Freddy made it up.

1603
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,630
I don't know the story behind farce,

1604
01:32:52,631 --> 01:32:55,990
but that's when you're kind of
mounting the guy and you have,

1605
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,140
you are mounting the guy in
the habit doors. So there's,

1606
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:03,550
there's a different variations of it and
the one that Tony Transit, 10th planet,

1607
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:06,460
Costa Mesa all week and every Thursday
he comes up and trains with me.

1608
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:09,730
And that's the move you got to
watch when you're on with Tony.

1609
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:13,390
He does flying darcis man,
he's, he's, I mean his,

1610
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:18,190
his Jujitsu is very underrated man. He's
going to shock a lot of people over the,

1611
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,870
over the his career.

1612
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,780
Well that Darcy did,
he hit that dude with,

1613
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:26,781
he immediately scooted under him and
then almost like an inverted crucifix and

1614
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,520
ties his arm up with
his legs from the bottom

1615
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:33,940
as that confidence in your
squeeze to do that. Yeah.

1616
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,680
So that tells you a lot. Yeah. Wow.

1617
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:39,170
You don't ever see
anybody going to the Mars.

1618
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:43,460
You see people going to the Darce and if
the guy on the bottom roles you should

1619
01:33:43,461 --> 01:33:46,280
be able to roll with them even if it
turns into a Mars still finish it.

1620
01:33:46,281 --> 01:33:50,180
But you don't go there voluntarily
unless you have your super confident with

1621
01:33:50,181 --> 01:33:50,420
them.

1622
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:54,380
Having those long arms is such a
massive advantage. It really is. Yeah.

1623
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:57,500
As far as like that leverage
that you can get with long limbs,

1624
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:02,840
it's really incredible. Guys who have
like wicked Darcy's and have long arms,

1625
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,420
they can just like shove them
under platelet Kendall Grove.

1626
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:08,570
Kendall Grove used to catch them and
all sorts of weird spots cause he could

1627
01:34:08,571 --> 01:34:12,030
just, he had like an extra foot
on his arms. Yup. Jeff Glover is,

1628
01:34:12,031 --> 01:34:16,880
well he's one of the best at Darcy's.
Jeff Glover lets you pass him.

1629
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:20,600
I love that move where he lets you get
into side control and you think you're

1630
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:23,030
going to assign control but
really just go into Darcel land.

1631
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,920
It just catches it in. The transition
is Jujitsu for people don't know.

1632
01:34:27,921 --> 01:34:32,540
It's so fucking technical. There's
so many techniques. I mean it's,

1633
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,380
it's truly amazing when you
stop and consider the positions,

1634
01:34:36,381 --> 01:34:40,310
the amount of different possibilities
each position holds and then different

1635
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:42,740
ways to submit people and
are they all flow together?

1636
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:46,190
If you've never done it before,
it's hard to kind of understand it.

1637
01:34:46,191 --> 01:34:47,710
And I know that's one
of the things that I,

1638
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:52,760
I take a lot of time on when it comes
to uh, uh, ground battle in the UFC.

1639
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:56,270
I always make sure I try to
explain what a guy is trying to do,

1640
01:34:56,271 --> 01:34:58,340
where it becomes a, where he's, you know,

1641
01:34:58,341 --> 01:35:01,790
where he's going to and people get
a chance to see it more that way.

1642
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:03,350
But unless you train yourself,

1643
01:35:03,351 --> 01:35:07,490
you'll never really truly understand
the beauty of it. If you train yourself,

1644
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,940
you'll get a sense of what it's like to
struggle to actually catch a guy in a

1645
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:15,080
position. Then you'll understand how
amazing it is when you see like really,

1646
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:19,930
really high level stuff. When you see
a mad scramble at Kron Gracie and uh,

1647
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,800
Gary Tona and Gary taken Crohn's back and
that wild scramble, they kept rolling,

1648
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:28,670
Kep Rolling, kept rolling that Pam
locks up the body triangle like, fuck.

1649
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,420
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's uh,

1650
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:36,730
it's an art that anybody can do. Children,
old ladies, they all do it. It's really,

1651
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,740
really easy. It's, I'm
not trying to sell it to,

1652
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:43,660
obviously I want to make money,
but it's the truth.

1653
01:35:43,661 --> 01:35:45,280
The truth is anybody can learn it.

1654
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,990
All you have to do to show up to your
local Jujitsu school and just watch,

1655
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,470
just go and just watch a couple times.
It's free. You don't have to commit to it.

1656
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:57,160
Just tell the guy you want to watch and
you watch and you realize all my God,

1657
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,780
I had it all wrong.
You know,

1658
01:35:58,781 --> 01:36:01,180
yet you expect that you're gonna show
up and there's going to be all these

1659
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:05,080
fucking douchebags killing each
other and bleeding on each other.

1660
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:09,970
And you realize it's a bunch of nerds.
It's a bunch of computer nerds. And,

1661
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,270
and after you,
after you watched one class,

1662
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:16,720
you should be sold on it and you
don't have to roll. And Do, you know,

1663
01:36:16,721 --> 01:36:19,360
people are scared of rolling and oh,
would it be taps and hurts me.

1664
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:23,090
It's so rare that anybody
gets hurt. Really. It so rare

1665
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:26,320
usually get hurt more from positions
than you do from submissions.

1666
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,650
You get hurt more when you leg gets
tripped on to you, but you know,

1667
01:36:29,651 --> 01:36:32,980
as you get better at it, that becomes
less than the last. And as you,

1668
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,300
if you're in a good school,

1669
01:36:34,301 --> 01:36:39,301
like 10th planet or like there's so many
good schools in La and we get spoiled,

1670
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:43,450
but most places have to be good in
order to stay open in this day and age

1671
01:36:43,451 --> 01:36:46,630
because there's so much competition.
Does amazing amounts of competition.

1672
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,570
Yeah.
From Jujitsu are beginning classes are,

1673
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:52,720
we kind of changed up a
little over the years.

1674
01:36:52,721 --> 01:36:57,721
I realized that most people are a lot
more scared of going to a Jujitsu class

1675
01:36:58,691 --> 01:37:01,240
and checking it out and taking
one class than I thought.

1676
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:05,770
They're way more scared than I thought.
So I understand that. I used to,

1677
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,780
I used to think that,
you know,

1678
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:12,310
if you should know that it's a safe sport
and you should know if you want to do

1679
01:37:12,311 --> 01:37:15,580
it or not. And if you're not totally into
it, I don't want to talk you into it.

1680
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,540
You should just know.

1681
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,840
And then that leaves me with a
small percentage of the population,

1682
01:37:19,841 --> 01:37:23,620
which I consider you're my family.
But in reality,

1683
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:28,540
if uh, I changed my beginner
classes and make them more,

1684
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:32,050
cater more to the guys that want to do it.
But they're just scared of debt.

1685
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,270
They're scared of death
of signing a contract.

1686
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:37,450
They're scared to death of getting hurt.
They're coming into Jujitsu is scared.

1687
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,210
So you got to really think about,
uh,

1688
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:44,890
just walking them through it nice and
slowly showing them that there's nothing

1689
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:47,650
to be scared of. This is a beautiful
thing that everyone can learn.

1690
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,610
You can learn to get really good at
putting people to sleep in six months.

1691
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:55,910
You know, another thing is,
um, don't be afraid to tap.
That's another thing that I,

1692
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,190
I make sure I really tell people,
it's nothing wrong with tapping.

1693
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:01,940
It's not that bad. Just go
in there and tap. It's, it's,

1694
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,000
you've got to think about it.

1695
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:06,210
Like someone's scoring a point on you
in basketball, it's going to happen.

1696
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,540
It's totally normal. Yeah.
And once you get past that,

1697
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,990
and especially if you're training with
good people, you tap them, they tap you.

1698
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,640
Doesn't matter.
It's good for you.

1699
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:17,430
And if you can't have a guy but
he can cat tap you, guess what?

1700
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,610
That's good for you too. It's good for
you to know that someone can tap you.

1701
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,460
You need to up your game and up your
skill level to get to the point where he's

1702
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:26,310
at, but just because he taps it
was no big deal. It doesn't matter.

1703
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:27,630
People tapped people all the time.

1704
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:31,320
That's one of the biggest reasons
people are afraid to come in and they're

1705
01:38:31,321 --> 01:38:35,070
afraid to lose this game of death
cause really that's why Jujitsu is so

1706
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:40,071
fascinating and such a beautiful thing
because really it applies to life in on

1707
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:43,560
the streets, saving your family,
protecting your, your children,

1708
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:47,310
protecting your wife,
your wife, protecting your
children and back and forth,

1709
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:51,030
your children knowing Jujitsu and
protecting their father and son, you know,

1710
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:56,000
whole family where everyone does Jujitsu.
That's increases your chances,

1711
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:00,060
chances of survival and like some
apocalyptic era. Well either way,

1712
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:04,050
it's a great way to exercise.
It's a great discipline. It's,

1713
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,720
it's great for your body.
It's great for your mind.

1714
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:11,430
Like after we leave Jujitsu class,
tell me when we more like loose,

1715
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:12,870
relax and silly.

1716
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,960
Then after Jujitsu meals like to
leave the parking lot after Jujitsu

1717
01:39:18,271 --> 01:39:20,250
conversations where everybody's exhausted.

1718
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:23,250
You've been fighting for your life for
the past hour and a half and we're all

1719
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:24,300
just hanging out,
chilling,

1720
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:28,770
and tried to kill each other just an
hour before virtual reality. Exactly,

1721
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,970
and you get used to that.

1722
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:32,910
It becomes a normal thing for folks
where it's not a normal thing.

1723
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:37,470
It seems daunting. It seems terrifying.
It seems uninviting, but believe me,

1724
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,350
I know a lot of, like you
said, nerds and it's a lot,

1725
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:44,220
a lot of Nice people in Jujitsu to people
who have a good control of their ego.

1726
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,650
We've, we've talked about that
on this podcast many times,

1727
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:48,920
but I think it needs
repeating and it's absolutely,

1728
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:54,030
I can't tell you how many
tweets, emails, messages,

1729
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:54,721
how many,

1730
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:59,010
I guess I listened to you guys talk about
Jujitsu on the podcast over and over,

1731
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:03,390
and then I finally went to a school and
I tried it and guess what? You are right.

1732
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:07,080
This is amazing. This is changing
my life. My son's doing it now too.

1733
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:12,081
It's toe and that is
the most likely outcome.

1734
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,050
If you give it a shot and you have an
open mind and leave your ego at the door

1735
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:20,040
is it's gonna Change your life for
the going to give you without a doubt,

1736
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:24,270
it's going to be one of the best vehicles
for developing your confidence that

1737
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:27,900
you can ever find. It will change
your confidence. And that's women,

1738
01:40:27,901 --> 01:40:29,430
including women.
You know,

1739
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,740
like think about a women that
you know that have gone to,

1740
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:35,460
your school's gone to different Jujitsu
classes and gotten better at it and then

1741
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:39,120
they become like more relaxed person.
They become a different person.

1742
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:41,940
They're not worried about their
self defense around men anymore.

1743
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:45,230
They know that the reality is a
girl is a brown belt in Jujitsu.

1744
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,170
Like remember when we had Felicia do
that thing with Seymour Butts? Yes.

1745
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,070
Explain any more bucks is a nice guy.
He's a porn star and a porn

1746
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,340
producer and he had a show
on showtime on showtime.

1747
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,250
I don't remember what the name of it was.
Do you remember the show?

1748
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:04,480
Maybe we'll just see more butts. I
don't remember what it was. But anyway,

1749
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:08,700
real nice guy. And one of the episodes,
he wanted to come down and do Jujitsu. Uh,

1750
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:13,180
with a woman? No, no, no. He just wanted
to come down and do Jujitsu. Oh really?

1751
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:15,730
It was not with a woman.
He didn't want to do it with Felicia.

1752
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:20,500
Did you set that up by
Harvard? Felicia. Oh,

1753
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:21,490
who's a friend of ours.

1754
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:26,491
She's a black belt under John Jacques
Machado and a legit bonafide bad ass.

1755
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:31,630
She's like 135 pounds. She's not a
big woman, but she is strong as fuck.

1756
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:35,920
And her Jujitsu is top notch and she's
really smart. She's super, super,

1757
01:41:35,921 --> 01:41:38,320
super smart.
So she just gets good at anything.

1758
01:41:38,321 --> 01:41:42,880
She just knows how to get good at shit
and her and see more butts rolled.

1759
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,500
It was like his first day and
she man handled this poor lad.

1760
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:51,700
He didn't get hurt. He just
lost the game. She was so nice.

1761
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:56,980
Never feels amazing when you tap
out, it doesn't feel refreshing. No,

1762
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:00,640
and that's why it's so beautiful
because it didn't feel good.

1763
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,280
You just lost a game of death.
No one got hurt.

1764
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:08,170
But that tap represented the fact
that he had your life in his hands.

1765
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:11,200
And the only reason he let go his cause
he's a cool guy and everyone's cool in

1766
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:16,170
class. But in reality of if he, if he was
a Douche bag and he wanted to kill you,

1767
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:17,980
he could have, yeah, they take your life.

1768
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:20,830
If someone wanted to choke you out and
then stomp your head out while your

1769
01:42:20,831 --> 01:42:25,390
unconscious, that's what happens. But the
point is, Felicia, being a small woman,

1770
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:30,280
uh, just, just using her technique, just
tapped him over and over and over again,

1771
01:42:30,281 --> 01:42:32,920
got an a triangle, got his
back, got him in an arm bar.

1772
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:37,430
And the way she did it was so fluid and
beautiful and you watch the episode, it,

1773
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:41,020
it doesn't,
I don't think it goes down like that.

1774
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:46,021
They edit it to make him look good because
we shot a segment where I'm teaching

1775
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:49,960
and I'm teaching him and we're doing the
teaching segment. And then I asked them,

1776
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:52,150
do you want to roll to, cause he
didn't even know where like rolling,

1777
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:55,720
we kind of spar and he said, yeah, yeah,
we'll shoot that and we'll do that.

1778
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:59,480
And I go, well we'll spar with the woman
you know and make it. And it was like, ah,

1779
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:04,420
okay. Whatever. That was
your idea. That is so funny.

1780
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,040
It was so long ago I forgot.
Yeah.

1781
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,360
Generally if you're a girl out there and
you do Jujitsu for solid for one year

1782
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:15,130
solid you,

1783
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:20,080
the chances of you getting
raped go down significantly.

1784
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:24,610
It's very hard to rape a Jujitsu girl
and it doesn't take that long to get good

1785
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:26,580
at what it said within two years.
Time flies you,

1786
01:43:26,581 --> 01:43:28,840
they'll be doing it three years just
like that. And you're a bad ass.

1787
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:32,530
The last time I rolled with Felicia,
I think I was a purple belt.

1788
01:43:32,531 --> 01:43:33,460
I might've been a brown belt,

1789
01:43:33,461 --> 01:43:37,750
was either purple or brown belt and it's
not like I was like trying to kill her,

1790
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:40,360
but I didn't tag her but didn't dabber.

1791
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:45,250
So he's 135 pounds and she just fucking
good man. Really? She's fucking,

1792
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,250
she's really strong and she's fucking
good. And when someone's really good,

1793
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,620
they know how to put themselves in the
perfect position and they know how to

1794
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:51,230
keep,

1795
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:54,170
they know how to keep getting away from
anything that you're trying to do to

1796
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:57,140
them and putting themselves in a better
position to defend a better position to

1797
01:43:57,141 --> 01:44:01,280
attack that being many steps ahead of
the person you're doing it with because

1798
01:44:01,281 --> 01:44:04,190
they don't know what you're doing. Give
someone a massive amount of confidence.

1799
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,330
And I've seen girls go into Jujitsu class,
start getting good,

1800
01:44:08,331 --> 01:44:09,890
and then start tapping out guys.

1801
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,920
And when they start tapping out
guys is a wild thing to watch.

1802
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,870
It's a wild thing to see the guy's face.

1803
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:17,120
It's a wild thing to see
a girl like cinch up.

1804
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,120
First girl I ever saw type of dude out
was his girl junk and he used to roll

1805
01:44:20,121 --> 01:44:23,750
with, they were both beginners. And uh,

1806
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:28,880
do you remember we got Dunkin and Ari
gave them a free year for like Christmas.

1807
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:32,790
Do you remember that? Uh,
yes. Yeah, very well. Ari,

1808
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:37,100
Ari stuck it out. Are he got some taps
in? Not some dudes. He kept going,

1809
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:42,430
but Dunkin ran into this girl who
was very pretty and very girly,

1810
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:46,360
but she tapped him with the quickness,
like how many times did she tab?

1811
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:50,150
I'm just happy with like several.
It was ugly, but that was,

1812
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:53,750
it was fascinating to watch.
Like this girl realizing like she could,

1813
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,600
if she knew the techniques better,
she could get a guy.

1814
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,370
The guy's probably stronger than her.

1815
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,930
She can still get them that
scarred Duncan. He, no,

1816
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:04,720
he didn't lie.

1817
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:09,290
I think he showed up to maybe
a handful of classes at most.

1818
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:13,880
He already stuck it out for awhile.
Yeah, but with Ari, he got hurt. He,

1819
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:17,090
something happened to his knee, I
think. Got a staff and then he had a,

1820
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,530
well he had an meniscus surgery
and then he got staff. Yeah,

1821
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:22,310
and that was too much. You
couldn't take it. Some people.

1822
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:28,070
There's a small percentage of people that
get hurt doing Jujitsu and that scares

1823
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:29,900
them and they never want to
come back with generally,

1824
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:33,080
most of the people who do what you did
to love it so much that the first thing

1825
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:34,190
they think of when they get hurt,

1826
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,920
they're pissed off because they're
going to be out for six weeks or they're

1827
01:45:36,921 --> 01:45:39,470
going to be out for three months.
They're going, that's why they're pissed.

1828
01:45:39,471 --> 01:45:40,820
They can't wait to get back.

1829
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,100
And you can't wait to get
back so much that you're like,

1830
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,910
you see a lot of times you come back too
early and you're not really healed ride

1831
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:49,800
and then you reinjure yourself.
So that's generally,

1832
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:54,110
if you come in with an open mind
and you leave your ego at the door,

1833
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:57,590
generally you're going to fall in love
with it. It's going to change your life.

1834
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:58,640
And when you get hurt,

1835
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:02,300
you're more bummed about missing Jujitsu
than you are about the actual injury,

1836
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:05,090
you know?
But there are some people that they might,

1837
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,430
they get ringworm once and they're like,
fuck this.

1838
01:46:07,431 --> 01:46:09,770
You get what you want me to
except ring warm. You know,

1839
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:13,400
it's very easy to eliminate ringworm.
You never have to deal with it.

1840
01:46:13,401 --> 01:46:16,820
If you can be consistent with the yogurt
and the acid office and defense soap,

1841
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:21,350
get some defense.
So absolute tell everybody is the best.

1842
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:24,590
And it's a great company owned
by great guy in the company.

1843
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:28,310
They said they support wrestlers and
they developed soap that cleans your skin

1844
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:31,840
without fucking up all the natural
bacteria. All the healthy for.

1845
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:34,250
I was resistant to defense.

1846
01:46:34,251 --> 01:46:37,010
So for a while I never really looked
into it in the very beginning.

1847
01:46:37,011 --> 01:46:40,660
I thought it was so self that
had all these antibiotics,

1848
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,120
antibiotics, and chemicals that I didn't
want to have nothing to do with it.

1849
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:45,050
It just sounded like that.

1850
01:46:45,051 --> 01:46:48,350
But when I finally looked into it and
found out that it was just eucalyptus,

1851
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,040
eucalyptus oil and

1852
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,680
oil at in high amounts,

1853
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,650
it's like wait like three times
the amount that you find it.

1854
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:58,500
And I bring that everywhere
on the road with me. I don't,

1855
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:00,520
I don't go to a hotel room
unless I have that sheet.

1856
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:04,620
I use deep defense soap every day,
every day.

1857
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,970
Now once I found out it was all natural
and I was sold and now that I don't need

1858
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:11,610
shampoo anymore, I use it on the top
of my head too. I use it everywhere.

1859
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:16,000
I use it a shampoo. Damn
you crazy. You crazy.

1860
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:21,380
That keeps dandruff away cause Dandruff
is a form of fungus similar to ringworm.

1861
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,380
Totally makes sense.
Yeah.

1862
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:27,600
Well healthy skin flora is something
that people don't even think about.

1863
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:28,530
But you know,

1864
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:31,920
I mean that's what killed
a lot of motherfuckers back
in the day when people got

1865
01:47:31,921 --> 01:47:36,610
scratched and you know, they got some
sort of infection and you know, they,

1866
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:39,240
they, people used to dive
infections all the time.

1867
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,800
That's like one of the biggest death.

1868
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,950
So it was the biggest scary things
about going into a hospital today is

1869
01:47:43,951 --> 01:47:45,480
infections.
You know,

1870
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:48,900
and you can do a little bit to
prevent that stuff by healthy diet.

1871
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,230
Eating a lot of probiotics.
Even if you're a Vegan,

1872
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:53,640
say if you only eat vegetables,

1873
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:57,150
you could still get probiotics in
the form of Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut,

1874
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:59,650
like natural, raw sauerkraut.
Super good for you.

1875
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,820
Can have acid off pills.

1876
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:07,740
Well see they shouldn't even really have
Kombucha because Kombucha is a fungus

1877
01:48:07,741 --> 01:48:10,190
and the fungus is actually closer to a,

1878
01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:12,960
a person than an aunt than a plant is.

1879
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:17,490
Funguses are actually closer to human
beings and plants are funguses are

1880
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:21,540
actually much more like an animal
than they are like a plant.

1881
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:25,830
So if you're a true Vegan
and you're eating Kombucha,
you're kind of a hypocrite.

1882
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:29,720
The mushrooms, you're kind of a
hypocrite. Too Shallow. But the,

1883
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:30,600
I mean that's probably,

1884
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:33,360
they actually probably want you to eat
him and that's the whole idea behind

1885
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:35,880
silicide. [inaudible] silicide
been wants you to eat it.

1886
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:39,270
That's why it's big and
white and gigantic. It's it,

1887
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:43,020
it shows up like it shows
itself very easily on a,

1888
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,120
on like a cow patties and shit like that.

1889
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:48,300
Like it's literally like
inviting you to come and eat it.

1890
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:51,000
Cause that's how it communicates
with the light. Yeah. I mean come on.

1891
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:53,970
How beautiful red ones,
right? Yeah. Beautiful though.
Let's say Amanita Mascara,

1892
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:57,540
but silicide been the ones that grow
on cow shit. They have, you know,

1893
01:48:57,541 --> 01:49:00,810
the big giant ones in the Amazon.
They grow the size of dinner plates,

1894
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,840
what's the difference?
They both get you to that other dimension.

1895
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,590
Am Anita miscarry is a very
controversial mushroom.

1896
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:11,370
And for folks who never heard of the
Amnesia miscarry and had one red one with

1897
01:49:11,371 --> 01:49:13,650
the white spots, it's
literally Santa Claus. Okay.

1898
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:17,040
And I'll break it down real quick. For
people who have never heard this before,

1899
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,930
go to my wife. Look, look up Joe Google.
Joe Rogan a Santa Claus was a mushroom.

1900
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:25,410
I wrote a whole article about it and like
to balance the 2006 or something like

1901
01:49:25,411 --> 01:49:28,350
that on my website.
And what I'm about to explain,

1902
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:29,360
I'm gonna have to explain to people,
okay,

1903
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:34,080
the Amanita miscarry and mushroom
is native to Siberia, to Europe.

1904
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,030
It's a different mushroom,
the mushroom,

1905
01:49:36,031 --> 01:49:39,180
the psilocybin mushroom that you see
in tropical climates. And you also,

1906
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:43,820
we've seen a lot of places now the Pacific
northwest has a lot of, um, it's that,

1907
01:49:43,821 --> 01:49:46,890
that's a different experience and that's
a much more accessible experience and

1908
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:48,430
it's much more reliable experience.

1909
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,310
The AMANITA Mascara oftentimes
isn't even psychoactive.

1910
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:54,280
Like they don't know what makes
it psychoactive and what doesn't.

1911
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,840
There's all sorts of speculation that
it could be a genetically variable.

1912
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:01,960
It could be seasonally
variable. It could be, you know,

1913
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:05,020
the strains of it that grew in certain
areas and they were super potent,

1914
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:07,220
but they don't exist anymore.
Or You have to find,

1915
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:12,850
I've never had a good Amanita miscarry
trip. I only had one, um, to speak of.

1916
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,760
That was, uh, that really blew it out.

1917
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:18,550
But we took 'em we took silicide been to,

1918
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:22,010
we took damn Anita for like an hour and
it wasn't doing shit. Is that us? No, no,

1919
01:50:22,011 --> 01:50:26,830
no. It was me and Stan. Hope me, Stan
Hope and um, Yon Urban, how many grams?

1920
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:33,180
He made this weird soup. He made like a
tea with the, uh, the Amanita Mascara.

1921
01:50:33,181 --> 01:50:34,480
Like he knows how to do all that shit.

1922
01:50:34,481 --> 01:50:38,640
He's yon is pretty well versed in how to
prepare these things. There was amount,

1923
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:42,500
an amount, a specific amount that tends
Mckenna and five, about five grand. Five.

1924
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:43,540
Well, that's, that's,

1925
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:46,450
that's silicide and this is the
[inaudible] scary like I was saying. Okay.

1926
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:49,630
So we took that and then,
uh, an hour or so in,

1927
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:53,960
we decided to jump it with psilocybin
and then when we jumped it with silicide

1928
01:50:53,961 --> 01:50:57,520
man, wow. The, the two of them together,

1929
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:01,690
it was pretty fucking intense and it was
the day of the war. So it was really,

1930
01:51:01,691 --> 01:51:05,860
really, really weird. And we
had this motto de Cocoa Tea.

1931
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,530
It's a,
it's cocaine tea.

1932
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,980
It's tea that's a derived
from cocoa leaves.

1933
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:14,860
Like natural coca leaves is
more shear that yon had legal,

1934
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:20,110
I don't want to believe so
I would say nay. But uh,

1935
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:24,400
it should be because the, the actual
leaves themselves in these indigenous

1936
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:28,780
high altitude hurting populations,
they just chew them,

1937
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:32,710
could shoot them all day and it's like
tobacco to them or like anything else

1938
01:51:32,711 --> 01:51:34,510
that people normally
have. It's like, you know,

1939
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:38,620
like chewing gum or something like
that and it provides a clean stimulant.

1940
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:41,200
It's when you break it down
and turn it into cocaine,

1941
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:45,190
then it becomes like a real fucking pain
in the ass comes addictive and you know,

1942
01:51:45,191 --> 01:51:46,390
people get weirded out on it,

1943
01:51:46,391 --> 01:51:49,420
but they say it's actually better for
you than coffee if you just chew the

1944
01:51:49,421 --> 01:51:54,020
leaves. I, I just found out within the
last year I saw a documentary on where uh,

1945
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:58,310
ecstasy comes from the, the, the
ingredient Mtma, right? Yeah.

1946
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,960
It comes from these trees
in Thailand and Cambodia.

1947
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:07,300
They're like chopping down all these
trees to get like the inner core of it.

1948
01:52:07,301 --> 01:52:09,850
And that's what makes ecstasy.
How crazy is that?

1949
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,840
Like a pure lab created thing?
I did too.

1950
01:52:13,841 --> 01:52:16,810
I think there was a vice documentary
on it. Another fucking vice one.

1951
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:20,710
Those vice guys are on top of everything.
Maybe that's the one I saw, probably.

1952
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:22,480
Yes.
But it was fascinating.

1953
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,260
It all comes from Cambodia and Thailand
and there's a lot of violence associated

1954
01:52:26,261 --> 01:52:29,230
with where these trees are now because
people are killing people to try to get

1955
01:52:29,231 --> 01:52:32,200
to these trees. Crazy.
Yeah. I wonder what, uh,

1956
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:35,590
how that would be like taking it naturally
like right from the tree. I know,

1957
01:52:35,591 --> 01:52:37,070
right?
I wonder if you could,

1958
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:43,220
that's the truth.
That's a movie.

1959
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:45,950
A group of guys that go find
a tree that's like three hot

1960
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:46,670
chicks.

1961
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:50,990
All the chicks die of course within the
first 45 minutes or one survives only

1962
01:52:50,991 --> 01:52:53,090
one at the end.
Ecstasy is a funny one,

1963
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:57,640
man. It's a really funny one. It's a
really interesting one because it's a,

1964
01:52:57,870 --> 01:53:00,770
it's thought of as like a
party drug and it certainly is,

1965
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:04,610
but you can learn a lot on ecstasy.
Man. I've only done it once,

1966
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:09,470
but I learned a lot. I had a very
beneficial trip. I paid the price with my,

1967
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:13,960
my, my mental health for the last couple
of days afterwards I was wrecked. Yeah,

1968
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,480
and my brain was not working well,
come down. It's terrible for me.

1969
01:53:17,481 --> 01:53:19,670
It was for some people apparently is not.

1970
01:53:19,671 --> 01:53:24,590
Or if you take five HTP supposedly
if you a you down five HTP, new mood.

1971
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:27,340
That's why that's five HTP as well.
We moved.

1972
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:30,810
It has a nail trim specifically
created for the party or well,

1973
01:53:30,811 --> 01:53:35,540
used to be a roll on roll on and roll off.
Do you remember?

1974
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:40,430
Are you joking around really serious? You
don't remember. Don't remember. Roll on.

1975
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:41,840
Aubrey created it.
The,

1976
01:53:41,841 --> 01:53:46,790
the original thing was RB likes to
party and he created it to two k for the

1977
01:53:46,791 --> 01:53:51,620
comedown off ecstasy because five HTP,
new mood became right, sort of. It became,

1978
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:55,100
it was enhanced and now new mood has a
bunch of different shit in and like Elle

1979
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:59,200
trip to fan which converts to five HTP.
So it has like a time release, etc. Yeah.

1980
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:03,950
Well it's better in that there's more
than one mechanism for converting five HDP

1981
01:54:03,951 --> 01:54:06,920
to Serotonin.
The El trip to fan converts to five HTP,

1982
01:54:06,921 --> 01:54:08,300
which to convert to Serotonin.

1983
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:12,740
It gives you the building
blocks to replenish your
serotonin surprise after you

1984
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:13,640
do something like that,

1985
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:17,540
but also gives you the extra
serotonin throughout your day would,

1986
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:20,930
which picks your mood up so much self
man that they save for people who are

1987
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:23,270
taking ssrs or antidepressants,

1988
01:54:23,271 --> 01:54:27,460
they tell them not to take
five HTP because Neal Brennan,
you know Neal Brennan,

1989
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,570
the dude who I met from the show,
he uh,

1990
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:34,040
was on five HTP but it was
also taken an antidepressant.

1991
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:37,220
The doctor told him to lay off the five
HTP cause he would give him too much

1992
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:41,180
serotonin. Huh? Yeah. That's for
real. Oh, it's definitely for real.

1993
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,290
Have you tried any of that shit?

1994
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,450
Well, I will say this, uh,

1995
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:48,650
Depeche mode was just in town last month
and after the Depeche mode concert,

1996
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:50,870
I did take some new mood.
Took about four of them.

1997
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,790
I see what you're saying.
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1998
01:54:53,791 --> 01:54:56,340
Without saying you're talking about it.
Know he should've done,

1999
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:00,230
he should've taken alpha brain before
the Depeche mode concert and you wouldn't

2000
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,290
smart enough to not go

2001
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:04,610
oh,

2002
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:07,400
oh no.
Oh No.

2003
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,393
I

2004
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:13,230
sold out the staples center
three nights in a row. Come on.

2005
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:18,660
We haven't had a hit singles, 10 years
flight status, old friend of ours,

2006
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:20,760
I think you were friends with them.
I was friends with him.

2007
01:55:20,761 --> 01:55:23,970
He used to work at the comedy store.
I was murdered last night.

2008
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:27,570
I don't ever remember.
Katie used to work there.

2009
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:31,830
I at the comedy store and he
recently moved to Las Las Vegas.

2010
01:55:31,831 --> 01:55:34,740
And what happened is this
gunman came into at night club,

2011
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:39,070
I believe it took a comms and a
shot, two uh, two guys and then, uh,

2012
01:55:39,071 --> 01:55:43,230
he was just a supposedly a guy that was
at this club and he tried to tackle guy

2013
01:55:43,231 --> 01:55:46,320
because he's, the guy was pointing
his gun too, like innocent people.

2014
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:50,490
So he was like doing a hero thing and
then he got shot. And you remember,

2015
01:55:50,491 --> 01:55:53,160
I don't know if you remember,
Katie is one of the nicest guy

2016
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:59,730
I was dating Katie. No, no, his
name was Kay. His name's Katy. Katy.

2017
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:03,350
Yeah. We talked about Katie yesterday
on the podcast. I'll hilarious. She was,

2018
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:05,510
that makes a k d was
wanting to actually my,

2019
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:09,810
one of my first friends in Los Angeles
when I first moved there. That's terrible.

2020
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:14,120
Fuck man. There was another
school shooting the other day too.

2021
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:15,820
Did you hear about that
shit? Yeah. Real quick.

2022
01:56:15,821 --> 01:56:18,890
Let's really get to the school shooting
back to the mushroom thing. I'm reading.

2023
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,720
Oh yeah.
We didn't even describe the difference.

2024
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:24,770
I'm reading a baby book and this is,
this is back the mushrooms and I will,

2025
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:28,700
I've never read so many God damn books
in my life over the last six months.

2026
01:56:28,701 --> 01:56:32,420
My kid, that's his favorite shit
is to have, he goes, grabs a book.

2027
01:56:32,421 --> 01:56:34,520
We have 1000 bucks.
He grabs his favorite,

2028
01:56:34,521 --> 01:56:36,440
but when he sits on my lap and I read it,
he loves that.

2029
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:40,440
He knows what the last page is. And
I'll flip it over, start it over. Sorry.

2030
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:41,540
Start it over.

2031
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:46,400
And there's this one book about Nicholas
the bunny and he's talking about how in

2032
01:56:46,401 --> 01:56:48,560
the fall I like to watch the leaves.

2033
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:53,710
And then in the winter I find shelter
from the rain under a toadstool and uh,

2034
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:00,170
and it's a mushroom. I never heard
mushrooms, uh, called toadstools before.

2035
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:01,970
Why is it cause,
and then on the other side,

2036
01:57:01,971 --> 01:57:05,930
there's a mushroom with a tote actually
sitting on top of the mushroom, right?

2037
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:08,750
Yeah. They'd been called
toadstools forever. But they also,

2038
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:13,070
if you look up any old
school Christmas shit. Yeah.

2039
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:17,290
All old school Christmas cards, anything
with elves, they all have mushrooms them.

2040
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:21,350
And they have that mushroom to Amanita
miscarry mushroom. Don't, isn't there,

2041
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:25,250
isn't there a myth that if you lick
a frog's ass, you get high? No,

2042
01:57:25,251 --> 01:57:29,450
it's not a myth at all. It's real. Some
frogs, frogs. It's different though.

2043
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:32,300
What they have is five Meo DMT in them.

2044
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,820
But what I'm saying is I
open up this baby book.

2045
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:38,660
There's a little bunny Nicholas the bunny
hiding under a toadstool and then they

2046
01:57:38,661 --> 01:57:43,661
show a mushroom and a frog on
top of it sitting down on it.

2047
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:48,140
So maybe that's why, uh,
when you lick a frog's ass,

2048
01:57:48,141 --> 01:57:50,480
you get high because they
actually sit on mushrooms.

2049
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:54,650
Maybe they're using the mushroom
texted. We don't extract. Listen,

2050
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:58,650
you don't look a frog's ass. You don't
lick a frog to get high the way there's,

2051
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:01,460
this doesn't work. [inaudible]
Grecian. Yeah. This is what it is.

2052
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:05,660
There's an excretion from certain types
of Frog's skin and you have to rub it on

2053
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:09,650
glass. So you take this frog and you rub
them on glass and they'll excrete their

2054
01:58:09,651 --> 01:58:13,010
substance on the grass. Then you take that
glass, you put in the sun, it dries out.

2055
01:58:13,011 --> 01:58:16,280
Then you take a razor blade and you
scrape it off the glass and it's a white

2056
01:58:16,281 --> 01:58:20,660
powder. You smoked that white powder and
it's five methoxy dimethyltryptamine.

2057
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:24,860
Now is that secretion coming from the
rectum? It's coming from their skin. Okay.

2058
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:28,160
It's that whole thing of licking a
frog is just one of those urban myths.

2059
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:30,720
It just, it's just weird than
an a baby book. You'll see.

2060
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:34,850
You hear about the mess of licking frogs
ass and they're sitting on maybe cause

2061
01:58:34,851 --> 01:58:38,720
you know you, some people put ecstasy
pills in their ass for better absorption.

2062
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:42,040
You heard of that Brian?
Right? So maybe the frog is

2063
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,010
trying to get high and maybe they figured
out how to get high by sitting on a

2064
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:45,580
mushroom.

2065
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:49,280
It goes up their ass and they get home
and then you lick a frog's ass and you

2066
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:51,400
gotta. That's all I'm saying.
This was in a baby book,

2067
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:55,560
the name of the frog, it's
called the Bufo. I'll reassess

2068
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,820
and you can't get followed by looking at,
if I remember correctly,

2069
01:58:58,821 --> 01:59:02,720
it's super concentrated and
super dangerous though to
do it. To get to lick it,

2070
01:59:02,721 --> 01:59:07,670
lick it because it's really
cool. I remember I bought
the, I bought the uh, yeah,

2071
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:11,000
you got to Google shit like that. Bottom
frog to do this and I been looks called

2072
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,740
Bufo. I'll various, yeah, cob,

2073
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:19,840
it's called the Colorado river towed or
Sonoran desert toad contains five Meo

2074
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:26,510
DMT and Bufo Tenon Bufo Photon,
the photon and be Ufo.

2075
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:28,190
T. E. N. I. N.

2076
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:30,720
There's a website that sell,
sold these frogs.

2077
01:59:30,721 --> 01:59:34,050
And so I bought one and I had it for
like a month that I was like, damn,

2078
01:59:34,051 --> 01:59:38,430
that dude, was it alive? So you never
licked it. I don't even know when ever.

2079
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:42,260
I think it's a myth. If you had it, why
don't you lick it? I mean, I don't know.

2080
01:59:42,261 --> 01:59:46,350
I was too scared. Can you,
can you Google licking frogs?

2081
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:51,870
The toads fandom has concentrated on
the surface of its skin and that's why

2082
01:59:51,871 --> 01:59:55,020
licking is dangerous. Smoking
is a different story, however.

2083
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:58,110
Yeah.
Um,

2084
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:02,970
so it's too powerful. If you look at
two powerful because it's concentrated.

2085
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:07,000
Hmm. The toxic ingredient, the
toads venom is called [inaudible],

2086
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,710
which is burned off all smoking.

2087
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:13,090
That's why it's dangerous because the
two things are in it. If you burn it off,

2088
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:17,530
what's left is five Meo DMT. So you don't
want to lick it because if you lick it,

2089
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:21,970
it gives you [inaudible]. But photo
named gets burned off while you smoke it.

2090
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,580
That's why it's dangerous toys.
Yeah. So I guess it really butthole.

2091
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:30,160
So listen to this. This is what's
weird. It's a, this, this frog.

2092
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:33,630
They're native to the Colorado
River or a southern Arizona,

2093
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:35,530
California and northern New Mexico.

2094
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:40,900
Even though five Ameo DMT is
classified as an unscheduled substance,

2095
02:00:40,901 --> 02:00:42,580
which means it's legal to possess.

2096
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:47,980
But the venom also contains [inaudible],
which is scheduled.

2097
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,470
So you all you do,

2098
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,010
you can be in possession of an illegal
substance even though it's not a

2099
02:00:54,011 --> 02:00:56,590
psychedelic.
The weird thing about five Meo,

2100
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:59,510
it's stronger than nn DMT and,

2101
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:02,590
and DMT is the one that
gives you the crazy visuals.

2102
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:05,590
But the stuff that we did the
first time, that's five me. Oh,

2103
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:09,150
it's even stronger than nn and it's legal.
The one where I was screaming. Yeah,

2104
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:11,530
they did. They miss that one. And this,

2105
02:01:11,531 --> 02:01:15,840
the sweeping psychedelic drug act
of 1970 they missed five meo DM.

2106
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:19,550
This is what I had bought at Colorado
River town. Yeah, that's the motherfucker.

2107
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:22,390
Good thing you didn't look at them. Yeah,
because you wouldn't have Google it.

2108
02:01:22,391 --> 02:01:25,030
You will just, Oh I have Google
back then. I don't think,

2109
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:29,530
I think this is right before I moved here.
Well anybody listening,

2110
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:32,450
please don't lick the toad
cause you can die and don't,

2111
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,450
don't like poison this dark dark frogs.

2112
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:37,720
Yeah. But if you take that stuff
and you smoke it, it's DMT.

2113
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:40,880
You will trip your fucking
balls off if you smoke.

2114
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:44,090
The shit that comes from that toad skin,
which is really kind of crazy.

2115
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:49,190
The difference between that
and Psilocybin is very similar.

2116
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:54,470
The silicide been also is
an end dimethyltryptamine
it's got that and something

2117
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:55,304
else.
So since uh,

2118
02:01:55,400 --> 02:02:00,200
siliciden is like four Fox for
Loxley and and dimethyltryptamine.

2119
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:04,950
So the, the, the last part of it is
dimethyltryptamine then five MBO diamonds,

2120
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:05,421
a trip to me,

2121
02:02:05,421 --> 02:02:08,990
which is what these frogs have is diamond
field trip to me with like an oxygen

2122
02:02:08,991 --> 02:02:12,200
mile molecule attached to it.
So it has a different impact.

2123
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:17,270
But all that shit that's like prevalent
in children's books and folklore,

2124
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:20,060
like all those elves when you see like if

2125
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,370
at that guy's name is towed and
he has a mushroom head. Yeah.

2126
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:27,040
And he has the head of the mushroom.
That sounds cool. I was telling you, I,

2127
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:32,110
I think that's the people that
are making books for kids.

2128
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:37,510
You gotta kind of have had a mushroom
trip to really want to help kids,

2129
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:40,720
you know, and it's kind of like, like,
oh, that's crazy. I don't know man.

2130
02:02:40,721 --> 02:02:44,050
There's a lot of mushrooms, a little, they
don't have to trip on my, I don't know,

2131
02:02:44,051 --> 02:02:45,580
but I swear to God,

2132
02:02:45,581 --> 02:02:50,140
I watch a lot of educational
TV for children and they
bring up mushrooms a lot.

2133
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:53,080
What is this? It's a mushroom and
it's a red mushroom. It's like why?

2134
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:54,760
There's so many other things
you could have brought up.

2135
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,850
You're talking about mushrooms
just trying to teach it.

2136
02:02:56,980 --> 02:03:00,430
Mushrooms come up a lot and
children's books and in their TV.

2137
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:01,980
I don't know what it
mean for Mario Brothers.

2138
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:02,831
Well, look at what, yeah,

2139
02:03:02,831 --> 02:03:06,030
we'll think about Lewis Carroll
and think about Alison Wonderland.

2140
02:03:06,031 --> 02:03:06,864
It was all about acid.

2141
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,220
Yeah. Right now there's billboards
everywhere. All over La.

2142
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:12,340
There's a new show called wonderland
or something, and as a guy and a girl,

2143
02:03:12,341 --> 02:03:15,460
they're looking at each other's eyes and
the background. All of these mushrooms,

2144
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:17,080
red hat, red tops, like,

2145
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,030
yeah.
Yeah.

2146
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:22,790
Those mushrooms are what they believe
to be Santa Claus because it even looks

2147
02:03:22,791 --> 02:03:25,130
like Santa Claus. Yeah,
those mushrooms also,

2148
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:27,950
this is where it gets really crazy if
you haven't heard the whole spiel before.

2149
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:32,870
They are, they're there. They
have a symbiotic relationship
with coniferous trees,

2150
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:35,150
like pine trees that
grow under pine trees.

2151
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:39,170
They have a Michael Rise will relationship
with the soil like the those trees.

2152
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:42,080
That's where those things always grow.
They feed off of each other,

2153
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,290
so this fucking thing is
always underneath these trees,

2154
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:48,920
just like brightly colored gifts that
are always underneath Christmas trees.

2155
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:50,780
Why are Christmas trees always pine trees?

2156
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:53,390
Why do Christmas trees have these
ornaments hanging in them? You know,

2157
02:03:53,391 --> 02:03:54,950
because he's taken these mushrooms.

2158
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:58,400
He was to pull them out of the bottom
of these trees and then hang them in the

2159
02:03:58,401 --> 02:03:59,450
tree to dry them out.

2160
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:02,330
The other way they drove with dried them
out was they would have them in front

2161
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:05,720
of fireplaces.
That's why socks are white and red.

2162
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:10,280
Christmas socks or white and red. Who
the fuck has white and red sox? Nobody.

2163
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:14,120
Why would you hang your socks in
front of the fireplace like that?

2164
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:15,620
Because that's how they
dried out mushrooms.

2165
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:19,490
They used to tie into strings and dangling
from a fire and that's how they dried

2166
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:20,930
them out.
That's how the preserved them.

2167
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:26,440
It's like everything about it has to do
with Shamans and everything about it has

2168
02:04:26,991 --> 02:04:31,220
a connection to this mushroom. And
that mushroom was like synonymous. The,

2169
02:04:31,221 --> 02:04:34,880
the Amanita miscarry and mushroom was
synonymous with reindeers because reindeer

2170
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:38,370
love those fucking thing.
Reindeer or Caribou live in Siberia.

2171
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,910
That's where they live up there.
And these motherfuckers,

2172
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,160
when you're in there like a showman's
hut and they're all like eating Amanita

2173
02:04:44,161 --> 02:04:47,460
Musk area mushrooms and having
these tribal ceremonies,

2174
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:52,170
they would go outside to pis and the
Caribou would literally knock them over to

2175
02:04:52,171 --> 02:04:56,670
get to their pis because they're pissed.
Had Avenue to miscarry a smell to it.

2176
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:01,210
Damn Hamilton Morrison did it on vice.
Of course he did.

2177
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:06,550
He's done everything on the show, right?
You puke a lot. Uh, this is the Amanita.

2178
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:08,650
Yeah, there's part one, two and three.

2179
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:12,290
Oh, he's done it on the frogs.
Well, there's another type of fraud.

2180
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:15,740
If he shows a scar does it, different
thing. There's another type of frog.

2181
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:19,130
We take the venom of the frog and you,
um,

2182
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:21,550
you cut yourself and you,
uh,

2183
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:25,310
take this toads venom and you put
it like directly into your skin.

2184
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:28,250
And somehow or another by doing that,
by doing it,

2185
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:31,160
I think they burned themselves like
they burned themselves to like with ash,

2186
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:35,690
like a an ember and then they put the
frog like so it opens up the pores and

2187
02:05:35,691 --> 02:05:38,600
they put the frogs venom right into
them and they have this transcendent,

2188
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:42,590
transcendent, transcendent
experience. Is that Hamilton Morris?

2189
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:46,780
My stomach is in excruciating pain.
He's such a freak in me.

2190
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:50,490
I love this guy's got a frog. Yeah, yeah.

2191
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:53,840
See they burn you and then
they stick this shitting on you

2192
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:59,390
and your trip, your balls off.
Go meet with the spirit world.

2193
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:03,800
But you know there's people throughout
history have come up with a bunch of

2194
02:06:03,801 --> 02:06:07,760
different methods to
transcend normal reality,

2195
02:06:07,761 --> 02:06:10,520
normal consciousness,
and in different parts of the world.

2196
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:14,150
When they were stuck in some
area that didn't have mushrooms,

2197
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:18,650
they figured out what Datura does. They
figured out what, you know, what is this?

2198
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:21,920
What does this cactus do if you light it
on fire, you know, what does this Bush,

2199
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:24,710
what's in this Bush? People have
been finding that stuff forever.

2200
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:29,090
These scholars in Jerusalem think that
that was what Moses was seeing when he

2201
02:06:29,091 --> 02:06:31,340
went to the burning Bush. He saw
the burning Bush. That was God.

2202
02:06:31,341 --> 02:06:32,600
He gave him the 10 Commandments.

2203
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:35,460
They believe that was DMT
because the bush has done,

2204
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:40,100
they have like the Acacia Bush, very
rich and DMT. It's all over that area.

2205
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:45,320
Bush burning DMT, light, DMT on fire
get high. It's like it's so obvious.

2206
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:46,201
He's expense.

2207
02:06:46,201 --> 02:06:51,201
I had with mushrooms is back in 2008 I
did five grams specifically five grams

2208
02:06:51,391 --> 02:06:55,140
weighted, put it in a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich and went to the zoo

2209
02:06:57,030 --> 02:07:02,010
and that was a bad choice. Decision fucked
up. It was a bad decision. I thought,

2210
02:07:02,011 --> 02:07:05,400
hey, we be with the animals and
to be all about love. We get that.

2211
02:07:05,401 --> 02:07:10,401
I went with the check and why we were
checking out the gorillas is when it hit

2212
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:14,670
and all we wanted to do is just sit in
the shade and not look at the animals,

2213
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:18,480
close her eyes and the visuals you get
are just amazing. When people say, oh,

2214
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:22,710
that's in your head, you made that up
mine. There's no way. If I made that up,

2215
02:07:22,711 --> 02:07:25,440
it would be fragmented and all fucked up.
There's no way.

2216
02:07:25,441 --> 02:07:28,410
As soon as I closed my eyes,
there's a show waiting for me and it's,

2217
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:33,720
in my opinion, there's no way I'm, I'm
doing this. If it was, if I was running,

2218
02:07:33,721 --> 02:07:36,100
the show would not look like that.
I have the ability,

2219
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,810
but well,
that's the actual,

2220
02:07:37,870 --> 02:07:41,050
what they believe is that
what you're doing is you're,

2221
02:07:41,051 --> 02:07:46,051
you're hijacking your visual cortex
and so that these chemicals impact your

2222
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:51,751
visual cortex and create this incredible
display because your body does not know

2223
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:57,010
how to process what's coming in. That's
the idea behind it. It does. It does it.

2224
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,060
What I've always said is it doesn't
matter because whether you're creating it,

2225
02:08:01,061 --> 02:08:03,760
whether it's real or not real,
it's still the same experience.

2226
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:08,200
Whether it's real or not real, whether
it is real, when it breaks down to it,

2227
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,490
you're actually seeing that.

2228
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,160
So whether or not that's your
imagination is creating it,

2229
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:15,900
that's how people like to dismiss things.
Oh, it's just in your imagination. No,

2230
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:19,600
it's not. And it doesn't matter. Even if
it is because it's still the same thing.

2231
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:22,390
It's still this insane, crazy
thing that you're looking at. Yeah.

2232
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:24,550
So even if it is your imagination,

2233
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:27,430
it's still the wildest fucking thing
you're ever going to see in your life.

2234
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:31,030
So hard to explain. The, the only
way I can explain it is like,

2235
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:35,800
it's like those visualizers on
your iTunes times a thousand. Yeah,

2236
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:39,310
it's perfect. It's not broken
up to me, in my opinion.

2237
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:42,190
Something else is creating it.
I don't know what it is,

2238
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:46,390
but there's something is creating that
cause there's no way I can create this

2239
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:51,391
amazing art and it's perfect and perfectly
symmetric and it's like snakes of

2240
02:08:52,961 --> 02:08:53,830
just crazy.

2241
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:58,180
So after like five minutes of
just sitting there at the zoo,

2242
02:08:58,181 --> 02:09:02,290
we thought we had like a fear and loathing
in Las Vegas moment where we just had

2243
02:09:02,291 --> 02:09:03,220
to get out.
And I just,

2244
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:08,221
we ran to the parking lot and it's at
the La Zoo and we're looking at the

2245
02:09:08,351 --> 02:09:10,420
mountains. I'm like, Oh, you're looking
at the mountain. Look at the mountain.

2246
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:15,690
I instantly understood what all
the Aztec art was all about.

2247
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:18,400
Like that's what they're seeing.
And I go,

2248
02:09:18,401 --> 02:09:21,950
you look at them at the mountains were
dancing. The guy who, who gave it to me,

2249
02:09:21,951 --> 02:09:23,620
he goes, dude, the clouds
are going to dance for you.

2250
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:26,290
I thought that was a metaphor.
I didn't know he actually meant that.

2251
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:29,290
And anytime you focus on something for
one second, you look at the clouds,

2252
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:32,650
they start dancing for you all
perfectly. It's like, well, it's, Ooh,

2253
02:09:32,651 --> 02:09:36,430
it's a weird feeling because it feels
like something's there all the time.

2254
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:40,510
You just can't see it. That's
what it feels like. Whenever
I've been on mushrooms,

2255
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,640
like when I was talking about the,
um,

2256
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:46,210
the one where Doug and I took the Amanita
miscarry and then the psilocybin. Yeah,

2257
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:49,570
the feeling I got and it didn't last very
long because there was so many things

2258
02:09:49,571 --> 02:09:52,000
going through our head and it
was the day of the Iraq war,

2259
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:54,550
the day the war started.
So it was a pretty freaky moment.

2260
02:09:55,090 --> 02:09:58,920
But I saw this honeycomb pattern in
front of me, like where everything I saw,

2261
02:09:58,930 --> 02:10:02,350
like the pattern of the universe.
And it like occurred to me like, oh,

2262
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:03,790
this is here all the time.

2263
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:07,450
I just don't see it and that's what it
feels like when you see those things

2264
02:10:07,451 --> 02:10:11,700
dancing. Absolutely. It was
incredible. It was so hard at,

2265
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:14,230
that was the craziest drive home.
It was exact.

2266
02:10:14,231 --> 02:10:16,750
When I first time I saw fear and
loathing in Las Vegas, I thought, man,

2267
02:10:16,751 --> 02:10:18,610
this is so unrealistic.
It doesn't,

2268
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:20,740
you don't see shit like
that when you get high.

2269
02:10:20,741 --> 02:10:22,180
I've been high planning
at times you don't,

2270
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:26,050
but I understood it because the
drive home, I didn't know it was,

2271
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:28,480
I should've been dead.
There's no way I should have made it home.

2272
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:31,030
I didn't know if that was cars next to me,
that we're right here.

2273
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:34,430
The it felt I was driving

2274
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:38,330
through a jungle. It was cranberry.
You. You called me. He said, dude,

2275
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:43,010
the road turned into flower pedals.
Yes. Like I was being guided by,

2276
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:47,510
I was in a jungle and there was flowers
and and Green Moss and I'm driving

2277
02:10:47,511 --> 02:10:50,090
through it and I could see
the cars like in the distance,

2278
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:53,570
but just in my little cube, my
little circle, I was in the,

2279
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:57,770
in the forest when I should've been dead.

2280
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:01,790
I don't recommend that. If you're
going to experiment with psychedelics,

2281
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:05,270
I'll stay home, I'll stay
home. Cause what does it show?

2282
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:09,560
The Fun and the great part of it is being
in a dark room and closing your eyes

2283
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:12,030
and checking out the light
show in your head. That's the,

2284
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:14,630
it's not like you pass out or anything.
Like if you smoked DMT,

2285
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:17,210
you pass out and it's kind of
like you're in a dream state.

2286
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:20,630
But with mushrooms you're completely
conscious. You could talking,

2287
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:22,250
but as soon as you close your eyes,

2288
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:27,310
it isn't like it takes a 10 1520 seconds
to dissolve into this show that the

2289
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,370
instant you close your eyes,
it's right there waiting for you.

2290
02:11:31,371 --> 02:11:34,360
It's like right in front
of your eyes and it's deep,

2291
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:39,370
five dimensional and it's perfect. There's
nothing breaking off. It's just it.

2292
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:42,000
To me,
there were some intelligence behind it.

2293
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:44,740
Well it certainly feels like
there's some intelligence behind it,

2294
02:11:44,741 --> 02:11:45,880
but the thing that's always struck me,

2295
02:11:45,881 --> 02:11:50,170
as weird as it always feels
like it's there all the
time. Like whenever I do DMT.

2296
02:11:50,171 --> 02:11:52,660
One of the weirdest things that
happens is this feeling like, oh,

2297
02:11:52,661 --> 02:11:56,350
I've been here before. Even before ever
did it. The first time I ever did it,

2298
02:11:57,010 --> 02:12:00,730
I was like, I've been here before. I
know this place. Like I know this place.

2299
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:04,860
You know it's, I don't know why with
the mushrooms. Awesome. All those.

2300
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:07,990
It seems like all those who listened, they
did. Like I said, I've done this before.

2301
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:13,120
Well, one of the reasons mo most likely
is that mushrooms and DMT on these,

2302
02:12:13,121 --> 02:12:17,070
all these things like mimic
human neurochemistry. So w the,

2303
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:20,200
the real wonder is what's happening
to you while you're sleeping?

2304
02:12:20,410 --> 02:12:22,930
What's happening to you for that
six to eight hours, whatever it is,

2305
02:12:22,931 --> 02:12:24,850
where you're out cold,
they don't really know.

2306
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:29,980
But they do know that the human
mind mimics the reactions to, to,

2307
02:12:29,981 --> 02:12:33,490
to a diamond field trip. To me, not only
does it produce diamond field trip to me,

2308
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:38,290
but it produces similar reactions like
dreams. When you're done with a dream,

2309
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:42,160
it's hard to remember it. You
know? You know how that is.
Yeah. You know, it's weird,

2310
02:12:42,161 --> 02:12:46,570
man. It's like the dream is so amazing.
I, I've said to myself too, like, oh,

2311
02:12:46,571 --> 02:12:48,820
I don't have to write this down cause
I'm gonna remember it cause I'm a lazy

2312
02:12:48,821 --> 02:12:50,870
bitch. I don't want to get up and
write something down. I'm like,

2313
02:12:51,090 --> 02:12:53,170
I'm not going to forget this.
And then I wake up in the morning like,

2314
02:12:53,171 --> 02:12:55,690
what the fuck was it? I don't
remember it at all. Forget. Yeah,

2315
02:12:55,990 --> 02:13:00,610
DMT is the same way you do DMT and
the dream, just whatever it was,

2316
02:13:00,611 --> 02:13:03,850
whatever the experience was
disappears like in the morning,

2317
02:13:03,851 --> 02:13:06,820
you can't remember it or when it's over
or rather you can't remember it. Well,

2318
02:13:06,821 --> 02:13:10,000
how about when you're dreaming, you
don't remember reality. Exactly right.

2319
02:13:10,001 --> 02:13:10,834
It's true.

2320
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:15,790
You don't remember it so much that your
uncle could be David Cassidy is fine

2321
02:13:15,791 --> 02:13:19,720
with it. Yeah, man do. I could
totally cool with it. You're
not going. Wait a minute.

2322
02:13:19,721 --> 02:13:24,640
How the fuck is he? My uncle?
He's my uncle. The Partridge
family. Wait a minute.

2323
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:27,820
We had a dream like David Cassidy.
Yeah,

2324
02:13:27,821 --> 02:13:31,560
like random people would show up in
my dream and you accept you don't,

2325
02:13:31,590 --> 02:13:32,460
you don't remember.

2326
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:36,210
You remember this dimension as much as
you remember your dream state when you're

2327
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:39,600
in this dimension. So it's like, man,
what, what is it really? And when you,

2328
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:43,500
when you think about like
that were all empty space,

2329
02:13:43,501 --> 02:13:45,930
you know that quantum
theory where you know,

2330
02:13:45,931 --> 02:13:50,550
at the subatomic levels we're
99.99, nine, 9% empty like this,

2331
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:55,140
this is empty your, this, your
body's empty to how is that possible?

2332
02:13:55,141 --> 02:13:58,020
It's solid.
How is it possible that this is empty?

2333
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:00,960
When you look at it at the subatomic
level, how is that possible?

2334
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:05,790
It's so hard to wrap your brain around.
Well, we had that unmet go swami guy.

2335
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:10,250
Yeah, I heard that. Great. Great podcast.
Did you understand a word he was saying?

2336
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:13,540
Some of it,
some of it I faked it through.

2337
02:14:13,541 --> 02:14:18,330
So I wonder if it has like the reason this
is solid. I wonder, you know, cause uh,

2338
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:21,270
electro magnetic energy is running
through everything, right? So that's,

2339
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:24,390
it seems like it's must
be powering everything.

2340
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:25,940
Like where do we get our electricity?

2341
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:30,640
We're plugged into the universe
house and according to science, uh,

2342
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:34,170
were just flooded with electromagnetic
energy and it's just running through

2343
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:34,650
everything.

2344
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:38,190
So it seems like that's how we might be
plugged in and that's what's giving us

2345
02:14:38,191 --> 02:14:42,110
the power because it's not our
muscles that are, are doing anything.

2346
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:45,210
It's the electric pulses
that are doing it.

2347
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:48,060
That's where you're getting your strength
from and that's what's running your

2348
02:14:48,061 --> 02:14:51,780
heart. You know, your heart isn't just
beating there. It's connected to this,

2349
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:54,810
this ocean of electromagnetic
energy that we're in.

2350
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:59,930
So for electoral magnetic energy
magnets might have something to do it.

2351
02:15:01,071 --> 02:15:03,600
So I'm thinking, you know, when you,
you try to put a magnet together,

2352
02:15:03,601 --> 02:15:05,220
there's like nothing there,
but it's solid.

2353
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:09,750
Like maybe the subatomic
particles that were created, it's,

2354
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:12,490
maybe it's solid because it's
really just a magnet in a,

2355
02:15:12,491 --> 02:15:16,350
in its own little unique form. Like
it's really not there. It's not,

2356
02:15:16,351 --> 02:15:20,580
but the way it's the, the photons or
whatever, I'm just making shit up.

2357
02:15:20,710 --> 02:15:24,860
I'll put together the way they're put
together. It's a certain form of magnet.

2358
02:15:24,861 --> 02:15:28,200
Like this is this kind of magnet. It's
the skin magnet, but it's really not.

2359
02:15:28,201 --> 02:15:31,320
They're just like, when you try to put
it on back fucking talking about, well,

2360
02:15:31,321 --> 02:15:34,380
we're all empty space.
I'm trying to get the magnet thing.

2361
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,150
When you tried to put
two magnets together,

2362
02:15:36,151 --> 02:15:39,630
you can't because it's like you don't
see anything there, but you just can't,

2363
02:15:39,631 --> 02:15:43,200
it just something solid, Ken, if you
flip it. But you know what I'm saying?

2364
02:15:43,201 --> 02:15:47,010
That there's nothing there
yet. It's solid. Like they're
saying something's there.

2365
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:48,090
Maybe,

2366
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:52,230
maybe since we're all a running through
electromagnetic energy now this is just

2367
02:15:52,231 --> 02:15:53,340
my crazy stone theory.

2368
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:57,180
Maybe it has some because people are
baffled or the top scientists don't even

2369
02:15:57,181 --> 02:16:00,180
know what the fuck. Like how was this
empty space? How was this empty space?

2370
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:05,030
When it's solid to us, maybe it
has something to do with, uh,

2371
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:09,930
like particles being magnetized.
Who knows?

2372
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:12,570
You know,
the points are just theories.

2373
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:15,720
The point is there's this matter
in a book anywhere. The reality,

2374
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:17,280
the reality of quantum mechanics,

2375
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:20,830
this is what we absolutely know is that
particles can be in a state of super

2376
02:16:20,831 --> 02:16:23,820
position, which means that they're moving
and they're still at the same time.

2377
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:25,860
Yeah. They blink in and
out of existence. They,

2378
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:30,070
we have no Orleans of times
per second and particles from,

2379
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,330
you know,
here could,

2380
02:16:31,331 --> 02:16:34,500
they could be on the other side of the
planet and they react instantaneously if

2381
02:16:34,501 --> 02:16:36,610
faster than the speed of light.
They split out of that.

2382
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:40,500
They'd done experiments without
split up a photon, whatever they,

2383
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:42,700
and they separated by
14 miles or whatever.

2384
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:46,690
One experiment was 14 miles there in
different labs and whatever they did to

2385
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:50,890
this, half of the Photon, the other
half reacted in the exact same way.

2386
02:16:50,891 --> 02:16:54,800
So that's the lag with no lag at
all. They don't understand it. Yeah.

2387
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:58,970
So just that alone is like,
that's science fiction.

2388
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:03,220
Those are all the blink in
and out of existence. Yeah.
Like Shit, how does it work?

2389
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,330
I think there's something way more to
this world than we're ever going to be

2390
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:11,620
able to wrap our heads around with
what are our crude minds and bodies can

2391
02:17:11,621 --> 02:17:13,840
perceive of the reality that we exist in.
Yeah.

2392
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:17,530
I think we have this idea that the
reality of the we exist in the measurable

2393
02:17:17,531 --> 02:17:19,460
reality we exist in is all there is.
Yeah,

2394
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:23,680
but I think there's probably a whole
soup of possibilities that we're swimming

2395
02:17:23,681 --> 02:17:26,890
in. We don't know. We're not, we're not
interacting with it. We don't have the,

2396
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:31,750
but we also know it exists. Like
that's Karma. You know that's love.

2397
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:36,340
That's like the one that's momentum and
you start having good things go your way.

2398
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:41,080
Good things tend to stay going your way
and it all sorts of feed into other good

2399
02:17:41,081 --> 02:17:41,800
things.

2400
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:46,800
There seems to be like a way the universe
would like you to to react and behave

2401
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:50,830
and it rewards you with
like a positive experience.

2402
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:54,310
It rewards you with love and if you pay
attention to people that are living like

2403
02:17:54,311 --> 02:17:59,290
a fucking disaster of a life, the universe
is not rewarding them at every turn.

2404
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:02,380
It's fucking them up, their cars
breaking down to getting arrested.

2405
02:18:02,530 --> 02:18:04,930
They're girl hits him in the head with
a fucking frying pan when of sleeping.

2406
02:18:04,931 --> 02:18:09,130
It's like a constant stream of shit keeps
coming their way until eventually they

2407
02:18:09,131 --> 02:18:11,080
either die or get locked up.

2408
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:14,660
And it's like the universe is
setting that up as well. It's like,

2409
02:18:14,670 --> 02:18:18,730
it's like forwarding or not rewarding
the correct behavior or the incorrect

2410
02:18:18,731 --> 02:18:21,430
behavior. Life is so
perfect, so beautiful.

2411
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:25,360
And so it's just incredible.
I mean,

2412
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:30,450
as humans we have the intelligence to
make satellites and rockets and airplanes,

2413
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:33,910
but we can't even make a flee.
We can't make a fleet.

2414
02:18:33,911 --> 02:18:35,500
We have no idea how that shit works.

2415
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:38,090
Making an athlete that can
fucking check another fleet.

2416
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:41,500
How can we can't make a tree?
Yeah, we can make a tree.

2417
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:43,180
We think we've got to figure it out.

2418
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:46,720
We think there is no higher
intelligence out there.

2419
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:51,400
Some kind of something come on. It
might even just be law, you know,

2420
02:18:51,401 --> 02:18:55,270
it might just be a law of the universe
or um, you know, instead of a law,

2421
02:18:55,271 --> 02:18:57,190
like an equation,
like you know,

2422
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:01,300
positive and love and this and that
and moves towards this direction,

2423
02:19:01,301 --> 02:19:05,260
negative and horrible and evil
moves towards that direction.

2424
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:08,980
And it's almost like the two need each
other to do battle back and forth and to

2425
02:19:08,981 --> 02:19:13,980
empower to empower the other.
Absolutely. Esther Hicks says, you know,

2426
02:19:13,981 --> 02:19:18,040
it makes sense like you were here.
Who knows if this is true.

2427
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:22,390
This is just something that someone said
that it's seems pretty awesome to me

2428
02:19:22,391 --> 02:19:24,880
that it seems that we're here,
we're existing,

2429
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:28,040
we're supposed to feel the
pain because if we don't feel

2430
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,461
the pain,

2431
02:19:28,461 --> 02:19:32,210
we're not going to appreciate the good
stuff and it's not going to feel as good.

2432
02:19:32,211 --> 02:19:36,080
Like she uses an example of your best
meal is always eaten when you and your

2433
02:19:36,081 --> 02:19:40,220
hungriest and that totally makes sense.
Like if you're never hungry,

2434
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:43,730
you won't really give a fuck about food.
If you're born a billionaire,

2435
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:46,350
you don't care about money,
you don't care about what it can buy.

2436
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:48,950
And so it's almost like we need,

2437
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:53,480
we need the pain where it's almost
like we're here for the pain. Well,

2438
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:55,360
there's certainly like reward systems

2439
02:19:55,410 --> 02:19:59,460
built in and it seems like if you look at
it like all the animals on this planet,

2440
02:19:59,461 --> 02:20:03,690
at least there is a struggle that's
going on constantly. Nobody lives easy.

2441
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:06,420
Everybody's struggling.
You're struggling to find food,

2442
02:20:06,421 --> 02:20:09,210
just struggling to keep off
predators is struggling to keep your,

2443
02:20:09,211 --> 02:20:13,200
your young alive.
And it seems like it's set up that way.

2444
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:16,140
And it seems like it could
be way easier if, uh,

2445
02:20:16,210 --> 02:20:18,750
there was like total harmony
in the animal world. Well,

2446
02:20:18,751 --> 02:20:20,490
isn't it like life and success,

2447
02:20:20,491 --> 02:20:24,390
like what they're looking for when they
all just be fucking eating plants, when,

2448
02:20:24,391 --> 02:20:27,220
that'd be like the best way
to go about it. But no, it's,

2449
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:29,370
it seems like the struggle is built in to

2450
02:20:29,570 --> 02:20:31,540
the whole code of life.
Yeah.

2451
02:20:31,560 --> 02:20:34,360
When there's a battle to try to
figure out how to do it right. Well,

2452
02:20:34,361 --> 02:20:36,950
we want the struggle and
a lot of things in movies.

2453
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:38,510
We don't want to go to
a movie where nothing,

2454
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:41,630
there's no conflict or nothing
bad happens. That would
be the worst movie ever.

2455
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:47,450
The greatest movies are the ones that take
you down to the depths and you buy it.

2456
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:51,030
You are and you've,
you suspend your disbelief in,

2457
02:20:51,031 --> 02:20:54,350
you're down there and then you come up
with it and the stories believable and

2458
02:20:54,351 --> 02:20:57,800
you lose yourself in the movie, but
without the conflict, the movie sucks.

2459
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:02,760
Do you worry about that with your kid
like in a certain way? I do with my kids,

2460
02:21:02,761 --> 02:21:05,490
it's like I don't want my kids
to experience a lot of adversity.

2461
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:07,680
Just you want to protect your children.
Yeah,

2462
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:11,880
but I know that all the people that I
know that experience adversity or the most

2463
02:21:11,881 --> 02:21:15,450
interesting people, you know,
all the people that we know,

2464
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:17,940
think about all the people that who
know look thinkers like Joey Diaz.

2465
02:21:17,941 --> 02:21:19,500
He's one of the most interesting
guys at right because this,

2466
02:21:19,501 --> 02:21:23,640
his life was completely crazy.
Like his life was full,

2467
02:21:23,641 --> 02:21:27,180
total chaos. Like the adversity you
had to go through the adversity.

2468
02:21:27,181 --> 02:21:28,710
I had to go through the adversity.

2469
02:21:28,711 --> 02:21:31,470
Cowen had to go like all the people
that we know that are interesting.

2470
02:21:31,650 --> 02:21:35,730
They all had kind of a fucked up life.
Yeah.

2471
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:36,773
What's that about?

2472
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:42,660
Do you think that you could get away with
just exposing your kid to a difficult

2473
02:21:42,661 --> 02:21:44,630
things like Jujitsu,
like uh,

2474
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:48,720
exposing them to martial arts and maybe
they could develop their character that

2475
02:21:48,721 --> 02:21:51,530
way without having to go through the,
the horrible

2476
02:21:52,230 --> 02:21:55,200
ups and downs of,
I don't know if Jujitsu

2477
02:21:56,790 --> 02:22:01,650
promotes or guarantees a great sense
of humor and the ability to make other

2478
02:22:01,651 --> 02:22:02,251
people laugh.

2479
02:22:02,251 --> 02:22:06,240
But the one thing in my experience that
I know that Jujitsu does for children,

2480
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:10,320
absolutely, and it's, it's
has a lot to do with you.

2481
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:15,450
W you always talk about it when a kid
doesn't have martial arts and Jujitsu

2482
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:20,700
specifically because of the
tapping and getting capped out,

2483
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:25,140
what that shows you that automatically
in Jujitsu, you know where you stand.

2484
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:27,780
You know where you stand,
you know that you're a blue belt,

2485
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:31,740
you're probably not going to be purple
belts that much, but when you do,

2486
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:34,920
you'll get your purple belt and you're
probably not going to beat brown belts

2487
02:22:34,921 --> 02:22:37,170
and black belts that much in the
beginning. But when you start doing it,

2488
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:39,540
then you get your brown belt
and so on and your black belt.

2489
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:44,160
So when a kid comes into Jujitsu,
he's four years old, five years old,

2490
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:48,180
he knows that he's not going to,
it rarely gonna beat the seven year olds.

2491
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:49,950
And when he's seven he's rarely
going to be at the 10 year olds.

2492
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:54,540
So that teachers, if they don't go
through that, there is a possibility.

2493
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,970
Not always. There's plenty of great
kids that have never done Jujitsu,

2494
02:22:57,990 --> 02:22:59,490
but what I've seen with Jujitsu kids,

2495
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:04,730
it almost guarantees that they won't be
delusional and become a douchebag kid.

2496
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:09,510
Because if you don't,
if you're not checked that way with a tap,

2497
02:23:09,511 --> 02:23:12,720
like reminding you that
this guy is 15 years old,

2498
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:14,460
you better respect that 15 year old.

2499
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:18,240
And then what ends up happening
is when you become 15 you,

2500
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:22,620
you know what it was like going through
the early stages of Jujitsu. So you,

2501
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:26,400
I see kids that are 10 and 11 are great
with the five year olds and great with a

2502
02:23:26,401 --> 02:23:27,234
six year olds.

2503
02:23:27,330 --> 02:23:31,110
It takes you out of that delusionary
state and let you know that you better

2504
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:35,460
respect your elders and as you get older
you better respect the kids too because

2505
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:38,910
they're going to get older too. So what
you did to really does is people put,

2506
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:42,210
it instills discipline in you.
Like A,

2507
02:23:42,211 --> 02:23:45,570
most people think martial arts does
like karate and taekwondo and that

2508
02:23:45,571 --> 02:23:48,870
definitely works too because
it does promote discipline.

2509
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:53,280
But Jujitsu does it I think
better because of the tapping.

2510
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:56,250
Most kids that I know
that are good at Jujitsu,

2511
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:00,180
they have a tremendous
relationship with their father.

2512
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:05,220
It brings them tighter traveling all
over the world like I do to all these

2513
02:24:05,221 --> 02:24:06,790
seminars. Um, oh,

2514
02:24:07,350 --> 02:24:10,920
I don't know how many times I've met
kids is Jujitsu phenoms that are eight,

2515
02:24:10,921 --> 02:24:11,580
nine years old.

2516
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:16,380
And their dads bring them to Jujitsu
and they're best friends Avery down in,

2517
02:24:16,381 --> 02:24:21,180
um, uh, and uh, uh, he used to be
a Springfield. Now he's an Oma,

2518
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:24,060
he's 16 now. Him and his dad
are best friends. And when I'm,

2519
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:28,320
when I run into them like,
man, give me advice. You know,

2520
02:24:28,321 --> 02:24:31,940
what else did you do? Cause there it just,
you see it over and over again. So, um,

2521
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:35,850
for those of you with kids out there
and maybe you're having trouble with the

2522
02:24:35,851 --> 02:24:38,820
kids, try to talk them into Jujitsu,
you know, it, it might be hard,

2523
02:24:38,821 --> 02:24:43,500
but I think that if you're having trouble
with your kids or you want to insure a

2524
02:24:43,501 --> 02:24:47,400
beautiful relationship, tight
relationship, a trusting
relationship and you know,

2525
02:24:47,401 --> 02:24:48,480
relationship where the kid,

2526
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:51,900
your kid wants to hang out with
his popping and you did you just,

2527
02:24:51,901 --> 02:24:52,920
until you do it with your kid,

2528
02:24:53,220 --> 02:24:56,640
that that's just a little something that
I've learned. That's a little insight.

2529
02:24:56,641 --> 02:25:00,120
You can take that for what it is.
I, I, I'm just, I'm just trying to,

2530
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:02,950
if anything the kid can
do that's difficult.

2531
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:04,690
It's good for their
personality development.

2532
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:07,420
One of the real problems with kids
today's cause everything's handed to you.

2533
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:10,090
You don't develop character because
you don't ever face adversity.

2534
02:25:10,091 --> 02:25:11,710
Your food comes from a supermarket.

2535
02:25:11,711 --> 02:25:16,030
You can go to a store and get whatever
you fucking need. You know, it's not hard.

2536
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:19,900
It's, it's, it's easy to live life.
And so when, when you're not tested,

2537
02:25:19,930 --> 02:25:21,280
especially as a young person,

2538
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:25,180
like a lot of bullying comes
from and people say like,

2539
02:25:25,181 --> 02:25:26,440
what's the best way to stop bullying?

2540
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:29,380
I always say the best way to stop
bullying is teach kids how to fight.

2541
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:32,170
If you had like mandatory Jujitsu classes,

2542
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:34,540
if you had mandatory martial
arts classes in school,

2543
02:25:34,541 --> 02:25:37,870
you would have a whole lot less
bullying because first of all,

2544
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:41,140
that they wouldn't be inclined to do
it. And second of all, it wouldn't work.

2545
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:45,910
Like if a guy is talented and skilled and
he's 155 pounds and there's an asshole

2546
02:25:45,911 --> 02:25:48,940
that's 180 pounds, it's fucking
with them. He's not gonna back down.

2547
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:50,410
They're going to figure
out a way around it.

2548
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,660
The kid's going to be able to figure
out a way like, listen, you know,

2549
02:25:52,661 --> 02:25:55,300
if you want to fucking fight,
you want to be an asshole and pick on me.

2550
02:25:55,301 --> 02:25:57,550
I have to fucking defend myself.
Then I'll defend myself.

2551
02:25:57,670 --> 02:26:00,370
But it's not like is going to be
terrified, not know what the fuck to do.

2552
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:02,350
It's going to be a completely
different scenario.

2553
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:05,310
And I think that one of the reasons
why people do it in the first place is

2554
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:09,130
they're trying to, they're trying to
prove that they aren't scared themselves.

2555
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:11,740
The reason why people are bullies where
they have that instinct is they're

2556
02:26:11,741 --> 02:26:15,070
insecure. They're trying to
be dominant without, you know,

2557
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:18,430
without putting in the work. But if
you put in the work, if you do Jujitsu,

2558
02:26:18,431 --> 02:26:21,340
if you were in a martial law,
he actually develops and proficiency.

2559
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:24,550
You don't have that need. You don't
have that need to dominate people.

2560
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:26,860
You don't have to know. You get it all
out, you get it all out in the gym.

2561
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:29,040
All my boys were wrestling
the wrestling team.

2562
02:26:30,210 --> 02:26:33,210
So that kind of like know
wrestling's different dressings,

2563
02:26:33,211 --> 02:26:34,740
a sport and probably
they're just sick or you

2564
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:42,710
know, where you're, I mean,
did you have bullies growing
up? Not really. I mean, uh,

2565
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:46,040
I was bullied before I started doing
martial arts, but from like 14 on,

2566
02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:49,620
not really cause I was like thinking
about like all my bullies were all guys in

2567
02:26:49,621 --> 02:26:54,600
sports, like football team wrestling the
time I wrestlers. Yeah, with bullies.

2568
02:26:54,601 --> 02:26:58,410
In what way? Like how were you bullied?
You know, like just pushed her out on the,

2569
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:02,970
the playground and stuff like that.
And like what year are you talking about?

2570
02:27:02,971 --> 02:27:06,840
Middle School. Elementary and middle
school used to trip you a trip.

2571
02:27:06,841 --> 02:27:11,580
You like when you're
walking ticked with, yeah,

2572
02:27:11,581 --> 02:27:13,950
I was fucked with a lot. But then
like in high school and it went away.

2573
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,440
It's a douchebag move,
man.

2574
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:18,760
Be a bully. It's one of the worst
things a person can do. Yeah, it's a,

2575
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:22,000
it's a weird, natural human
weakness. So weakness,

2576
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:24,670
instinct to like fuck up.
Picky.

2577
02:27:25,650 --> 02:27:29,290
Yeah. My shit was mostly cause evo. My
parents were divorced and I was poor.

2578
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:32,060
I think it was that big.
Why they picked our meme.

2579
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:35,710
It's they pick on you because you were
poor. Yeah, cause I lived in Worthington,

2580
02:27:35,711 --> 02:27:38,140
which is a higher end place in Columbus,

2581
02:27:38,350 --> 02:27:42,640
but I was like living on that one part
that was all apartments. That was,

2582
02:27:42,641 --> 02:27:44,260
it shouldn't have been in there,
you know?

2583
02:27:44,261 --> 02:27:49,261
But somehow I was in Worthington so
they knew I was poor and my parents were

2584
02:27:49,931 --> 02:27:53,440
divorced back then. Back then divorce.
It wasn't as crazy as it is now.

2585
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:57,250
Where you know was unusual. Yeah,
a little bit more unusual. Yeah.

2586
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:59,620
Isn't that weird that
like when we're younger,

2587
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:03,180
people didn't bother getting divorced or
they didn't happen nearly as much? Not,

2588
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:05,770
not in my neighborhood.
Everybody got divorced.

2589
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:10,870
All my friends didn't have fathers.
All of them except one. Norio Galvin.

2590
02:28:10,930 --> 02:28:15,250
He's the only one out of maybe 15
friends that we had gone up. Everyone,

2591
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:19,030
every father left in a really
poor neighborhood was all Mexican.

2592
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:21,990
You grew up in Mexicans believing
they get drunk and go back to Mexico

2593
02:28:21,990 --> 02:28:24,380
and say, fuck that. Yeah.
Isn't that weird man?

2594
02:28:24,381 --> 02:28:27,430
When people that don't take take care
of their kids as a father now it doesn't

2595
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:31,000
have freak you out. Yeah
man, I can't imagine me out.

2596
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,250
My father had 19 kids from
eight different chicks,

2597
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:37,370
God 19 is he still alive?
I don't know.

2598
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:40,880
What kind of crazy hell does that guy
live in when he closes his eyes and one of

2599
02:28:40,881 --> 02:28:42,290
the last,
the last time I saw him,

2600
02:28:42,291 --> 02:28:47,291
I was 27 and he my my on my mom's side,

2601
02:28:48,831 --> 02:28:51,530
my mom's mother and father,
they stayed together to the very end.

2602
02:28:51,531 --> 02:28:53,930
They were married 50 plus
years and had 10 kids.

2603
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:59,560
And my dad told me first he told me that
at 14 I saw him at 14 then I saw him at

2604
02:29:00,501 --> 02:29:05,000
27 at 14 tries to shove advice down my
throat and he said, make sure your Mary,

2605
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:08,570
when you marry your wife,
she's at least 15 years younger than you.

2606
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:11,570
He told me that. I remember
that. And he also said he also,

2607
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:15,350
and my wife was 15 years younger than me.
It wasn't strategic,

2608
02:29:15,351 --> 02:29:16,400
but it just happened that way.

2609
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:21,650
And the other thing he told me at 14
was be nice to kids cause they grow up

2610
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:25,040
really fast and they'll turn into adults.

2611
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:29,390
So he was trying to give me the right
advice and then at 27 I haven't seen him

2612
02:29:29,391 --> 02:29:30,350
in forever.
I thought he was dead.

2613
02:29:30,351 --> 02:29:34,100
He shows up one day and am I at my
grandpa's house? He goes, do what?

2614
02:29:34,530 --> 02:29:38,060
He's old and he's like, do what your
grandfather did. That's the way.

2615
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:42,320
Have kids every Christmas and Thanksgiving
he has all his family and all his

2616
02:29:42,321 --> 02:29:45,920
grandkids. That's the way I had to
do it over. I would do it that way.

2617
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:46,911
That's what he said.
And he was,

2618
02:29:46,911 --> 02:29:49,700
I want to some player and just banging
everything and just getting everybody

2619
02:29:49,701 --> 02:29:54,650
pregnant. Wow. That's so
sad. That's a sad life man.

2620
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:59,330
Yeah. And I asked him, I go, what made
you want to come by this time? I was like,

2621
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:00,620
he hadn't been around and I just,

2622
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:04,340
I heard he showed up to my grandfather's
house and he had been friends with my

2623
02:30:04,341 --> 02:30:07,100
grandfather while he was messing with
my mom and him and my grandfather got

2624
02:30:07,101 --> 02:30:11,720
along and my aunt, Congress, your
dads get over here now. Your Dad's,

2625
02:30:11,910 --> 02:30:14,180
it's your grandma's. And
I'm an, I'm in Hollywood.

2626
02:30:14,181 --> 02:30:17,060
I'd drive down to Orange County and the
whole drive down. I'm like, I'm just,

2627
02:30:17,061 --> 02:30:18,140
I'm not going to give him a hard time.

2628
02:30:18,141 --> 02:30:21,710
I hadn't seen him in like 13 years and
I'm not gonna give him a hard time.

2629
02:30:21,711 --> 02:30:24,140
I'm just going to start over. I get,
I get another chance with my father.

2630
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:25,870
I was like dry.
It was a long drive,

2631
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:29,240
like an hour drive and show up at my
grandma's house and I'm happy you got a

2632
02:30:29,241 --> 02:30:31,250
smile. I'm like, damn,
I thought he was dead.

2633
02:30:31,251 --> 02:30:35,840
I'd have dreams of him dying and he's
is this really is right here. Shit,

2634
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:40,040
let's go out to eat. Like we went to
black Angus in Tustin. My mom went,

2635
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:44,450
we're all sitting there like, fuck
that. We get a second chance. Meanwhile,

2636
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:47,150
I'm all happy to see my
father and I rarely, you know,

2637
02:30:47,151 --> 02:30:50,870
my mom wants to see me more than
I actually drive down and see her.

2638
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,910
But now I want to start another
relationship with my father.

2639
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:55,520
So then I asked my father,
uh,

2640
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:59,060
and at this point I didn't know
about his 19 kids at this point,

2641
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:02,030
if I've got five kids from, uh, I
knew he was married, had five kids,

2642
02:31:02,031 --> 02:31:05,480
and he was seeing my mom and on the
side I knew that my mom was a side grow.

2643
02:31:05,481 --> 02:31:09,230
That's what I do at this point. And I
said, why did you come by this time?

2644
02:31:10,430 --> 02:31:13,850
I'm curious each. And I was expecting
them to say, it's been so long.

2645
02:31:13,851 --> 02:31:18,500
I wanted to see what happened. You
know, what's become a view? And he said,

2646
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:21,380
ah, just I was passing
through Orange County and,

2647
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:24,060
and I wanted to see if your
grandfather was still cool with me.

2648
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:27,810
I didn't know if he was mad
at me or anything and I just,

2649
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:30,960
I just kept a smile on and bright.
They're right there.

2650
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:34,950
I looked at my mom and I'm like,
fuck this dude. Fuck this guy. I'm a,

2651
02:31:35,130 --> 02:31:37,470
I'm going to spend time with my mom.
Fuck that dude.

2652
02:31:37,471 --> 02:31:39,580
And just kept a smile on it right there.
I made the decision.

2653
02:31:39,620 --> 02:31:44,310
I will never see this guy ever
again, and I never did, but less.

2654
02:31:44,311 --> 02:31:48,420
So during that dinner, he did say, Hey,
one of the two of his kids live in La,

2655
02:31:48,421 --> 02:31:50,850
the ones from that family, he goes,
they want to have dinner with you.

2656
02:31:50,850 --> 02:31:53,670
They want to meet you. So I did end up
meeting with them, never saw them again.

2657
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,380
They're the ones who told me.

2658
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:59,130
They sat me down at the old spaghetti
factory in Hollywood when I was 27 and

2659
02:31:59,131 --> 02:32:03,300
they go, do you have any idea how
many kids your father has? I said,

2660
02:32:03,330 --> 02:32:05,340
five plus me.

2661
02:32:07,230 --> 02:32:11,940
He has 19 kids. I still, how
did that happen? He goes,

2662
02:32:11,970 --> 02:32:15,030
he got, not only did,
did they know about it,

2663
02:32:15,031 --> 02:32:20,031
he told his family about every
kid and every girl he was seeing,

2664
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:24,120
he was trying to drive his
wife insane to get a divorce.

2665
02:32:24,121 --> 02:32:27,270
She wouldn't divorce him. She was hardcore
Catholic. So she wouldn't divorce.

2666
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:31,950
He wanted a divorce. He wanted,
uh, uh, to, to marry my mom.

2667
02:32:31,951 --> 02:32:35,280
That's what he says. But she wouldn't
give him a divorce. So he would tell her,

2668
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:38,280
they knew all about me. He goes, he
would come home and just say, oh,

2669
02:32:38,281 --> 02:32:41,760
Marty has pregnant now all muddy.
I had the baby, we named it Ed God.

2670
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:46,290
He would come home to his wife, to his
wife and kids and say, oh, Maria had,

2671
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:50,010
had just got pregnant. We just had
our kid, I'll be gone for the weekend.

2672
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:53,260
I'm gonna spend time with my son.
So I actually spent my mom,

2673
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:58,290
my dad had my mom in an apartment
promising that he would leave his,

2674
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:02,040
my mom thought he was going to leave
his, his wife, his wife for her, for her.

2675
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:06,510
She was in love and he never did, but he
had her in an apartment in downtown La.

2676
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:08,080
And then after like three years,
got,

2677
02:33:08,110 --> 02:33:10,530
apparently I lived with them for three
years. My mom just said, enough's enough.

2678
02:33:10,531 --> 02:33:13,230
She went back to Orange County,
back to her parents' house.

2679
02:33:13,231 --> 02:33:16,590
And that was the end of that weird thing,
isn't it?

2680
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:20,330
The idea that someone could just do that.
When you have kids now and you,

2681
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:23,190
you know, I know you, you
know, you get on a plane,

2682
02:33:23,191 --> 02:33:26,070
we were talking about you
leave your house. No, you're
going away for the weekend.

2683
02:33:26,071 --> 02:33:29,400
You miss them as soon as you get in
your car. Yeah, just start driving away.

2684
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:34,230
But this guy could just abandon this kid
and then see you and not even have like

2685
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:35,570
a connection with you and be like,
God,

2686
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:37,930
I just want to see if your
grandfather was mad at me. Yeah.

2687
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:39,810
And then when I talked to them,
when I had that,

2688
02:33:39,811 --> 02:33:42,930
when they told me about the 19 kids,
they, it started to make sense. I'm like,

2689
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:46,650
no wonder he didn't give a fuck about me.
Now I understand the kind of 19 kids.

2690
02:33:46,890 --> 02:33:49,320
How can you, he was, you know,
it was never a dick to me.

2691
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:53,910
When he would see me once a year, he
would cruise by. Did he hug you? Ah,

2692
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:57,670
maybe a little not, but I found out that
he never said I love you had a prior.

2693
02:33:57,690 --> 02:33:59,940
He never told any of his kids. I
love you. Never said I love you.

2694
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:04,860
So he had something really
wrong with them. So then it
all became clear like, oh,

2695
02:34:04,861 --> 02:34:06,960
this guy has no love in him.

2696
02:34:06,961 --> 02:34:10,170
That's why he just keeps having kids
with whoever and he doesn't really care.

2697
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:14,520
He was never a dick to me. He just didn't
really like care that much about me.

2698
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:18,040
It's Kinda weird because that's
sort of like if look at nature,

2699
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:22,270
if you look at the programming of
the human animal then that's like the

2700
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:25,540
programming. The programming is to
spread your seed as much as possible.

2701
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:28,240
The programming is to have
as many babies as you can.

2702
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:31,270
The program has not for the male
to take care of them though.

2703
02:34:31,450 --> 02:34:33,340
It's really strange.
You know,

2704
02:34:33,341 --> 02:34:37,720
the program is to keep going to keep
spreading that seed and that's one of the

2705
02:34:37,721 --> 02:34:40,040
reasons why they say that.
Um,

2706
02:34:40,090 --> 02:34:42,910
like the intensity of her attraction,

2707
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:46,660
like it goes away within a
few months of meeting someone,

2708
02:34:46,661 --> 02:34:48,280
like the intensity when
you first meet them.

2709
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:52,660
That intensity of attraction for a man
goes away with within the first five or

2710
02:34:52,661 --> 02:34:57,070
six months because usually by then the
woman's already pregnant in nature.

2711
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:00,490
You've been banging her, you know,
every day for several months.

2712
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:02,520
One of the days she's been operating,

2713
02:35:02,550 --> 02:35:07,050
you shot one in there and ensured this
intense bond. You know, initially too,

2714
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:10,360
to make sure that you continue to having
sex as much as possible to increase

2715
02:35:10,361 --> 02:35:12,040
your odds of getting them pregnant.

2716
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:15,400
And then all of a sudden this weird
thing kicks in where you want to

2717
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:19,930
go. Sometimes I kicked him and as soon
as you not post, not syndrome baby.

2718
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:22,750
Yeah, but it's, it's, it's a weird, yeah.

2719
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:26,880
Dang that,
that nature is literally set up that way.

2720
02:35:26,910 --> 02:35:30,840
And so in order to conform to what
society expects from a person,

2721
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:32,730
you have to fight against your genetics.

2722
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:37,080
You have to literally fight your instinct,
your instinct to fuck other girls,

2723
02:35:37,081 --> 02:35:39,570
their instinct to shoot loads into them.
I get them pregnant.

2724
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:43,590
Weird. Remember? Do you remember
that when we worked on the man show,

2725
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:46,560
that sketch I wrote
for pulseless syndrome.

2726
02:35:46,561 --> 02:35:49,770
It was a pill that you could
take that, uh, or you could,

2727
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:52,320
you could have sex with a girl
and not get posted on syndrome.

2728
02:35:52,321 --> 02:35:55,020
If you take it 30 minutes before Sachs.
I don't remember that.

2729
02:35:55,670 --> 02:35:59,620
And obviously it never, it never got green
lighted, but that just reminded me of,

2730
02:35:59,730 --> 02:36:02,480
because that was a pill, right.
That is a real thing with men now.

2731
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:05,280
Plus Syndrome is serious.
It's the feeling that you have.

2732
02:36:05,281 --> 02:36:07,620
Like right after you called me, like,
oh my God, I gotta get Outta here.

2733
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:12,480
I gotta get Outta here. And if you don't
have that, that's when you know, like,

2734
02:36:12,481 --> 02:36:14,490
Hey, I think he's calling
somebody and she's cool.

2735
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,680
I think I found a real
relationship. You're like, Hey,

2736
02:36:16,681 --> 02:36:19,710
let's go get something to eat. Or what
do you say? Don't leave. Let's watch TV.

2737
02:36:20,130 --> 02:36:22,770
What are you saying? What Spooner?
What are you saying? What after I come,

2738
02:36:22,771 --> 02:36:26,280
I just want to spirit and
snuggle with every chick. Yeah.

2739
02:36:26,281 --> 02:36:29,370
And then wake up and do it again.
More half retarded. It's different.

2740
02:36:29,730 --> 02:36:33,420
You know those girls, if you have sex
with and they're really dumb and you go,

2741
02:36:33,421 --> 02:36:34,720
oh my God,
why did I do this?

2742
02:36:34,721 --> 02:36:37,430
And you just want to jump down to when
he's as smart as them. So it's perfect.

2743
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:42,690
[inaudible] they match
perfectly. They talk about shoes.

2744
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:44,720
They sit there and talk about who's fat.

2745
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:48,240
Girls don't really get posted on syndrome
unless they're married or something

2746
02:36:48,241 --> 02:36:51,030
and you know, then they feel
guilty. But if they're not married,

2747
02:36:51,031 --> 02:36:53,550
if they have sex with you, they,
they, they fall more in love with you.

2748
02:36:53,650 --> 02:36:57,440
All that depression, that depends entirely
on what the experience was like. Yes,

2749
02:36:57,490 --> 02:37:00,900
you're right. More than guys get
posted on syndrome way more than girls.

2750
02:37:00,901 --> 02:37:04,620
It's also the guys that we know too. We
know a bunch of savages. If you compare,

2751
02:37:04,621 --> 02:37:08,520
like we went to an accountant's
meeting, you know, and said, hey,

2752
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:11,610
how you guys feel after you
come. But you know, people,

2753
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:15,890
some people managed her talking to him
about sex. It's a weird thing when dudes

2754
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:19,190
start talking like you and I have done
this before, we won't name any names,

2755
02:37:19,340 --> 02:37:23,390
but we've had sex conversations around
square dudes and you watch them panic

2756
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,670
like they absolutely panic.

2757
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:29,060
You know like they don't know what the
fuck does say like how often you fuck

2758
02:37:29,061 --> 02:37:29,960
your wife be serious.

2759
02:37:30,810 --> 02:37:33,680
Some guys a tell you like fuck
my wife like three times a week.

2760
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:36,470
No more than that. Like I don't want to
fuck her everyday but I fuck her a lot.

2761
02:37:36,890 --> 02:37:40,910
And some guys would just go,
what? They just, they just
cleaned him up twice a day.

2762
02:37:41,060 --> 02:37:42,560
I can't or they will
say I can't know what,

2763
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:44,540
it's just not something that I discuss.

2764
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,200
Like you don't discuss how often
you bang your wife with another man.

2765
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:51,830
Like why wouldn't you discuss that?
Do you not love your wife?

2766
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:54,380
If you love your wife, you have sex
with you. Why? So is that off the books?

2767
02:37:54,381 --> 02:37:56,420
You can't talk about it like what do you,
I'm not,

2768
02:37:56,421 --> 02:37:58,370
I'm not asking you like specific details.

2769
02:37:58,710 --> 02:38:03,030
You know, what's crazy about my
wife is before the kid, you know,

2770
02:38:03,390 --> 02:38:07,140
once you, once you going out with
a girl for a year or two years,

2771
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:10,530
you come home from Jujitsu.
My classes are kind of late.

2772
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:12,780
A lot of times I'm broken.

2773
02:38:12,781 --> 02:38:17,781
I just went to war for an hour with
guys from out of town trying to tap me.

2774
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:21,000
I come home,
I'm going to drink a protein shake,

2775
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:23,190
I'm going to get on the
Internet a little bit.

2776
02:38:23,191 --> 02:38:27,450
I'm just going to collapse and
die generally after Jujitsu. So,

2777
02:38:27,810 --> 02:38:31,370
um, you know, for a while there, you know,

2778
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:33,960
it's like I have sex tomorrow.

2779
02:38:33,970 --> 02:38:36,480
You just keep putting it off
and you don't have sex as much.

2780
02:38:36,930 --> 02:38:41,930
And then when you have a kid now you can
only have sex when that baby's asleep.

2781
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:46,260
Right.
So now I really can't have it that much.

2782
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:51,560
So I wanted way more than ever g cry
easy with the voice in the microphone one

2783
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:56,750
or to way more than no. Yeah.
Oh yeah. I like it. I liked it.

2784
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:59,250
The one thing I learned in my old age,
the one thing I learned,

2785
02:38:59,251 --> 02:39:01,230
because I've dated girls that didn't,

2786
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:05,100
some girls didn't want
sex as much as I did,

2787
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:09,420
and that would kind of Piss me off. I'm
23 and it's like, man, this is bullshit.

2788
02:39:09,421 --> 02:39:12,330
I should, I should get whatever I wanted
to. You're my girlfriend. Why are you, oh,

2789
02:39:12,331 --> 02:39:15,210
you're tired. Like it would, I would
get pissed off. And I'm like, man,

2790
02:39:15,390 --> 02:39:19,050
I want a girl that wants to fuck
anytime I want it. You know? So,

2791
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:22,820
but then you have girls, and I've
had most of the girls were, uh,

2792
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:26,700
wanted it more than I did. I was always
the tired one. And they always want it.

2793
02:39:26,701 --> 02:39:30,300
Morning. I get to the point where it's
kind of bothersome. I'm like, damn,

2794
02:39:30,301 --> 02:39:34,800
she wants it way too much. But now looking
back at all that and where I'm at now,

2795
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:36,720
yeah.
Looking back at that now,

2796
02:39:36,990 --> 02:39:41,990
I would rather want it all the time and
rarely get it then always get it and

2797
02:39:44,701 --> 02:39:46,380
rarely won it. That's the one. Yeah,

2798
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:49,520
that's definitely better. Yeah. As long
as you are still getting it. Yes. No.

2799
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:53,070
Do you see this state Chell son and
Vandelay Silva going to host tough Brazil,

2800
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:57,510
the ultimate fighter of reserve effect
Chels son and is going to go to fucking

2801
02:39:57,511 --> 02:40:02,010
Brazil. That crazy ass hole I have
to all the shit that he talked on,

2802
02:40:02,011 --> 02:40:06,900
Brazilians and Vandelay Silva and shale
has been like putting like these rhymes

2803
02:40:06,901 --> 02:40:09,840
up on his, uh, on his Twitter account.

2804
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:12,960
Is it going to be an English or Brazil
and the Brazilians are going to be,

2805
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:14,070
it's going

2806
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,040
to be a Americans fighting
against Brazilians.

2807
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:21,700
16 Americans will go to war to find eight
guys and then 16 Brazilians will go to

2808
02:40:21,701 --> 02:40:24,010
war to find eight guys.
That might be the greatest time.

2809
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:29,010
Those two teams they might have. So a lot
of extracurricular violence. You know,

2810
02:40:29,070 --> 02:40:31,260
you gotta be careful of your,
your coaches. Chell son.

2811
02:40:31,261 --> 02:40:35,850
And he said a lot of nasty shit. Excuse
me. A lot of nasty shit about Brazilians.

2812
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:38,610
Liam.
He's just talking trash is all he's doing.

2813
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:41,940
And if you asked him honestly off the
record, he'd say they're great fighters.

2814
02:40:41,941 --> 02:40:43,890
It's a,
it's an honor and all that jazz.

2815
02:40:43,891 --> 02:40:47,580
But he talks so much mad shit
and Vandelay wants to kill him.

2816
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:52,470
Vandelay and he was going to
be a car Raisie fight. Man,
that's going to be crazy.

2817
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:53,640
As long as we handle is healthy.

2818
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:57,750
I don't want to name any names
or any seasons or anything,

2819
02:40:57,751 --> 02:41:01,650
but apparently there's been some stuff
on the ultimate fighter that happened

2820
02:41:01,651 --> 02:41:05,300
behind the scenes. It was so violent
that they didn't want to air it. Really.

2821
02:41:05,310 --> 02:41:07,580
Have you heard about that?
Like fights? Yeah, like Pete,

2822
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:11,370
there had been fights that they just
completely edit out. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

2823
02:41:11,450 --> 02:41:14,310
I believe it.
I believe it dudes get crazy.

2824
02:41:15,210 --> 02:41:19,010
They had to have them all still
living in houses together. They, yup.

2825
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:22,080
This season they have girls
and guys living together.

2826
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:25,560
Eight girl fighters and it's
a great season. This year.

2827
02:41:25,561 --> 02:41:28,500
Season is awesome at house.
Must smell so bad.

2828
02:41:28,930 --> 02:41:33,470
That's protein far clean.
That shit. Dirty guy.

2829
02:41:33,630 --> 02:41:37,620
It definitely, definitely, probably smells
bad. Are you watching the season? Yeah.

2830
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:41,610
It's good to Rama between
those two chicks, man, jasmine,

2831
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:45,660
Duke and what was the girl she fought?
Raquel Pennington or something.

2832
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:51,560
Was that her name? I'm not sure. But
she can hit. Ah, but you're, you're,

2833
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:56,550
yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't see girls
names. Yeah. But Jasmine, Duke man,

2834
02:41:56,551 --> 02:42:00,510
talk about heart. She was getting
hit hard and she kept calling back,

2835
02:42:00,511 --> 02:42:03,000
throw a nice throw him down.
And she's,

2836
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:06,780
she's actually more of a Jujitsu
chicken and she has a striker and man.

2837
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:12,160
Talk about heart. She's a, um,
out in la now. Training with, uh,

2838
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:16,470
Ronda Rousey's team. Dude, you got
to come down to the one in December,

2839
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:20,850
the UFC in December, December 28th, which
we'll come to Vegas. You got to come.

2840
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:24,660
Okay. That's the, that's the one word Ron
is going to fight Misha Tate. Oh Shit.

2841
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:29,340
Yeah. You gotta be there.
And it's also Chris Weidman,
Anderson Silva dose. Oh Damn.

2842
02:42:29,341 --> 02:42:33,330
I'm that. Yeah, you got, you gotta be
there. That when he should take fights,

2843
02:42:33,331 --> 02:42:36,840
Ronda Rousey and when they actually
step into the octagon. Oh my goodness.

2844
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:40,650
That's good. That might, that might
be the most insane evening ever.

2845
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:43,640
Marinette also, or is that the
18th or something like, ah,

2846
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:48,060
let's find out who's Barnett. Funny
Maxx is fighting Travis Browne. Oh,

2847
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:51,720
that's right. Shit, son.
Good fight. Fuck yeah, it is.

2848
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,860
Yeah. Let me see. Um, to do, do, do, do,

2849
02:42:55,861 --> 02:42:58,890
so it's front snap kicks that are
coming back strong, aren't they? Yeah.

2850
02:42:58,891 --> 02:43:02,930
They don't want to add on those.
Yeah. It's crazy. Isn't it weird that,

2851
02:43:02,931 --> 02:43:05,520
that that technique by Earl even existed?

2852
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:09,630
Do you remember us going over it in
your garage and put it on mastering the

2853
02:43:09,631 --> 02:43:12,120
system?
And I remember asking him about a go,

2854
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:15,400
why haven't we seen the front snap
kicks so much hard land. Yeah.

2855
02:43:15,401 --> 02:43:16,990
And you were like, ah, it's
hard to generate power.

2856
02:43:16,991 --> 02:43:17,920
And you were throwing a couple on,

2857
02:43:17,921 --> 02:43:22,390
like when you were throwing like that
looks like it would hurt if it landed and

2858
02:43:22,391 --> 02:43:24,900
boom, right after that Anderson, uh,

2859
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:28,140
drop couture with it or know
Anderson dropped veto, right.

2860
02:43:28,141 --> 02:43:32,200
Victoria and then Machita drop couture
and now everyone's throwing those snap

2861
02:43:32,201 --> 02:43:37,150
kicks. Yeah. Overeem goes down with them.
That's a big technique now. Yeah. Okay.

2862
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:41,620
Let's see. Anderson fight card.
Anderson Silva Weidman too.

2863
02:43:42,430 --> 02:43:45,680
Oh my God. This is an amazing card.
Oh, Shonda rouse, he meets me.

2864
02:43:45,681 --> 02:43:48,120
Should take Travis Brown.
Josh Barnett. Oh Shit.

2865
02:43:48,121 --> 02:43:50,740
Let me some Thai tea bowel
versus Michael Johnson.

2866
02:43:50,741 --> 02:43:55,450
Chris Liebing versus Uriah Hall.
Oh Shit. Wait, wait, Chris,

2867
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:58,840
listen, leave. And versus Uriah
Hall. How is that possible shit,

2868
02:43:58,930 --> 02:44:02,830
Chris Liebing as a one 85. They're
five. Uriah Hall. I thought you were.

2869
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:06,620
I thought I was thinking you're a favor
by a hall. The winter ultimate five. Okay.

2870
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:11,550
Dennis Seaver versus Manny Gambier
Aryan. Whoo. Oh my goodness.

2871
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:16,270
Goodness. Just nets on it. Sweet. Oh,

2872
02:44:16,271 --> 02:44:18,820
see our bio design aura.
How'd he say it?

2873
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:23,800
By her designer versus a Doomsday Howard.
Holy Shit.

2874
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:27,200
Dustin [inaudible] versus
[inaudible] brand. Oh,

2875
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:30,630
this card's insane.
Yeah.

2876
02:44:31,970 --> 02:44:36,820
It's December 28th. Jim Miller
versus for Breazeale come once. Damn.

2877
02:44:36,850 --> 02:44:38,950
Oh my God.
This is cards insane.

2878
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:43,420
I think for Breesa Como lines is that
guy that hit that a badass triangle from

2879
02:44:43,421 --> 02:44:47,640
the mount? Maybe, but now. Yeah.
I wouldn't know that was Sergio.

2880
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:51,070
Something's different types. I don't
know who did it. A different guy

2881
02:44:51,530 --> 02:44:53,420
either way.
What a fucking card.

2882
02:44:53,421 --> 02:44:58,070
Water card this weekend I'm going to,

2883
02:44:58,071 --> 02:45:02,600
uh, I'm headed to England.
Going to Manchester. UFC.

2884
02:45:02,750 --> 02:45:06,650
Yeah. Well, I'm going, I was
going to do that. Uh, blood
treatment thing in Germany,

2885
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:09,650
but I'm an, I'm going to do it in Santa
Monica. They do it in Santa Monica.

2886
02:45:10,310 --> 02:45:14,120
What's the blood treatment? So stem
cell thing that guys do for their disks.

2887
02:45:14,121 --> 02:45:16,640
It's supposed to be
incredible for it's been,

2888
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:19,060
that's the one thing that
kept me out of Jujitsu.

2889
02:45:19,070 --> 02:45:20,870
I've been like we were
talking about been uh,

2890
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:23,750
injuries and you look forward
to getting back to Jujitsu.

2891
02:45:24,010 --> 02:45:25,280
Had been stitched up before.

2892
02:45:25,281 --> 02:45:29,150
I've had two knee surgeries and I
went back to Jujitsu at my nose fixed,

2893
02:45:29,151 --> 02:45:32,330
went back to new Gi Jujitsu
and everything's fine.

2894
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:36,020
But this was a scary one when
you start getting numb hands.

2895
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:39,890
And then we knew quite a few people that
have had like real serious issues with

2896
02:45:39,891 --> 02:45:44,210
their backs where they have atrophy of
their arms and a bus route and has one

2897
02:45:44,211 --> 02:45:48,630
arm that's like literally half the size
of his other arm. It's scary. So I'm not,

2898
02:45:48,631 --> 02:45:50,270
I wasn't down with any surgeries man.

2899
02:45:50,271 --> 02:45:55,271
I wanted to make sure that I did all the
right things as far as rehabilitate and

2900
02:45:55,431 --> 02:45:56,990
uh,
I got a lot stronger.

2901
02:45:56,991 --> 02:46:00,590
I came back that one day and rolled
pretty fucking hard and didn't have any

2902
02:46:00,591 --> 02:46:04,580
problems, but it was real stiff. And
um, the next day it was stiff and sore,

2903
02:46:04,581 --> 02:46:07,190
but I'm like at least I could roll.
I know I can roll,

2904
02:46:07,191 --> 02:46:10,430
but I think I can make this thing better.
You haven't rolled forward. Go back.

2905
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:14,270
I'm enrolled sense mostly
been doing just Moitai and uh,

2906
02:46:14,290 --> 02:46:17,300
a lot of weightlifting,
which doesn't bother me.

2907
02:46:17,301 --> 02:46:20,290
It doesn't bother me with kettle bells
and it doesn't bother me with, um,

2908
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:23,660
with [inaudible] it's just getting
my neck cracked in the day.

2909
02:46:23,661 --> 02:46:28,580
I came back to your, to the gym too. It
was all arm triangles. It was a member.

2910
02:46:28,910 --> 02:46:33,590
It was a arm triangle transitions and
gay teens, which is um, my favorite.

2911
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:37,040
I love arm triangles, but God, Dan has
a lot of shit going on with your neck.

2912
02:46:37,450 --> 02:46:40,880
So how you feeling right now today?
Feel fine. It's stiff. My back stiff.

2913
02:46:40,970 --> 02:46:43,580
But that's just cause I lifted
weights yesterday. Pretty hard, man.

2914
02:46:43,581 --> 02:46:47,120
I hope that that works out for you.
Be Too. You got to do it too, man.

2915
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:50,820
You gotta try that shit back feeling
great, but I would, it would make it easy.

2916
02:46:51,100 --> 02:46:52,430
It's not 100% right,

2917
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:54,740
but it doesn't stop me from Roland
doesn't sound from training.

2918
02:46:54,741 --> 02:46:58,490
I just got to really focus on keeping
my hamstrings nice and stretch.

2919
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:01,430
Never stretched my hamstrings ever.
That was,

2920
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:04,550
that's the downfall of lower backs is,

2921
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:07,980
is a tense and tight hamstring.

2922
02:47:07,981 --> 02:47:11,720
So that's a new thing of mine
where every morning I'm waking up,

2923
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:16,920
I'm stretching my hamstrings before class,
after class. Sometimes, you know, I,

2924
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:19,310
I, I don't have time, but I just,

2925
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:23,120
I'm more committed to stretching my
hamstrings more than, than anything.

2926
02:47:23,150 --> 02:47:25,850
This is a stretch. This is what this stuff
is, that's important. But this is what,

2927
02:47:25,851 --> 02:47:29,310
this stuff it's called, it's
the, the way, uh, the, the,

2928
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:32,390
the term is called regene. Oh, keen.

2929
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:37,070
R. E. G. E. N. O. K.
I. N. E, a Ortho keen.

2930
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:41,660
It's is the actual medical procedure
and you take, they take your blood,

2931
02:47:41,661 --> 02:47:42,494
extract it,

2932
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:46,880
the manipulated somehow then reintroduce
it to the body as an antiinflammatory

2933
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:50,090
drug to reduce chronic pain and arthritis.

2934
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:55,040
And the process involves two ounces
of blood drawn from your arm and it's

2935
02:47:55,041 --> 02:47:57,620
incubated in a slightly
raised temperature.

2936
02:47:57,800 --> 02:48:00,960
The liquid is then placed in a
centrifuge until its constituents.

2937
02:48:00,961 --> 02:48:02,090
Parts are separated.

2938
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:06,950
The middle yellowish layer is dense with
agents that are believed to stop our

2939
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:10,550
and arthritic agent
known as Interleukin one,

2940
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:13,640
which causes degeneration of the
joints and a breakdown of cartilage.

2941
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:17,030
That serum is injected into
the patient's affected area.

2942
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:19,670
The procedure reduces pain
and discomfort to the joint,

2943
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:24,020
and the treatment generally lasts five
days with six shots of the serum into the

2944
02:48:24,021 --> 02:48:24,920
effected area.

2945
02:48:25,070 --> 02:48:29,090
It's normal for a patient
to receive annual injections
to ease joint discomfort.

2946
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:33,110
So many pro athletes have done
this and had miraculous recoveries.

2947
02:48:33,111 --> 02:48:34,910
Peyton manning went to Germany for this.
He's,

2948
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:38,480
he'd get two neck surgeries and he was
on his way out of football and now he's a

2949
02:48:38,481 --> 02:48:41,390
fucking superstar again.
He's having the best year of his life.

2950
02:48:41,570 --> 02:48:42,410
It's from this shit.

2951
02:48:42,590 --> 02:48:47,320
G Dana White did it and he's just raves
about the result of it. Supposedly level.

2952
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:51,860
If you're, if you have arthritis in
your spine, your lower back, Louis,

2953
02:48:51,861 --> 02:48:56,450
hello from 10th planet. Montreal's got
this, he's got arthritis in his back.

2954
02:48:56,750 --> 02:48:59,750
A guarantee or this would help them.
I mean, I don't know how much he has.

2955
02:48:59,750 --> 02:49:01,610
I don't know what,
I haven't seen his MRI,

2956
02:49:01,611 --> 02:49:05,240
but I guarantee you that this will make
him feel better than he feels. Now.

2957
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:08,070
I'm going to tell, I'll, I'll give
everybody breakdown of it. When I do it.

2958
02:49:08,071 --> 02:49:12,720
I start next week when I get back
from England, I go in, um, and uh,

2959
02:49:12,810 --> 02:49:17,250
we'll see what happens. You already had
all that shit done. Yeah. My, my Mri,

2960
02:49:17,310 --> 02:49:20,370
I had my MRI done right after the injury.
He looked pretty nasty man.

2961
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:24,600
I had a six millimeter millimeter bulge
in my neck. It's pretty big. You know,

2962
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:28,350
it's reduced now quite a bit, but right
after the injury it was six millimeters.

2963
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:32,340
That's not good. And that's why I was
having numb hands and all that shit.

2964
02:49:32,341 --> 02:49:33,900
And you know, it's from,
it's from doing it,

2965
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:37,020
getting injured and then taking a couple
of weeks off and jumping right back in.

2966
02:49:37,470 --> 02:49:42,240
That's what it is. Not allowing myself
to fully heal up and core strengthening,

2967
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:45,210
core strengthening is massive.
It's so important. You know,

2968
02:49:45,211 --> 02:49:47,430
if you're going to be in there
throwing down on a regular basis,

2969
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:51,090
you got to do some core workouts.
You've got to do something that keeps you,

2970
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:55,770
gives you a little armor to protect
you from being injured. No squats,

2971
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:59,970
squats, help a lot. Squats a wind,
mills Kettlebell, windmills are huge.

2972
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:04,120
I love those. The exam, that is a
strengthening your entire core, you know,

2973
02:50:04,121 --> 02:50:07,890
all that bending and carrying
that heavyweight, Turkish
getups, that kind of shit.

2974
02:50:08,730 --> 02:50:12,090
You're doing any shows when you're
in England? I am doing two shows.

2975
02:50:12,091 --> 02:50:14,520
The dance house theater, they're
both sold out, so go fuck yourselves.

2976
02:50:14,550 --> 02:50:16,770
English people, they
bring it into late. No,

2977
02:50:16,771 --> 02:50:21,510
I'm going with a guy who
was a local kid and uh,

2978
02:50:22,110 --> 02:50:26,880

again. He can't. No, no, no.

It's done. Go over there. Do you ever

2980

2981

aspect of Jujitsu to check
out a different person's game.

3004
02:52:05,501 --> 02:52:06,250

doing seminars with your comedy.

3006
02:52:10,811 --> 02:52:14,490
Yeah, we did one in Miami.
Miami. Dot. Oh yeah. Late.

3007
02:52:15,130 --> 02:52:18,610
Do you remember how crazy that rain
was? Yeah. I'll never forget that. Yeah.

3008
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:23,060
We hit a wall of water in Miami that you
couldn't see anything in front of you.

3009
02:52:23,061 --> 02:52:26,170
We've got to stop on the freeway. The
whole freeway stopped dead for the rain.

3010
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:29,230
It was fucking crazy.
Yeah, that was awesome.

3011
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:33,490
I haven't did a seminar in Miami
and for Jesus, a lot of Jujitsu.

3012
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:37,420
That was the last time. That was the last
time. There's a lot of Jujitsu in Miami,

3013
02:52:37,630 --> 02:52:42,580
eight 10 may in Miami. My budgets are a
lot of Brazilians, like a Miami weather,

3014
02:52:42,610 --> 02:52:43,960
so follow him on Twitter.

3015
02:52:43,961 --> 02:52:48,610

3016
02:52:48,611 --> 02:52:51,250

3017

yeah, once I'm back in man,

3020
02:53:01,571 --> 02:53:03,410

We'll figure out some,

3021
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:06,090

place where I'm doing comedy. Let's,

3022
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:09,910
let's work that out, that, that's
making it happen, bitch. Beautiful.

3023
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:14,110
All right folks, we will be back
soon. Um, next week I got a,

3024
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:18,880

Should be a lot of fun. Um, and uh,

3025
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:22,600
someone else as well. I forget who.
Don't worry about it. It'd be good.

3026
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:26,530
Don't sweat it. All right. Keep it
together. You're dirty freaks and uh,

3027
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:31,120
I will be at the Irvine Improv
November 1st, second and third.

3028
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:33,790

the next day coming out that's available.

3029
02:53:33,850 --> 02:53:37,090
The river Cree in Edmonton
