1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Go see a boxing match.
He doesn't even want that to be the 

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,770
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,993
one.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,890
We live.
Are we live?

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,753
Yeah.
We were just talking about a sober 

6
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:11,494
October and a red sphere and the 
speculation that he may be in fact a 

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,430
doing,
running some shenanigans.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,623
We do not know.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,830
It seems to be shenanigans at play here,
but he's.

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,080
He went to strong the first day.
I know still.

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,400
I don't believe that you could sustain 
that amount of that heart rate for that.

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,310
It's interesting to look at his graph 
because he was at 80 plus percent of his

13
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:35,860
max heart rate for more than an hour and
20 minutes.

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,980
Which a look,
he might just be trying to kill himself.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,750
He's got a strong will.

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,100
Yes.
I know.

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,430
Shifty.
She hung.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,333
Is He shifty and honest because he'll 
eventually come out with this is what I 

19
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,334
did and of course I did that.
You guys knew I was doing it the whole 

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,800
time.
That's what he'll say.

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,861
Oh,
come on.

22
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,700
Yeah,
of course.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,690
Of course.
I was going to do that.

24
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,810
So yeah.
But he is shifty and like he,

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,540
he,
he,

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
he's a prankster,
he's a prankster,

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,580
he's definitely going to do some weird 
stuff to get ahead in this.

28
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,470
But he also knows he's gonna lose to

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,750
legion of skanks,
no shit in a box and brought it onto the

30
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:23,010
stage and he had it like sealed up and 
then open it in front of everybody.

31
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,650
And apparently the smile was so 
horrendous.

32
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,280
People were bail you out of the room.
He's gagging and throwing up.

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,263
It's like a public health hazard.
You're not supposed to like have shit 

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,740
human shit in public.

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,740
He's so weird.
Fast.

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,613
And Elisa was gangs.
They've seen everything for them to be 

37
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:44,770
running out of the room.
Yeah,

38
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,604
they've done everything and seeing 
everything in red still freaked them 

39
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,720
out.
I can't believe that.

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,250
I just now heard that story like that 
should be like a headline that's shit in

41
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:58,750
a box and brought it into a room where 
the live podcast was taking place.

42
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,890
It was a small room to room with a 
hundred people in it.

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,980
I love it.
I love someone who is not scared to talk

44
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,770
about shit and deal with shit.
Just

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,600
no,
he's not scared of that.

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,440
I mean,
look,

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,273
the fact that he entered into this 
contest at all and it doesn't work out 

48
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,840
at all for 10 years,
and then he's like,

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,290
there's a fitness contest and the loser 
has to do something.

50
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,124
We haven't totally determined what the 
loser has to do or he wants us to like 

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,750
drink each other's piss.

52
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,050
He wants to drink.
Your pis are lifted.

53
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,920
He might not lose right now.
Tom Seger is in the bottom.

54
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,150
Thompson goes at the bottom.
I think tom is gonna try.

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,253
I think.
I mean your obviously set to witness 

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,100
thing,
but I think Tom's going sneak up.

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,860
He's playing it down.
You looked at his wrist yesterday.

58
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,810
You Go,
what's the thousand something?

59
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,943
Oh,
that's nothing.

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
Just the calories you burned that day.
A thousand.

61
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,120
Tom's Tom Sneaky.
A lot of people feel like that.

62
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,010
I really think he's gonna.
He's gonna do something on this.

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,460
He's going to be the one to beat.

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,460
You got to realize though,
Bert ran a marathon.

65
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,570
He did run a marathon.

66
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,590
He's got this.
This is fun.

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,830
I have to say any one of you could pull 
ahead,

68
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,350
but you're the.
I mean,

69
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,580
can we talk about what you did 
yesterday?

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,483
Yeah.
I worked out for three hours and 20 

71
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,350
minutes.
I'm trying to.

72
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm trying to double marathon.
Yeah.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,380
I'm trying to break burt's will.
That's what I'm really trying to do.

74
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,140
Talks on this Mickey Mantle Gene Shit.
I'm like,

75
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,850
motherfucker,
I'm crazy.

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,760
You don't understand.
I will work out twice a day like that.

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,953
I will.
I'll try to give you a fucking heart 

78
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:31,521
attack.
You Fat.

79
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:35,150
Fuck.
I would love to see you will too.

80
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,500
He'll,
you'll kill him.

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,270
You couldn't kill it.
Don't know if he's going to.

82
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,780
I don't know how long he's going to keep
it up because like birds,

83
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:45,650
very competitive up to a point like the.
With the weight loss challenge.

84
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,840
Tom Stayed steady and Tom one in the end
in one bit per tried.

85
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:51,674
He tried to sprint towards the end but 
it was too little too late and Thomas 

86
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,760
talking shit the entire time.
Like,

87
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:56,594
I know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna fuck off until the very 

88
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,480
end.
Then you get to try to catch up,

89
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,040
but it's going to be too late.
And he was right.

90
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,120
Yup.
Yeah.

91
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,370
Bert,
I don't know if birds will,

92
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,650
can be broken,
hasn't been broken before.

93
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,990
Uh,
well it's not as will.

94
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,560
It's the discipline aspect.
See,

95
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,400
when you're dealing with an entire 
month,

96
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,420
you have 31 days of having to get after 
it.

97
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,820
So how often do you get after it 
normally?

98
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,780
See,
that's the thing.

99
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,773
Yeah.
The difference between me and Bert is I 

100
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,314
work out almost every day already.
So for me it's just like those days off 

101
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,024
don't exist anymore.
So what I've decided to do on my days 

102
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,724
off,
it's just do shit that I wouldn't 

103
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,044
normally do.
So I'll do the elliptical machine for 

104
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,990
two hours or I'll do something else or 
just I'll do something else,

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,340
but the whole time I'm thinking I'm 
going to break.

106
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm gonna break.
Fuck your Mickey Mantle Gene.

107
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,970
Yeah.
You guys were talking about like who you

108
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:50,804
think about when you're really trying to
get past that point where you're either 

109
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,650
your kickboxing or even on an 
elliptical,

110
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,820
sometimes you've got to get angry and 
you think of Bert right now

111
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,490
talking about right now I'm thinking of 
Bert,

112
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,520
thinking of her breaking bird breaking 
as well.

113
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,743
I don't understand.
You guys are all addicts in different 

114
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,410
ways and this is so interesting to watch
because you're right.

115
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,060
You already work out a lot.
You're an extremely healthy guy,

116
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,130
but you're now going to take it.
Your Ex.

117
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,113
I can see the excitement on all of you 
to take this to just an excruciating 

118
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,320
level because it.
It gets obsessive and it gets fun.

119
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,900
Like you can work,
but that's the thing I'm excited to talk

120
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,770
to you at the beginning of this when 
you're still pumped up about it and it's

121
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,380
like you get a high from working out for
three and half hours a day.

122
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,470
Seventeen days from now I'm going to be 
a beaten man.

123
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:41,304
Yeah,
you are,

124
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,550
and you're going to get a surge at the 
end when it gets close again,

125
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,990
but 17 days.
You're right.

126
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,520
That's not going to be a fun day for 
you.

127
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:47,590
Um,

128
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,710
yeah.
Well,

129
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:49,610
I don't know.
Who knows,

130
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,870
you know,
did she ever see.

131
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,780
There's a really interesting documentary
with Eddie Izzard.

132
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520
Eddie Izzard,
who is not a guy,

133
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,570
and really good.
Should you see it?

134
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,160
I didn't it,
but I know what he's done.

135
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,620
I love that guy.
He's so impressive.

136
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,250
He's amazing.
What he did was he ran around Europe.

137
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,220
He did a marathon a day with no 
training.

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,570
I mean,
no training.

139
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,340
He wasn't,
he wasn't in shape.

140
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,770
He was overweight,
his feet weren't prepared,

141
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,220
his feet got destroyed and I watched 
this in the beginning.

142
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,870
I watched us like,
how is he going to do this?

143
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,700
And then towards the end I was like,
wow,

144
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:23,900
this guy is a force of will.
Just sheer will.

145
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,943
I mean his lifestyle is not that he's 
exercising consistently and this is 

146
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:29,444
just,
he's just going to do a little bit more 

147
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,750
and really push himself hard.
No,

148
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,360
no exercise,
just like,

149
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,800
I don't think he exercised at all or if 
he did it was just,

150
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,480
he just had a normal body,
you know,

151
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,380
it didn't have a body of,
yeah,

152
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
somebody's looking at me go a marathon a
day.

153
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,610
Anyone could do that.
But it's,

154
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,440
it's so mental,
mental.

155
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,323
Yeah.
And I think I think a lot of comedians 

156
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,034
have that.
Maybe I'm just doing the thing what 

157
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,560
comedians do of patting themselves on 
the back for being more interesting than

158
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,720
other people.
Like we do all the time.

159
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,650
Like we're so much more broken and we 
have more willpower,

160
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,493
but I think that there's.
I get obsessed with exercise too and I 

161
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:09,544
really get into it and I kind of.
I remember Louis C k doing some 

162
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,054
interview where he said that he runs 
five miles a day because on that fourth 

163
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:17,950
mile when he doesn't want to do the 
fifth,

164
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,880
he thinks about like a day where he'll 
be on set and want to just call it a day

165
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,340
and not push through and it's like how 
it all relates.

166
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,750
Or you'll be in the middle of an hour 
set and you'll be tired and you just.

167
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Everything can relate to being on set or
in the middle of a set and that run five

168
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,134
miles a day.
Making yourself do that means you can 

169
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:39,490
get through anything.
And so I run a lot and I have,

170
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,563
I think of it the same way.
It's just endurance to perform for an 

171
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,540
hour every night.
Think that's insane that we do that.

172
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,970
Well.
If you have more energy,

173
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:49,980
definitely can put out more during the 
show.

174
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,920
So if you are in better shape,
you have more cardio,

175
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,650
you won't get exhausted,
you'll be able to put out more energy,

176
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,410
you'll be more vibrant,
more robust,

177
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,940
you know,
you,

178
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,390
you really kind of.
I mean in some ways if you're doing like

179
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,224
an hour a night,
especially if you're doing two shows a 

180
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:06,210
night,
right?

181
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,750
You owe it to yourself to have an energy
reserve.

182
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

183
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,580
It's just the.
I just think that running,

184
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,983
running so monotonous,
and there's so many times where you 

185
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,924
could go,
I could just not do this and I can just 

186
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,173
start walking and who cares?
But something about pushing yourself 

187
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:28,700
through a run when you could give up and
always you never regret it.

188
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,770
I'll say that you never regret keeping 
running when you could just walk

189
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,740
a moving meditation and a lot of ways 
you're.

190
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,613
You're forcing your mind to take control
of your body and you're forcing your 

191
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:45,470
mind to ignore all of the aches and 
pains and all the,

192
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,323
the desire to quit.
That's when people say that run 

193
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,090
marathons.
You know that you just have to.

194
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,970
Like my friend John Joseph says it best.
He said,

195
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,980
you got to tell you your mind as to tell
your body who the

196
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,120
fuck the bosses

197
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,280
God it is.
I just did dancing with the stars.

198
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,490
Holy Shit.
I just got eliminated last week.

199
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,100
That's a lot of work.
It was so physically exhausting for.

200
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,110
It was a month of my life every day for 
hours a day dancing.

201
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:14,870
And I've never danced before.
And um,

202
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,723
but it was,
I didn't realize how mental it all 

203
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:23,950
really is,
like athletics is,

204
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,823
it's so mental.
I didn't realize it because I've never 

205
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:29,390
been an athlete my whole life.
But before I got into this competition I

206
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:30,224
was like reading all the books about 
like why I am where I am physically 

207
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,230
that's not going to change.
So I better figure out a way to mentally

208
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:39,230
overcome some stuff and I was able to.
But man,

209
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,670
it is,
it's all that I,

210
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,160
I feel like a lot of times and it broke 
me in many ways mentally and physically.

211
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,970
But it was,
I mean it was my sober October for sure.

212
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,013
It was my,
you working on every single day and 

213
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,890
giving it,
trying to beat Bert.

214
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,270
It's definitely not easy.
There's nothing,

215
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,104
there's nothing.
I did a bunch of dancing lessons for a 

216
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:04,870
movie that I was in called zookeeper 
with Kevin James Way back in the day.

217
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,973
And I had to learn how to dance.
And then I had to learn how to dance 

218
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:11,050
with Leslie Bibb from Talladega Nights.
She,

219
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,810
my ex girlfriend and was trying to win 
back from Kevin in the movie,

220
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,110
so I had to learn how to,
like there was a scene where we dance in

221
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:19,910
this ballroom and uh,
you know,

222
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,070
if you realize how difficult it is for 
ours,

223
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,530
we're practicing these moves and it's 
fucking monotonous.

224
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,410
And here's the thing,
I don't give a fuck about dancing.

225
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,393
So it's something like I had to force 
myself to do that I didn't really want 

226
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:34,744
to do.
I'm just not that I don't give a fuck 

227
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,930
about other dancing's fun if you just do
whatever you want,

228
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,050
but when you're doing this very specific
pattern to certain music and you did.

229
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,890
Ugh.
Yeah.

230
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh yes.
This is the scene,

231
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,400
James.
Gosh,

232
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,150
look at you.
Yeah.

233
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:57,860
We had to practice this shit over and 
over again for weeks and weeks.

234
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,333
What was that?
You.

235
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,470
Yeah,
it was,

236
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,790
it was exhausting.
There was a lot to it.

237
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,590
That was so stupid.
It's so hard.

238
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,410
Dancing is so hard and just like you,
I.

239
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,460
Wow.
That's good.

240
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,080
I don't,
I don't care about it.

241
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:19,914
I,
I,

242
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,993
I don't.
It's not something when I want to be 

243
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:25,200
good at something,
I will give everything to be good at it.

244
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,403
And here's the other thing,
if you have a natural ability to begin 

245
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:29,970
with,
if someone goes,

246
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,190
you've got to,
you kind of knack for this,

247
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,300
you go,
oh well I'm good.

248
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,370
I'm going to keep trying.
When I walked into this,

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
I've never.
No one's ever been like,

250
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,150
you've got rhythm girl.
No one's ever.

251
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,800
No one's ever given me even the 
slightest nudge towards any kind of,

252
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,290
um,
playing,

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,090
you know,
having any musical ability or having any

254
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,250
dance ability if anything.
I've been shamed my whole life.

255
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,860
And then they asked me to do this.
Literally my whole life.

256
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,740
I've never danced at weddings.
I don't dance at concerts because I just

257
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,943
know that I'm going to be made fun of in
some way and obviously no one's even 

258
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,340
thinking about me,
but in my head it's,

259
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,040
it's my most insecure thing to do.

260
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,430
I would rather have sex on,
on,

261
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,950
on tv 100 percent.
Then do dancing with the stars.

262
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,230
If there was a sign me up,
Joe.

263
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,490
I'm serious.
This was my biggest fear,

264
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:18,670
but you can't turn down these things 
when they're offered to you.

265
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,743
I feel like,
especially if there's something that 

266
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:23,080
scares you that much as as this did,
I was like,

267
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,020
what do I have diluted?
I'm not going to die doing this.

268
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,423
What's the worst that could happen is 
I'm voted off first and they say really 

269
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:34,000
means to the judges say mean things 
about my style from.

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,390
Yeah,
they got mean to me.

271
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,430
They got really means me fucking super 
serious.

272
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,923
Listen,
I got eliminated less than like a week 

273
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,010
ago from this show that I gave 
everything to and I and I went in saying

274
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm a terrible dancer.
I don't know what I'm doing,

275
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,180
and I did a whole dance and I didn't 
mess up.

276
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,030
Joe Like I and I got very injured the 
day before.

277
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,670
I couldn't even move.
I couldn't get out of bed.

278
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:05,100
I had to have help because I tore 
something in my back and I overcame,

279
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,003
came at mentally.
I talked myself out of having an injury 

280
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,600
mentally,
like I meditated my way out of it,

281
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,740
which I've done with several different 
injuries in my life of just like I,

282
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:14,740
I,
I got to be better.

283
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:17,470
I have to dance on live TV tonight and I
couldn't move.

284
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,400
I couldn't brush my hair because my arm 
was hurting so bad that morning,

285
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,220
so I just started saying to myself,
you're strong,

286
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,260
you're prepared and this is easy.
You're strong,

287
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,220
you're prepared.
The ZZ,

288
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,210
and I sent it 3000 times out loud in the
makeup chair all day,

289
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,750
walking around,
slowly going from this kind of injury,

290
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,660
walking like in the morning to,
okay,

291
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,220
I'm strong,
I'm prepared,

292
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:39,850
this is easy.

293
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,280
And then I.
Then at the end of the day I was,

294
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,970
I danced on live TV and I cured myself 
mentally.

295
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,830
It was insane,
but they were so mean to me.

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
Especially len goodman,
the British,

297
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,690
old Cranky Judge Frisch guy.
The British guys always assholes.

298
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,613
It was,
it was really hurtful and I took it in 

299
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,480
stride,
but I was very.

300
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,950
He called me awkward.
Like I,

301
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,700
I just wanted to walk away from this 
show,

302
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,340
not being like a white girl dancing 
meme,

303
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,203
you know,
like I just didn't want people to be 

304
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:11,471
like,
Oh,

305
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:15,640
white girls can't dance because I know I
can't dance in and I just didn't want to

306
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,350
be made fun of.
And he made fun of me.

307
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,213
He was like,
you look awkward because at the end of 

308
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:21,130
it I just go,
I can dance.

309
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,530
Like it was just me being funny because 
I obviously can't.

310
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,364
But I was like,
I just completed a dance that if you 

311
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:27,610
walk,
it's not that terrible.

312
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,490
I was very injured that morning.
I was proud of myself and he goes,

313
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,490
you will awkward and you can't dance,
you can't dance.

314
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,420
And then he,
he said other things that I just,

315
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,263
I kind of blacked out during it because 
it was so sad and I was just holding 

316
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,580
onto Tom Bergeron for dear life.
And um,

317
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,080
and then I got eliminated first.
So it's so funny to me because I took on

318
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:47,914
this challenge being like the worst that
could happen is that I get eliminated 

319
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,970
first,
which I surely won't do because that's,

320
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,060
I can't be that bad.
I'll be better than somebody,

321
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,120
somebody 13 of 13 people and I wasn't,
I was the worst.

322
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,700
My worst fear did happen.
I got made fun of on TV.

323
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,870
I got eliminated first and you know,
like being on a reality show,

324
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:13,871
like have you done a reality show where 
it's like and the next to the first,

325
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,490
the first contestant eliminated from the
show and then there's dinner and there's

326
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,900
a spotlight on you and I'm staring at 
the stage,

327
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,670
like just a slat in the stage.

328
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,970
I'm just staring there being like 
they're going to say Nikki and gloves,

329
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,880
they're going to say Nikki and Globe and
they Nikki and Gla.

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,650
And it was just like,
I'm on a reality show right now.

331
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,580
Getting eliminated.
It was so surreal and it sucked.

332
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,943
It sucked.
And I'm still obviously very much 

333
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,480
feeling it.
And I loved the show.

334
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,980
I wanted to like,
keep going.

335
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:43,814
I wanted to do different dances.
I like was ready to really because I 

336
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,074
just learned how to learn how to dance,
so I had to learn how to learn how to 

337
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,520
because I'd never danced before in my 
life,

338
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:56,300
never learned the mark arena like I was.
I took myself out of any kind of dancing

339
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,170
that was offered to me in school because
I was just like,

340
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,100
I'm a bad dancer.
I don't want.

341
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:01,934
I wanted to make fun of me.
I'll never dance and I sign up for the 

342
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:04,850
show.
I learn a dance.

343
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,550
I nail it as much as I can nail 
something.

344
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,590
I was very proud of myself and then I 
get eliminated and it,

345
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,730
it really.
Obviously I'm still,

346
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:14,260
I'm just.

347
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,940
Has Anybody ever done it?
Two years in a row?

348
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,430
I would love to do it.
I was almost.

349
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,413
No,
but I want you start taking dancing 

350
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,290
lessons.
I would love to.

351
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,193
Why don't you do that and then come back
next year and shove it up that British 

352
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,560
guys ass.
I don't think they'd want me back.

353
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,423
I bet they would.
I bet they have a hard time getting 

354
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,510
people to do that show.
Why did they let me go so soon then joe?

355
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,560
Because it didn't feel like it was 
because of my

356
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,693
sing.
It felt,

357
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,773
you know,
when you get eliminated from one of 

358
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:45,460
these shows that you just go,
oh,

359
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,340
they don't.
Someone at the top doesn't like me.

360
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,170
There's something else involved here.
It's not okay.

361
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,550
It's probably just butt out of 13 
people.

362
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,560
They liked me the least.
Well,

363
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,760
maybe just being honest,
you had the worst performance.

364
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,010
Isn't that possible?
I mean,

365
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:05,291
you,
you,

366
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,300
you don't.
Didn't look.

367
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,763
If I was on with you,
I probably would have had the worst 

368
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,140
performance.
I don't fucking dance.

369
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,033
Right.
So it's like you think about your base 

370
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,900
that you're coming from.
You're not a person who dances.

371
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,193
This is a totally new thing for you,
but if now you have this in your head 

372
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,233
and you decide to take dancing lessons 
and you do it on a regular basis just 

373
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,980
once,
twice a week for a year,

374
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,620
you can be fucking amazing by time next 
year rolls around.

375
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,623
I really,
I got to see if they allow people to 

376
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,410
enter a second,
continue.

377
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
They will will.
Look,

378
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,573
I,
it's fucking hard to get people to do 

379
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,010
that show.
A lot of people say no.

380
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,230
A lot of people.
It's a massive commitment.

381
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,703
A lot of people don't have the courage 
or the time or the interest in sending 

382
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,590
twice and got the same place

383
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,280
looking good.
For me,

384
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,170
that was a different host to the same 
house.

385
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,153
It was a different host,
different judges because the first time 

386
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,544
I did it I was in college and I liked.
There was no reason for me to even get 

387
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,550
as far as I got.

388
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,700
Let's be honest.
It was rigged.

389
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,900
What did you ever host or hostess?
No,

390
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,743
it was one of the judges and there was.
There was a real issue of with one 

391
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,390
season,
not with mine,

392
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,560
but with Brett Butler,
drew Carey and a couple other people.

393
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,203
They protested because the person they 
voted for did not make it through 

394
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:25,914
because the producers decided that they 
knew better and because they wanted the 

395
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,434
television show to be more interesting,
so they wanted someone more 

396
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,420
controversial or whatever,
whatever it was.

397
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,640
So it was this huge deal where they're 
like,

398
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,474
wait a minute,
why are we here as judges if you're not 

399
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,090
even counting our vote,
like this is all a puppet show,

400
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,860
like what?
What's happening here?

401
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,963
And then there was also conflict because
one of the guys who was a producer was 

402
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,730
also a manager of some of the people 
that were on the show and people like,

403
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,360
what the fuck?
You know?

404
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,723
There was a lot of issues.
There was a lot of issues with that 

405
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:58,900
show.

406
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,630
Yeah.
But I think that's every realities,

407
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,370
but it's a context.

408
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,453
There's rules.
Like I would tell people like that want 

409
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,520
it to be on fear factor.
Like they would say,

410
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:10,680
hey man,
can you get me on fear factor?

411
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,190
I'd say it stopped right now there's 
very specific rules about game shows.

412
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:18,700
Like I can't even talk to you if you 
want to be on the show.

413
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,110
I can't say,
hey man,

414
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm going to get you on the show because
I like you and I'm gonna help you.

415
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,850
I can't do that.
You can't.

416
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,070
Even if you want to be on the show,
don't talk to me because if,

417
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,880
if I have to go to court.
Do you remember that?

418
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,480
That show quiz show?

419
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,501
Yeah,
the,

420
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,334
the,
the movie was based upon that 

421
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:35,714
controversy,

422
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,873
fraudulent show because during that show
they decided this one guy who was 

423
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,774
winning,
they decided it was a great thing to 

424
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,784
have him keep winning and so they rig 
the show and because of that there's 

425
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:50,401
actual federal laws about how you 
organize and run game shows.

426
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,140
It's,
there's a real laws behind.

427
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,270
So then that's why I think I can't go 
back.

428
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,680
I really,
I love this idea.

429
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:04,681
I would like to tell ABC I am interested
in coming back and any of this

430
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,340
and I guarantee you you can go back.

431
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,120
I would love to go back.
I had the best time.

432
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,983
I just want to be a dancer now.
Like I stopped doing comedy because I 

433
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,034
just wanted to focus solely on dancing 
and I started doing comedy towards the 

434
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:21,400
end because you do something for hours a
day that you're terrible at.

435
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:22,234
You want to go do something you're good 
at just to like get your ego back in 

436
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:26,164
place,
because I was beaten down for hours a 

437
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:28,594
day of just,
I'm terrible and I was able to get to a 

438
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,110
place where I could kind of have my,
uh,

439
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,980
my teacher gloves of Django is one of 
the best dancers in the world.

440
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,270
He would just say like,
I've never been a teacher teaching dance

441
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:42,820
since he was 14 years old.
And he was like,

442
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:47,821
I've never met someone who is so bad at,
like I've never met

443
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,940
someone who's.
I go,

444
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,180
I'm special needs dancing.
Like if this were a,

445
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,330
I would be on the short bus for dancers.
I just don't have whatever it takes.

446
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,350
But I worked hard enough that I was able
to learn a very difficult to know.

447
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,343
Stop you there.
It's not that you don't have what it 

448
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,570
takes as you've never exercised it.
Yes.

449
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,410
You know how to move.
You're not ambulatory,

450
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,640
you know,
I don't

451
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,133
to say that I'm disabled in any way,
but whatever some people are born with 

452
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:17,010
that gives them a natural rhythm and 
like ability to dance.

453
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,990
I don't,

454
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm coming out a little of that and a 
lot of it is just a bunch of dancing and

455
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,770
they danced at all.
Yeah,

456
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:26,604
I mean think about it.
I mean if you never played basketball 

457
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,340
and you went and played basketball,
you.

458
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,350
God Damn it.
I'm terrible.

459
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:31,550
I thought it was going to kick ass.
Yeah.

460
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,743
You know,
that's.

461
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,670
A lot of people feel like that about 
fighting.

462
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,590
Like a lot of people think if I ever 
fought out,

463
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,130
fuck people up like you.
Yeah.

464
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,580
Good luck.
You think that good luck.

465
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,773
That's the thing is I wanted,
I kept saying down the barrel of the 

466
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,714
camera,
I'm like,

467
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,540
if you're watching at home being like,
why can't this girl do this?

468
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,374
Because it would be like clapping that I
couldn't get or walking and clapping 

469
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:52,754
together and I could just picture people
at home watching me struggle and be 

470
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:55,941
like,
oh,

471
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:56,774
I could do that.
Like I say to the computer when I watch 

472
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,600
this stuff,
but I'm like,

473
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,320
until you do it,
you don't know how hard this is.

474
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:03,800
It.
Look,

475
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,820
everyone assumes that they can do it 
just like stand up.

476
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,903
But here's the difference with standup 
is like I had people just like you did 

477
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,260
throughout your childhood and growing up
be like,

478
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,020
you're funny,
you've got like no one's ever been like,

479
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,330
you should dance.
Like No.

480
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:21,164
What do you mean?
Like we have a natural knack at what we 

481
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,924
do that's kept us,
that made us even try it in the first 

482
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:28,034
place.
Right.

483
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,710
Who was the first person that you 
remember being like,

484
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:31,544
you're funny.

485
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,643
Well,
the,

486
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,430
there's like one guy in specific that 
I'm still very good friends with.

487
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,490
His name's Steve Graham.
He's an ophthalmologist actually.

488
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,230
And when we were,
uh,

489
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,730
we were friends,
I was 15 and he was probably in his late

490
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,170
twenties and we were training together.
We're doing martial arts together and he

491
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,004
was just,
I would just do impressions of our 

492
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,920
friends and,
and he was like,

493
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:55,780
you should be a comedian.
And I was like,

494
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:57,610
get the fuck Outta here.
And there's no way,

495
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,444
man.
I was like,

496
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,891
look,
I'm,

497
00:22:58,891 --> 00:22:59,724
I'm,
I say fucked up things that you think 

498
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:01,744
are funny because you're fucked up too.
Like regular people are gonna think I'm 

499
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:05,940
an asshole.
Like,

500
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,070
I just wanted to make people laugh that 
were around me.

501
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,260
I didn't know.
And then I started going,

502
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,143
uh,
I went to an open mic night and then I 

503
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,410
realized like,
oh,

504
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,450
there's like a whole,
this is like martial arts.

505
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,010
Like there's a whole process of 
learning.

506
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,890
Like I didn't think of it that way.
I thought people were just really good,

507
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,413
you know what I mean?
Like,

508
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,400
Hey,
it's Jerry Seinfeld.

509
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,234
Like when I was in high school,
when I was in high was senior in high 

510
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:29,560
school,
this girl that I was dating,

511
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,080
we went to see Jerry Seinfeld at the 
paradise.

512
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:32,914
It was this big club and in Boston.
And I remember sitting there thinking 

513
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,390
like,
this guy's incredible.

514
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,090
He's just talking and all these people 
are laughing.

515
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,560
Like this is amazing.
What a,

516
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,530
what a crazy ability to do that,
you know?

517
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,560
And just,
wow,

518
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,483
that blew me away.
And then a couple of years later I was 

519
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,490
doing it.
So it's weird.

520
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,840
It is.
But that's,

521
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,230
I would love to see a picture of you in 
that crowd that night.

522
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:58,250
Never having been on stage with a mic.
Like,

523
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,060
and then look at you now.
It's just so crazy.

524
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,280
Those moments of like in your life where
you were at a Jerry Seinfeld show going,

525
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:09,160
Whoa,
I could never do that.

526
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,200
Joe Rogan.
That's so nuts.

527
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,123
It was weird,
but now you're just like you and Jerry 

528
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,190
Seinfeld to me are like one in the car.
Like that's the same,

529
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,810
so that's,
that's cool.

530
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:23,890
But what I'm saying is that you need 
these people in your early on.

531
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:24,724
You need to be.
I would never have done standup comedy 

532
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,160
had someone not been like,
you should be a comedian.

533
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:30,790
I was desperate for anyone to give me 
any kind of direction.

534
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,103
And then some one person says at one 
ophthalmologist says it and then it 

535
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,120
becomes your career and that's why I'm 
always.

536
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,770
I always try to just tell what I'd see 
people like something in someone.

537
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,950
I try to say that because you don't know
if you're the one person that's going to

538
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:45,784
get them to go do it.

539
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,693
I do that too.
I've tried to talk like 100 people into 

540
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:49,200
being comedians.
Yeah,

541
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,220
yeah,
yeah.

542
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,350
What was trying to tell friends that I 
have that are funny,

543
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,270
I'm like,
you should just try it.

544
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,520
Just go up at an open mic night and give
it a shot.

545
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,730
I would just say do it if you want to do
it,

546
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,564
do it now because you're going to do it 
eventually and you're going to regret 

547
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:04,340
not doing it sooner.
You might not do.

548
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,440
There was a nurse that used to work at 
this doctor's office or to go to.

549
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:10,260
She was fucking hilarious and I was 
always telling him,

550
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:12,960
listen to me.
You should fucking do comedy.

551
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,450
You really should try it.
And she never did it,

552
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,843
you know?
And I went there for years and she 

553
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:19,734
thought about doing it,
so I'm going to call them to open mic 

554
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:20,970
night.

555
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,960
I go,
tell me when you're going.

556
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:22,890
I'll go.
I'll go,

557
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,210
I'll meet you there.
I'll,

558
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,240
I'll help you.
I'll introduce you to the whole process.

559
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:29,340
I'll show you how it works.
I'll show you.

560
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,320
There's a signup.
People go up.

561
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,480
Listen,
she's not meant to do it.

562
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,463
Well,
it's like,

563
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,020
what's that expression?
You can lead a horse to water,

564
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:38,880
but you can't make them drink.
Yeah.

565
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,590
It's like,
I know,

566
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,453
but just I think you have to be fucked 
up to want that kind of rejection and 

567
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,140
humiliation that we got in the early 
days.

568
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,980
The early days too.
Like people see you now.

569
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,990
You go up in the main room.
Hit Ladies and gentlemen.

570
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:55,824
Nikki glaser.
Yeah.

571
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,271
Clap,
clap,

572
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:57,990
clap.
Thank you.

573
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,610
Goodnight.
Seems like fun.

574
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,170
Hey,
that seems like a great Gig,

575
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,213
but see you.
When you're an open miker and you're 

576
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:07,770
around all those fucking psychopaths 
that are signing up for open mics.

577
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,910
They're all smelly and and sons in 
Kansas City.

578
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,160
Oh my God.
I heard Craig just died recently.

579
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,070
Know gone beetlejuice because your dog.
Do you like this?

580
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,200
Hey,
you want to really work here?

581
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:21,010
Come sit on Craig's lap.
Uncle craigy.

582
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,120
Yeah.
That takes me right back.

583
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:25,590
Dude.
Started there.

584
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,610
That was a fun Gig.

585
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
It was a fun gag.
I used to love that place.

586
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,900
Classic Road Gig.
Just CD.

587
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:36,030
Didn't know if you were going to get 
paid the full amount.

588
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,600
Good shows too.
Rowdy drunk.

589
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,180
Kansas City is a fun place.
It was a fun place.

590
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,010
I was just there couple weeks ago

591
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
and I did some crazy outdoor place.
Some outdoor amphitheater was awesome.

592
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,920
No,
that's good.

593
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,990
No,
it was really great.

594
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,990
I didn't even know it was outdoor until 
we got there.

595
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,083
It was

596
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,750
one of those gigs.
Are you like I had done?

597
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:58,584
No,
I didn't read any of the emails about 

598
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:00,540
this.

599
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,450
I didn't pay attention to is me and 
Santina.

600
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,520
Santina was outside.
I was like,

601
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,140
get the fuck out of here.
It's not outside.

602
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,350
What's outside?
It was strange.

603
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,960
Yeah.
I started in Kansas City,

604
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,070
but that's just.
I've been relating it recently.

605
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:20,390
I'm like working on a bit about 
encouraging people early on because I do

606
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:22,880
look at the people that told me you 
should be a comedian when I.

607
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,163
right before I tried it because I was 
going to be an actress and then I was 

608
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,790
like not really good at this and I'm 
not.

609
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,173
I don't care enough to get good at it.
Like I see what it takes to be great at 

610
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:36,470
being an actress and I was just like,
I don't want to do that.

611
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,750
But then someone was like,
you're funny,

612
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:40,670
you should try standup.
And then that was like,

613
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,070
oh,
I'm,

614
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,480
I care enough about this to like go 
through the worst of it and get good.

615
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,763
But I,
I,

616
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,730
I've been exploring recently unstaged 
like blow jobs.

617
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,723
Um,
I've been talking through and I think 

618
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:54,920
it's the same thing because I'm not 
great at them.

619
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,880
I've never been like,
wow,

620
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,760
you're the best at this.
And I've never been a girl who's like,

621
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,970
I love giving blow jobs.
And I've always heard girls,

622
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,680
like there's some girls that say that 
like,

623
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,600
I love second deck and I've always been 
like,

624
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,170
say that to you or does it say it's a 
guys?

625
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,580
They say it,
it just,

626
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,943
it just out there.
And I've always called bullshit on it 

627
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:15,590
because I just think it's like you're 
just serving a guy and you.

628
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,453
There's no way that you can enjoy it.
Like it's not that comfortable of a 

629
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:20,570
thing,
but maybe you get some,

630
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,330
uh,
what's the,

631
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,810
the compersion where you enjoy someone 
else's.

632
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,790
Yes.
So maybe it's that,

633
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,020
but now I realize that the difference 
between me and those girls is that those

634
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:31,850
girls,
the first time they gave a blow job,

635
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:35,540
I guarantee or one of the first times 
the guy was like,

636
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,380
you're amazing at this,
you're really good at this,

637
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,340
because when a girl is told or anyone 
has told early on the first time they do

638
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,790
something that like,
you have a natural talent at this,

639
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,863
you go,
I,

640
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,830
I do.

641
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,230
And then you do it again and again 
because you're like,

642
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,670
I'm good at this,
this is my thing.

643
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,650
And then you get good at it and you're 
like,

644
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,513
it's my thing.
But no one ever said that to me about 

645
00:28:57,711 --> 00:28:58,544
blowjobs early on.
It was always just kind of like a means 

646
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:01,694
to an end.
And I feel like if someone would have 

647
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,700
just been like,
lied to me.

648
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,010
So I am.
I asked guys now like,

649
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,873
just lie to every girl.
If you get a blow job and it's like 

650
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:10,310
mediocre,
just be like,

651
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,144
you're the best at this ever.
Like this is the best job I've ever 

652
00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:16,340
received because she will be.
So it'll make her feel good.

653
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:17,174
What's it gonna hurt that she thinks 
she's the best at this thing that she's 

654
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:21,290
not that great at,
but she'll do it a lot because she'll be

655
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,124
like,
I'm great at this and this guy thinks 

656
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:23,984
I'm the greatest at it.
So she'll do it a lot and then by doing 

657
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:28,730
a lot she'll get better and then 
everyone wins.

658
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,970
Yeah,
maybe.

659
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,813
Or she could just suck a lot of dicks 
and people will lie to her and then her 

660
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,150
self esteem gets shattered.
If she runs into the one dude and said,

661
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,740
who the fuck told you you're good at 
this?

662
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,430
Nobody told me I was great.
No,

663
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,670
no,
you're not good at this at all.

664
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,790
It's all teeth and you're choking.
This is crazy.

665
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,093
Maybe maybe even a girl that is really 
good at them can meet a guy that's like 

666
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:55,890
you're tailing because everyone likes 
different styles.

667
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:57,960
So I think that you run that risk 
regardless.

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,130
Maybe some guys just like really bad 
blow jobs.

669
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,964
Right?
Like some guys like blowjobs from 

670
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,970
someone who seems like they've never 
done it before,

671
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,990
that way they don't feel like they're 
the 90th in line.

672
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,920
Oh,
that's a really good point.

673
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:08,754
Joe.
Like you could be into a blowjob that's 

674
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,940
kind of apprehensive and like,
what am I doing that.

675
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,560
How does this feel like a virgin all 
type situation?

676
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,573
Just putting on an act.
It's got pigtails on I just schoolgirl 

677
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,540
outfit.
What am I doing?

678
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,040
Wait,
what do you teach?

679
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,500
What do you do with this?
Oh my God,

680
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,690
my friend recently,
because we've talked a lot about,

681
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:28,524
me and my friend have talked a lot about
how we are insecure that we're bad at 

682
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:34,560
blowjobs and we've taken classes at bay 
bland or all these things are way.

683
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:34,901
Way,
way,

684
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,310
way,
way,

685
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,220
way,
way way wait,

686
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:36,660
wait,
wait,

687
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,493
wait.
They tip,

688
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,333
they give out classes to give blowjobs.
Who's teaching the class as girls or 

689
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:42,670
guys?
Uh,

690
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:45,240
I think it was like a gay guy and a 
woman together.

691
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,143
Jay Guy,
gay guy should know how to suck a dick 

692
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:49,164
because he has one.

693
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,590
I've read everything.
I've watched tutorials.

694
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:54,510
I just,
it's just not getting through to me.

695
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,130
I just,
I haven't,

696
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,870
I try and I'm not like bad at that.
Like I,

697
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,480
I don't think I'm,
I'm bad at them,

698
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,314
but I just,
I think I always was apprehensive 

699
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:03,384
because I think the first thing I heard 
about blow jobs was that the first 

700
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:06,684
complaint I would hear around me was too
much teeth and I've always had like 

701
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:14,541
really big teeth in some like smile.
I have vague teeth that abnormal,

702
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,743
but I always just like,
I had buck teeth as a kid so I was 

703
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,750
always called me like a beaver.
I was like,

704
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,740
my teeth are going to get in the,
in the way of this,

705
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,840
so I immediately.
That was my biggest issue.

706
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,550
And then you learn that like that's easy
to like work around and then so anyway.

707
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,030
But my friend said that she learned this
new trick where she wouldn't,

708
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:33,864
she's hooking up,
she'll do a role play of like will you 

709
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:39,630
teach me how to do a blow job?
But she's actually wanting them to teach

710
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,260
her and so it's a hot thing where like 
she gets to role play.

711
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,094
But she honestly doesn't know and gets 
and then the guy tells her exactly what 

712
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,604
to do and then if she messes up,
it's like part of the character as 

713
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:53,610
opposed to her being bad at blow jobs.
So that's my next thing.

714
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,850
I'm going to try thing.
So the guys invested in the project.

715
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,340
Yeah.
And if you mess up your own,

716
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,530
you're just part of your character.
You're just being good at the roleplay.

717
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,410
It's because you're innately better.

718
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,730
But then when you break up,
you're like,

719
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,860
listen asshole,
I sucked 100 Dick before you.

720
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,050
I know exactly what I was doing.
I was trying to make you feel better.

721
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,170
You fucking loser.
But either way they were all bigger than

722
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:14,590
yours.
All of.

723
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,710
Exactly.
Yeah.

724
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,540
It's um,
yeah.

725
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,291
I,
I don't know,

726
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,490
I have a lot of thoughts about sex.
Obviously I'm,

727
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,170
well your act is very much like that.
It is,

728
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:27,690
but it's,
and I hate being pegged,

729
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,730
no pun intended as like a sex comic,
but like,

730
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,523
cause I just did this ABC show dancing 
with the stars and the whole time I'm 

731
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:39,350
trying to be on my very best behavior.
I,

732
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,100
I want

733
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,680
to play the game,
I don't want to be the sex girl.

734
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,240
Get kicked off in the first episode.
I don't want to offend children watching

735
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,074
at home.
That's.

736
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,270
I've never talked about sex.
So people go,

737
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,260
Ooh,
she's,

738
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,690
you do nightclub comedy,
you're there for adults.

739
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,150
I'm just talking about what I want to 
talk about.

740
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,133
Obviously what we all know that,
but I think sometimes people are like 

741
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,404
year the sex coming because like I just 
think that's the most interesting topic 

742
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,914
right now.
That's why I'm talking about it becomes 

743
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:06,644
a problem,
right?

744
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,520
You get labeled.
Yeah.

745
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,670
It sucks because I have ambitions beyond
being a comedian who talks about sex,

746
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,950
but already I brought it there with you 
because it is my wheelhouse.

747
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,240
I'm most comfortable talking about it.
It's fun to talk about.

748
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,140
I have a lot of opinions about it.
I was trying to behave myself so much on

749
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,850
dancing with the stars because I don't 
want to be labeled as that.

750
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,550
But.
And I also was like,

751
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,940
didn't have sex.
I was 21.

752
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,030
I,
yeah,

753
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,873
I was not.
And then I didn't because I was all 

754
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,980
through high school,
I was just like scared of guys.

755
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:41,750
I don't know why I was just scared of 
intimacy,

756
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,040
scared of boys,
couldn't,

757
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,933
didn't kiss a boy until I was 17 and 
even then it was like one shot deal and 

758
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,104
then I didn't do it for years.
And then I got an eating disorder which 

759
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,084
like push men away because I looked like
a skeleton and then as soon as I was 

760
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:56,000
able than I,
I had sex.

761
00:33:56,001 --> 00:34:00,830
But it was years and years and until I 
started like drinking,

762
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,783
I couldn't have sex.
And then I quit drinking and I couldn't 

763
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:06,380
have sex again.
Thinking about how many

764
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,490
the people have gotten laid because of 
booze.

765
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,453
Every one dming Joe,
do you remember when there was this 

766
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:13,064
ridiculous time just a few years ago 
where they were trying to push this 

767
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:17,480
narrative that if you have sex with 
someone who's been drinking,

768
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,314
that you're a rapist even if you're 
drinking to this is this weird third 

769
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:27,440
wave feminist nonsense where they were 
like adults going to grown adults have a

770
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,274
couple of drinks.
You're not supposed to do that because 

771
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:30,314
they can't consent because they're 
drinking and so people were literally 

772
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,304
calling people and accusing people of 
rape because they had sex with each 

773
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,540
other while they were both drunk.
No.

774
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,453
Well,
this was a.

775
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,013
well,
here's it was a real weird time and 

776
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,893
they've abandoned it because it's so 
preposterous and the pushback was so 

777
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,044
hard,
but you're responsible for yourself 

778
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,310
every other time when you're drunk,
if you're driving,

779
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:54,080
you're responsible.
If you get in a fight,

780
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:54,914
you're responsible,
you're responsible during all those 

781
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:57,674
things,
but somehow or another if you and a 

782
00:34:58,941 --> 00:34:59,774
person or exchanging pleasure,
then you are not responsible for your 

783
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,590
actions and you can't consent to that 
because you've been drinking and then it

784
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:09,950
becomes rape and it's only really only 
rape.

785
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,873
In the case of the guy,
it's never raped a girl rape the guy 

786
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:13,964
because the guy was drunk.

787
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,843
Right.
Even though I know stories of where 

788
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,190
that's happened,
where a guy wakes up from a blackout and

789
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,450
a girl is stuck in this deck.
Yeah.

790
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,460
Yeah.
And that's.

791
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,150
And he's like,
Hey,

792
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,620
do I know if it was the other way 
around?

793
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,590
Right,
right,

794
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,423
right.
Yeah.

795
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,050
Um,
yeah.

796
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,400
But obviously it's not the same.
No.

797
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,610
And no one would be having sex if we 
didn't,

798
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,950
if we didn't have alcoholic few people.

799
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,210
So few people because 30 percent of the 
people having sex,

800
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,043
think about casual sex.
That's my whole point right now is like 

801
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,430
I can't have,
I'm single.

802
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,650
I can't even have casual sex because I'm
sober.

803
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,560
So how long have you been sober?
Seven.

804
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,340
It'll be seven years in December.
From alcohol?

805
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,453
Yeah.

806
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,723
Yeah.
And before then I was hooking up a left 

807
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:00,620
and right.
It was so fun.

808
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,950
I was blacking out just to have sex 
because I was scared of intimacy.

809
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm realizing all of this now is like,

810
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,670
I know the whole deal.
You're doing all that.

811
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,090
Yeah,
I go through therapy.

812
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,910
I work on myself constantly.
I meditate,

813
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:12,630
I do all the things and I'm,
I,

814
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,910
I don't know if I'm any.
I am better for it,

815
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,970
but I realized that I'm not getting,
I'm not having sex and it's not fun like

816
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:22,440
I am.
I'm hooking up with ex boyfriends,

817
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,410
which you know,
that's because there's no pressure there

818
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:26,244
of like,
this is new and am I going to catch 

819
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:28,164
feelings?
It's like they've already been had or 

820
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:32,940
the or the bubble up again.
You just get to scratch an itch.

821
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,590
Yes,
yes.

822
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,980
But,
but having new sex casually,

823
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,190
like I just can't.
I can't even imagine doing that.

824
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,024
But I had so much when I drank because 
it just makes everything easier and I 

825
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:50,340
used to just.
And I asked the crowd sometimes.

826
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,440
I'm like,
have you guys ever.

827
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:55,650
Who here has had sex for the first time 
with someone?

828
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,783
We're.
Both of you were stone cold sober first 

829
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,914
time sex.
Literally two people raised their hand 

830
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,890
and in the main room and go

831
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,250
of the story.
No,

832
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,430
exactly.
No,

833
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,140
you're so right.
No one listening at home right now.

834
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:11,540
Wherever you are.
Have you ever had sex for the first time

835
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:14,540
with someone where you're both sober?
It doesn't happen in our society.

836
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,550
Well,
alcohol gets abused for sure,

837
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,280
but it also gets used,
used correctly.

838
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,783
There's good things to alc.
I think it's a technology that 

839
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:23,354
alleviates a lot of your inhibitions and
it makes people feel better and that's 

840
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,210
it for that reason.
You.

841
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,410
Are you an addict?
I mean,

842
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,570
is it possible that you could drink a 
little bit?

843
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,333
I'd be fine drinking a little bit.
I know I would first thing you say 

844
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,610
before you wake up in the gutter,
exactly

845
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,920
how I am with weed and I have to,
I start out and I go,

846
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,230
I'll just get high as a treat,
you know,

847
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,510
after a set and then I go,
that'd be fun to be high for the set and

848
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:55,240
then it's like it'd be fun to be high 
when I wake up in the morning.

849
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,133
And so it always,
it always snowballs into I'm high all 

850
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:00,610
day and then I have to go.
Okay.

851
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,180
Sober October and I quit for a month and
then build it back up again.

852
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,440
Is that what you're doing right now 
with.

853
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:06,580
We'd,
like you say you're sober,

854
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,070
sober with alcohol,
but

855
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,783
I smoke a little weed and I've gone 
years in the seven years of not smoking 

856
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,880
weed and um,
but I'm back on it.

857
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,160
I quit for dancing with the stars 
because my short term memory

858
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,710
was shit and you can't learn dance steps
when you're high.

859
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,390
I thought I might like help me,
but no,

860
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,570
I think if you already knew it,
if you had it locked in your memory then

861
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:30,730
it would be good because you'd feel it 
more.

862
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,040
Yes,
but it was terrible for me.

863
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:34,874
So I quit for three weeks and the second
I got eliminated I started again and 

864
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,243
have.
So it's been a week of me smoking weed 

865
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:45,370
again and it's already like it's,
you know,

866
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,590
the snowball effect is in,
is in play,

867
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,450
but we does not derail my work ethic.
It makes me work out more.

868
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,613
It makes me think in a different 
creative way and it eventually impedes 

869
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,250
me when it starts to interfere with my 
voice.

870
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,084
If I start getting like horse more 
because I'm doing radio every morning 

871
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:05,950
and then I'm going to make you hoarse.
Yeah.

872
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:08,680
Because I just like,
I don't know how to inhale or something.

873
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,560
I just want you use edibles.
I do,

874
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,280
but those aren't.
I liked like,

875
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,630
I like to feel it in my lungs and feel 
it immediately.

876
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:19,990
If there was an immediate edible I'd do 
it.

877
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,620
But um,
I like those too.

878
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,020
But again,
those fuck up my voice too.

879
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,910
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
Yeah.

880
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,430
But um,
yeah,

881
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,264
I so wish.
But with alcohol I will say like I just 

882
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,390
could see it snowballing into a point 
where I would quit again,

883
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,370
but I just have never.
I miss drinking a lot for the sex thing,

884
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:45,730
for the dancing thing.
Like just dancing to music in general.

885
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,450
Like is more fun.
Like if you drunk just life,

886
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,380
like first who drinks,
like life is pretty great for drinks,

887
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,230
good.
Sending text messages.

888
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,153
I don't want to send reaching out to 
guys they don't want to talk to in the 

889
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,330
morning.
All of that anxiety.

890
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,910
The hangover.
That's what I'm avoiding is the hangover

891
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:05,590
and with we need.
I don't have a hangover.

892
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,360
You can hang from weed.
No.

893
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,240
No,
but for sure.

894
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,480
And does it make you want to quit and 
question everything?

895
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:15,280
I mean,
how do you keep your drinking in check?

896
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,053
Um,
I've never had a problem with drinking 

897
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,190
in like,
it's never been like,

898
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,330
God,
I need a drink.

899
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,780
I've never been like,
like,

900
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,903
like sober.
October was the first time I did 

901
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:30,800
absolutely nothing for a whole month.
I didn't smoke a joint,

902
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,440
I didn't do mushrooms,
I didn't,

903
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,790
nothing,
right?

904
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,403
Wasn't that hard.
What was interesting about it was the 

905
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:41,120
dreams,
first of all,

906
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:45,920
because the dreams come hard and fast 
when you're off the weed and they,

907
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,130
because apparently I talked to this Guy 
Dr Matthew Walker,

908
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:54,131
who is a dream specialist and he was on 
the podcast discussing the importance of

909
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,540
sleep sleep specialist,
I should say,

910
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,220
but he was saying that marijuana impede 
certain aspects of rem sleep,

911
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,820
which is when you do all your dreaming.
So when you,

912
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:06,620
um,
get off the marijuana,

913
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,753
your brain apparently makes up for lost 
time and hits you with some crazy 

914
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:12,524
fucking dream talking frogs and fucking 
Unicorns and roller coasters that go 

915
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:22,481
straight to heaven and fucking bananas 
dreams or my gut.

916
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,833
Well,
the thing is this time for a sober 

917
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,224
October,
I was way tapered off by the time this 

918
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:32,414
rolled around.
Like I a little pot in Toronto on 

919
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,700
Saturday,
but I mean a little like I took like one

920
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,370
or two hits.
I had a drink,

921
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,383
maybe two drinks.
I think I had one drink when I went on 

922
00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:48,621
stage and then I had a couple glasses of
wine after the show who went out to this

923
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,970
restaurant after the show.
But yeah,

924
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:52,804
it was.
This was an easy one because I was kind 

925
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:55,091
of.
But I,

926
00:41:55,091 --> 00:42:00,091
I think I slowed down after last year.
I think doing that a sober October thing

927
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,650
made me realize like,
hmm,

928
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,140
there's some,
there's some of that school that right.

929
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,920
Unfortunately that is all my favorite 
comics did drugs.

930
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,480
All of them picks Kennison prior.
Everyone did drugs.

931
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,440
They were,
they were all.

932
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,680
I mean prior was coke.
I've never touched coke but Kennison was

933
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:22,514
coke too,
but Hicks was more psychedelics and I 

934
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,080
mean he did coke and alcohol and all 
that other stuff before,

935
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,010
but there was,
there was all.

936
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,600
They were all like these wild fucks.
Like Ron White is a good friend of mine,

937
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,500
always drunk and there's like this part 
of that life that,

938
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,453
you know,
there's so it's so attractive because 

939
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,720
it's just like this wild,
loose,

940
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,180
carefree,
rebellious,

941
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,590
figured out tomorrow life and that's,
that's the life of the comic.

942
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,050
But I realized like after last year,
so by October that there's a lot of that

943
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,710
stuff you could do if you're sober and,
and it's,

944
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,470
I think as I said,
you can abuse alcohol,

945
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,420
but you can also use it,
you know,

946
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,710
you can use it,
you can,

947
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,920
you can have a couple drinks and feel 
good and you enjoy the moment more.

948
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,720
You know,
there's,

949
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,040
there's something,
there's something to it,

950
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,300
but it's really a matter of your own 
personality and discipline.

951
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,570
It's like how much and how much of an 
addict are you?

952
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,650
Like what,
how much,

953
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,513
what is it,
what holes are missing in your brain 

954
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,560
that get filled up with that booze and 
that like once you take the booze away,

955
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:32,500
there's this gaping chasm that you need 
to fill in.

956
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,300
What is that?
And you got to figure out who you are.

957
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,370
Because I know some people that can't 
have anything,

958
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,490
they have one drink and then they're off
to the races and they're doing math.

959
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,573
Yeah.
No,

960
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,600
that's not me,
but it's,

961
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,240
I just,
I,

962
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,470
I would get blackout drunk a lot and 
well after a couple beers,

963
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,860
like were you less secure then the newer
now?

964
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,060
Yeah,
way,

965
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,193
way less secure,
but I think being sober has helped me 

966
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,623
become more secure.
But because you're forced to be in the 

967
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,500
moment,
I just,

968
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,560
I worry about my depression too,
like with adding booze on to depression,

969
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:12,480
which I feel like I have a good handle 
of right now.

970
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:15,360
I just don't want to lose it because I 
think that like,

971
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,950
I don't know,
obviously alcohol is a depressant and so

972
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:23,750
I think that and,
and the people that I,

973
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,750
I,
I,

974
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,660
I get really,
really depressed and like in a dangerous

975
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:29,130
way where I'm like,
I gotta watch it.

976
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,203
Like I got to be vigilant about 
meditating every day to keep my 

977
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,080
depression at bay because

978
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,000
what do you think that is?
Do you think that's a genetic thing?

979
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:38,710
Do you think it runs in your family?

980
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,653
I think it must run in my family.
I think we have stuff that I haven't 

981
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:42,774
even like get found out,
but like there's some suspicious deaths 

982
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:48,810
in my family that I'm like,
was that suicide?

983
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,550
You know,
where I'm like,

984
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,140
I think it's described.

985
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,370
Feels like,
what does your depression feeling?

986
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,180
It feels like it.
Honestly.

987
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:02,480
I get suicidal thoughts.
Not like I just,

988
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,860
I should kill myself.
It's like kill yourself.

989
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,790
It would be fun to kill yourself.
They come from literally soothing.

990
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,624
It soothes me to think about killing 
myself when I'm in my worst depressive 

991
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,080
stages.
And it is,

992
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,660
I compare it to like sniffles when 
you're getting a cold,

993
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:21,370
like I have a little,
a little thought will go,

994
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,260
oh,
shoot yourself in the head.

995
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,230
Like it literally comes into my head 
like a sniffle where you're like,

996
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,360
Oh God,
I'm getting sick again.

997
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,330
Okay,
I got to meditate now and then it'll.

998
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,780
And then I'll be fine.
Like literally it's like that.

999
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,920
And what is,
what's before the shoot yourself.

1000
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,660
Nothing.
Nothing.

1001
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,180
And that's the,
that's the problem is like,

1002
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,040
it just is,
you know,

1003
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,480
it can be,
it can be.

1004
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:49,120
Um,
it may be,

1005
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:49,954
it's circumstantial little bit like 
maybe I'm feeling lonely that day or I 

1006
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:54,274
didn't get a thing that I wanted or I,
but I really do think it's like the 

1007
00:45:58,661 --> 00:46:01,120
weather,
like I just can't even describe it.

1008
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,920
I remember Sarah Solomon talking about 
her depression.

1009
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,960
Like it's just a cloud comes over you 
and you're just like,

1010
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,400
oh,
well here it comes.

1011
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:10,540
And that's kind of how it feels.
And I totally have it under control when

1012
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:11,374
I'm meditating everyday doesn't,
I don't get a single one of those 

1013
00:46:13,451 --> 00:46:15,310
thoughts.
But like if I skip a day,

1014
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,820
if I don't do tm one day,
those thoughts keep,

1015
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,743
they come in and then if I.
and then you see if you get into a real 

1016
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:24,880
bad spot,
you,

1017
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:26,090
those thoughts start.
I,

1018
00:46:26,091 --> 00:46:26,924
and I've never even so much as made an 
attempt or even planned to make an 

1019
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:30,934
attempt.
Like it's never gotten to that even 

1020
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:32,644
close to that for me.
But I realized that these are the same 

1021
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:36,694
kind of thoughts that people that end up
doing this start with like there's some 

1022
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:42,750
kind of like I,
I,

1023
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,683
I'm,
I'm a people who love me and care about 

1024
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:46,534
me get so upset when I talk about this,
but I think that more people struggle 

1025
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:50,260
with these thoughts then talk about.

1026
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,093
So I,
I'm eager to share it because I don't 

1027
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,720
think I'm ever going to kill myself and 
I don't think that that's.

1028
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,823
But I think that like a lot of people,
I'm at risk and I don't think that 

1029
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,384
people talk about that enough then 
because I do have these thoughts and I 

1030
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,670
go,
it's not even like I go,

1031
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,560
what can I do to make myself feel bad?
Oh,

1032
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:10,390
I could kill myself.
And literally it's like kill yourself.

1033
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,313
It's like a little voice or something.
And I've struggled with mental illness 

1034
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:15,790
before.
I mean I had anorexia where it was like,

1035
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,930
don't eat.
And you're like,

1036
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,040
where's that?
Who's that?

1037
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,750
But it's,
it's a voice.

1038
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,730
Did you have,

1039
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,563
don't eat because you thought you were 
overweight or don't eat because you 

1040
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:26,520
thought you'd be more attractive.
If he looks like

1041
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,080
all,
I'm a rail,

1042
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:33,770
I mean this vague direction vague or was
it just like an obsession?

1043
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,430
It was,
it started out like,

1044
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,510
you know,
um,

1045
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,340
high school,
I should be skinny.

1046
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,960
Everyone should be skinny.
I admire,

1047
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,800
I like wanted to be famous someday and I
looked at,

1048
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:47,110
I admire like I idolize everyone in the 
magazines,

1049
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:47,944
the whole classic thing of like looking 
literally in magazines and I want to 

1050
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:51,364
look like that.
I hate myself pinching my sides being 

1051
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:55,210
like,
if I'm not like that then I'm worthless.

1052
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,890
Having a mom who constantly hated her 
body was skinnier than me and constantly

1053
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,350
said she was fat and things like that 
where you just,

1054
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,580
you have things modeled for you.
So I grew up thinking skinny equals more

1055
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:10,600
lovable and then I lost weight just 
because,

1056
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,434
um,
my senior year I lost weight because of 

1057
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:13,194
boy liked me that I liked who I liked 
back and I was like very nervous about 

1058
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:15,910
it.

1059
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:16,181
Like,
you know,

1060
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,730
when you just get nervous so you can't,
you don't eat that day.

1061
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,100
And I had a date with this guy was my 
first date ever.

1062
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:23,260
And I just,
that day I didn't eat because I was just

1063
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:26,470
nervous and then the next day it showed 
up on me because someone goes,

1064
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,000
you look great,
what's going on?

1065
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,410
And I was like,
oh,

1066
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:32,110
I just didn't eat yesterday.
Like I can do that again.

1067
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:34,120
So it's basically the same thing as 
saying,

1068
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:38,180
you're really funny.
You're open to suggestion.

1069
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:42,470
I'm really good dude.
I know I,

1070
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,180
I'm scared of it.
The thing is I,

1071
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:48,750
I am open to suggestion,
but the thing is I am good at,

1072
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,830
at losing weight.
I can,

1073
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,010
I can stick to a diet and I can black 
and white things.

1074
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,900
I can say I'm not drinking for seven.
I can,

1075
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,860
I can quit things,
I can quit eating and I have good.

1076
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,940
It's like willpower.
And I learned that like Oh for the first

1077
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,870
time,
like I could do this.

1078
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:05,704
And so I just stopped eating.
And then the for a while you get like 

1079
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:09,304
super hot.
Like I was very popular for a couple of 

1080
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,450
weeks.
And then for a hot second,

1081
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,284
I was hot for a second and then I got so
scary skinny and then I couldn't stop 

1082
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,420
your.
You were just like,

1083
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,590
I go,
well I don't.

1084
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,660
Everyone's like,
hey you looked great like a week ago.

1085
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:24,760
Like right now it's kind of of concern.
And I'm like,

1086
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,270
well I don't know what to do because if 
I eat I'll just get fat again.

1087
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:30,550
And so I just,
this is all I know now.

1088
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:34,000
And then it becomes if you eat your week
and then it becomes obsessive compulsive

1089
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:34,834
and then it's not even about being fun 
anymore because you look in the mirror 

1090
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,320
and I would look in the mirror and go 
like,

1091
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,790
you're disgusting.

1092
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,600
Like I looked like I w I look like 
Holocaust pictures.

1093
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,493
Like that's how bad I looked at photos 
from back then to make sure that you 

1094
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:50,980
don't ever get back to that spot again.
I won't ever get back to that spot again

1095
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:55,240
because I'm too vain to do that now.
And I know like what I see it coming.

1096
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:58,420
It's the same way of like pot when I see
it starting to interfere with my life,

1097
00:49:58,421 --> 00:49:58,991
I go,
okay,

1098
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:01,000
you need to stop drinking and smoking 
pot.

1099
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,980
And when I see myself get too skinny now
I'm like,

1100
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,470
okay,
you need to stop working in chaos,

1101
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:07,000
but you kind of have a handle on it.
Oh,

1102
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:07,834
I totally have a handle on it.
I won't ever be anorexic or die of 

1103
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,360
depression.
Like all these things I won't,

1104
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,850
like,
I'll go a different way.

1105
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:16,684
But like those things aren't going to 
get me because they almost got me 

1106
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:19,564
before.

1107
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,240
I mean anorexia.
I should have died.

1108
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:23,074
I was going to die from it.
And I planned on dying from it and 

1109
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,250
planned on time from.
Because Joe,

1110
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,173
I was starving.
It sucks to be starving and on doing 

1111
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:34,010
this because I wanted to die.
I was like,

1112
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,770
some,
it was a slow suicide.

1113
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,000
Uh,
18,

1114
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,680
18,
19,

1115
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,180
20,
21.

1116
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,080
I was like,
I stopped weighing myself because it was

1117
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:46,760
so dangerous to get attached to a 
number.

1118
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:51,020
But the last time I remember wearing 
myself I was 98 pounds.

1119
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:54,530
That was when I was admitted to a psych 
ward when I was 18 and

1120
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,760
I'm five nine.
And what do you weigh now?

1121
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,900
I'm 1:35
now and I'm skinny now.

1122
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,250
So yeah,
you're not,

1123
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,283
you're not stretching imagination like 
35 pounds lighter than this plus more 

1124
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,390
crazy.

1125
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,530
I was so thin.
I was so like,

1126
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,590
that's crazy.
Everywhere I went people would point and

1127
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:19,424
whisper and talk.
It was one of those things where it was 

1128
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:21,081
like,
you know,

1129
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,570
you've seen girls out and about like 
that.

1130
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,350
Do those to go to my yoga class.
That was terrifying.

1131
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,650
She was so scary.
She looked like.

1132
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,920
I mean she was a small person too.
She was only like five,

1133
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:35,370
one or five to and she looked like she 
probably weighed 80 pounds.

1134
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,833
It was awful.

1135
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,680
It's,
that's the way people.

1136
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,514
And I see girls like that now and I,
I do the same thing that people used to 

1137
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:44,680
say to me,
which is like just eat a sandwich bitch.

1138
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,470
Like what are you doing with Kim?
I know you can't say that,

1139
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,304
but I don't even relate to the person I 
was when I wasn't eating because the 

1140
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:54,640
only way you can say is like,
I could not eat,

1141
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,850
I could not do.
It was almost like if you were to like,

1142
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,700
if a protein shake,
it was like drinking poison.

1143
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,280
Like I'm gonna die if I drink this.
It was that hard to,

1144
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,660
to eat.
I don't get.

1145
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,120
I,
first of all,

1146
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:10,240
I was admitted to a hospital because I 
was going away to school.

1147
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,640
Um,
I lost all this weight and like a couple

1148
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,473
months,
like it went away quickly for me and it 

1149
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:16,570
got scary fast.

1150
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:17,823
The school called my parents.
My parents were in denial because they 

1151
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,430
didn't want to believe that their 
daughter was like dying.

1152
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,000
So they were kind.
They were concerned.

1153
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,920
But like I was lying to them about,
oh,

1154
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:27,754
I'm going out to eat.
I'm not going to be here for dinner 

1155
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,070
night.
Just lying,

1156
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:30,904
lying,
lying.

1157
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,583
I went to the doctor to get a physical 
because I was going away to school in 

1158
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,010
the fall.
This was July.

1159
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,320
I went to go get a physical and my 
pulse.

1160
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,950
I have like a low pulse anyway,
like I Brady Cardia.

1161
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,360
It's I think it's 37 to 42 resting.
You have an issue.

1162
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:48,300
What is it called?
It's called Brady Cardia.

1163
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:51,250
It's just like a low resting pulse rate.
I don't know.

1164
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,380
An exercise?
No.

1165
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,180
I exercise a lot,
but even when I don't exercise a lot,

1166
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,910
I still just have a low.
Do you do a lot of cardio?

1167
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,640
I do a lot of cardio now.
Yeah,

1168
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,513
but I really liked this elite athlete.
Resting heart rate's like Lance 

1169
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,691
Armstrong.
I'm really proud of it,

1170
00:53:04,691 --> 00:53:08,590
but I do nothing to support it.
Like I run every day but not like enough

1171
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:09,424
to boast that,
but it saved my life because I didn't 

1172
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,414
know I had a low pulse rate,
but when I went in for this thing that 

1173
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,203
this physical,
the doctor clearly could see I was 

1174
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:22,120
anorexic because they looked at me and 
weighed me,

1175
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:27,210
but they didn't have any kind of data to
keep me,

1176
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,610
but until they took my pulse and they 
were like,

1177
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,473
if you leave you're going to die and 
you're going to be a liability to us 

1178
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,870
because we know so you can't leave.
You're going to owe you a 50 1:50

1179
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,440
or whatever it is where you're committed
to a second one.

1180
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,150
So I went in for a checkup,
was taken on a golf cart,

1181
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,003
the golf cart to the other side of the 
hospital where I was checked into a 

1182
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:48,120
psych ward.

1183
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,700
And my mom's like,
no,

1184
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:51,600
she's not in there.
Like,

1185
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:54,930
yes she is.
And so I was admitted there and I had to

1186
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,230
stay there for a couple of weeks I 
think.

1187
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,530
And then I lied to get out of it because
I ate just enough to get out.

1188
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,393
And then I went to school,
I convinced my parents I was okay to go 

1189
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,900
away to school,
which I wasn't nearly died.

1190
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:10,650
They're just starving myself and 
exercising too much and that.

1191
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,484
But that,
that is how I got out of it was that so 

1192
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:16,350
I wanted to die because I was hungry all
the time.

1193
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:19,800
Being hungry socks and I couldn't eat.
I didn't know how to eat.

1194
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,240
I didn't know even know how to begin to 
eat.

1195
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,074
So I was like,
every night I would just pray that I 

1196
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:24,114
wouldn't wake up because I would go to 
bed freezing cold because you have no 

1197
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:28,020
fat so you're cold.

1198
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,390
You have to wake up.
I was going to school in Colorado.

1199
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:33,870
I was ill prepared for the weather and 
also I had no fat on my buddy was.

1200
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:34,943
It was an awful existence.
And then I did stand up comedy for the 

1201
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,424
first time because yeah,
because when I went to school my 

1202
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:45,620
freshman year,
I was so crazy looking like I was.

1203
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,483
I was like,
I was like the nightmare before 

1204
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,690
Christmas.
Jack skeletal.

1205
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,080
Yet that is what it looks like.
I was.

1206
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,090
I look at pictures,
I'm like,

1207
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,500
how did you have friends,
bitch,

1208
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,573
but I did because I became really funny 
because I wanted people to go look over 

1209
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,730
here,
don't look at me,

1210
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:03,564
so I just,
I was a shy kid in high school when I 

1211
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,653
was not anorexic,
but then when I needed to make friends 

1212
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,780
because I was one school loan,
I was like,

1213
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,913
oh,
I'll just develop this really over the 

1214
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,890
top personality so people don't notice 
that I'm so thin.

1215
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,340
So that's when I became funny.
Really funny,

1216
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,174
you know,
I was always like,

1217
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,210
dormantly funny,
but that's when it became like outwardly

1218
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:22,044
funny.
People started telling me how it should 

1219
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:24,690
be a comedian.
My freshman year I tried it,

1220
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,700
I did it one time and then I was like,
oh,

1221
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:27,534
I have a reason to live now.
Like I have a purpose and I know that 

1222
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:32,570
sounds so stupid,
like cliche to say like,

1223
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,660
oh,
gave me comedy.

1224
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:34,494
Gave me a reason to live,
but it really did because I didn't know 

1225
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:36,660
what that.
I was like,

1226
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,920
what am I going to become a teacher?
I don't care.

1227
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,650
I'm not passionate about that,
but this,

1228
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:41,850
I was like,
okay.

1229
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:42,960
So then I was like,
I got,

1230
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,720
I have to gain some weight if I'm going 
to now have a career.

1231
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,720
So then I started,
I found a therapist.

1232
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:49,890
I was like,
I got to beat this.

1233
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,110
I started reading books.
I found a therapist and I found this one

1234
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:56,190
therapist who told me the thing that 
really broke through,

1235
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:58,560
which was like,
when you have anorexia,

1236
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,750
everyone's just eat something.
Why aren't you eat something?

1237
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,584
And you feel very in control of it and 
you feel like you're the one to blame 

1238
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:05,304
for it because you're the one that's 
choosing not to eat and you're the one 

1239
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,880
that's choosing to exercise.
And,

1240
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,300
and um,
and so I felt all this shame about like,

1241
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:16,050
why can't I cured myself?
Why am I giving myself this thing that's

1242
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:18,390
ruining my life?
And then this therapist was like,

1243
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:20,220
think of it as like cancer.
Like you got,

1244
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,083
you got sick,
like something invaded your life and 

1245
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:27,130
there is a demon inside you telling you 
don't eat and it's not you.

1246
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,590
It's not you.
So don't listen to that voice.

1247
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,860
And then as soon as I was able to like,
disassociate my illness from like,

1248
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:37,150
it's my choice,
it's my doing,

1249
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:37,984
I'm not eating.
And I was able to see it as like the 

1250
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,314
exorcist,
like that little girl has like a demon 

1251
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:44,660
inside insider.
That's like dominique pitch,

1252
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,693
eat if you eat your week.
As soon as I was able to go shut up 

1253
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,930
voice,
then I was able to eat again.

1254
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,793
It was like one nugget of one way of 
perceiving my illness that was able for 

1255
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:59,290
me to like crack it.
And then it took many years to like.

1256
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:04,420
And I still struggle with controlling 
issues over food,

1257
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,210
but I'll never be anorexic again.
But yeah,

1258
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:08,620
it was that,
it was um,

1259
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,820
it was a mixture of comedy and also 
therapy that

1260
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,053
with alcoholics too,
that that's one of the reasons why 

1261
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,720
alcoholics,
when they talk about,

1262
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:17,554
they talk about it,
like it's a disease and people who 

1263
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:21,220
aren't alcoholics who are judgmental 
global.

1264
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,770
It's not a fucking disease.
Cancer's a disease.

1265
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,080
Leukemia disease,
you'd as weak.

1266
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,620
But if they treat it like it's a 
disease,

1267
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,450
then you can cure it.
But if you,

1268
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,910
if you treat it like your week,
then you just shit on yourself.

1269
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:34,270
Like,
oh,

1270
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,430
I'm weak.
I just want another drink.

1271
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,950
Like what is it about me?
Why do I need this booze?

1272
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,370
And there's this weird cycle,
this loop,

1273
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,290
this that goes on in your brain,
you know,

1274
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:46,390
like,
I don't want to drink.

1275
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:47,470
I don't want to drag.
Dammit.

1276
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:48,970
I drank.
I'm never gonna drink again.

1277
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:49,930
Fuck,
I'm drinking again.

1278
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:53,710
And then these people that just get 
completely out of control.

1279
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,250
One of the ways that helps them is to 
treat it like it's disease.

1280
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,850
Yeah.
I think it's,

1281
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:02,550
I think it was just a real,
a way that I'd never seen.

1282
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,583
I had seen so many doctors,
but until that one guy told me to think 

1283
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:07,184
of it in like literally did the thing 
where he put a chair in the corner of 

1284
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:11,720
the room and was like,
talk to your disease,

1285
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,990
tell it what it's done to your life.
And I had to.

1286
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,140
And I go,
this is too.

1287
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:16,910
I'm not doing this.
Fuck.

1288
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,230
It took me 30 seconds until I was 
sobbing,

1289
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,750
screaming at this empty chair.
But it,

1290
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,823
I mean it works.
Have you ever talked about this on 

1291
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:27,550
stage?
No,

1292
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,453
it's so weird because I'm still,
I feel like I'm still too in it or I 

1293
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,360
don't know.
I don't know.

1294
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:38,120
I want to be able to someday and when I 
am able to,

1295
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:41,210
it'll be like a real huge moment in my 
career in life.

1296
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,373
But even me being able to talk about it 
on podcasts like this or in platforms 

1297
00:58:46,251 --> 00:58:50,180
like this is new to me still and I've 
done it before,

1298
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:52,130
but it's,
it's,

1299
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:57,131
I just feel like I still suffer with so 
many of these things that I'm like,

1300
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:59,210
oh,
it's so weird to talk about it.

1301
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:00,044
Like I,
I like to have a little bit more 

1302
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:02,540
distance from the.
Even though it's been.

1303
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:05,270
I'm 34 now and I get had anorexia when I
was 18.

1304
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:06,920
I'm still like,
it's still too new,

1305
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,900
but sometimes things

1306
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,850
16 years seemed like a long time,
you know?

1307
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,620
But it goes by quick happens very quick.
It's,

1308
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:17,770
yeah.

1309
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,890
I just like to have.
I don't know.

1310
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,700
I know what it is.
I'm just still.

1311
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,090
I think I'm still so angry about it.
And still,

1312
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:27,950
there's still pieces of it that I'm 
like,

1313
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:28,784
how did I get this and how did I have to
save myself instead of someone else 

1314
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:37,451
coming in and saving me?
And why didn't someone intervene before?

1315
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,180
Can't though,
can they?

1316
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,143
I mean now it's kind of,
it's very hard for someone to convince 

1317
00:59:43,931 --> 00:59:46,890
someone you need to stop drinking or you
need to get your shit together,

1318
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,520
you need to do this,
we need to do that.

1319
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,290
You need to hit your own bottom.
I know.

1320
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:52,440
And,
but you know,

1321
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,530
I feel like yeah,
you just,

1322
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,833
I,
there's still things about it that are 

1323
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:02,620
really painful to me.
And I think that it,

1324
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,120
when I am dealing with something like 
that on stage,

1325
01:00:06,121 --> 01:00:06,954
I think the pain still shows and I can't
be funny with it yet because I'm still 

1326
01:00:09,661 --> 01:00:10,494
so angry.
I think I'm still just like angry about 

1327
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,300
it because I also feel like I'm still a 
victim to um,

1328
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,720
body dysmorphia,
like crazy.

1329
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:22,560
Like that's my new thing where like,
I'll just see something in the mirror.

1330
01:00:22,561 --> 01:00:23,610
Then I'm like,
well,

1331
01:00:23,611 --> 01:00:24,444
yesterday you felt the opposite.
I'll go from a 24 hour timeframe from 

1332
01:00:29,131 --> 01:00:30,510
being like,
you're fat,

1333
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,850
I'll look in the mirror and be like,
you're fat,

1334
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,740
and then the next day I'll be like,
you're too thin.

1335
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:35,670
And I'm like,
well,

1336
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:39,030
those things can't be possible within 24
hours of themselves.

1337
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,870
So your crazy.
Right,

1338
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,061
so that.
I mean,

1339
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:45,060
I'm still dealing with stuff like that 
and I want to be on the other side of it

1340
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:45,894
and be able to tell girls like,
you're beautiful and your body doesn't 

1341
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:50,280
matter and it's what's up here.
That counts.

1342
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,740
But I don't.
I'm not there yet.

1343
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:54,830
So I don't know how to,
to,

1344
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,880
to really talk about it.

1345
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,320
Well,
I don't think.

1346
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:03,290
I don't think there's one way,
you know,

1347
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,124
I think everybody's got their own weird 
thing that's causing them to have 

1348
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,260
issues,
whether it's a B to b,

1349
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:11,540
an alcoholic,
or to be addicted to whatever.

1350
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:12,374
You're addicted to everybody.
There's no one you have to figure out 

1351
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:16,874
the person and then figure out how this 
disease or whatever it is a sort of 

1352
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:24,980
interface with that person.
And what is it that happened to you that

1353
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,460
made this,
this thing attractive where it fits into

1354
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:30,070
your slots and,
and,

1355
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:30,993
and distracts you from all the things 
that are freaking me the fuck out about 

1356
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,960
your existence.
I mean,

1357
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:39,950
it is a coping mechanism.
If it was so simple that like,

1358
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,850
oh well then people are anorexic,
you tell them this and then they go,

1359
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,840
oh,
okay.

1360
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,033
I mean the.
If there was like a protocol that you 

1361
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:48,314
could just establish right away,
oh you just got to take these steps and 

1362
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:52,754
then you'll be fixed.

1363
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,150
It doesn't work.
And they might work for some people.

1364
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,220
You know,
what would really doesn't help,

1365
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:02,600
you know,
it doesn't help that it's so prevalent.

1366
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,250
Like there's so many people that have 
issues like that.

1367
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,173
And the other way too,
like there's people that are 

1368
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:10,450
bodybuilders that are crazy,
that can't they,

1369
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,680
they the same gang big enough.
It's the same thing.

1370
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,030
It has the same goals with giant fake 
boobs that they think they need triple f

1371
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:17,864
boobs.
I like the way people see themselves 

1372
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:23,100
versus the way other people see them as 
very strange.

1373
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,373
Yeah,
I know what I've been watching the show 

1374
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:27,060
botched.
Have you watched that show?

1375
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:28,230
Yeah,
I've watched that show.

1376
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,570
Holy Shit.
I mean that's the same.

1377
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,650
They don't,
they don't,

1378
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:35,060
they don't know what they don't see what
we're seeing at.

1379
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,140
Oh,
it's,

1380
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,103
it's crazy.
This is poor lady who was on the other 

1381
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:43,020
day who is getting,
she's getting her nose fixed because she

1382
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:46,500
had so many surgeries that are,
knows collapsed and it was just like,

1383
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,420
oh Christ,
you know?

1384
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:53,421
And they had to take a chunk out of her 
rib and they rebuilt her nose up.

1385
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,090
It came out great at the end obviously.
Which is why they put it on television.

1386
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,610
She fixed her.
Oh yeah.

1387
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:04,690
Unless you don't fix inside.
I don't know that bitch done done.

1388
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:09,303
Unless you're fixing what's up here 
that's making you look at yourself in 

1389
01:03:11,531 --> 01:03:12,980
the mirror and go,
I'm uglier.

1390
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,600
And that's what I'm in a mad dash to do.
Joe is like,

1391
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,540
fix yourself.
Well,

1392
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:22,570
just know to yet to get to love myself 
enough through therapy meditation,

1393
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:27,580
just to love myself on the inside enough
that I don't.

1394
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,410
Because as I age,
as you age,

1395
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,244
especially in this business,
things aren't as good for what as you 

1396
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:33,671
age,
as a woman,

1397
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:37,960
things get shittier,
like you become less valuable to society

1398
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:38,794
based on the fact that you're aging.
It's just funny in this business and in 

1399
01:03:41,591 --> 01:03:42,424
life.
Like I remember the first time I 

1400
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:45,274
remember one time I was hanging out in 
high school with my girlfriends and I 

1401
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:51,520
remember her.
This girl's mom always used to just kind

1402
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:52,354
of say things that she envied our youth 
a lot and when you're young you're just 

1403
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:55,751
like,
okay,

1404
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:56,930
Old Lady,
what are you gonna?

1405
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,270
Get out of here.
What do you do?

1406
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,200
You're saying these sad things and then 
just walking out of the room silently,

1407
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,383
like.
But she would say these things in one 

1408
01:04:04,061 --> 01:04:05,620
day.
The one thing she said really got to me,

1409
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:06,454
she was like,
you girls are also young and thin and 

1410
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:11,050
beautiful.
You know?

1411
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:11,884
I remember,
I remember the last time a man held the 

1412
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,590
door for me and then she just left the 
room and I'm like,

1413
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,960
oh,
there's a day that that just stops.

1414
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,130
Wow,
that's ridiculous.

1415
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:23,440
I hold them.
Of course for old ladies all time,

1416
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:24,274
that's stupid,

1417
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,220
but I,
I think she meant that was the last time

1418
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:30,640
a man who wanted to fuck her and you 
know,

1419
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:34,560
when that's in the air when there's a 
door being held for you by a guy who was

1420
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,860
like,
bug you,

1421
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,220
but why is that gender specific?
I mean that's,

1422
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,540
that's with men with women.
Men Too.

1423
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,100
I,
my dad recently said to me,

1424
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:42,934
he was like,
[inaudible] don't even look at me 

1425
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,910
anymore.
My Dad's like an attractive guy and he's

1426
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,753
like,
I'm like invisible to women and I can 

1427
01:04:46,821 --> 01:04:49,780
see like a sadness in it and,
and I don't want to.

1428
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,123
I know that that's all that will happen 
eventually because that is just the way 

1429
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:56,160
things go once in a while.
A guy might be,

1430
01:04:56,161 --> 01:05:00,040
I'm an older ladies and I'd like to bang
her and I will love that guy so much and

1431
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:00,874
I know those guys are out there and I 
hear hear from those guys a lot when I 

1432
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:05,620
talk about this stuff,
but those guys are sick.

1433
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:07,250
Just like you were when you were 18 
pounds.

1434
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,193
I hope they never fixed that thickness.
Please share it with the old ladies are 

1435
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:16,820
so needy though.
Thank you.

1436
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,760
So you.
So

1437
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,270
thank you for that is don't fix that.
We need those guys.

1438
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,190
But I just know that that's,
that's on the horizon,

1439
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,053
that attention from men and women and 
just society will start to wane and 

1440
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:32,854
you'll become more invisible physically 
to other people and I just hope at that 

1441
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,904
point I don't give a fuck.
And then I liked myself enough and so 

1442
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,710
that's what I'm.
I'm like running at that.

1443
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:44,230
Trying to like,
like myself enough on the inside,

1444
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,064
which I really have gotten so far ahead 
of what I thought I could ever do in 

1445
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:51,004
terms of loving myself and working on 
myself and getting sober and all the 

1446
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:55,550
things.
But I still feel like it's not enough.

1447
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,384
Like I'm still,
I still deal with insecurities and I'm 

1448
01:05:58,871 --> 01:05:59,860
like,
God dammit,

1449
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,390
I'm aging and this.
I'm supposed to not feel this.

1450
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:06,730
I'm supposed to not care that I'm aging 
as much.

1451
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:09,160
I don't want to be one of these women 
that's like a hates aging.

1452
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:11,500
I just don't want to be it.
And I'm kind of,

1453
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:15,620
well you have to be very careful in you 
feel about aging,

1454
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,090
aging.
I don't think about it

1455
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,910
really don't tell you don't because you 
seem ageless.

1456
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,890
Like honestly,
someone just said your age,

1457
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:24,724
and I was like,
I don't even think of Joe is having an 

1458
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:28,240
age.
I honestly don't like.

1459
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:29,074
You seem like an ageless person to me.
And that's because you don't give a 

1460
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:31,894
shit.

1461
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:35,510
You don't think of it you this.
I mean this is gonna sound ridiculous,

1462
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:39,690
but you have to eat.
You have to realize that the entire,

1463
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,360
your life from birth to death is a blink
of an eye.

1464
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,700
It is a very short period of time in 
terms of the entire life of the planet,

1465
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,380
the life of the human race,
the life of the universe.

1466
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:59,210
It is a blink of an eye.
And for you to be with wear blinders and

1467
01:06:59,211 --> 01:07:04,211
concentrate on one tiny little window of
sexual viability,

1468
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,090
it's preposterous.
It's ridiculous because the whole,

1469
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,303
your whole existence is insane.
It's so bizarre looking at people's 

1470
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:15,590
bizarre like how the fuck do your eyes 
work?

1471
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:16,483
You're looking through your eyes and 
light is refracted through your lenses 

1472
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:22,700
and your cornea and you're seeing things
and I know that if I reach,

1473
01:07:22,701 --> 01:07:24,710
I can grab.
This can is right there.

1474
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:29,950
I mean all of that is bizarre and so to 
to concentrate on this one thing,

1475
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,040
when will people stop wanting to stick 
their Dick in the me?

1476
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,500
That's crazy that I even like,
but it's a crazy.

1477
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,540
It's a perspective issue,
right?

1478
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,010
Yeah,
and I think the,

1479
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,490
the,
the wider you get away from that and one

1480
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:45,590
of the best ways to do that,
a psychedelic drugs,

1481
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,873
psychedelic drugs are one of the very 
best ways to broaden your perspective 

1482
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,640
because the experience is so tight,
tonically,

1483
01:07:52,641 --> 01:07:57,641
alien and so giant and connects you to 
the entire universe itself that when you

1484
01:07:59,090 --> 01:07:59,923
come back down to earth,
it seems so preposterous and then you 

1485
01:08:03,021 --> 01:08:05,440
see this dance that everybody's involved
in,

1486
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:06,274
you know,
with putting on fake butts and fucking 

1487
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,463
get your lips done and all the chaos 
that people are doing just to try to 

1488
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:16,760
attract more sexual attention and 
knowing that this is so,

1489
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,610
so such a short period of time.
One of the things that freaked me out is

1490
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:20,444
what I call monster face.
It's when women get their face pulled 

1491
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:28,160
back so far that their mouth looks like 
it's bigger because there had been doing

1492
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:28,994
this and so it looks like they could 
just open their mouth up like venom and 

1493
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,580
fucking get your whole head in there and
chop your fucking head off.

1494
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,053
It's.
It's a.

1495
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,190
it's a sickness.

1496
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,410
It's so funny because yeah,
when you get that stuff done,

1497
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,244
you end up looking like other people who
have had it done so you get a certain 

1498
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:44,810
type of face.
We all know the face.

1499
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:46,680
You're describing like a deep sea 
monster,

1500
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:47,750
a deep sea fish.

1501
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:48,663
Yeah.
And shoot things into their cheeks and 

1502
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:52,540
make your cheeks puff up because it 
eliminates some of the wrinkles.

1503
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:56,400
But then it looks like you've been 
beaten up literally like you got fucking

1504
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,590
stung with a swarm of bees.
It's better.

1505
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,150
Well,
it doesn't.

1506
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:00,983
You know also doesn't work because 
there's a thing called the fibonacci 

1507
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:05,200
sequence and when you look at a person's
face,

1508
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:07,570
there's a golden ratio of the nose to 
the eyes,

1509
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,090
the chin,
and as soon as you fuck with anything,

1510
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,180
soon as you switch one of those up like 
lips,

1511
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:12,910
you're like,
hey.

1512
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:15,100
Like if you look at say like Serena 
Williams,

1513
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,650
her lips match her face and there's 
like,

1514
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:20,380
there's a natural order to that.
If you look at Arusha fear,

1515
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:23,080
his nose matches his chin matches his 
face.

1516
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,680
There's a,
there's a ratio that it fits in and when

1517
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:29,380
you get a nose job and you're supposed 
to have a big nose,

1518
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,350
people look at you like,
what the fuck is going on?

1519
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,410
What if you have like a Persian face,
like a,

1520
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,560
you know,
a big,

1521
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:36,394
robust Persian face.
But you have this little fucking Pixie 

1522
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:43,840
Irish knows people like what the fuck is
going on with her face?

1523
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:45,010
This is crazy.

1524
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,053
But Joe,
there's so many people that have worked 

1525
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,300
on that you'd like,
we all know bad plastic surgery,

1526
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:55,690
but there's some that so good and we 
think of these people as being born that

1527
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,840
way mean there's dinner.
Yes.

1528
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:00,220
Yes.
That's a perfect one.

1529
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,600
I mean,
girls always bring her up,

1530
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,050
let it out later that she was a monster.
She's a monster now.

1531
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:08,290
She's gorgeous.
I mean there's some stuff that works,

1532
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,273
but you're so right.
Like I want to talk to you about 

1533
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:13,660
psychedelics because when did you first 
do them?

1534
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,640
Most 30 when you were 30.

1535
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,010
I think I was a little younger.
No?

1536
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,110
Yeah,
yeah.

1537
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:20,944
When I was 13 I started smoking pot and 
then a psychedelics dogs came after 

1538
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:24,480
that.

1539
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,390
And did you.
I mean obviously that,

1540
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,343
that was before the time when people 
thought psychedelics were a way to like 

1541
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:32,663
heal yourself.
Like I feel like this is kind of like a 

1542
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:37,430
new movement,
that psychedelics are the answer.

1543
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,413
You're around the right people.
Back then you would get that 

1544
01:10:40,171 --> 01:10:40,780
information.

1545
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,150
Were you around the right people?
Is that how you got introduced to them?

1546
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:43,770
Yeah.

1547
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:44,603
Yeah.
I was around a lot of it because of the 

1548
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:51,930
fact that I was a comedian.
And then also because of the fact that,

1549
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,370
um,
you know,

1550
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,220
I was relatively famous back then,
not,

1551
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,000
not famous famous,
but like pee.

1552
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,380
I was,
I was on television.

1553
01:11:01,381 --> 01:11:06,381
I've done some things so people would 
want to like turn you onto things,

1554
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,170
you know,
like,

1555
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,470
you know,
and I would go to parties or meet people

1556
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,540
and they would,
you know,

1557
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,151
say,
hey man,

1558
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:13,350
have you ever done mushrooms?
Know.

1559
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:13,530
And,
uh,

1560
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,090
hey man,
you ever heard of DMT?

1561
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:15,924
And the like.
And then there's a few different things 

1562
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:21,030
that would happen and you'd be around 
these people who had gone to jail for it

1563
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:24,510
or you know,
that we're like real psychedelic heads.

1564
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,840
And once I was around a few of those,
I realized like,

1565
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,000
well,
there's a whole nother world out there.

1566
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,983
And then I discovered Timothy leary and 
John Lilly and this flotation tank 

1567
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,250
became a giant part of my life.
And then,

1568
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,240
um,
you know,

1569
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:44,270
Terence Mckenna and Dennis Mckenna and 
all the various psychedelic wizards that

1570
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:48,570
are out there that I've been sort of 
expressing that there's,

1571
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,830
there's a whole world out there that 
you're not seeing.

1572
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,943
It's like we're living life inside this 
very strange tent is a very thin 

1573
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,670
membrane tent.
And if you just unzip that tent and step

1574
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:03,504
out,
the entire wilderness of the universe 

1575
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:05,784
exists.
But most people live their life inside 

1576
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,024
this very thin walled tent.
And they think that that tent sort of 

1577
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:14,980
defines the actual universe itself when 
it's,

1578
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:15,814
it's so small and so limited.
Is there a chance that you opened that 

1579
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:21,054
tent and you don't like what you see and
now you've fucked your whole life up 

1580
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:24,054
because I think that's most people's 
apprehension about shure specifically 

1581
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,250
come back.

1582
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,230
Yes,
we'll sit bear it.

1583
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,093
You know,
there's been a lot of people that were 

1584
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:34,710
um,
I mean,

1585
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:35,563
uh,
I have friends that know friends that 

1586
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,673
will.
The issue is with psychosis and people 

1587
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:41,994
that have schizophrenia,
people that have legitimate mental 

1588
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,740
illness,
mental health issues.

1589
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:50,460
And they did the argument is correlation
or causation.

1590
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:51,570
Right?
And the argument is,

1591
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:56,630
does the psychedelic drugs caused mental
illness or do a certain amount of people

1592
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:58,554
already have mental illness?
And I think it's much more likely that 

1593
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:06,390
the percentage of people that are 
schizophrenia remained static.

1594
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,450
Because if you,
if you look at it like this,

1595
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,490
the number of people who smoke 
marijuana,

1596
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,473
who are also schizophrenia mirrors the 
number of people or schizophrenia 

1597
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,003
period.
So it's not that marijuana causes 

1598
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,610
schizophrenia,
so it's a one out of 100 or whatever the

1599
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,800
number is.
They just have this issue,

1600
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,540
this,
this.

1601
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,900
And for those people it's critical that 
they avoid psychedelic drugs,

1602
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:32,901
that they avoid marijuana and probably 
even alcohol or many even maybe bunch of

1603
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:35,730
other psychotropic drugs as well because
it could.

1604
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,713
You've got an imbalance.
Just like someone who has a liver 

1605
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:39,564
disease has an imbalance,
just like someone who has a lung 

1606
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:43,554
disorder can breathe well,
someone assisting fibrosis or someone 

1607
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:46,854
who has any number of diseases.
You've got to kind of think of it that 

1608
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:51,450
way.
There's an ailment of the mind.

1609
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,450
And so if you add this unknown element 
to that ailment,

1610
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:56,940
like five grams of dried mushrooms,
like,

1611
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:58,770
whoa,
who the fuck knows what could happen?

1612
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:02,040
You might never come back.
And then there's the question.

1613
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:02,874
The other part of your question is,
is it possible you could open that tent 

1614
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:07,440
and not like what you see and fuck up 
your life?

1615
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,420
Yes,
yes.

1616
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:12,250
Even if you don't have or a mental

1617
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,413
disorder,
you might have a view of the world 

1618
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:16,174
that's untenable with the experience 
that you have under the influence of 

1619
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,300
psychedelics,
but that might be the.

1620
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:23,143
Your view of the world is bullshit and 
you've been living your life with this 

1621
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:29,770
fucking Norman Rockwell nonsense 
floating around your head because you've

1622
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:30,604
been so influenced by media,
by songs and by television shows and 

1623
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:35,141
buy,
you know,

1624
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:38,440
I want to live like the kids on friends,
they don't even live like that.

1625
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,630
Look at them.
They're all fucked up.

1626
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:41,560
Now,
you know,

1627
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,530
for the most part,
Jennifer Aniston seems to be not aging.

1628
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,500
That's pitches is insane.
That's my girl.

1629
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:49,480
I want to be around her.
I want to find out what she's doing.

1630
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,750
What kind of cream are you using?
Cream.

1631
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,010
It's lasers.
Whatever the fuck she's doing.

1632
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:56,230
It's amazing.
One hundred and 50 years old.

1633
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:57,064
She looks like she's 12.

1634
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,683
It's incredible.
You would feel bad if you had sex with 

1635
01:15:00,951 --> 01:15:01,784
it.
Like you're having sex with an 18 year 

1636
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:04,000
old.
She looks amazing.

1637
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,760
She literally hasn't really done Matthew
Perry.

1638
01:15:06,761 --> 01:15:07,594
Looks like he's been to hell and back 
like that motherfucker went head first 

1639
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:15,700
into a sand storm and he got his face 
ripped off.

1640
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:19,600
Like he's been just doing math every day
and smoking cigarettes.

1641
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,823
One lighting the other from the time 
he's awake until the time he goes to 

1642
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,144
sleep.
He looks like total dog shit and she 

1643
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:32,370
looks fucking amazing.
I know they were.

1644
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,960
They worked together.
They were both young together.

1645
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:38,140
Shared some skin care.
A fuck.

1646
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,710
How the fuck.
I mean that is like a perfect example.

1647
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:44,620
It is a perfect example.
Even she can't keep it together.

1648
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:45,454
Right?
She's on like some new marriage and I 

1649
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:51,050
got divorced and it's like there's this 
chaos to this business and this what you

1650
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,160
were talking about,
like the,

1651
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,053
like I've talked about this many times 
in the podcast at this business is nuts 

1652
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:59,110
because it takes people that are 
insecure already and then puts them in a

1653
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:01,090
position where they have to get chosen 
for things.

1654
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:04,780
So you have to audition and people have 
to decide whether they like you next.

1655
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,663
Nikki.
Hm.

1656
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,060
Hm.
Okay.

1657
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:10,450
Nikki.
So a central show.

1658
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:13,450
He had a comedy central show that uh,
didn't work out.

1659
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,590
It just,
you know,

1660
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,910
there was an internal thing.
It wasn't any good.

1661
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,010
You were on dancing with the stars for a
hot minute.

1662
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah.
Again,

1663
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:23,950
that was just like,
there were just,

1664
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:25,690
I'm.
That guy was really mean to you.

1665
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,903
What was that all about?
I think I've reminded him of a 

1666
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:33,040
granddaughter who has called him in the 
judges that are such assholes.

1667
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,903
Anyway,
so you're reading for Amy and amy is an 

1668
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:44,290
anorexic standup comedian who likes to 
drink and blackout.

1669
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,393
So,
uh,

1670
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,970
right up your alley.
So here we go.

1671
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:51,170
And so,
and then you do it and go,

1672
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:53,030
okay,
well thanks a lot Niki.

1673
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,280
Good job.
Uh,

1674
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:57,920
okay.
And so you'll call me.

1675
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,290
Yeah,
no,

1676
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:00,440
you'll

1677
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,273
kind of just watched the show that 
you're auditioning for and see someone 

1678
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:04,700
else in the role and that's how you'll 
know,

1679
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,960
scream.
So you.

1680
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:10,160
And

1681
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,880
then you walk out feeling like a hundred
percent dog shit.

1682
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:14,983
Like you're from the top of your head to
the bottom of your toes is just dog 

1683
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,224
shit.
And we do this stuff and you got people 

1684
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:26,350
commenting on it and tweeting at you and
saying mean.

1685
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,233
It's like you're right.
It's like I'm in this business because 

1686
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:32,780
I'm insecure and I want people to 
strangers to love me.

1687
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,570
And then I don't even accept the love 
that they give.

1688
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,400
I don't care about the tweets that are 
nice.

1689
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,750
I reject those and I think you're crazy.
And then I think,

1690
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:44,563
which I don't read comments or anything 
like I've been really good about like 

1691
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:47,263
self care of that's not ever going to 
bring me joy is going through the 

1692
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:52,500
comments of a youtube video.
But um,

1693
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,570
but still mean things get through and 
yeah,

1694
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:56,404
you're right,
like I am a really strong person to be 

1695
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:03,890
where I am in this business and have 
gotten as far as I've got,

1696
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:09,620
but it breaks me at times still and I'm 
scared and I'm spent.

1697
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,620
I'm so excited to do psychedelics.
Are you kidding me?

1698
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,753
I,
I'm,

1699
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:18,060
I'm excited.
Like I.

1700
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,220
Well I want to do it with a shaman if 
you're available,

1701
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,803
but I wanted to,
I want to do it in like a really 

1702
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:29,060
controlled way because I do think it's 
the next frontier for me in terms of,

1703
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,520
because I'm done with therapy talk 
therapy.

1704
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:33,260
I'm like,
this is too slow of a process.

1705
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,113
I did mushrooms once but it was not a 
good experience because it wasn't bad 

1706
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:42,260
setting a very small amount and not 
enough to really have a good trip.

1707
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,510
Even though it was a small amount of 
still a bad experience.

1708
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,390
It was just bad because I was hanging 
out with two people that are coupled.

1709
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,333
That got into a fight while I was with 
them and they kicked me out onto the 

1710
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,210
street in New York City.
While they were on mushrooms,

1711
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,590
they don't want to fight on mushrooms.

1712
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,453
Yeah,
just got kind of tense hanging out with 

1713
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:57,554
them.
We were supposed to just like us three 

1714
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:02,180
chill on their roof and like look at the
skyline and just have a nice night.

1715
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:03,014
But then his girlfriend got sick.
They were in a weird kind of bickering 

1716
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:06,320
thing.
I was like,

1717
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,790
I'm going to go.
I left.

1718
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,610
I had been arrested the night before for
smoking weed on the street,

1719
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,880
so I'd spent six hours in a holding cell
the night before.

1720
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,160
But I had planned to do mushrooms the 
day after and the guy was like,

1721
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,740
you should still do and we'll celebrate 
you getting out of jail.

1722
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:19,940
And I was like,
okay.

1723
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,240
So I did mushrooms.
I was broke.

1724
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,040
I had just been arrested.
I,

1725
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,890
um,
and I was on the street and I remember I

1726
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:28,724
called my parents because I was,
I just felt like the way that smoking 

1727
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:34,310
weed is portrayed in movies where it's 
like,

1728
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,410
oh,
things coming at you.

1729
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,040
Like,
you know,

1730
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,720
that's the way I felt on mushrooms.
Like,

1731
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:39,554
I don't know if that's the normal way,
but like I felt like everyone was just 

1732
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:43,040
like in my face.
I called my mom and I go,

1733
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,320
mom,
I'm on mushrooms right now.

1734
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:46,154
I'm on the upper east side.
I'm just trying to get to my friend 

1735
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:48,080
Mike's House.
And she goes,

1736
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,123
who do you think you're talking to?
You don't call your mom and say you're 

1737
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:53,924
on much.
Like she was like for once in our life 

1738
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:56,810
she had boundaries.
If she goes,

1739
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,280
she goes,
talk to your father.

1740
01:19:58,281 --> 01:19:59,630
And so then I talked to my dad.
I was like,

1741
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:00,980
Oh,
I'm on most rooms that I don't know.

1742
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:01,814
And he kind of talked me down,
but I just went home and chugged a 

1743
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:05,360
bottle of wine because I was like,
I want to be.

1744
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:08,160
I want to feel something else other than
this because I felt too much.

1745
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,353
I felt a lot of love in that scared me.
But this was before I quit drinking a 

1746
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:14,670
lot of love.
And that scared you?

1747
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:15,653
Yeah,
I was like calling my friends being 

1748
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:18,180
like,
I love you,

1749
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,640
like it in a way that I'd never felt 
before,

1750
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:22,710
and I was like,
I don't like this feeling,

1751
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:23,731
chug,
chug,

1752
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:26,320
chug.
I don't know what.

1753
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:28,530
Maybe it's because you were alone.
I think it was.

1754
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:31,150
I was going through a lot of things that
was like I was,

1755
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:36,170
I think it was billy mic at that time.
This was not a good time in my life.

1756
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:42,200
I had to be doing psychedelics,
but now I think I,

1757
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,100
I've read enough about them and I'm 
like,

1758
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,710
you know,
there are soldiers who have ptsd that go

1759
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:51,711
through talk therapy for years and have 
no have minimal amounts of progress and,

1760
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,653
and,
and,

1761
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:57,480
and then they do one thing of dmt and 
they're like,

1762
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,060
I'm good.
Like there's something there.

1763
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:03,600
I can't wait for whatever that is.
I want to do IOWASCA.

1764
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:05,030
I want to do DMT,
I want to,

1765
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,050
I want to open up those doors.

1766
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,503
Great for soldiers to.
That's their maps is doing some really 

1767
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:15,680
serious trials right now with MDM may 
assisted therapy.

1768
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:19,550
So they're taking people with PTSD,
whether it's soldiers,

1769
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:20,623
victims of violence,
and they're taking them through a MTMA 

1770
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:28,340
assisted therapy and they're having some
pretty dramatic results.

1771
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,283
I think it is like the next big.
I'm so excited about it for certain 

1772
01:21:32,351 --> 01:21:33,920
people and myself.
Like I just

1773
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,020
done Mtma ecstasy.
No,

1774
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,343
I only did it once and the,
the rebound the next day was horrific 

1775
01:21:40,891 --> 01:21:43,590
for me.
That was one of the worst hangovers I've

1776
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:45,420
ever had.
Like it wasn't just a hangover,

1777
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:46,650
it was,
I was,

1778
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,980
I felt really stupid.
Like I couldn't read.

1779
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,073
Like I was trying to read a magazine the
next day I couldn't read and then I had 

1780
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:56,340
to perform that night and I kind of ate 
shit on stage and um,

1781
01:21:56,430 --> 01:22:01,050
but I'll never forget the lessons from 
the experience.

1782
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:01,884
It was very powerful,
like a really illuminated how much 

1783
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:06,804
insecurity hinders you and inhibits your
ability to communicate with people and 

1784
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:14,940
flavors,
how you interact with people.

1785
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:20,210
And how much of my own aggression and 
the way I would interact with people was

1786
01:22:21,331 --> 01:22:23,220
basically just me being scared.

1787
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:24,520
Like what?
What?

1788
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:27,700
I want to know what Joe Rogan was before
psychedelics,

1789
01:22:27,701 --> 01:22:30,280
like what are the things that you 
socially,

1790
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:32,650
the hurdles that you've overcome?
Well,

1791
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,420
what were you like?
What were the things that you're like,

1792
01:22:34,421 --> 01:22:36,010
oh my God,
I can't believe I was like that.

1793
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,360
I'm dying to know this.

1794
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:38,440
Well,
you know,

1795
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:39,274
when I was young I was super insecure.
My parents split up when I was really 

1796
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:45,130
young and then we moved around a lot so 
it didn't have like a base of friends.

1797
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,053
And then I found martial arts when I was
a young teenager and what martial arts 

1798
01:22:51,101 --> 01:22:56,101
did was it gave me something that I 
finally felt like I wasn't a loser at.

1799
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,770
It was like the first thing that I ever 
did where I was like,

1800
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:00,430
oh,
I,

1801
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,680
I'm good at something.
I can be really good at something.

1802
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:05,110
And I got good at it really quickly 
because I was obsessed.

1803
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,153
I was completely addicted and I was 
training every day and it became my 

1804
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:10,504
identity.
So my identity was that I was really 

1805
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:16,180
good at martial arts and so to be really
good at martial arts,

1806
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:18,760
especially in competition,
you have to be,

1807
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,773
you have to be very aggressive,
you have to be ruthless and you have to 

1808
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:28,051
be like,
you have to embrace this sort of the,

1809
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,613
there's,
there's an undeniable violence and 

1810
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,490
kicking someone in the head,
I mean it's very,

1811
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,270
it's very violent,
like martial arts competitions,

1812
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,113
extremely violent and you have to be 
able to embrace that and the embracing 

1813
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:43,030
of that and the terror and the fear of 
it all,

1814
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:47,200
just that it shaped my,
my developmental period.

1815
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,470
So like when I was 15,
16,

1816
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:51,161
17,
18,

1817
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:51,731
19,
20,

1818
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:52,900
21,
22,

1819
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:56,530
that was my whole life.
That was all I did until I started doing

1820
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,364
standup comedy.
So my entire form formative period was 

1821
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:05,410
based on violence.
It was all,

1822
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,910
it was all.
I mean it was,

1823
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,560
it was martial arts.
It was very controlled and well I wasn't

1824
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:15,160
like a bad person who is a beating 
people up or anything like that.

1825
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:19,840
But my,
I was ready to go all the time.

1826
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,973
Like it was all,
it was always any edit around any 

1827
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:24,274
corner.
That might be something the next person 

1828
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,513
might say the wrong thing and you might 
realize you're going to have to fight 

1829
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,940
them or whatever,
whatever it was,

1830
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:36,330
and that took a long time to let go.
That took a long time to like shake off.

1831
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,920
Are you easily angered?
Would you get into fights?

1832
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,200
No,
I didn't really get into.

1833
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,310
I was smart.
Like I will avoid fights.

1834
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,410
So you were 10,
you were anxious?

1835
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:46,330
Constantly.
Well,

1836
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,173
I,
my,

1837
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:50,180
my personality developed through 
violence.

1838
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:51,703
Me really develop through martial arts,
competition through from the time I was 

1839
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:57,530
15 to Thomas Twenty one I traveled the 
entire country.

1840
01:24:57,531 --> 01:24:59,360
It was all I did was fighting 
tournament's.

1841
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,580
I fought all the time.
I fought like,

1842
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,720
I don't know how many times.
Do you have girlfriends?

1843
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:07,280
Like I mean you were upset you were you 
really going to Olympic athlete?

1844
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:10,070
You were an elite elite athlete at 15.
Did you?

1845
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:10,923
What was your 15?
But by the time I was 17 I was boy when 

1846
01:25:14,061 --> 01:25:16,110
I was 18 I won the state championship.
Well,

1847
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:17,383
to get to that point is my social life 
and elite was going to say it had to 

1848
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:24,530
have just been know it was,
it was awkward and weird.

1849
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,543
You know,
you like with girls and stuff early on 

1850
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:28,910
were you.
Did you do okay.

1851
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,530
All right.
I mean,

1852
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:31,760
you know,
high school,

1853
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:32,594
I had girlfriends in high school and 
then there was a dry period after high 

1854
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:36,764
school for sure,
and then once I started doing standup 

1855
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,380
comedy then then it was easy and there's
a wet period.

1856
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,520
Then it was crazy that it's like,
whoa.

1857
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,300
It's like,
that is nuts.

1858
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,380
But yeah,
my,

1859
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,273
my life was all about competing and 
being at a gym so there wasn't like a 

1860
01:25:53,121 --> 01:25:56,870
lot of time to meet people.
It was all very strange.

1861
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:57,963
But there's this getting over that,
that hurt the hurdle of that bizarre 

1862
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,400
childhood.
Was there a moment

1863
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,220
though when you came out of a trip or 
what?

1864
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,093
Was there a,
like a nugget that you took where you 

1865
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:09,621
were like,
oh,

1866
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:10,454
this is bullshit.
Was there a certain trip that you like 

1867
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,123
look to and you're like,
I emerged a different person and what 

1868
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:15,340
does that,

1869
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,173
one of them,
one of them highlighted unnecessary 

1870
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,160
tension.
Highlighted.

1871
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,083
What was the last one?
What did you learn in the last trip you 

1872
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,184
had?

1873
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:30,290
The last one I had was basically,
it was almost a reef,

1874
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:35,430
a reaffirmation more than anything.
It was,

1875
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,451
it was like,
oh,

1876
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:37,284
I remember this.
Like I hadn't done it in about a year 

1877
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,700
and a half to two years.
And then,

1878
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:42,750
uh,
we all,

1879
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:43,733
we did dmt three or four times.
We did like a a trip and then we went 

1880
01:26:48,421 --> 01:26:49,980
back in,
went back in again.

1881
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,480
I can't remember his three or four 
times,

1882
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:55,350
but it was.
It just made me realize like,

1883
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,940
oh yeah,
okay,

1884
01:26:56,941 --> 01:26:57,774
this.
This is just the though the world that 

1885
01:26:59,701 --> 01:27:04,701
you're living in is like a thin veneer 
over this gigantic,

1886
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:06,923
impossible realm of souls of love and 
expectation and and understanding and 

1887
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:19,560
information and that that's what the 
universe is made of and that you're sort

1888
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:23,160
of trapped in this very strange,
rudimentary,

1889
01:27:23,161 --> 01:27:27,390
tactile existence where you can pick 
things up and put them on scales and you

1890
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:30,390
can measure things with a ruler,
but the rest of the universe is not made

1891
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:31,224
of that stuff.

1892
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,720
The rest of the universe is made out of 
ideas.

1893
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:38,030
The rest of the universe is made out of 
thoughts and there's dimensions that you

1894
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:42,210
you can't travel to with your feet and 
with a car,

1895
01:27:42,211 --> 01:27:45,420
with a plane,
like there's portals that you go through

1896
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:46,254
and these portals of chemical portals 
and your brain literally is wired for 

1897
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:51,150
these.
Not only that,

1898
01:27:51,151 --> 01:27:51,984
your brain produces dimethyltryptamine,
which is the most potent of all 

1899
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:55,434
psychedelics.
It's literally made by the human body 

1900
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,610
and it's,
it's everywhere.

1901
01:27:59,611 --> 01:28:02,670
It's in all sorts of plants,
thousands of plants.

1902
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,103
It's in every animal.
It's like all these different creatures 

1903
01:28:06,331 --> 01:28:08,010
create it.
They have it.

1904
01:28:08,011 --> 01:28:09,440
I mean,
in Europe.

1905
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,750
It's actually made by your third eye 
there.

1906
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,480
Pretty sure you know,
there's,

1907
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:17,490
um,
there's a group out of New Mexico called

1908
01:28:17,491 --> 01:28:18,324
the Cottonwood Research Foundation,
and they're doing these tests on all 

1909
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:24,804
sorts of tests to find out the source of
DMT and they've isolated in the pineal 

1910
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:33,930
gland of rats and this is the first time
they've ever shown it in a live rat that

1911
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:35,640
it exists in the pineal gland.

1912
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,740
The pineal gland is literally your third
eye,

1913
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,350
like that thing from eastern mysticism 
like this right here,

1914
01:28:40,351 --> 01:28:44,820
this little audio here and reptiles,
that actually is a retina in the lens.

1915
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,440
It's a,
it's an eyeball,

1916
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:51,000
and this is in the Egyptian would call 
it the seed of the soul.

1917
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,073
And this one spot in your head is 
producing the most potent psychedelic 

1918
01:28:56,521 --> 01:29:00,300
chemical known to man as well as it's 
produced by your liver and your lungs,

1919
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:02,370
like your body's psychedelic chemical 
factory.

1920
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:06,120
And this one psychedelic chemicals,
they believe,

1921
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:07,043
and there's been some recent research,
there was a recent paper that was put 

1922
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:13,470
out that showed that they think that 
during periods of extreme stress,

1923
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,573
like would periods if your body body's 
convinced that you might be dying or 

1924
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:17,994
that there's something happening that 
you may be releasing this psychedelic 

1925
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:22,014
chemical,
so it might be the portal to the 

1926
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:24,534
afterlife,
like it might be the way that carries 

1927
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,223
your consciousness through to the next 
dimension when your body passes for 

1928
01:29:32,411 --> 01:29:33,244
this,

1929
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,070
when you're in distress,
because it feels like it's getting ready

1930
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:37,100
to watch your,
your mom.

1931
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,080
But yeah,
your body's like,

1932
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:39,490
this might be it,
this might be it.

1933
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,510
Here we go.
Let's.

1934
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:43,120
They think that's the source of near 
death experiences.

1935
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:43,954
When people have these phenomenal loving
experiences where they crossover to the 

1936
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:48,424
other side,
then they come back and they think that 

1937
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:51,350
this.
And you know when,

1938
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,213
the way the way people describe it,
that's another issue with psychedelic 

1939
01:29:54,641 --> 01:29:55,870
drugs.
It's impossible.

1940
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,340
Describe.
So when you describe it,

1941
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,620
it's so crude,
like the words,

1942
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,150
the way I've described it,
as I say,

1943
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:01,984
it's you.
You enter into another dimension filled 

1944
01:30:04,061 --> 01:30:04,894
with complex geometric patterns that are
made out of love and understanding that 

1945
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,780
that's what it takes,
but it's still.

1946
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:12,580
It's a bunch of words.
It's like a nonsense thing to describe,

1947
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,000
but when you will,
you talked to these people that have had

1948
01:30:16,001 --> 01:30:19,540
near death experiences.
They all feel relieved in some sort of a

1949
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:20,374
strange way.

1950
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,240
They all feel like,
or a lot of them do.

1951
01:30:22,241 --> 01:30:26,230
I should say that when it does happen,
if it does happen,

1952
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,120
it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

1953
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:28,954
Like there's a thing that happens.
Then you go to this other place where 

1954
01:30:31,361 --> 01:30:33,070
there's.
There's no shoes,

1955
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,880
there's no tables,
there's no electricity in this house,

1956
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:36,903
but it's,
it's made out of whatever the fuck the 

1957
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,700
world's made out of.
It's made out of the,

1958
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:45,040
the whatever the universe actually has 
below the wiring.

1959
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:46,720
Like you lift up the circuit board and 
we're like,

1960
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:48,850
Whoa,
you peer behind the green curtain.

1961
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:50,590
So at this point for you,
when you,

1962
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,110
when you did it the last time,
it was almost like a tune up of like,

1963
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:54,093
oh yeah,
I remember now seen this before and I 

1964
01:30:57,191 --> 01:30:59,590
needed to be reminded.
But then how does that.

1965
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:04,060
Sorry if I'm asking questions that 
you've probably already answered,

1966
01:31:04,061 --> 01:31:08,440
but like how does the next week of your 
life after a trip of this,

1967
01:31:08,441 --> 01:31:10,720
like how do your,
does your decision making change?

1968
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:11,180
What happened?
It's up

1969
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:11,930
to you,
right?

1970
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:12,763
That's up to you.
It's up to everybody when everyone is 

1971
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:16,820
different.
I mean for me it's a,

1972
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:20,130
it was like a big deep breath and it's 
like,

1973
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:22,040
oh,
it's going to be okay.

1974
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:25,130
The last time I did like a real serious 
psychedelic trip.

1975
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:27,650
I've done a little bit of acid,
a little bit of mushrooms,

1976
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,903
but the last time that a serious one was
right before I've filmed triggered and 

1977
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:34,100
uh,
it's just,

1978
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:35,420
um,
it just,

1979
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,400
it just lets you know,
like,

1980
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:38,180
um,
you know,

1981
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:41,900
just just do your best to try to be nice
and this is nonsense.

1982
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,960
This whole thing is nonsense.
You know,

1983
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:46,490
don't concentrate on the fact that in 20
years,

1984
01:31:46,491 --> 01:31:48,890
no one's going to want to fuck you,
or you know that your,

1985
01:31:48,891 --> 01:31:49,724
your,
your tits gonna fall off or just you're 

1986
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:52,540
alive right now.
You're,

1987
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,383
you are existing right now in the one of
the craziest experiences that the world 

1988
01:31:58,611 --> 01:32:03,611
has ever being a human being in 2018 in 
the United States of America.

1989
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,970
I mean this is a fucking bizarre 
pathway.

1990
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:09,010
You're on.
All of us,

1991
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:12,010
every single person listening to this,
if you can listen to this podcast,

1992
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,100
you are in the rarest moment in human 
history.

1993
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:20,430
You are literally at the cost,
the very peak of this insane merging,

1994
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:26,740
the same merging of technology,
of information,

1995
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:29,320
of understanding,
of expression,

1996
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,770
all the stuff that you see,
all the stuff that we're seeing going on

1997
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:33,604
right now socially,
whether it's the me too movement or 

1998
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:37,180
whether it is,
um,

1999
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:42,250
know social justice warriors and people 
who are woke and crying out,

2000
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:43,084
racist for listening.
All this bubbling up of our culture is 

2001
01:32:45,671 --> 01:32:48,720
all this recognition of this ability to 
communicate this,

2002
01:32:48,721 --> 01:32:49,554
this radical new ability to express your
ideas that is being done by some people 

2003
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:57,130
that are responsible.
Some people that are very responsible,

2004
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,340
but everyone gets a shot and it's just 
like youtube comments.

2005
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,800
It's fucking chaos.
You know,

2006
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:07,600
Clark culture is youtube comments.
They'll the world is youtube comments.

2007
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:12,750
Our interaction is this unique ability 
where anybody can express themselves and

2008
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:18,391
some people have larger signals like you
or like shift fear or like you know,

2009
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,220
fill in the blank.
Anybody who has a podcast,

2010
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:24,820
they have a larger signal and you know,
you have a youtube video that's a larger

2011
01:33:24,821 --> 01:33:27,070
signaling of a comedy central show 
that's a larger signal,

2012
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:28,023
but everyone has a signal and everyone's
fighting for relevance and everyone's 

2013
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:36,130
fighting for attention and acceptance 
and there they're fighting for their own

2014
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:36,964
significance.
They just want to exist and they're 

2015
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:39,394
yelling out and sometimes the yelling 
out like a baby and sometimes the 

2016
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:42,574
yelling out like a wise person on the 
mountain who has some new information 

2017
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:46,503
and it's all happening at the same time.
And it's all just and we're sorting it 

2018
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:53,530
out like in some things don't stick like
this whole,

2019
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:55,090
if you're having sex and you're 
drinking,

2020
01:33:55,091 --> 01:33:56,830
you're a rapist like that didn't stick.

2021
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:58,323
But some of them do stay.
Some of them you can't say retarded 

2022
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:01,690
anymore.
That one's sticking,

2023
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,500
right?
Like,

2024
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,333
and people are realizing there's certain
things that you can do and certain 

2025
01:34:05,411 --> 01:34:06,244
things you can't do.
Certain things we accept certain things 

2026
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:08,704
we can't accept anymore and we're 
figuring it out and we're figuring it 

2027
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:12,400
out in real time,
in a,

2028
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:13,234
at a radical pace that's never existed 
before in human history where something 

2029
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,793
that was acceptable just 10,
15 years ago is completely unacceptable 

2030
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:22,054
now that's.
There's never been a time like that 

2031
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:24,274
before.
Never been a time in the entire world 

2032
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:27,663
since people started talking.
There's never been a time where change 

2033
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:31,454
is taking place at such a radical pace 
and you're a part of it and I'm a part 

2034
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:36,880
of it and everyone is listening to this 
as a part of it.

2035
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:40,090
We're all together in this and no one 
knows where the fuck is going.

2036
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,063
I love that you're.
You're saying that the reason all this 

2037
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,630
is happening right now is because we are
now,

2038
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,880
we're just communicating at a more rapid
pace.

2039
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:51,550
That's all it boils down to.
You're absolutely right.

2040
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,340
It's the communication revolution.

2041
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:55,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2042
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:56,650
And if so,
if someone says,

2043
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:57,820
you know,
hey,

2044
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,430
you,
what?

2045
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,660
Were you sad?
It doesn't make sense.

2046
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:00,310
Like,
yeah,

2047
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:01,143
yeah,
for sure.

2048
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,263
No one's going to get it right.
No one's going to get it right all the 

2049
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,760
time,
like no one does.

2050
01:35:04,761 --> 01:35:07,430
No,
I'm not an oracle fucking human.

2051
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:11,000
I was born in New Jersey.
No one's getting this right,

2052
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:14,940
but you are being held to that standard.
We all are now something.

2053
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,840
What's good?
There's good to that too.

2054
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:20,400
The good is you realize like when you're
responsible,

2055
01:35:20,401 --> 01:35:23,820
like if you make a mistake or you say 
something incorrect or you say something

2056
01:35:23,821 --> 01:35:25,110
mean,
they were just trying to be funny.

2057
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,190
It came out bad.
The,

2058
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,370
the blow back,
let's you know,

2059
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,353
this is how people feel about that and 
it's disproportionate because your 

2060
01:35:33,931 --> 01:35:35,480
signals disproportionate.
The,

2061
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,440
your ability to express yourself as 
disproportionate.

2062
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,870
So the blow back is going to be 
disproportion as well.

2063
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:44,340
So it feels awful,
but that's just an affirmation,

2064
01:35:44,341 --> 01:35:45,540
just letting you know,
okay,

2065
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:46,853
this is not what p and,
and sometimes people are completely 

2066
01:35:48,841 --> 01:35:49,830
wrong about like,
you know,

2067
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,950
white girls can't wear hoop earrings.
It's cultural appropriation.

2068
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,793
There's,
there's bad signals out there because a 

2069
01:35:55,081 --> 01:35:56,520
lot of bad signals,
you know,

2070
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:58,580
where you're racist if you wear a 
Kimono,

2071
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,200
just a of like really dumb bad signals.

2072
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:06,590
But there's also a lot of exchange and 
it'll all work itself out.

2073
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,650
We just have to be really careful.
We don't lynch a lot of people along the

2074
01:36:10,651 --> 01:36:11,484
way,
like the wood that we don't get 

2075
01:36:13,051 --> 01:36:13,884
convinced that our ideas are 100 percent
the way things should be and that we 

2076
01:36:18,991 --> 01:36:23,940
listened to all these various ideas,
whether it's ideas about trans people or

2077
01:36:23,941 --> 01:36:27,720
gay people or women or men or anybody,
you know,

2078
01:36:27,721 --> 01:36:28,554
like it's,
it's like it's super important now that 

2079
01:36:30,571 --> 01:36:31,404
people think before they act and that 
they think before they cast judgment 

2080
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:40,490
that we have to communicate because 
there's things are fucking flying at us.

2081
01:36:40,831 --> 01:36:43,530
Like fish coming down a river and trying
to catch them with your hands.

2082
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:44,880
And there's this too many of them.

2083
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:47,170
Do you,
I mean,

2084
01:36:47,171 --> 01:36:49,600
you're broadcasting every single day for
hours.

2085
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:51,550
Do you say things sometimes that come 
back?

2086
01:36:51,551 --> 01:36:52,384
I mean,
I know you say things that come back to 

2087
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,960
haunt you or you said this and that was 
wrong,

2088
01:36:55,961 --> 01:36:57,370
that you said that,
and this is why you're wrong.

2089
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,470
Do you,
do you ever catch yourself and go,

2090
01:36:59,471 --> 01:37:01,400
oh yeah,
I shouldn't have said that all time.

2091
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,260
What do you do with that?
That's of I made a mistake.

2092
01:37:05,261 --> 01:37:06,370
I,
I misspoke.

2093
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:07,151
Right?
But not.

2094
01:37:07,151 --> 01:37:09,880
This was not an oracle.

2095
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,940
If you keep talking,
people go,

2096
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:12,750
oh,
I get it.

2097
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:13,583
Nikki's just the person that says things
sometimes what you don't mean to say 

2098
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:19,860
dumb things,
but you're like being a human being.

2099
01:37:19,861 --> 01:37:20,694
It's just a flawed exercise.
Like we're super flawed and we're 

2100
01:37:23,731 --> 01:37:24,564
working with language,
which is like a really awkward way to 

2101
01:37:27,721 --> 01:37:30,070
express intent.
You know,

2102
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:33,090
it's awkward.
This is sometimes the right.

2103
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:34,303
Yeah.
Sometimes the right word is not there 

2104
01:37:35,251 --> 01:37:37,670
for you and you use a lot of likes and 
um,

2105
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,720
so it's like,
um,

2106
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,220
like a,
like a and people like,

2107
01:37:41,221 --> 01:37:43,050
like what?
People are listening,

2108
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:44,610
they're on the fucking stair climber and
they'll go,

2109
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:46,590
you shut the fuck up,
you talk too much,

2110
01:37:46,591 --> 01:37:47,424
you complain too much,
and you know their signal like they're 

2111
01:37:49,621 --> 01:37:50,454
mad that they don't have a signal,
so they're fucking screaming at you for 

2112
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:54,810
your flawed signal.
Do you have a responsibility?

2113
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:56,220
You know,
there's a lot going

2114
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,450
on.
There's a lot going on.

2115
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:02,480
There is and yeah,
I mean I have,

2116
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:03,683
I have a radio show every day that I do 
and I do podcast and even sitting here 

2117
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:08,421
now I'm like,
oh,

2118
01:38:08,421 --> 01:38:09,254
what am I going to regret saying?
And I've just gotten to a point where 

2119
01:38:10,941 --> 01:38:11,774
it's like,
I will apologize if I say something 

2120
01:38:12,621 --> 01:38:16,010
stupid and wrong and offend someone and 
I really feel bad about it,

2121
01:38:16,011 --> 01:38:21,011
but like I have to lead from a place of 
guidance at this point in my life.

2122
01:38:21,051 --> 01:38:24,140
I know I'm a good person.
I don't think I'm a secret psychopath,

2123
01:38:24,141 --> 01:38:25,430
which I think a lot of us are always 
like,

2124
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:27,770
am I a bad person?
Deep down,

2125
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:29,143
do you ever have that fee?
Did you use to have that feeling where 

2126
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:31,644
you're like,
people are going to figure out that I'm 

2127
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,670
a fucking psychopath?

2128
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:35,573
You know what?
I really wish that I was like Tony 

2129
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,860
Danza.
Tony Danza was always smiling and he was

2130
01:38:41,861 --> 01:38:43,300
always nice to people.
I was like,

2131
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:46,930
I want to kill everybody,
and Tony Danza is also nice and smiling.

2132
01:38:46,931 --> 01:38:47,764
I just want to fucking smash people and 
Tony Danza just seems like such a nice 

2133
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,131
guy.
Like God,

2134
01:38:51,131 --> 01:38:51,964
I wish I was like Tony Danza.
I used to think that when I was like 19 

2135
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:54,520
years old,

2136
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,790
I can tell.
I totally relate to that.

2137
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:57,624
I see people and I go,
why can't I just be like her and just 

2138
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,170
smiling,
smiling and say funny,

2139
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,073
nice things that don't offend anyone but
also everyone likes what you say and it 

2140
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:11,160
still gets people jazzed up,
but you're not offending anyone.

2141
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,600
It doesn't feel good to offend people.
And I say things all the time that do,

2142
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:18,270
and I'm not going to stop because I 
just,

2143
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:19,343
I can't,

2144
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:22,970
but you're offending people but also 
making a large amount laugh.

2145
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:23,943
Know the problem is the.
If you have 100 people in the room and 

2146
01:39:26,031 --> 01:39:29,630
10 of them get offended,
90 of them are fucking slap in the table

2147
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:31,420
and laughing their ass off.
That's.

2148
01:39:31,421 --> 01:39:34,010
You got to accept that.
That's just part of the game.

2149
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:35,660
That's part of the game.
You and I play.

2150
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:36,643
We play a strange game.
We're in one of the weirdest businesses 

2151
01:39:38,631 --> 01:39:40,360
ever.
We're in the business of talking shit.

2152
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:41,593
We're shit.

2153
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,140
I love it.
I love talking shop and I can't stop.

2154
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:47,400
Right.
Do you get,

2155
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,500
do you get in trouble talking shit like 
di Di do you feel?

2156
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:54,600
Because I feel like sometimes when I 
talk shit about people,

2157
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:56,970
it's obviously I'm just,
I'm talking about myself and I'm,

2158
01:39:56,971 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm just projecting like,
oh she's,

2159
01:39:59,090 --> 01:39:59,923
you know what?
I'm really talking shit backstage where 

2160
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:04,380
I don't think anyone will ever tell this
to anyone.

2161
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:05,710
Right.
It's not a,

2162
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:09,150
it's supposed to be like not a good 
thing to do is talk shit.

2163
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,820
Like that's not healthy for hands on,
but I love it.

2164
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,530
It's fun.
It's a hobby.

2165
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,340
It's fun.

2166
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:17,460
You're making fun of things.
You're making fun of things and it makes

2167
01:40:17,461 --> 01:40:18,294
sense.
If you're talking shit and it doesn't 

2168
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:21,630
make any sense and no one wants to talk 
shit with you,

2169
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:24,310
but if you go to Nicky and Nicky said 
some hilarious,

2170
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:29,470
that's all your soldier,
that's fun and when you see both,

2171
01:40:29,471 --> 01:40:30,304
hate someone together and you could just
send each other snap screenshots of 

2172
01:40:33,491 --> 01:40:34,324
their instagram and be like,
look how sad this bitches when really 

2173
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:39,130
I'm just seeing myself in her

2174
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:44,090
sometimes when you're saying oftentimes 
what you absolutely hope you never are,

2175
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,033
yes,
but that you fear that you are and you 

2176
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:48,500
think you might be.
So it's,

2177
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,353
it's,
it's me hating a tiny piece of myself 

2178
01:40:51,071 --> 01:40:51,904
that I'm trying so hard to keep it at 
bay will be parent or sad or you're 

2179
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:57,400
hating me.

2180
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,080
Human behavior.
That's flawed.

2181
01:40:59,140 --> 01:40:59,973
That's where you're heading.

2182
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,823
Yeah,
because I don't want to be flawed and 

2183
01:41:01,761 --> 01:41:05,030
I'm secretly feeling flawed because I am
flawed because we all are,

2184
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,300
but it's part of.
It's a way to

2185
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,310
forest that.
You'll never going to do that again,

2186
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:11,850
but talking shit about people that are 
doing

2187
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:15,100
hold yourself accountable because then 
you can't talk shit if you do it.

2188
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:17,500
So it keeps you in check.
That's a really good point.

2189
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,800
So it's good to do.
Yeah.

2190
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:23,840
There's some group text messages.
I know you mean my God,

2191
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:26,383
where are you only talk about one person
in that we only go to that mass text to 

2192
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:32,950
talk shit about that one person.
Oh,

2193
01:41:32,951 --> 01:41:33,784
have you ever talked.
Have you ever sent a text to someone 

2194
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:38,710
that you were talking shit like shit 
about the person?

2195
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,560
No,
but it happens.

2196
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:43,870
There are stories of people sending.
Like this one girl the other day told me

2197
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:45,160
like in a makeup chair,
she was like,

2198
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:48,280
oh,
I want sent someone a text about someone

2199
01:41:48,281 --> 01:41:49,720
at work that we are currently working 
with.

2200
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:53,860
That was like Buffalo.
Buffalo is a fat piece of shit today.

2201
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:55,203
Kimberly.
She would wear that dress like that 

2202
01:41:56,621 --> 01:42:00,970
specific to her and she was working with
her and had to work with her the rest of

2203
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:01,804
the day.

2204
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:06,050
It happens all the time.
It happens all the time.

2205
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,000
Just slipped up,
send it to the wrong person.

2206
01:42:08,001 --> 01:42:08,860
Is telling you,
Joe,

2207
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:13,480
be careful because we're all capable of 
when you write that name,

2208
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,360
when you're writing a name and a text,
it's so easy to just.

2209
01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:19,870
That person is probably in your phone 
too to send it to them.

2210
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:22,060
It's totally possible.
But yeah,

2211
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:23,380
I,
I love talking to you.

2212
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:26,320
I think that is a thing comics have in 
common and you know,

2213
01:42:26,321 --> 01:42:30,700
when I extend making fun of things that 
I'm getting shit talked about me because

2214
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:32,770
it has to happen.
If I'm talking to this much shit,

2215
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,740
people are talking shit about me and I 
accept it and it's fine.

2216
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:37,900
I don't want to ever know.
I hate when people go,

2217
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:38,590
Oh,
you know what?

2218
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:40,540
Someone was talking about you and why 
would you tell me that?

2219
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:42,150
Be Nice.
Well,

2220
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,800
if you overhear something,
keep that in that thing.

2221
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:45,590
Well,
unless

2222
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:46,423
person's like a really good friend and 
then you find out that they're 

2223
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:50,270
backstabbing you.
You want to know that?

2224
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:51,390
Yeah,
yeah,

2225
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:52,303
yeah,
yeah,

2226
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:53,170
yeah.

2227
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:55,060
They're saying things to a guy you're 
dating.

2228
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,710
Oh yeah.
Oh,

2229
01:42:56,711 --> 01:42:59,920
if that.
Oh God,

2230
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,880
that's the dirtiest of dirty.
When you find out for a guy,

2231
01:43:02,881 --> 01:43:06,930
when you find out that a friend of yours
is talking shit about you to a girl,

2232
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:07,764
you're dating.

2233
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,420
Oh,
and that happens a lot because guys that

2234
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:14,470
I've had that happen to me with guys 
where it's like,

2235
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:15,430
watch out for this guy.
I'm like,

2236
01:43:15,431 --> 01:43:17,890
aren't you best friends?
That's a dirty man.

2237
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,090
That's a good person.
Yeah.

2238
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,510
Yeah.
Me and my friends,

2239
01:43:20,511 --> 01:43:23,500
we have a very strict policy of what we 
call jihadi,

2240
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,823
which means like if you're around a girl
that the guy likes you blow him up to 

2241
01:43:29,601 --> 01:43:30,171
her,
say,

2242
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:31,850
oh,
he's the best guys.

2243
01:43:31,851 --> 01:43:33,030
Awesome.
I love that guy.

2244
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,730
As long as he is.
And if he's not,

2245
01:43:34,731 --> 01:43:35,780
it shouldn't be friends with them 
anyway,

2246
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,780
but as long as he is,
you let him know,

2247
01:43:38,781 --> 01:43:39,614
like,
you know,

2248
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,830
fill in the blank.
Mike is just a fucking phenomenal guy.

2249
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,440
He's,
he's such a good dude all the time.

2250
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,620
Like he loves you too.
Says great things about it.

2251
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,280
I'm already into this guy that you're 
talking about in this example.

2252
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,113
I'm like,
yes.

2253
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:53,990
I'm like,
dude,

2254
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,420
when I was around,
you know,

2255
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:56,121
whatever,
shelly.

2256
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:57,010
I was like,
boom,

2257
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:02,080
I blew out my friend Eddie Bravo came up
with that term because I would do that.

2258
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:04,881
He goes,
dude,

2259
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:08,050
you totally jihad at me for that girl.
That's what we're doing.

2260
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,030
You just blow you up.
Let everybody know.

2261
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:11,570
Knows guy's awesome.
He's the best.

2262
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,210
I do that a lot.
It feels good too.

2263
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:15,830
It feels the opposite of talking shit

2264
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:16,860
if you're not lying.
Yeah.

2265
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,380
It makes us more in that line as long as
you're not lying.

2266
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,450
I love that.
Yeah,

2267
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:22,400
but,

2268
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,390
but it's hard.
You know,

2269
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,300
the,
the petty instinct is to talk shit.

2270
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,373
That's the petty instincts.
Some people deserve it and some people 

2271
01:44:29,691 --> 01:44:30,300
don't.
You know,

2272
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:31,730
it's,
there's different motivations,

2273
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:33,230
right?
Like sometimes you talk and shit because

2274
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:36,620
you're really jealous of someone.
You're jealous of their effort,

2275
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,990
their work ethic,
their success,

2276
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,310
the way they look.
What a,

2277
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:41,144
what,
fill in the blank.

2278
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,240
You're jealous of something about them.
That's generally for me,

2279
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,690
root of that.
If I'm going to be honest,

2280
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,760
I,
I recently got busted talking shit about

2281
01:44:48,761 --> 01:44:49,594
someone and I told and she,
it got back to me from another friend 

2282
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:54,400
and I wrote their own,
I go,

2283
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:55,263
I'm jealous of you.
You're cool and you're who I want to be 

2284
01:44:57,911 --> 01:44:58,744
and I want to be friends with you and 
you didn't seem to want to be friends 

2285
01:45:00,431 --> 01:45:01,264
with me.
So I decided I hated you and that you 

2286
01:45:02,741 --> 01:45:03,574
weren't to be trusted.
And I told people that and it wasn't 

2287
01:45:04,991 --> 01:45:06,670
true.
It completely wasn't true.

2288
01:45:06,671 --> 01:45:07,504
As threatened by you and you're hot and 
I don't like that you exist in the same 

2289
01:45:10,361 --> 01:45:12,790
business as me and it makes me jealous.
And what did she say?

2290
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,100
And she said,
I totally get that.

2291
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,860
And I,
at first she goes,

2292
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,020
at first she just thumbs down my 
apology,

2293
01:45:20,021 --> 01:45:20,854
which I loved.

2294
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:22,450
And then I was like,
we're going to be good.

2295
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:24,360
But I,
I love good.

2296
01:45:24,370 --> 01:45:25,810
I love apologizing.
I love,

2297
01:45:25,811 --> 01:45:30,400
like admitting when I've been jealous or
petty and I will continue to do so.

2298
01:45:30,401 --> 01:45:33,670
But if I'm caught I'm just,
I can be.

2299
01:45:33,671 --> 01:45:34,504
So it got back to me that I said about 
this girl that she shouldn't be trusted 

2300
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:39,753
and I go,
I don't even know why I would say that 

2301
01:45:41,141 --> 01:45:41,974
about her.
I have no evidence to back that up 

2302
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,400
equals I was just petty and jealous in 
that moment.

2303
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:46,660
So I wrote her.
I was like,

2304
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:47,823
dude,
I don't know what was going through my 

2305
01:45:48,731 --> 01:45:50,170
mind that week.
But yeah,

2306
01:45:50,171 --> 01:45:51,580
I did say that about you because

2307
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:54,160
standard,
it's a standard instinct.

2308
01:45:54,161 --> 01:45:56,800
It's a standard emotion.
So common.

2309
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,991
Yeah.
And,

2310
01:45:57,991 --> 01:46:01,570
and,
and as a woman in this business,

2311
01:46:01,571 --> 01:46:04,720
like I just,
I support women's so much,

2312
01:46:04,721 --> 01:46:05,554
but I'm aware of every woman who is a 
who was doing the same thing I'm doing 

2313
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,310
in this book,
like I'm aware who are the up and comers

2314
01:46:12,311 --> 01:46:14,230
and I'd take them under my wing and I 
build them up.

2315
01:46:14,231 --> 01:46:15,064
But I'm like,
I'm aware of like there's a part of me 

2316
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:22,081
that's like crazy deep breath.
That was me seeing a headline of them on

2317
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:30,240
deadline.
He's just like,

2318
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:34,270
I know have a new show.
I know that it's good for all of us.

2319
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:37,410
We have a new show and it's in the slot 
that your show was in.

2320
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:39,043
You know what it is.
I literally have to unfollow girls 

2321
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:44,120
sometimes who I'm friends with who are 
in,

2322
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:44,983
who are comedians,
who are my peers and who I respect and 

2323
01:46:48,441 --> 01:46:49,274
think they're funny.
I have to unfollow them if I see that 

2324
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:51,864
they're just like,
I'm working a lot right now and they're 

2325
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:55,104
putting it out there that they're like 
really busy with work and I just got 

2326
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:58,074
kicked off dancing with the stars.
I have to unfollow them because I start 

2327
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:03,084
to feel sad about myself and I would 
rather just remove that from my feed 

2328
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,140
then and then it's a really awkward 
follow when I know that or they messaged

2329
01:47:10,141 --> 01:47:12,630
me on one of those things and they see 
I'm not following them because it's like

2330
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,763
we all know we follow each other.
They know and sometimes I'll just tell 

2331
01:47:16,171 --> 01:47:20,100
them I've unfollowed you because you,
you make me feel sad about my own career

2332
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:22,243
over that.
It's easier to just take them out of my 

2333
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:25,110
feed.
Yeah,

2334
01:47:25,111 --> 01:47:27,960
but that's a weird one.
I am looking to get over it.

2335
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,470
I am,
I am

2336
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:32,900
just just use it as informal as 
inspiration.

2337
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:34,850
Use them as fuel to work harder.

2338
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,870
Yeah,
I do.

2339
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:40,220
But I would also like to not see their 
tour dates scheduled.

2340
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:42,390
Crazy.
Crazy.

2341
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,720
That one go.
That's not a good one to accept.

2342
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,460
I don't think,
you know what I probably,

2343
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:50,120
I'm probably going to unfollow one.
All,

2344
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,023
all you guys with your,
with your workouts and your calorie 

2345
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:58,101
counts that you post mad shit.
But I'd even post the big one.

2346
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:02,580
I didn't triggering as fuck to people 
who are like,

2347
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,700
you know,
hate their bodies and stuff.

2348
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,610
It can be very triggering.
So like when I see girls,

2349
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:10,230
they're like,
I just ran a marathon.

2350
01:48:10,231 --> 01:48:11,880
I'm like unfollow,
I can't,

2351
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:14,640
I can't have you in my life bragging 
about this shit.

2352
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,773
Listen,
I go to the gym too and I don't tweet 

2353
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:18,640
about it.
I want to.

2354
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:20,303
I just so many calories but I don't 
tweet tweet about it because I don't 

2355
01:48:24,391 --> 01:48:26,190
want to trigger people and I don't want 
to be the.

2356
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,830
I don't want to be what I am so jealous 
of,

2357
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,173
but I should brag about it.
And I also liked that some people are 

2358
01:48:33,421 --> 01:48:34,770
like,
look at what I did at the gym.

2359
01:48:34,771 --> 01:48:36,240
Fuck you.
I'd worked today.

2360
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:38,280
And they're proud of themselves,
but I can't.

2361
01:48:38,281 --> 01:48:40,110
I can't see.
I get inspired.

2362
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:40,730
Okay.

2363
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:43,370
Do you know who I go to?
Like all the time for inspiration?

2364
01:48:43,371 --> 01:48:47,210
The Rock.
That motherfucker never stops.

2365
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,130
He never stops.
I mean,

2366
01:48:49,131 --> 01:48:51,770
I don't want to do what he's doing.
I don't want to do these movies.

2367
01:48:51,771 --> 01:48:52,604
I don't want to do what he's doing,
but that I fucking admire the shit out 

2368
01:48:54,651 --> 01:48:56,210
of that guy's work ethic.
That guy.

2369
01:48:56,211 --> 01:48:58,220
I'll fly to Tokyo,
it will be 4:00

2370
01:48:58,221 --> 01:48:59,940
in the morning.
He sets up an elliptical machine,

2371
01:48:59,941 --> 01:49:02,120
starts going after it.
That's what he does.

2372
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:04,620
And that doesn't make.
That doesn't put you in a place of like,

2373
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:05,770
I'm,
I'm never,

2374
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,600
I can't do that because you can.
But the thing is,

2375
01:49:07,601 --> 01:49:09,130
Joe Rogan,
you can do that.

2376
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:09,993
Look at that.
Look at all his food and he gets to do 

2377
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:13,510
that.
Oh God.

2378
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,673
He landed in London,
midnight ordered Sushi like a 

2379
01:49:16,601 --> 01:49:19,160
motherfucker go to.
Is His instagram with all of

2380
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:23,820
this is you are the Rock Joe.
You are the Rock,

2381
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:29,040
you do these workouts all the time and 
that's how you get that shirt.

2382
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:38,220
Rock.
I got to text x

2383
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,613
today from David Goggins and I told 
David Goggins I'm trying to beat 

2384
01:49:46,011 --> 01:49:47,710
everyone by double.
He's like,

2385
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:52,880
fucking kill it.
Like capital 100 exclamation points.

2386
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,980
That's what I'm saying.
Look at that dude focused.

2387
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:59,860
I see that I want to go work out right 
now.

2388
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:02,640
Are you insecure about anything right 
now in your life?

2389
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:04,380
Well,
people are always insecure,

2390
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,233
you know,
I mean there's not something that's 

2391
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:07,951
like,
well,

2392
01:50:07,951 --> 01:50:10,530
I'm always insecure about my act.
I'm always working on it,

2393
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:11,533
you know,
I'm always trying to pick it apart and 

2394
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:15,450
look at it like,
like someone who hates it.

2395
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:18,390
I'm always trying to like where's the 
flaws?

2396
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:19,283
You know?
And always trying.

2397
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:20,950
I heard you talking about that the other
day of like,

2398
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:23,800
now that you've done your specialists 
out and like watching it,

2399
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:26,590
now you come up with new tags.
Oh God

2400
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:28,000
always,
always.

2401
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:31,120
But that's so because you're always 
growing and learning and getting better.

2402
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:33,940
And I think comedy is like a living 
thing.

2403
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:37,060
It's like as a live you keep watering 
and it keeps growing,

2404
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,550
you know,
and sometimes you have to trim things to

2405
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:41,050
make it better.
Just like a Bush,

2406
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,460
you know,
Trim a little here,

2407
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:43,690
trimodal there,
it gets fuller,

2408
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:44,950
you know,
there's,

2409
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:47,810
but then also grows and gets bigger,
you know,

2410
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,470
but then you got to release it at a 
certain point in time.

2411
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:51,200
My,
my,

2412
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:54,220
my schedule seems to be two years,
it seems to be.

2413
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:55,054
I develop a full solid hour and a year 
and then I hammered that motherfucker 

2414
01:50:58,661 --> 01:50:59,494
like a Samurai sword for the next eight 
months and then I film it and then four 

2415
01:51:02,741 --> 01:51:04,780
months later it airs and then I start

2416
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:08,260
credit card ashy and bet in the new 
specialists in the last one.

2417
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:10,650
The last one that's triggered.
That one was.

2418
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:15,660
So I've seen that your stuff is,
but how do you write,

2419
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:19,120
like do you,
do you literally write right or.

2420
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:20,090
Oh right,
right.

2421
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,280
Yeah.
I'll show you how right.

2422
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,213
Use One of the things that I use,
I've been using over the last couple of 

2423
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,133
years.
I always write like in Microsoft word 

2424
01:51:28,881 --> 01:51:29,714
and shit like that,
but I use this program called scrivener 

2425
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:34,700
that I really like and the reason why I 
really like it,

2426
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:38,990
especially when I'm doing new stuff is 
the way it's set up.

2427
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,130
Like if you,
uh,

2428
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,193
was this,

2429
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:42,253
oh wait,
I know the bed that is in the new one 

2430
01:51:44,691 --> 01:51:48,170
that I love that you've just done the 
women inventing things.

2431
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:53,000
Oh my God.
That bit I saw that grow.

2432
01:51:53,001 --> 01:51:53,834
That was a devastating bit because the 
first time I saw it it was like already 

2433
01:51:57,621 --> 01:52:00,620
like one of those bits.
Where are you as a comedian?

2434
01:52:00,621 --> 01:52:02,090
You Watch and you just go,
I can't.

2435
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,680
What am I doing?
One of those,

2436
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:04,550
you know,
we've all,

2437
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,900
we've all been in the back of the room 
going,

2438
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:07,670
what am I doing?
If that's what's happening?

2439
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,653
And then I,
that was like early stages of that bit 

2440
01:52:10,821 --> 01:52:12,740
and then it became something so much 
more.

2441
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:15,770
I haven't seen your special yet.
I'm excited to see where it landed,

2442
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:18,200
but that wasn't an,
that's an incredible bed.

2443
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:20,060
But where does that start for you?

2444
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:23,010
So this is what this in Scrivener,
if you see here,

2445
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:25,560
like all on this,
this is all my new stuff.

2446
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,633
So these are all the categories and I 
click on each category and when I go to 

2447
01:52:29,431 --> 01:52:33,460
each category I have all the material 
that I've written out about each side.

2448
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,580
End caps was,
it's not cool to kick robot.

2449
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:42,030
Do you know what that's about?
Peta?

2450
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:45,890
Peta released a statement because Boston
dynamics

2451
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,010
has created these robots that are self 
balancing.

2452
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:49,963
So they have like a gyroscope in them.
So these scientists were kicking these 

2453
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,613
robots,
these four legged robots and Peta 

2454
01:52:56,631 --> 01:52:59,810
released a statement saying that it's 
not cool to kick robots.

2455
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:01,200
Yes,
this,

2456
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,030
this.
They did.

2457
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:04,160
I'm like,
you fucking weak pussies.

2458
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:04,994
This is going to be problem number one.
When the robots take over these fucking 

2459
01:53:08,471 --> 01:53:10,400
people are gonna.
They're gonna open up the door.

2460
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:13,340
Like you know,
robots are alive and they're,

2461
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,550
they're sentient and you can't kick 
them.

2462
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,690
You know they're going to eat your 
family fuck.

2463
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:19,680
And the same point in time,
you know,

2464
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,980
they're coming up with these,
you know,

2465
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,860
more and more advanced artificial 
intelligence.

2466
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:26,990
So this is how right write.
So these,

2467
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:31,340
this is essentially stage two.
So Stage one is,

2468
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,140
you know,
I do everything in Microsoft word,

2469
01:53:33,141 --> 01:53:35,600
so this is in Microsoft word.
All of these are.

2470
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:38,890
And it's just like you just loose 
thoughts.

2471
01:53:38,891 --> 01:53:40,920
You're not really editing as you go.
Okay.

2472
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:41,860
Exactly.
So like

2473
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:43,370
this,
which one is this?

2474
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:46,010
This one is um,
this is a lot.

2475
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:47,600
Yeah,
I write you gotta write.

2476
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:50,000
This is how I think.
I think.

2477
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:52,580
I think you've got to do two things.
You got to Ad Lib,

2478
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:55,190
you got to do it on stage,
you got to work things out on stage.

2479
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:56,263
But I think you're foolish to not write 
as well because I think there's so much 

2480
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:03,860
to be gained by sitting in front of a 
computer working on your act.

2481
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,903
That's one step.
Another step is you have to review your 

2482
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:09,140
act.
You have to listen to it or watch it.

2483
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:09,974
Preferably watch it.
Like I learned a lot watching the 

2484
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:14,600
editing when I was editing this special 
and I snapped.

2485
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:15,453
I had a snip,
I decided I wanted to be an hour and my 

2486
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,240
set was like an hour and 17 minutes,
so I said let me just cut,

2487
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,750
just,
I just want it to just fuck it.

2488
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:24,560
Boom,
just one hour,

2489
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:27,080
boom and done.
So I had caught a couple of bits out,

2490
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:30,890
but when I did that I was like watching 
the videos.

2491
01:54:30,891 --> 01:54:31,431
Like,
you know what?

2492
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:35,480
I should really videotape everything.
I should watch the video because it's so

2493
01:54:35,481 --> 01:54:38,910
much more immersive than just audio.
You.

2494
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:42,560
You only get so much out of audio.
I kind of know my expressions,

2495
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:45,470
all the different things that I'm doing,
but when I see them I go,

2496
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,333
oh,
it's better if I move like this or it's 

2497
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:51,170
better if I pause there.
It's better if I raise my eyebrows.

2498
01:54:51,171 --> 01:54:53,250
It's better if I look concerned.

2499
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Don't realize how much of comedy is the 
physical thing until you do watch it.

2500
01:55:00,131 --> 01:55:02,650
You're so right and,
and you're right about writing it down.

2501
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,513
Anytime.
I've had to do a transcript because I 

2502
01:55:04,691 --> 01:55:07,520
don't write anything down Longhand,
but when I've had to do a transcript for

2503
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:10,270
tonight show or like just for laughs 
festival and see it.

2504
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:12,100
Then you start writing new tags and 
you're like,

2505
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,680
all this took was for me to write it 
out,

2506
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:16,420
but then what do you do for Microsoft 
word?

2507
01:55:16,421 --> 01:55:19,870
Then you take it to take it to that 
scrivener and then what do you do there?

2508
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:19,870
I

2509
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:20,703
put it.
I'd take the stuff from Microsoft word 

2510
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,133
and then I trim it down and when I trim 
it down I put it in Scribnar and when I 

2511
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,680
trim it down and put it in Scribnar,
what I'm essentially doing is saying,

2512
01:55:29,681 --> 01:55:31,180
okay,
this is ready,

2513
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:34,450
this is ready to play,
and then what it's scrivener do.

2514
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:37,630
Oh Shit.
I left my notebook in a hotel room.

2515
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:40,060
God Damn it.
Someone's going to freak out.

2516
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:41,763
So then from there I write things out on
an actual notebook and the actual 

2517
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:48,414
notebook is basically just to get my set
list in order and to make sure I 

2518
01:55:53,101 --> 01:55:56,520
highlight all the different tags.
So there's three stages.

2519
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:57,743
There's the Microsoft word stage,
which is basically just free form free 

2520
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:04,230
association writing things down.
No,

2521
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:07,530
there's no structure to it.
Sometimes it comes out like a bit.

2522
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:10,180
Sometimes it's just nonsense that never 
goes anywhere.

2523
01:56:10,181 --> 01:56:10,290
Okay.

2524
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:12,690
You needed to get out anyway so you 
could get to others.

2525
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,610
Yeah.
You will.

2526
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:14,620
You just urging.
Yeah,

2527
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,130
well it's.
I don't know if you need it,

2528
01:56:16,131 --> 01:56:20,330
but it's like there's a road and get 
onto and as you're on that road all of a

2529
01:56:20,331 --> 01:56:21,111
sudden like,
oh look,

2530
01:56:21,111 --> 01:56:24,720
I found a bag of gold and,
and you don't find that bag of gold.

2531
01:56:24,721 --> 01:56:26,750
If you stay home,
you gotta walk,

2532
01:56:26,751 --> 01:56:27,584
you gotTa get out there and that's,
that's what the writing does with the 

2533
01:56:29,721 --> 01:56:32,690
writing does it allows you to pick up 
these little bags of gold along the way.

2534
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,793
And then I'd take these little bags of 
gold when I pile them up and then I 

2535
01:56:35,901 --> 01:56:39,470
throw them into the fortress and the 
fortress is like scrivener,

2536
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:43,640
so then I can move those bits around 
like what is it?

2537
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,860
Why is that different than Microsoft 
word?

2538
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,020
The reason why it's different is because
it's set up in columns,

2539
01:56:48,021 --> 01:56:48,530
right?

2540
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,363
So you see how uh,
and it's also as corkboard see Jamie's 

2541
01:56:52,011 --> 01:56:52,844
got it up on the big screen.
So when the court records see how it's 

2542
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:59,450
set up right here,
like each one of these things,

2543
01:56:59,451 --> 01:57:00,284
if you go to the left side here,
each one of these categories I can move 

2544
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:05,120
and I can,
I can change,

2545
01:57:05,121 --> 01:57:10,121
I can have that bit in the beginning and
then once I'm in the bit I could also go

2546
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:15,050
to this and that sets me up with a cork 
board so I can have like,

2547
01:57:15,051 --> 01:57:19,800
I could set up little note,
like little a setlists.

2548
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:23,720
Well like that,
like up there little notepad things.

2549
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:26,750
So I can write down these on these index
cards.

2550
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:31,130
Like don't forget this or this is 
important here or this tagline,

2551
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:33,820
huge try switching this around and

2552
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:34,723
it's just this constant.
But are you already like this or you 

2553
01:57:38,031 --> 01:57:39,650
already this kind of an organized 
person.

2554
01:57:39,651 --> 01:57:41,010
Have you always been this way or did you
get.

2555
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:42,173
You have to know this is a discipline 
thing that if you can teach yourself to 

2556
01:57:46,791 --> 01:57:48,500
be like that,
because I just feel like some people are

2557
01:57:48,501 --> 01:57:50,510
made that way.
This is not me.

2558
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:51,410
No,
no,

2559
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:54,080
not like this at all.
This is just look at your backpack.

2560
01:57:54,081 --> 01:57:59,081
You just brought out in every pocket as 
a thing and a pen as just cleaned it up.

2561
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,733
No,
you're like that.

2562
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:01,131
No,
no,

2563
01:58:01,131 --> 01:58:02,590
no.
If you caught that three days ago,

2564
01:58:02,591 --> 01:58:03,950
he's fucking.
Wires are coming out.

2565
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:04,813
Are like chaos and domestic guns really.
That makes me and so many people 

2566
01:58:10,311 --> 01:58:13,250
listening feel so good right now.
I cleaned it up a lot,

2567
01:58:13,251 --> 01:58:14,750
but a lot of times your house,
like,

2568
01:58:14,751 --> 01:58:17,060
I mean I know you probably have people 
come in and clean,

2569
01:58:17,061 --> 01:58:17,894
but like if you're in a hotel room over 
the weekend and don't have a maid 

2570
01:58:19,731 --> 01:58:20,900
service,
what are we looking at?

2571
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:21,853
Chaos.
Everything's spread out all over the 

2572
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:28,350
place and you throw it hits the ground

2573
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:32,390
I'm in.
When I'm in a room like a hotel room.

2574
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:35,300
Um,
it's basically like battle camp.

2575
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:36,910
I'm ready to roll.
No,

2576
01:58:36,911 --> 01:58:38,390
I'm not going to care what it looks 
like.

2577
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,283
You know,
I'm here like I'm want a clear path to 

2578
01:58:40,581 --> 01:58:41,920
the shower.
You know,

2579
01:58:41,921 --> 01:58:43,060
I,
I have a desk.

2580
01:58:43,061 --> 01:58:46,330
As soon as I get into the hotel room,
I set the computer down the desk,

2581
01:58:46,331 --> 01:58:49,810
I plug it in,
get connected to the Wifi and then I,

2582
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:50,763
you know,
it depends on how long I'm there for 

2583
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:54,970
what I'm,
what I'm going to do and then you know,

2584
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:56,960
I get to work,
you know,

2585
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,480
if I'm there,
I'm there to work.

2586
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:01,350
So that's.
I set everything up,

2587
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:02,353
spent time folding shirts and socks and 
shit and put different things in 

2588
01:59:05,871 --> 01:59:06,704
compartments.

2589
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,770
No full shit.
I also buy these shirts.

2590
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:11,313
There's a company that I work with 
called Mizzen and main and they make 

2591
01:59:13,701 --> 01:59:17,130
these shirts that are like Super Flexi.
I'm going to have you ever seen me wear,

2592
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:21,910
wear these shirts on stage?
I wore it on my last special special.

2593
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:25,790
They're like pajamas there.
You pull on them and they have a flex to

2594
01:59:25,791 --> 01:59:28,610
them so they don't feel like anything 
and they never get wrinkly.

2595
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:33,110
So I could roll that bitch up in a ball,
throw it into the suitcase and then pull

2596
01:59:33,111 --> 01:59:34,640
it out and wear it and you would never 
know.

2597
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,740
Efficient.
But it's just,

2598
01:59:36,741 --> 01:59:37,574
they're the best to wear because when 
you're on stage they don't feel like 

2599
01:59:39,861 --> 01:59:41,960
anything.
They feel like you're wearing nothing.

2600
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:43,880
What is this again?
Ms Dot and main.

2601
01:59:43,881 --> 01:59:46,550
Is the name of the competition?
Do they make women's stuff?

2602
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:49,280
That's a good question.
I do not know find out.

2603
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:53,420
So I wear them and I wear these jeans 
that have like flex to them.

2604
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:56,270
So the genes are like pajamas too.
Like the jeans,

2605
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:58,250
they're literally like sweatpants,
like you pull them,

2606
01:59:58,251 --> 02:00:00,560
they snap so they don't get wrinkly 
either.

2607
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:04,200
And what's your like,
like your regimen,

2608
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:06,930
like your,
your skincare regimen.

2609
02:00:06,931 --> 02:00:09,840
Do you spend a lot of time on that stuff
before you go to bed?

2610
02:00:09,841 --> 02:00:13,050
Are you washing your face?
Are you applying oils and creams?

2611
02:00:13,051 --> 02:00:14,950
Like are you.
Yeah.

2612
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,033
Yeah.
But you don't attend a lot of times you 

2613
02:00:17,191 --> 02:00:20,070
don't waste a lot of time doing stuff 
that doesn't.

2614
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:25,200
You're very utilitarian.
But like not just botox.

2615
02:00:25,201 --> 02:00:26,540
If that's you mean I'm a man?
No,

2616
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:27,503
I don't think.
I definitely don't think you look like 

2617
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,113
your best self.
Like I'm saying like you literally see 

2618
02:00:31,981 --> 02:00:34,320
major list to me.
I don't understand you like,

2619
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:35,693
but it is interesting to me because I 
would have thought you were very 

2620
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,124
meticulous with like organization and 
wasted a lot of time organizing things 

2621
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:42,264
and I like that you don't.

2622
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:43,171
Oh No,
no,

2623
02:00:43,171 --> 02:00:43,620
no,
no,

2624
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:46,260
no.
I think you have to have both.

2625
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:48,420
There has to be.
Look if you're a comic,

2626
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:49,470
right?
If you're good.

2627
02:00:49,471 --> 02:00:52,650
Especially I think there's a certain 
amount of you that has to be impulsive.

2628
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,113
It has to be reckless and impulsive and 
you have to be like one move away from 

2629
02:00:58,591 --> 02:01:02,430
ruining your life all the time,
but you have to keep it under control.

2630
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:03,413
It's like you have a wolf and you have 
it behind like this flimsy chain link 

2631
02:01:06,121 --> 02:01:07,400
fence that you just like,
oh,

2632
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,453
I'm going to wire this fucking shot and 
I'm going to go to work and I hope the 

2633
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:11,134
wolf doesn't get out.
That's literally what it's got to be 

2634
02:01:12,931 --> 02:01:13,764
like.
But then you also have to have 

2635
02:01:14,281 --> 02:01:18,690
discipline and I think those two 
counterbalance each other and one of the

2636
02:01:18,691 --> 02:01:21,600
things that's helped my act tremendously
over the last few years.

2637
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:25,350
I think my,
my I think triggered was my best special

2638
02:01:25,351 --> 02:01:27,600
ever and I think this one is better than
that.

2639
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:29,340
I think strange times better than 
triggered.

2640
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:30,413
And one of the things that over the last
three or four years that have really 

2641
02:01:32,431 --> 02:01:37,350
concentrate on is this process.
The process of organizing and being very

2642
02:01:37,351 --> 02:01:40,370
meticulous about like how I structure

2643
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:43,580
my material and then doing a lot of sets
too.

2644
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:46,010
You got to do that and then fuck around 
and go on stage.

2645
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:47,900
Trump,
I'd like to go on stage high.

2646
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:51,050
I like to fuck around because those are 
workout sets in,

2647
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:53,540
in,
in those moments of chaos.

2648
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:57,380
Sometimes a thing will come out that 
wasn't there before.

2649
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,690
It just popped out of nowhere.
And that motherfucker might be my.

2650
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:02,833
That might be my Bruce Jenner bit,
that might be my closing bit in those 

2651
02:02:05,631 --> 02:02:07,340
bits are.
They're rare,

2652
02:02:07,341 --> 02:02:10,310
they're strange,
they're theory theorial.

2653
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:12,710
They come out of the sky.
You don't know where they're from.

2654
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:17,711
And you have to nurture that and that 
comes from chaos and that come that this

2655
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:23,390
is not necessarily a discipline thing.
So there's the creativity in the madness

2656
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,153
has to sort of,
they have to share space with the 

2657
02:02:27,771 --> 02:02:30,980
discipline they have to,
they have to go back and forth with each

2658
02:02:30,981 --> 02:02:31,370
other.

2659
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,203
So we've always thought like,
like people have always thought of 

2660
02:02:34,851 --> 02:02:38,390
Comedians as being like sad people are,
drunks are messy,

2661
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:41,420
people are not disciplined,
don't have their shit together.

2662
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:46,421
But why I don't think that's the case.
Like I'm always going to be fucked up.

2663
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:47,151
Right.
Okay.

2664
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:49,910
So how about I be fucked up,
but I also keep it together,

2665
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:52,040
you know,
so I always have these thoughts,

2666
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:54,500
you know,
like I still have crazy thoughts.

2667
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:55,550
Like what?
Like what's your,

2668
02:02:55,551 --> 02:02:57,020
what are you,
why are you fucked up?

2669
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,000
Like what are you,
what's your fucked up thoughts for?

2670
02:02:59,001 --> 02:02:59,834
Probably definitely have brain damage 
will probably definitely have like some 

2671
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:06,800
sort of head trauma induced damage.
I don't know what's going on.

2672
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,840
Does that manifest itself?
I don't know.

2673
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:12,390
I'm sure sometimes.
Yeah,

2674
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:17,780
really not totally like that,
but also I work out so much that I drain

2675
02:03:19,551 --> 02:03:21,320
all that shit out of my system.
You meditate,

2676
02:03:21,321 --> 02:03:22,154
right?
Yes.

2677
02:03:22,450 --> 02:03:24,800
I spent a lot of time doing the float 
tank too.

2678
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:28,400
I have a float tank right here.
That helps a lot.

2679
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:29,583
Um,
but I think that if I did slow down and 

2680
02:03:31,551 --> 02:03:32,280
you know,
and people are like,

2681
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,113
oh,
you're fucking work so much because 

2682
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:34,920
you're afraid you're crazy.
Yeah,

2683
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:36,010
yeah,
yeah,

2684
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:36,860
exactly.
Yeah.

2685
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:37,630
Yeah.
What do you say,

2686
02:03:37,630 --> 02:03:38,390
Samsung?

2687
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:40,520
Only when I'm running I'm like,
you're running.

2688
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:41,383
I'm forrest gump and right now I can,
when I'm going through the worst times 

2689
02:03:43,671 --> 02:03:45,530
of my life,
I could just run forever.

2690
02:03:45,531 --> 02:03:46,364
And that's what,
when you see old men running and you're 

2691
02:03:47,631 --> 02:03:48,201
like,
what are you,

2692
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:49,034
why are you running from your running 
from something ever when you work out 

2693
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:54,080
that much,
you're running from something and mit to

2694
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:54,620
it.
It's a,

2695
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:57,650
it's a great copay.
It's better than drinking for me.

2696
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:58,763
Well it,
it,

2697
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,660
but it works.
That's the thing.

2698
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:01,500
It does.
Yeah.

2699
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:04,590
Like if you are crazy and you do it,
like if you're a comedian,

2700
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:06,300
guests what?
You're fucking crazy.

2701
02:04:06,301 --> 02:04:08,430
If you're a good one.
I've never met a good one.

2702
02:04:08,431 --> 02:04:09,264
That's not crazy.
I mean everybody's got their own crazy 

2703
02:04:10,531 --> 02:04:12,690
like howie mendell.
As crazy as you can't touch people.

2704
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:13,793
You know,
he's got to put paper towels on the 

2705
02:04:15,121 --> 02:04:17,400
ground every time he walks.
Like when he goes to a hotel room,

2706
02:04:17,401 --> 02:04:19,410
you know what he does is he lays out 
paper towels,

2707
02:04:19,411 --> 02:04:21,930
a pathway to his bathroom,
to the bed.

2708
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,180
Again,
he won't touch people's hands.

2709
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:27,390
Severe Germaphobe,
Super Nice Guy.

2710
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:29,370
The nicest guys you'll ever met.
Meet.

2711
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,353
That's his crazy.
His craziest different than you're 

2712
02:04:31,351 --> 02:04:32,460
crazy.
You're crazy.

2713
02:04:32,461 --> 02:04:35,430
Is Different than my crazy.
To my crazy different than crystal.

2714
02:04:35,431 --> 02:04:36,720
Leah's is crazy.
Everybody's crazy.

2715
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:39,350
I know.
Everyone's so crazy.

2716
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:40,350
To be,
to be good.

2717
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:42,450
You have to be.
You have to embrace that.

2718
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,553
There's no way else your coming up with 
the kind of fucked up shit that you and 

2719
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:51,720
I say onstage that you say in front of a
bunch of people and then you hit it with

2720
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:55,740
a tagline and then take it to another 
place like there's no way your normal.

2721
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,930
There's no way it's not.
It's not possible,

2722
02:04:59,870 --> 02:05:00,703
but are we?
Are we more crazy than the average 

2723
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:05,460
person?
Know that's the thing.

2724
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:08,070
We're just going everywhere.
Everyone's fucking crazy.

2725
02:05:08,071 --> 02:05:11,250
I bet less crazy than the average person
because we're free to express ourselves.

2726
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,540
The average person has to live this 
fucking bizarre,

2727
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:19,310
contained life where you show up the 
same place everyday.

2728
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:20,243
Do something you don't want to do every 
day with a bunch of people you probably 

2729
02:05:22,501 --> 02:05:23,334
don't even like,
and you're all backstabbing and weird 

2730
02:05:25,711 --> 02:05:29,190
with each other and you're just doing it
for a paycheck.

2731
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:30,211
You know,
and you're,

2732
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:30,631
you're,
you're,

2733
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:31,464
you're spending the majority of your 
time here on this heavenly body hurling 

2734
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:37,800
through infinity,
doing something you don't want to do.

2735
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,683
Yeah,
that's more crazy what you and I are 

2736
02:05:41,401 --> 02:05:43,050
doing.
At least we're doing something we love.

2737
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,570
And then that feeling that you get,
I mean,

2738
02:05:45,571 --> 02:05:47,130
I've seen you crush,
right?

2739
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:47,964
You go on stage in the main room and you
fucking crush and you say thank you 

2740
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:54,390
goodnight.
And everybody was like,

2741
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:58,530
that is that feeling of making all those
people happy.

2742
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,480
Have they?
They went out,

2743
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:03,450
they got babysitters,
they got together,

2744
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:05,610
they dressed up,
they went to dinner,

2745
02:06:05,611 --> 02:06:08,970
they got to the comedy store or they 
ordered drinks.

2746
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:12,300
They sat down there and you fulfilled 
their expectations.

2747
02:06:12,301 --> 02:06:15,630
You gave them what they wanted to see 
and I've seen you do it.

2748
02:06:15,631 --> 02:06:17,970
And that feeling that you get when that 
happens,

2749
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:23,450
it's indescribable and drag you,
your 300 people happy.

2750
02:06:23,971 --> 02:06:25,860
You made them all laugh.
I mean this,

2751
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:29,190
there's nothing like it on earth for us.
I mean,

2752
02:06:29,191 --> 02:06:31,110
don't you see people that never get to 
kill and you go,

2753
02:06:31,111 --> 02:06:32,070
Oh,
you poor pitch.

2754
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:33,723
Never get it to kill.
He just go through your life as a 

2755
02:06:34,981 --> 02:06:36,510
doctor.
You never get to kill,

2756
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:38,903
kill.

2757
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:42,670
How do you go through life?
He wanted to die.

2758
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:43,563
I was like on a path to like,
I'll probably just kill myself some day 

2759
02:06:46,301 --> 02:06:50,670
if I don't find a purpose,
and then killing gave me a purpose,

2760
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,650
kill.
Going onstage.

2761
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:54,100
Killing on stage was like,
okay,

2762
02:06:54,101 --> 02:06:57,340
now I have a reason to live.
That's like fucked up.

2763
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:58,930
It's fucked up.
It's so fucked up.

2764
02:06:58,931 --> 02:07:02,620
But it keeps me going and I and I get to
continue to do it.

2765
02:07:02,650 --> 02:07:03,483
It's fucked up some.
It's a struggle to do and that's 

2766
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:07,960
exciting.
But don't you like the art of comedy?

2767
02:07:07,961 --> 02:07:09,670
Like didn't you'd like it before you 
ever did it?

2768
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:12,070
Hell yes.
The greatest.

2769
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:13,840
It's such a good.
Yeah.

2770
02:07:13,841 --> 02:07:14,674
I mean,
but it just never seemed like an option 

2771
02:07:16,481 --> 02:07:17,314
to me.
Like I didn't even like look at stand 

2772
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:18,671
ups.
Like,

2773
02:07:18,671 --> 02:07:19,504
oh,
that's something I could ever do and 

2774
02:07:20,621 --> 02:07:23,110
then get anybody does until you do it.
There's some people that are like,

2775
02:07:23,111 --> 02:07:23,944
I love what I grew up.
All I did was a memorized comedy and I 

2776
02:07:26,441 --> 02:07:29,530
performed it for my class and I won't 
memorize people stand up.

2777
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,830
It was never even something I paid 
attention to until people were like,

2778
02:07:32,831 --> 02:07:34,810
you should do it,
and I paid attention to it.

2779
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:37,750
I could do routines and Conan and 
everything,

2780
02:07:37,751 --> 02:07:38,860
but stand up.
I was.

2781
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:41,830
I was never really aware of what w.
What were you,

2782
02:07:41,831 --> 02:07:43,600
what was your exposure to it early on?

2783
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:45,220
Well,
when I was about,

2784
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,113
I think I was 13 or 14,
my parents took me to see live in the 

2785
02:07:48,731 --> 02:07:51,190
sunset strip.
Yeah.

2786
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:52,383
It was a in the movie theater and it was
Richard Pryor and it was absolutely the 

2787
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:58,600
first time I'd ever seen anything like 
that.

2788
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:00,030
Cool parents.
Oh yeah,

2789
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:01,110
hippies.
Yeah,

2790
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:02,613
and that moment when I was in that 
audience watching that and in dying 

2791
02:08:06,761 --> 02:08:09,550
laughing and looking around,
I remember I really,

2792
02:08:09,551 --> 02:08:13,270
really distinctly remember looking,
not just looking at the screen,

2793
02:08:13,271 --> 02:08:14,104
but looking at all the people that were 
just like slapping the chair and moving 

2794
02:08:17,621 --> 02:08:18,454
around and holding their chest and 
thinking how insane is it that this guy 

2795
02:08:22,151 --> 02:08:22,984
can do this,
that this guy can just talk and just 

2796
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:28,390
through talking,
he's,

2797
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:33,430
he's making me laugh way harder than any
movie I'd ever seen in my life.

2798
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:34,810
And I think it came around.

2799
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:35,703
I think that movie came out.
I think live with the census came out 

2800
02:08:38,441 --> 02:08:39,274
around the same time as stripes,
which is one of my all time favorite 

2801
02:08:42,161 --> 02:08:43,660
comedies.
But I remember thinking,

2802
02:08:43,661 --> 02:08:46,870
why isn't stripes as funny as that guy 
talking?

2803
02:08:46,871 --> 02:08:51,160
How insane is this thing that this guy 
can do where he,

2804
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:54,550
he's just talking stripes.
I'm watching all this stuff play out.

2805
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:56,530
There's texts and yeah,
you know,

2806
02:08:56,531 --> 02:08:58,450
and,
but he's funnier than that.

2807
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:02,050
And I remember thinking he's Funnier 
than any movie that I've ever seen.

2808
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:04,370
Even in Richard Pryor movie,
uh,

2809
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:05,223
Richard Pryor movie,
like never as funny as him talking like 

2810
02:09:08,501 --> 02:09:10,990
him talking his way.
Funniest thing,

2811
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:13,240
the funniest thing,
a comic killing.

2812
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,780
Like I remember my friend Steve 
[inaudible],

2813
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:16,960
he said something about,
uh,

2814
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:18,193
he went to see something about Mary and 
this was his instinct strip is his 

2815
02:09:22,391 --> 02:09:24,220
fucking old school Italian guy.
He's a lawyer.

2816
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:26,050
He was on the Sopranos.
He,

2817
02:09:26,051 --> 02:09:27,220
uh,
he said he goes,

2818
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:30,520
it was as good as someone killing.
That's what he said.

2819
02:09:30,610 --> 02:09:33,070
He was as good as a comic killing.
That's a funny.

2820
02:09:33,071 --> 02:09:34,330
That movie is.
I was like,

2821
02:09:34,331 --> 02:09:37,120
wow,
what a crazy statement.

2822
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,163
It's as good as a comic killing.
Like it's universally accepted that if 

2823
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:42,460
you go to see,
you know,

2824
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:44,050
fill in the blank,
Dave Chappelle,

2825
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:44,884
whoever it is,
it's killing bill burr when they're on 

2826
02:09:46,471 --> 02:09:47,304
stage smashing that.
That's probably the funniest thing you 

2827
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:50,314
could ever experience.
So the art form itself is to me like 

2828
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:57,730
it's the craziest

2829
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:58,933
it most craziest dynamic art forum that 
we stand up there with a microphone and 

2830
02:10:02,431 --> 02:10:03,900
talking to it.
And that's all we have.

2831
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:06,390
There are times where I'm on stage,
I'm like,

2832
02:10:06,391 --> 02:10:07,224
what,
how,

2833
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,273
how are you doing this?
You have that moment that other people 

2834
02:10:11,041 --> 02:10:12,060
say to you all the time.
It was like,

2835
02:10:12,061 --> 02:10:13,980
how do you just,
you know,

2836
02:10:13,981 --> 02:10:14,814
musicians say they're like,
I have a guitar and I get to sing and I 

2837
02:10:16,711 --> 02:10:21,420
rely on all these things use,
have to talk and there's no other option

2838
02:10:21,421 --> 02:10:22,254
for us.
Like it's like that's all we've ever 

2839
02:10:22,951 --> 02:10:25,890
done,
but it is a wild thing that we do.

2840
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,230
It is.
But you know,

2841
02:10:27,231 --> 02:10:29,120
musicians have their own wildness.
I mean,

2842
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:30,680
could you imagine?
Oh God,

2843
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:31,930
no.
Yeah,

2844
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:33,443
I'd,

2845
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,220
no,
because I have no skills.

2846
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,740
I don't have it either,
but I admire the shit out of it.

2847
02:10:38,741 --> 02:10:42,310
One of the reasons why I admire it 
because I don't have it like a watch.

2848
02:10:42,311 --> 02:10:45,070
Like I have friends that are musicians.
I go to see them live and it's,

2849
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,520
it's so fulfilling to me because I have 
no talent.

2850
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:50,560
So like when I,
when I watched them do it,

2851
02:10:50,561 --> 02:10:52,870
I was like,
this is amazing that they can do this.

2852
02:10:53,110 --> 02:10:54,650
I can't do that.
That's incredible.

2853
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:56,530
Like wow,
when I go to see Cirque du Solei,

2854
02:10:56,531 --> 02:10:57,364
I get the same feeling.

2855
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:59,890
Wow.
Doing dancing with the stars.

2856
02:10:59,891 --> 02:11:03,260
I'm just like watching these dancers.
Like how did you just do like that?

2857
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,273
That took me months to learn and you 
just taught it to this girl in three 

2858
02:11:06,701 --> 02:11:08,760
minutes for her to fill in for me to do 
the camera black.

2859
02:11:08,761 --> 02:11:11,490
Like it was just like I couldn't get 
you.

2860
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:14,370
That is the thing of the wonder of like,
I just can't.

2861
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,150
I don't even know what that's like to 
do.

2862
02:11:16,151 --> 02:11:18,700
But I of course.
Do you play an instrument?

2863
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:20,350
Do you have any musical ability?
None.

2864
02:11:20,351 --> 02:11:21,900
Zero.
It was like you would know.

2865
02:11:22,150 --> 02:11:23,410
I know.
Doesn't it suck?

2866
02:11:23,470 --> 02:11:25,220
Like want that?
You don't want to.

2867
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:28,480
I don't want to learn anything and I do 
too much shit already.

2868
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:30,770
Yeah.
You to where you don't need it.

2869
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:32,880
I can't,
I'm trying to manage my time.

2870
02:11:32,881 --> 02:11:33,980
I'm just uh,
yeah.

2871
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,940
Um,
I'd have to manage my obsessions,

2872
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:40,080
but I think that what we are seeing,
whether it's in music or in,

2873
02:11:40,081 --> 02:11:44,490
you know what going to see a great comic
or anything when you're seeing is these,

2874
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:48,870
these portals for expression and the 
more they concentrate on that portal for

2875
02:11:48,871 --> 02:11:50,400
expression,
whether it's dancing,

2876
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:54,090
whether it's musicians or even someone 
making a film,

2877
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:57,990
there's more they concentrate on those 
portals of expression.

2878
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,853
The better the message and the better 
the impact it's going to be for the 

2879
02:12:01,441 --> 02:12:03,660
people that are enjoying it.
The people that watch it,

2880
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:04,703
and I think Paul Mooney told me that a 
long time ago when I was a young comic 

2881
02:12:08,581 --> 02:12:11,130
coming up and he was like the old sage 
at the comedy store.

2882
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:12,203
He goes,
if you really want to get good 

2883
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,340
accommodate,
you want to go up and kill.

2884
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,230
He goes,
you should go get into tained.

2885
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,210
Go get entertained.
I go,

2886
02:12:18,211 --> 02:12:18,901
really?
He goes,

2887
02:12:18,901 --> 02:12:19,621
yeah.
He goes,

2888
02:12:19,621 --> 02:12:21,420
you know what I do?
I go to see some music.

2889
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,310
I go to see a movie,
I get entertained,

2890
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:25,080
I get entertained and I want to 
entertain.

2891
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:26,670
I was like,
oh,

2892
02:12:26,671 --> 02:12:30,420
that makes sense.
Like you go see someone kick ass,

2893
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:34,680
right when you go see someone sing and 
it's fucking amazing and you're like,

2894
02:12:34,681 --> 02:12:35,920
God that,
that,

2895
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,310
that,
that portal for expression,

2896
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:39,353
like they've honed whatever message 
that's going to go through that portal 

2897
02:12:42,661 --> 02:12:44,910
and it reaches you,
you know,

2898
02:12:44,911 --> 02:12:45,744
it's the result of hundreds of not 
thousands of hours of twisting and 

2899
02:12:49,681 --> 02:12:53,490
turning and hammering and sculpting and 
massaging and sanding,

2900
02:12:53,491 --> 02:12:56,490
and then you get to see it in this 
finished form.

2901
02:12:56,491 --> 02:12:58,670
Like awe inspiring.

2902
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:02,650
Fuck yeah.
Do you go see a lot of music and as much

2903
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:03,460
as I can,
yeah,

2904
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:07,000
I do it on purpose.
Like I try to be entertained on purpose.

2905
02:13:07,330 --> 02:13:08,163
Are you saying that to me just now?
It's like that I need to work harder at 

2906
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,770
doing like it sounds stupid,
but I need to go and enjoy myself and be

2907
02:13:14,771 --> 02:13:15,604
entertained more.
You're absolutely right because every 

2908
02:13:16,751 --> 02:13:20,260
time I do I walk away from it and I go 
and be a better comedian.

2909
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:21,000
I

2910
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:21,833
think.
Well,

2911
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:24,870
like I said,
he told me that in the nineties and he's

2912
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:28,500
just such a wise man and when,
when he told me that I remember thinking

2913
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:30,900
like,
God fucking totally completely makes

2914
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,650
and I think um,
we don't do enough of that.

2915
02:13:34,651 --> 02:13:35,484
And also I think if you just do only 
comedy in your round comedy all the 

2916
02:13:38,011 --> 02:13:40,290
time,
we didn't get too wrapped up in it.

2917
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,173
You get to in your own head and you,
it takes away a little bit of your 

2918
02:13:44,491 --> 02:13:45,570
ability to be free.

2919
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:46,680
Yeah.
I,

2920
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,770
I,
I don't,

2921
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:50,160
I don't seek out comedy.
I've seen enough of it,

2922
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:53,530
but movies and I went to a musical last 
week at forced myself to go,

2923
02:13:53,531 --> 02:13:55,930
just watch people be great at that.
And it was,

2924
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:58,990
I left feeling good.
It's good to do.

2925
02:13:58,991 --> 02:14:01,810
It's hard to do though.
Like to watch a movie.

2926
02:14:01,811 --> 02:14:04,240
I feel accomplished at the end of it.
Like I read a book,

2927
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:05,963
that's how,
that's where I've gotten to now if it's 

2928
02:14:07,511 --> 02:14:08,350
a good movie,

2929
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:10,230
you know,
if you see something that's like,

2930
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:11,183
like x mocking.
I was like one of my favorite movies of 

2931
02:14:12,761 --> 02:14:13,594
all time,
but I remember seeing that movie and 

2932
02:14:15,071 --> 02:14:16,790
getting out of there going,
God damn it.

2933
02:14:16,791 --> 02:14:20,740
I want to make something like that.
Something that when I leave I go,

2934
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:22,240
fuck.
That was good.

2935
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:23,860
God Damn.
They nailed it.

2936
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:27,610
You know like when when something comes 
together like that,

2937
02:14:27,611 --> 02:14:29,920
I think it gives you just a little bit 
of juice.

2938
02:14:30,070 --> 02:14:34,110
Music definitely does that to me.
Like I'll play like a five.

2939
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,980
There's a song that really cracks with 
me.

2940
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:39,310
I'll play that motherfucker on repeat in
the background while I write.

2941
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:40,563
I'll just,
I'll just one song just over and over 

2942
02:14:42,191 --> 02:14:46,570
again and all the songs sort of like 
fades into the background and just gives

2943
02:14:46,571 --> 02:14:47,404
you energy.
Once you hear it like two or three 

2944
02:14:49,481 --> 02:14:50,314
times,
like the words don't mean anything 

2945
02:14:51,011 --> 02:14:56,011
anymore and then it just becomes like 
this fucking this power supply.

2946
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:59,190
Have you done the Goddamn comedy jam?
And like,

2947
02:14:59,570 --> 02:15:00,740
Nah,
no interest.

2948
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:03,310
Interesting.
Bill was trying to get me this thing the

2949
02:15:03,311 --> 02:15:03,701
other day.
He's like,

2950
02:15:03,701 --> 02:15:06,340
you should do it because if I was him 
and Dean del Rey,

2951
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:10,570
the what they do is they go to a venue,
like he played the forum last week.

2952
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:12,490
Yeah.
So they get there 2:00,

2953
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,080
set up the drums and the guitar and the 
amps and then they play to no audience.

2954
02:15:17,081 --> 02:15:19,990
They jammed all day.
He played from two to 6:30.

2955
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:24,220
Fat Fun.
Yeah.

2956
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,810
They're playing,
they're having fun.

2957
02:15:26,230 --> 02:15:28,440
And then you go on later that night and 
you know,

2958
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:30,010
you've just free.

2959
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,233
Yeah.
I rented a karaoke room for my birthday 

2960
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:33,963
and I just sang Taylor swift songs the 
whole time and had my friends are held 

2961
02:15:37,421 --> 02:15:38,440
captive.
They didn't even,

2962
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:41,230
they got the same one or two songs but 
we only had it for an hour because I had

2963
02:15:41,231 --> 02:15:43,280
to go do sets that night and I just 
sang.

2964
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,600
I just performed Taylor swift to them 
because I want to be Taylor swift and it

2965
02:15:46,601 --> 02:15:48,130
was so fun.
I was like,

2966
02:15:48,131 --> 02:15:51,040
I should do this more often by myself 
just to sing,

2967
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:53,360
to attract and retain and pop star for 
an hour.

2968
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:55,450
That is.
So that is such.

2969
02:15:55,451 --> 02:15:56,950
That's so cool that they did that.

2970
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:57,903
Yeah.
I think just having funds important 

2971
02:15:59,530 --> 02:16:01,440
because doing things that are fun,
you know,

2972
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:03,213
like you,
I think you could definitely get too 

2973
02:16:05,711 --> 02:16:08,410
distracted when you're not concentrating
on what you should be doing,

2974
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:09,453
but I also think you could get too 
focused where you lose track of what it 

2975
02:16:12,431 --> 02:16:13,350
is.
Like what is that?

2976
02:16:13,450 --> 02:16:14,283
What do I do for fun anymore?
I've had to ask myself that and I'm 

2977
02:16:17,051 --> 02:16:20,050
currently asking myself that and like,
what did,

2978
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:23,530
I don't know.
I mean running,

2979
02:16:23,531 --> 02:16:26,650
but does that count sometime?
I love it every day.

2980
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:27,960
It's something that,
it's,

2981
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:28,960
that it's a hobby.
Sure.

2982
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:32,710
Why wouldn't account because it's like 
you.

2983
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:34,690
Because it's a thing that people are 
like,

2984
02:16:34,691 --> 02:16:36,500
oh,
I kind of feel like it's a chore kind of

2985
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,380
working on is something will look as a 
chore.

2986
02:16:38,381 --> 02:16:39,640
Yeah.
It isn't any more.

2987
02:16:39,641 --> 02:16:42,880
To me,
meditation might be a hobby,

2988
02:16:42,881 --> 02:16:44,650
but that's more of a practice that I 
like.

2989
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:47,050
It's like brushing my teeth.
So I wouldn't say brushing my teeth as a

2990
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:48,960
hobby.
Um,

2991
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:51,640
no,
and I need more.

2992
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:56,950
But you've always had hobbies has you've
always like martial arts.

2993
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,873
Did that turn into a hobby for you as 
soon as you started doing comedy or did 

2994
02:17:01,571 --> 02:17:03,710
you have to like Kinda get back into it?
Not,

2995
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,180
never stopped.
It's always been just,

2996
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:08,740
it's almost like a big part of my 
philosophy,

2997
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:11,740
like who I am.
It's never stopped because,

2998
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:15,340
you know,
I started working for the UFC in 1997.

2999
02:17:15,490 --> 02:17:19,180
That's when I started doing post fight 
interviews and I was still very involved

3000
02:17:19,181 --> 02:17:21,670
in martial arts then.
That's what I was just starting to learn

3001
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:22,870
Jujitsu.
Uh,

3002
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:25,330
so it was in involved in a new martial 
art for me.

3003
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:26,740
And then,
um,

3004
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:27,663
I've never stopped.
I've always done something and I've 

3005
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:30,574
never stopped paying attention to it or 
studying it or learning new moves or 

3006
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,340
paying attention to the new trends or 
you know,

3007
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:37,174
watching fights or you know,
and especially things that I don't 

3008
02:17:40,751 --> 02:17:43,780
necessarily practice as much.
I'm interested in that,

3009
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:46,030
like watching different things that 
people do.

3010
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:51,680
What's the last hobby you picked up?
Bow Hunting and you're like,

3011
02:17:52,310 --> 02:17:53,640
you love it.
Really?

3012
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:55,700
What's a.
to me it's a,

3013
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:57,270
it's,
it's going to sound ridiculous,

3014
02:17:57,271 --> 02:17:58,104
but it's a,
it's a spiritual way to achieve your 

3015
02:18:02,611 --> 02:18:03,444
food,
to get meat and spiritual sounds 

3016
02:18:06,811 --> 02:18:07,830
ridiculous to people like,
Oh,

3017
02:18:07,831 --> 02:18:12,540
you're shooting an Arrow and an animal.
You have to be so finely tuned with your

3018
02:18:12,541 --> 02:18:13,374
senses in your skills and your abilities
and there's so much consequence on the 

3019
02:18:16,891 --> 02:18:21,720
line if you fuck up.
And then the pressure is so immense that

3020
02:18:21,721 --> 02:18:25,470
to me it's almost cleansing and its 
intensity and that,

3021
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:28,320
uh,
I think doing difficult things makes,

3022
02:18:28,321 --> 02:18:31,260
doing other difficult things,
uh,

3023
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,600
better.
Not Easier,

3024
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,400
but you're get better at it.
You get,

3025
02:18:35,430 --> 02:18:36,263
you understand,
like I think if you put yourself in a 

3026
02:18:38,251 --> 02:18:40,170
situation,
this happens to certain comedians,

3027
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,533
they get really good,
they get really famous and then they 

3028
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:46,380
only perform for their crowd and they 
get soft.

3029
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:48,040
I think we've all seen them.

3030
02:18:48,050 --> 02:18:49,830
You've all seen them.
They start to suck.

3031
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:51,270
They start to do,
they're,

3032
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:52,133
they're committing,
their comedy gets soft and they become 

3033
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:56,483
like a,
almost like someone doing an impression 

3034
02:18:58,141 --> 02:18:59,820
of them.
They lose their edge.

3035
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:02,910
And I think one of the ways to keep your
edge is to always be scared.

3036
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,920
So always do something that scares the 
shit out of you.

3037
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:06,840
Always do something that's nerve 
wracking.

3038
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:07,703
Always do something that's difficult.
Whether it's a martial art or it's 

3039
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:10,913
learning to dance or learning an 
instrument or there's something that's 

3040
02:19:13,590 --> 02:19:17,280
something hard for bill bird does.
He flies helicopters,

3041
02:19:17,281 --> 02:19:20,010
he plays the drums.
I think things like that.

3042
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:21,353
I think those are critical.
I think you need differently and it 

3043
02:19:23,731 --> 02:19:25,860
almost like she'd be thought of as like 
a protocol,

3044
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:28,100
like,
like cross that you're

3045
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,933
not just going to do your discipline but
you're also going to be involved in 

3046
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,210
other,
um,

3047
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:39,230
other disciplines that they add to what 
you're doing.

3048
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:42,260
Yeah.
I think that's what you're hitting on.

3049
02:19:42,261 --> 02:19:44,810
Exactly why I said Yes to dancing with 
the stars,

3050
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:45,644
which dancing is the thing that I'm know
that I'm worst at was because it's like 

3051
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:49,063
that's the scariest thing to me.
And if I do that then I can do so many 

3052
02:19:51,561 --> 02:19:53,750
other things.
And I'm also scared of that.

3053
02:19:53,751 --> 02:19:57,530
I'm not as scared of as dancing.
Like it's really weird.

3054
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:01,250
But like I like I'm,
I've talked a lot about sex.

3055
02:20:01,251 --> 02:20:03,620
I'm into like,
I want to do weird sex things in my life

3056
02:20:03,621 --> 02:20:05,900
that I haven't done.
Like I want to go to sex clubs,

3057
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:06,910
I want to have threesomes.
I've,

3058
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:11,300
I'm pretty vanilla.
Even though my sex club [inaudible] club

3059
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:14,990
is the other people in the sex club 
there also there.

3060
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:16,220
Yeah.
No,

3061
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:19,110
that's not the problem for me.
Weirdos chosen on your feet and chill.

3062
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:20,003
They're not.
It's all very consensual and it's all 

3063
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:23,290
very.
I just want to study that.

3064
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:24,643
I know enough going in like I'm ready 
for it now because I did dancing with 

3065
02:20:27,351 --> 02:20:28,040
the stars.
I'm like,

3066
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:29,660
oh,
I could go have a threesome,

3067
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:30,533
go to have a threesome 100 percent.
And I was not before because I always 

3068
02:20:33,081 --> 02:20:33,914
wanted to say I've done a threesome.
I've always wanted that experience to 

3069
02:20:35,631 --> 02:20:37,790
talk about.
It seems like an interesting thing.

3070
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:39,740
What do you want to do a threesome with 
two dudes?

3071
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:42,080
Or do you want to do a threesome with a 
girl guy?

3072
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:43,520
I mean,
I would,

3073
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,353
I would prefer for my own,
like I would like more dudes than women 

3074
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:50,570
because I'm just not like making out in 
front of you.

3075
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:52,460
You'd be like,
it has to be about me.

3076
02:20:53,050 --> 02:20:55,970
I have to be like,
they have to be mostly into me,

3077
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:56,863
but I can.
I don't mind a little bit of gayness 

3078
02:20:59,181 --> 02:21:01,010
going on.
Like I don't.

3079
02:21:01,011 --> 02:21:02,990
I think we're all very fluid or 
whatever,

3080
02:21:02,991 --> 02:21:04,250
but good luck with that thought.

3081
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:10,370
I am totally like if a guy has kind of 
gay,

3082
02:21:10,371 --> 02:21:12,350
but it's like enough end to me,
I'm fine with it.

3083
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:15,930
If you have sex and in your life you 
can.

3084
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:18,470
I can tell you I don't care.
Isn't Rni cool?

3085
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:23,471
How many dicks sexual if you like,
equal dicks to pussies.

3086
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:28,190
I don't care as long as you're very into
my pussy while it's in front of you.

3087
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:29,960
Is that rare though?
That seems rare.

3088
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:31,670
It seems like most girls would be 
skeeved out.

3089
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:33,140
I think that is rare.
No,

3090
02:21:33,141 --> 02:21:35,060
I think it's rare,
but I think it shouldn't be.

3091
02:21:35,061 --> 02:21:39,950
I think that why shouldn't it be like 
whatever you liked.

3092
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:42,650
Like if you're just in a totally 
straight men,

3093
02:21:42,651 --> 02:21:45,650
there's nothing wrong with that.
As long as you're not homophobic,

3094
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:47,173
bisexual,
a phobic to the point where you judge 

3095
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:51,350
them and you hate them,
but you shouldn't have to like them.

3096
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:52,251
Well,
okay.

3097
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:54,800
Here's,
I don't think that.

3098
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:00,620
I don't think that liking Dick makes you
like pussy any less.

3099
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:02,330
If you also,
if you're bisexual,

3100
02:22:02,331 --> 02:22:06,980
it's not like you have an amount of 
liking other people's body parts to give

3101
02:22:06,981 --> 02:22:09,470
out and you're giving half of that to 
Dick's and half of that to put these.

3102
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,453
I think you can like them both equally 
and be as excited by them in front of 

3103
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:16,160
you.
I never met anyone like that.

3104
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:17,553
I've,
I've met bisexual men who like you like 

3105
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:22,280
them equally.
I don't really totally believe,

3106
02:22:22,281 --> 02:22:25,860
but it was just a good joke that I kind 
of believe that I,

3107
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:26,230
I,

3108
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:31,080
I believe in gay women but.
And I believe in bisexual women,

3109
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:34,950
but I think there's two types of gay 
men,

3110
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:35,813
I think.
I don't necessarily believe in bisexual 

3111
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:40,890
men.
I think there's gay men and then there's

3112
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:41,873
really gullible,
straight dudes who get talked into blow 

3113
02:22:45,621 --> 02:22:46,500
and crafty gay.

3114
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:53,840
I think that those things do exist real.
There's definitely some gullible,

3115
02:22:53,841 --> 02:22:56,030
straight dudes,
but I do think there are really bisexual

3116
02:22:56,031 --> 02:22:57,350
men.
I'm just as just a joke.

3117
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:59,220
Of course that's just a joke,
but I do.

3118
02:22:59,230 --> 02:23:00,063
I think you're right.
Those do exist like straight men who 

3119
02:23:03,231 --> 02:23:04,064
have been and who will live with that 
secret and I walked around Travolta's 

3120
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:08,030
massage therapists

3121
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:15,620
allegedly just to show you a good guy.
Yeah,

3122
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:18,870
I'm into.
I don't,

3123
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:19,923
I,
I think that if I'm not like I don't 

3124
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:24,330
look at women and go like,
I want to fuck her,

3125
02:23:24,331 --> 02:23:28,200
but if a girl was like super into me,
I could totally date someone and fall in

3126
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:30,780
love with someone and like be in a 
romantic,

3127
02:23:30,781 --> 02:23:34,200
sexual relationship with a girl.
That would be just as gratifying as with

3128
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:36,820
a man because you would have to be.
So you have to be into me.

3129
02:23:37,090 --> 02:23:39,210
Like I think that's the thing that I'm 
into.

3130
02:23:39,211 --> 02:23:42,740
Men that aren't in a certain way to 
certain lesbian,

3131
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:47,750
like a dude energy.
Like I'm arnold energy or is looking for

3132
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:58,260
a woman of energy.
They were like down vests when it's just

3133
02:23:58,261 --> 02:24:00,030
a little too warm out for the best.
Yeah.

3134
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,010
I kinda lesbians women because they're 
just like,

3135
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:06,690
I just like a woman who just lumberjacky
I like to be pursued.

3136
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:07,553
So any kind of energy you give me,
like where you're like I want you and 

3137
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:13,320
I'm coming after you and I'm not going 
to really take no for an answer.

3138
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:14,880
Not in a rapey way.
We all know,

3139
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:19,910
but like I do like the energy of a sick 
woman with a big neck.

3140
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,720
I like a feminine looking.
I like anytime a woman,

3141
02:24:24,721 --> 02:24:28,030
but I think it's an energy.
But yeah,

3142
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:30,510
like I've met women in rose type 
character.

3143
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,190
I mean that's.
Everyone's like,

3144
02:24:32,191 --> 02:24:33,810
yeah,
that would be nice.

3145
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:35,170
But it's what everyone wants.
No,

3146
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:37,530
I mean Jennifer Aniston is my favorite 
part.

3147
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,570
Like she is like the hospital.
If she's like,

3148
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:40,390
I know what's wrong with you.

3149
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:41,223
Me.
This is why I can't settle down with a 

3150
02:24:43,351 --> 02:24:43,690
dude.

3151
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:45,980
Oh God,
yes.

3152
02:24:46,030 --> 02:24:47,620
Like Nikki glaser.
Oh my God,

3153
02:24:47,621 --> 02:24:51,460
I would you be into that for real?
Wow.

3154
02:24:51,790 --> 02:24:54,570
If she was into me,
but if it was like if she was like,

3155
02:24:54,580 --> 02:24:55,960
I'm going to try this out,
then no,

3156
02:24:55,961 --> 02:24:58,480
but if she was like,
I'm want this girl and I'm going to come

3157
02:24:58,481 --> 02:24:59,740
after her.
Oh yeah.

3158
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:03,100
They had a lesbian relationship before?
No,

3159
02:25:03,101 --> 02:25:04,360
not even close,
but I didn't make.

3160
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:06,750
I make it.
I made out with most girl.

3161
02:25:06,930 --> 02:25:10,180
I mean it was like all my girlfriends 
before I ever kissed a guy because I was

3162
02:25:10,181 --> 02:25:11,014
so scared of boys that I.
The first time I got drunk I made it 

3163
02:25:12,791 --> 02:25:15,220
with all of my girlfriends because we 
wanted to kiss boys,

3164
02:25:15,221 --> 02:25:17,470
but we didn't have boys around who liked
us.

3165
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:20,110
That's the difference in girls and boys.
Guys don't ever do that.

3166
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:21,760
Oh,
they just don't talk about it.

3167
02:25:21,761 --> 02:25:23,630
Show.
Oh they do that they

3168
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,600
can make out with each other.
I think so.

3169
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:28,390
How many guys,
if you had like 10 guys in a room,

3170
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:30,760
how many guys do you think have made out
with their buddies?

3171
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:31,763
I'm not kidding you.
I think for at a 10 guys have done some 

3172
02:25:34,171 --> 02:25:35,004
gay stuff early on before they had a 
chance to do it with women straight men 

3173
02:25:38,161 --> 02:25:39,000
who identify as straight.

3174
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:42,580
You are dealing with a severely impaired
sample,

3175
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:44,553
like whatever,
whatever semi homo energy you're 

3176
02:25:48,161 --> 02:25:53,161
attracting,
these are all the Cymbalta dot put.

3177
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,010
Poor John Travolta.
It's just a joke.

3178
02:25:57,011 --> 02:25:58,120
Just a joke,
John

3179
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:01,980
the.
I don't think that's the number.

3180
02:26:02,190 --> 02:26:03,660
I mean I think it's probably like,
what is the,

3181
02:26:03,690 --> 02:26:04,523
what is,
what's the standard accepted number of 

3182
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:12,110
homosexuals in a population?
Is it one on one time?

3183
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:14,200
So real.
I think it's like $10.

3184
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:17,100
It would be so many more to stop and 
think about that.

3185
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:17,963
Right?
There's 20 million people in Los 

3186
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:21,750
Angeles.
You think one out of 10?

3187
02:26:22,370 --> 02:26:24,180
I think there's 200,000.
Wait,

3188
02:26:24,181 --> 02:26:25,320
no,
that would be like wait,

3189
02:26:25,321 --> 02:26:26,870
20 million people.
One that's two.

3190
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:28,560
That's 2 million people.
Okay.

3191
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,630
Um,
that is a lot of gates.

3192
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:35,130
A lot of homos.
You could still say homo.

3193
02:26:35,570 --> 02:26:37,760
You can definitely still say,
ah,

3194
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:39,750
you fucking homos.
Enjoy it while you can.

3195
02:26:39,751 --> 02:26:44,000
Dangerous saying fucking homeless.
It's like there's an aggression to it.

3196
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:46,770
You beautiful home that he can say,
all right,

3197
02:26:46,771 --> 02:26:47,760
hey,
respects us.

3198
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:50,970
What are the numbers?
What numbers of gays broken down by?

3199
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:51,933
Yeah,
but how many closeted gays see the 

3200
02:26:53,021 --> 02:26:56,610
problem that I know so many closeted gay
guys and there's steps.

3201
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,473
There's several stages to that.
There's closeted gays that are out to 

3202
02:27:00,181 --> 02:27:01,014
their friends,
which I have friends that are closeted 

3203
02:27:02,221 --> 02:27:03,570
gay,
that are out to their friends,

3204
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:06,150
but they're in the business and so 
they're closeted,

3205
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:08,700
but then there's closeted even to their 
friends.

3206
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:11,250
I have.
I have one friend in particular.

3207
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:12,700
You know who you are,
motherfucker.

3208
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:13,933
No,
sorry.

3209
02:27:15,350 --> 02:27:16,183
Okay.
It's a six percent of women or five 

3210
02:27:17,631 --> 02:27:21,410
percent of women.
Five point one percent of them and three

3211
02:27:21,411 --> 02:27:25,400
point nine percent of men that are 
identifying.

3212
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:28,410
So then let's round up a little bit.
Yeah.

3213
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:29,540
Well,
how much will we round up?

3214
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:34,460
I got around up at least a percentage of
more.

3215
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:37,250
So we're.
We're dealing with a five percent,

3216
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,920
I think five percent.
If you're rounding up five percent,

3217
02:27:39,921 --> 02:27:41,090
then we're looking at 10 percent joe.

3218
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:42,380
No,
it's three.

3219
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:43,490
Oh,
what do you mean?

3220
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:46,640
So five percent of women identify in 
three point nine percent of men.

3221
02:27:46,641 --> 02:27:49,100
So if you're rounding up,
if you're doubling that,

3222
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:49,993
what you're saying,
rounding up five percent or you're 

3223
02:27:51,591 --> 02:27:55,400
running a five percent of the percent 
were both back.

3224
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:59,180
It's been clearly established.
I think,

3225
02:27:59,181 --> 02:27:59,910
uh,

3226
02:27:59,910 --> 02:28:01,870
you're safe if they're saying it's three
percent,

3227
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:03,550
I think it's probably five percent.

3228
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:04,591
Okay.
Oh,

3229
02:28:04,591 --> 02:28:06,270
I see what you're saying.
You're rounding up one percent?

3230
02:28:06,271 --> 02:28:06,841
Yes.
Okay.

3231
02:28:06,841 --> 02:28:09,290
Then that's what St I think it's about.
Yeah,

3232
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,593
probably,
maybe even more because there's such a 

3233
02:28:13,331 --> 02:28:14,164
stigma whenever there's a stigma to 
something is always going to be a bunch 

3234
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:21,620
of people that are just in denial of it 
and just they're sad that they are,

3235
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:23,180
you know,
a lot of that.

3236
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:25,680
There was a guy that I used to know and 
uh,

3237
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:30,710
he was a comic and he used to have the 
most ruthlessly homophobic material.

3238
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,820
It was awful.
It was awful.

3239
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:35,773
Like he used to do,
like he used to God he to do these 

3240
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:41,610
really mean nasty jokes about gay guys.
And then uh,

3241
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:45,020
I moved out here to la and then somebody
said,

3242
02:28:45,021 --> 02:28:46,370
hey,
did you hear that guy's gay?

3243
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:47,263
I went,
what?

3244
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:47,741
He goes,
yeah,

3245
02:28:47,741 --> 02:28:49,190
he finally came out.
I'm like,

3246
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:51,690
get the fuck Outta here.
And then uh,

3247
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:52,543
go back home,
went back to Boston and then all of a 

3248
02:28:54,231 --> 02:28:56,680
sudden he's like a big old queen.
It's like he just,

3249
02:28:58,490 --> 02:29:00,950
he was just keeping it in the poor 
bastard,

3250
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:03,320
you know?
And then that's,

3251
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,830
it happens all the time.
The guys,

3252
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:09,170
when guys have acts where I watch on 
stage and they're just,

3253
02:29:09,171 --> 02:29:13,730
they hate women so much.
That's not so much hating gay people but

3254
02:29:13,731 --> 02:29:17,380
hating women in a way that they're like 
a lot of guys that um,

3255
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:18,650
I have,
I have a lot.

3256
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:19,513
I used to hate my vagina a lot because I
would hear guys talk about like beef 

3257
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:23,623
curtains or voguing Derby's five for $5 
and I have like one of those vagina's 

3258
02:29:28,101 --> 02:29:30,320
right?
So I have like more,

3259
02:29:30,321 --> 02:29:32,150
I have like a,
like not like,

3260
02:29:32,151 --> 02:29:34,280
it's not like hanging down to my knees,
but like I have a,

3261
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:36,380
I don't have a pussy you see in porn.
Like I like,

3262
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,273
I don't want to like a perfect little 
designer batch and I used to be really 

3263
02:29:40,191 --> 02:29:44,180
insecure about it because I used to hear
guys say like too many lips down there,

3264
02:29:44,181 --> 02:29:45,014
it's gross and I think that a lot of 
guys that have that kind of mentality 

3265
02:29:49,881 --> 02:29:50,714
about postseason and say that they're 
gay and I would be disgusted with pussy 

3266
02:29:54,111 --> 02:29:55,280
too.
I would have that like,

3267
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:56,870
oh,
it looks like a Rosebud.

3268
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:01,900
I would act that way too if I were a gay
man that if I had to do something that I

3269
02:30:02,751 --> 02:30:04,640
didn't really want to be doing by 
nature.

3270
02:30:04,641 --> 02:30:09,641
So that's where I think that comes from 
sometimes being.

3271
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:11,023
So when I see when I see a guy on stage 
just say like really disgusting things 

3272
02:30:13,941 --> 02:30:15,600
about women and just hate women and I'm 
just like

3273
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:16,250
gay,
gay,

3274
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:16,701
gay,
gay,

3275
02:30:16,701 --> 02:30:18,160
gay,
gay,

3276
02:30:18,161 --> 02:30:19,050
gay.
Yeah.

3277
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:23,520
Do you remember like what I was going to
bring up that.

3278
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:24,990
What is his name?
Ted?

3279
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:25,853
Uh,
we talked about a meal a day on the 

3280
02:30:26,551 --> 02:30:27,384
podcast.
I used to have a whole bit about them 

3281
02:30:29,071 --> 02:30:32,820
from ninth,
2009 that my butt's special.

3282
02:30:32,850 --> 02:30:33,301
No,
no,

3283
02:30:33,301 --> 02:30:36,750
he was the famous preacher,
Ted Haggard,

3284
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:41,250
Ted Haggard who was just fucking rabidly
gay,

3285
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:45,090
turned out he was smoking meth and 
having gay sex with prostitutes,

3286
02:30:45,091 --> 02:30:46,800
and then the outer did.
I'm on CNN,

3287
02:30:46,801 --> 02:30:48,720
the gay prostitute was like,
I suck your Dick,

3288
02:30:48,721 --> 02:30:50,790
and we smoked crack together,
and he was like,

3289
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:54,450
but that's what it is.
Like these guys,

3290
02:30:54,451 --> 02:30:55,284
they hate what they are and there's so 
many of these anti gay politicians that 

3291
02:30:58,801 --> 02:31:00,930
turned out to begin with so many of 
them.

3292
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:04,790
It's almost a go the other way because 
you were just telling us who you are and

3293
02:31:04,791 --> 02:31:07,140
this is how many times they don't know.

3294
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:08,053
I think the thing about people that are 
living a lie is that they're always 

3295
02:31:11,121 --> 02:31:15,350
living in that lie and they can't see 
truth because they're spouting.

3296
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:16,333
I think if you lie all the time,
like you're always not yourself in an 

3297
02:31:19,981 --> 02:31:20,814
honest way.
You get super confused and you don't 

3298
02:31:23,281 --> 02:31:24,300
know what it is.
It's like

3299
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:28,050
comics who steal jokes can't write 
jokes.

3300
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:31,440
You ever noticed that there's no.
Comics is steal jokes that right.

3301
02:31:31,441 --> 02:31:32,550
Amazing.
Right.

3302
02:31:32,551 --> 02:31:35,220
Amazing jokes and they don't do both.
Do both.

3303
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:37,260
You do one or the other,
right?

3304
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:38,300
Yeah,

3305
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:40,430
because to be living in that lie like,
Oh yeah,

3306
02:31:40,431 --> 02:31:42,170
I thought of that.
That's my joke.

3307
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:46,340
Like you're constantly justifying it and
living in your head like that.

3308
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:47,960
Those comics,
when they're,

3309
02:31:47,990 --> 02:31:50,720
when they get out it and they're forced 
to write their own material,

3310
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:54,680
they fucking suck.
They suck.

3311
02:31:54,681 --> 02:31:56,420
Like,
like a joke,

3312
02:31:56,421 --> 02:31:57,254
like an open mic or something.
Like someone who doesn't know how to do 

3313
02:31:58,971 --> 02:32:01,670
comedy and they could have been doing 
comedy for 10,

3314
02:32:01,671 --> 02:32:02,504
15 years,
but you'll see their material and 

3315
02:32:05,661 --> 02:32:07,450
compare it to the jokes they stole.

3316
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:10,080
Wow.
You're so right.

3317
02:32:10,081 --> 02:32:10,914
To live a lie that to steel material,
you can't be actually a creative genius 

3318
02:32:18,211 --> 02:32:20,880
person in another way.
What's a totally different?

3319
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:22,050
It's a different.
You're different.

3320
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:24,390
You're not a comedian.
You're a thief.

3321
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:26,490
You're a magician.
You're doing something,

3322
02:32:26,491 --> 02:32:28,320
you're doing,
you're an actor,

3323
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:30,390
you're a liar.
You're a liar.

3324
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:32,390
Not the same thing.
So the opposite.

3325
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:35,850
It's so interesting to take that away 
from them and then they'd.

3326
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:37,630
We've seen it.
Yes.

3327
02:32:37,710 --> 02:32:38,543
So mentioning names,
we've seen it and when you see it it's 

3328
02:32:40,291 --> 02:32:43,560
super obvious and they get terrible as 
they get older,

3329
02:32:43,561 --> 02:32:45,450
as they get further along in their 
career,

3330
02:32:45,451 --> 02:32:46,530
instead of getting better,
they get

3331
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,670
way worse.
It's so weird when you're like,

3332
02:32:49,030 --> 02:32:49,863
we've all been accused of stealing 
material because there's one tweet that 

3333
02:32:52,901 --> 02:32:54,760
someone did and it's like,
well that's a similar thought.

3334
02:32:54,761 --> 02:32:56,230
And it's like,
well it's a parallel thought.

3335
02:32:56,231 --> 02:32:57,064
Idiots.
Like always parallel thought was a joke 

3336
02:32:58,961 --> 02:33:00,680
theat when I've been accused of stealing
land.

3337
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:01,820
It's like,
why?

3338
02:33:02,530 --> 02:33:06,490
So then all of my stuff is stolen 
because why would I do that?

3339
02:33:06,491 --> 02:33:07,324
Why would it take that one?
Do I really need that that badly that I 

3340
02:33:09,731 --> 02:33:10,564
would steal it?
And then all this other stuff is 

3341
02:33:11,861 --> 02:33:14,080
original.
Then all of my stuff is probably stolen.

3342
02:33:14,081 --> 02:33:14,520
Right?

3343
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:16,590
And when that some.
One of the weird things that you do find

3344
02:33:16,591 --> 02:33:18,210
out when you find out that someone's a 
thief,

3345
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:19,513
then then someone starts going through 
their material and comparing it to all 

3346
02:33:22,351 --> 02:33:24,810
these other comedians.
You Holy Shit,

3347
02:33:25,090 --> 02:33:27,300
like look at all this,
all my God.

3348
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:28,373
And then look at that time.
It has a bit from mad tv or that's a 

3349
02:33:30,361 --> 02:33:32,460
cosby bit.
Oh my God,

3350
02:33:32,461 --> 02:33:35,490
and then you see like most of their 
thoughts,

3351
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:40,470
they've somehow or another pilfered from
someone else and just sort of repackaged

3352
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:42,670
and that's a different kind of talent.
I'm almost like,

3353
02:33:42,671 --> 02:33:43,504
okay,
I respect that you were able to have 

3354
02:33:44,951 --> 02:33:47,740
that room is going for that long.
That's like a different kind of.

3355
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:52,060
You're just a kid imagined that being 
that much of a.

3356
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:56,770
just waiting for someone to pull up that
youtube clip,

3357
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:00,810
but they must not.
I don't think they.

3358
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:03,310
I don't think they think about.
They can't possibly think about that.

3359
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:04,520
I mean,
when I used to,

3360
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:08,370
when I used to shoplift,
I was worried about getting caught.

3361
02:34:08,410 --> 02:34:09,180
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3362
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:10,013
I was addicted.
Shoplift like noses while you're 

3363
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:13,000
anorexic.
Big Time.

3364
02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:14,020
Oh.
I was like,

3365
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:16,120
I was addicted to it.
I didn't even want it to

3366
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:18,490
keep yourself from about the fact that 
you were really skinny.

3367
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:19,743
I was shoplifting to stop from thinking 
about how I was hungry or that I was 

3368
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:25,990
hated myself for.
It was just a high.

3369
02:34:25,991 --> 02:34:29,200
I would get like getting things and I 
would steal things that I didn't want,

3370
02:34:29,230 --> 02:34:31,240
that I didn't like,
that I would never wear,

3371
02:34:31,241 --> 02:34:33,670
that I just wrote this because I could 
write.

3372
02:34:33,671 --> 02:34:36,760
Yeah.
And I always knew I would get caught and

3373
02:34:36,761 --> 02:34:37,594
I knew that I had to get caught to quit,
but I wanted to keep going as long as I 

3374
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:41,854
could.
And then I got caught and I never 

3375
02:34:42,911 --> 02:34:43,744
shoplifted again after getting caught.
But like I remember getting caught and 

3376
02:34:47,021 --> 02:34:48,690
being like,
I knew I needed to get caught.

3377
02:34:48,691 --> 02:34:50,320
Thank you.
Like I'll never do it again.

3378
02:34:50,321 --> 02:34:51,154
And she was like,
I'm fucking tired of this shit and 

3379
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:53,103
screaming at me.
She was like a couple of years older 

3380
02:34:54,401 --> 02:34:55,900
than me.
It was an urban outfitters in Lawrence,

3381
02:34:55,901 --> 02:34:59,710
Kansas I was on,
was on a break from work and I just went

3382
02:34:59,711 --> 02:35:03,140
over to do some light shoplifting and I 
got caught on the way out.

3383
02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:04,463
The beeper went off.
It was so embarrassing because she went 

3384
02:35:06,041 --> 02:35:07,210
through my bag and she goes,
really?

3385
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:08,920
The shirt?
This is disgusting.

3386
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:14,920
And she was like cooler than me.
It was so humiliating on every level and

3387
02:35:14,970 --> 02:35:15,803
every I was wearing my uniform from my 
restaurant job where I worked next door 

3388
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:20,453
and it was urban outfitters that was the
only cool place to shop in my college 

3389
02:35:23,321 --> 02:35:24,820
town and she was like,
your band for three years.

3390
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:26,110
I'm like this,
the rest of college,

3391
02:35:26,111 --> 02:35:26,944
so I'd have to go in and disguises to 
actually purchase things because that 

3392
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:30,750
was banned.
But I,

3393
02:35:30,751 --> 02:35:33,170
I never shoplifted again,
but I remember guys,

3394
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:34,013
this is where I would just like wear 
sunglasses and a scarf and like Eddie 

3395
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:46,170
Murphy when he put on the fast shallow.
Uh,

3396
02:35:47,470 --> 02:35:48,161
yeah,
I,

3397
02:35:48,161 --> 02:35:49,330
I,
but I,

3398
02:35:49,450 --> 02:35:50,283
but being someone who stole things,
like I knew that I would get caught and 

3399
02:35:53,291 --> 02:35:55,690
I wanted to get caught because it's a 
terrible life.

3400
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,340
Do you think these people want to get 
caught?

3401
02:35:57,910 --> 02:35:58,900
No.
No,

3402
02:35:58,901 --> 02:36:02,230
I think they just want to kill him.
They get addicted to killing.

3403
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:04,060
You know,
one of the things that happens,

3404
02:36:04,061 --> 02:36:04,894
like when someone gets caught stealing 
or we're just talking about this the 

3405
02:36:06,941 --> 02:36:07,774
other day,
was that when someone gets caught 

3406
02:36:10,661 --> 02:36:12,360
stealing and then you call them on and 
they said,

3407
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:13,810
I won't do that again,
and then he's here.

3408
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:14,673
Hey you here.
He just did that your bit at the laugh 

3409
02:36:15,551 --> 02:36:18,400
factory like that motherfucker.
He said he would stop doing it.

3410
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:22,050
Aren't they?
Get addicted to killing you.

3411
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:22,953
Addicted to it.

3412
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:25,190
Imagine being having that taken away 
from you.

3413
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:28,910
That's what I keep thinking about with 
comedians that have had,

3414
02:36:28,911 --> 02:36:31,400
did not go on stage anymore because 
something happens.

3415
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:34,460
Obviously the me too.
Stuff that's happened.

3416
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:36,440
I like,
there's a part of me that's like,

3417
02:36:36,441 --> 02:36:40,190
what if someone said I couldn't go on 
stage for a year.

3418
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:43,310
Like I was banned.
Like Richard's.

3419
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:44,930
Well yeah,
like forever,

3420
02:36:45,390 --> 02:36:46,223
like he's basically been forever.
I don't know what I do if I couldn't do 

3421
02:36:49,221 --> 02:36:52,610
standup at night and like I'm not 
jerking off in front of people.

3422
02:36:52,611 --> 02:36:53,444
So like,
I'm not at risk of losing that right 

3423
02:36:54,951 --> 02:36:56,930
now,
but like I don't think he thought he was

3424
02:36:56,931 --> 02:36:57,764
at risk of losing that.
Do you think like it was just a matter 

3425
02:37:00,981 --> 02:37:01,791
of time?
I mean,

3426
02:37:01,791 --> 02:37:05,360
I know that maybe towards the end when 
everything was kind of blowing up around

3427
02:37:05,361 --> 02:37:07,970
him with other men that he was maybe 
worried about it,

3428
02:37:07,971 --> 02:37:09,680
but like,
do you think he wouldn't?

3429
02:37:09,681 --> 02:37:11,600
Years of like,
I hope this doesn't come back?

3430
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:13,130
Probably.
Yeah.

3431
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

3432
02:37:15,831 --> 02:37:17,450
Because it's um,
you know,

3433
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,673
that's a weird one.
That's because that's one that you 

3434
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:21,590
liked.
How do you describe that?

3435
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:22,820
I mean,
how do you,

3436
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,130
how do you defend that?
Like you really can't.

3437
02:37:27,410 --> 02:37:28,960
It's just a weird one.
It's just,

3438
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:34,190
it's not the worst one because I'm into 
jerking off in front of women.

3439
02:37:34,191 --> 02:37:35,480
I don't know why.
It's my thing.

3440
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:38,310
I'm listening to Jim Norton.
Jim Norton should to.

3441
02:37:38,370 --> 02:37:40,880
This is attorney.
He should've done a press conference and

3442
02:37:40,881 --> 02:37:43,430
Jim Norton should've been as attorney.
They would have fucking clear that thing

3443
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:46,730
up in a heartbeat.
Jim Norton was said,

3444
02:37:46,731 --> 02:37:48,560
well I,
I jerk off in front of women as well,

3445
02:37:48,561 --> 02:37:52,120
but a lot of times they have dicks and 
that's what I'm into.

3446
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:55,700
And like,
I mean,

3447
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,630
yeah,
Norton is so free because he talks about

3448
02:37:59,810 --> 02:38:00,360
his,
he,

3449
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:04,250
he hose into trannies and like that.
That's his thing and you know,

3450
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:06,140
a lot of training anymore by the way.
Oh that's right,

3451
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:07,033
that's right thing.
But he can still say it because he's 

3452
02:38:08,481 --> 02:38:11,510
into them.
It no one even calls him out on it.

3453
02:38:11,511 --> 02:38:13,700
They just let it slide.
That's.

3454
02:38:13,701 --> 02:38:14,534
He really does.

3455
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:16,880
He does so much for the community.
Yeah.

3456
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:18,113
I don't really know.
I think he's talked about liking having 

3457
02:38:20,291 --> 02:38:21,124
people shit on him.
Like he puts down a tarp before women 

3458
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:26,630
come over sometimes like seven women 
piston his mouth.

3459
02:38:26,730 --> 02:38:29,170
Remember reading his books like early on
in college and being like,

3460
02:38:29,171 --> 02:38:32,470
I can't believe this man talking so 
openly about this,

3461
02:38:32,471 --> 02:38:34,390
but thank God for him.
There's nothing.

3462
02:38:34,391 --> 02:38:36,400
He's not worried about anything coming 
back to haunt him.

3463
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:38,570
No.
He's so brave because the fact that he's

3464
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:41,990
so ruthlessly honest like that and loved
for it,

3465
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:42,930
you know,

3466
02:38:42,930 --> 02:38:43,763
storm rain,
him talking about blowing another kid 

3467
02:38:45,301 --> 02:38:47,220
underneath the porch as a kid.
That was,

3468
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:48,493
I mean,
people now talk openly about being 

3469
02:38:49,770 --> 02:38:50,603
molested or having weird sexual 
experiences with boys early on and it's 

3470
02:38:53,971 --> 02:38:54,804
more of like an okay thing.
When Jim Norton was doing it back in 

3471
02:38:56,671 --> 02:39:01,410
2002,
no one talked about that shit and it was

3472
02:39:01,411 --> 02:39:02,720
an joked about it.
Yeah.

3473
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:03,833
And was beloved by ONA fans for us.
I mean he was someone that early on I 

3474
02:39:09,031 --> 02:39:10,070
was like,
I,

3475
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:11,873
this is different to me and I love it 
and I want to be on the other side of 

3476
02:39:14,401 --> 02:39:16,890
this where I can talk about all this 
stuff too and not,

3477
02:39:16,950 --> 02:39:17,783
oh,
that's interesting because there's so 

3478
02:39:19,111 --> 02:39:20,790
much freedom and being able to be like,
yeah,

3479
02:39:20,791 --> 02:39:22,380
I blew a kid under a porch when I was a 
kid.

3480
02:39:22,381 --> 02:39:24,030
Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with I was a kid.

3481
02:39:24,610 --> 02:39:26,340
And being yourself,
being yourself,

3482
02:39:26,341 --> 02:39:27,420
being honest.
Yeah.

3483
02:39:27,450 --> 02:39:30,940
And you find that when you are yourself,
so as you're not hurting anybody,

3484
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:32,820
you,
when you are yourself,

3485
02:39:32,850 --> 02:39:34,980
you find people actually love you for 
it.

3486
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:36,330
Yes.
Yeah.

3487
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:40,470
And they love the fact that you can be 
so brave that you can talk about all the

3488
02:39:40,471 --> 02:39:41,304
different things that you love that 
other people might be scared of 

3489
02:39:42,631 --> 02:39:44,010
admitting.
Yes.

3490
02:39:44,650 --> 02:39:48,210
Just like that.
Like his love of transgender women.

3491
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:49,253
Like think of that.
Like if that came out about someone 

3492
02:39:51,211 --> 02:39:54,450
who's trying to hide that it would be 
devastating to them.

3493
02:39:54,660 --> 02:39:55,493
But to him it's just like he,
he'll just talk about it openly and 

3494
02:39:58,290 --> 02:40:00,110
laugh about it,
you know?

3495
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:03,210
And it's not a point of contention at 
all.

3496
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:07,920
It's not something he's ashamed of.
It's just who he is.

3497
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:10,640
I know I've,
I've him and there.

3498
02:40:10,641 --> 02:40:13,500
There's several other people though,
but just to.

3499
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:14,513
I remember Sarah Silverman or hearing 
her talk about being a bed wetter and I 

3500
02:40:17,541 --> 02:40:18,374
was,
that was like my biggest shame for so 

3501
02:40:19,531 --> 02:40:20,970
long.
And then I was just like,

3502
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:21,541
oh,
okay,

3503
02:40:21,541 --> 02:40:22,950
well then that,
then it's okay.

3504
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:24,103
Just that all it took was one cool woman
to say she did something embarrassing 

3505
02:40:27,481 --> 02:40:28,350
and I was like,
okay,

3506
02:40:28,351 --> 02:40:29,970
it's acceptable now.
Now I can talk about it.

3507
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:33,330
And so that's why I talk about like,
I like anal sex.

3508
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:36,840
I don't think that it's a cool thing.
I'm not saying that like I,

3509
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:38,123
I'm not trying to put that out there as 
like nih naughty and don't you want to 

3510
02:40:40,441 --> 02:40:41,274
fuck me?
Like that's not my intention with it 

3511
02:40:42,421 --> 02:40:44,580
even though people will put that on me 
sometimes,

3512
02:40:44,970 --> 02:40:45,803
but it's because you should try it.
It feels good and I want to put it out 

3513
02:40:50,521 --> 02:40:51,740
there to women.
Like it's,

3514
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:52,973
it actually,
like I want to just more people to 

3515
02:40:54,721 --> 02:40:55,554
experience it and not be scared of it.
And it is gross and it is scary and it 

3516
02:40:59,671 --> 02:41:00,504
is weird,
but like I talk openly about it because 

3517
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:06,390
I hope that if you are a girl that's 
into it,

3518
02:41:06,391 --> 02:41:09,810
you're not ashamed of being into it.
Or if you're a guy that's into it,

3519
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:12,900
you're not,
you're going to have a threesome with.

3520
02:41:13,270 --> 02:41:15,570
I honestly,
I will listen.

3521
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:17,173
Do you think you would be excited about 
a dude but fucking a dude who's fucking 

3522
02:41:19,551 --> 02:41:20,384
you?
Like have you got some sort of human 

3523
02:41:21,771 --> 02:41:22,700
centipede thing going?

3524
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:24,093
Um,
no because I don't think he could focus 

3525
02:41:25,951 --> 02:41:26,784
on me if he was

3526
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:30,800
penetrated himself and it would be more 
about taking it for a year in the past.

3527
02:41:30,801 --> 02:41:35,801
I think that is so amazing.
I think it's because of you might be the

3528
02:41:36,711 --> 02:41:38,030
Dick in my ass.
I'm not sure.

3529
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:40,520
No,
I couldn't stand that.

3530
02:41:40,540 --> 02:41:42,610
I would need more focus on trading on 
you

3531
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:53,640
two thrusts.
One back be concentrating on both.

3532
02:41:55,341 --> 02:41:58,550
Focused on me.
I need to be the focal focal point.

3533
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:00,800
If I'm going to be in one of these 
things,

3534
02:42:00,801 --> 02:42:05,120
which I think you can arrange that.
Good luck.

3535
02:42:05,210 --> 02:42:07,250
Good luck.
Arranging what people are going to focus

3536
02:42:07,251 --> 02:42:08,120
on.
Oh,

3537
02:42:08,121 --> 02:42:09,410
that's a good point.
But that's,

3538
02:42:09,440 --> 02:42:10,273
that's the thing that I was fearing of 
doing a threesome is like what if I get 

3539
02:42:12,741 --> 02:42:13,574
in it and like what if I had to go down 
on a girl and like I'm doing it and I'm 

3540
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:20,290
like it's bad pussy or something.
Or it's like,

3541
02:42:20,291 --> 02:42:22,010
what a bad pussy,
what's bad pussy?

3542
02:42:24,950 --> 02:42:26,900
What if,
what if I just don't like pussy,

3543
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:29,450
but what's possible?
When I did dancing with the stars,

3544
02:42:29,451 --> 02:42:30,284
I really came out of it being like,
I'm ready to eat some pussy now because 

3545
02:42:32,540 --> 02:42:36,260
I faced my fear of dancing in front of 
millions of people,

3546
02:42:36,261 --> 02:42:39,260
which is like the scariest thing I've 
ever done on live TV.

3547
02:42:39,261 --> 02:42:40,940
Anything go wrong.
And now I'm like,

3548
02:42:40,941 --> 02:42:43,700
what's,
why am I so scared of a threesome?

3549
02:42:43,730 --> 02:42:45,510
Because I think my thing about 
threesomes,

3550
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:47,000
I'm going to get into it and I'm going 
to be like,

3551
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:50,060
I don't want to be here and that I'll 
still have to go through with it.

3552
02:42:50,061 --> 02:42:51,200
But like,
no,

3553
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:54,560
it won't.
What I like,

3554
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:55,453
I changed my mind,
which I do all the time now with 

3555
02:42:57,381 --> 02:42:58,214
hookups.
I think that as a woman we are so 

3556
02:43:00,231 --> 02:43:03,230
conditioned to think that men have to 
come at the end of it.

3557
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:06,140
There's the thing called blue balls and 
like in that if you've,

3558
02:43:06,230 --> 02:43:07,063
if you've made out with a guy and gotten
a loan with a guy that and you've 

3559
02:43:09,141 --> 02:43:10,340
decided to hook up with a guy and you're
like,

3560
02:43:10,370 --> 02:43:11,203
I'm getting naked a guy,
you have to go through the whole thing 

3561
02:43:13,361 --> 02:43:15,510
until he orgasms.
Like that is what,

3562
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:19,510
that is what we are sold because men put
that pressure on you.

3563
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:20,860
It's not men,
it's women,

3564
02:43:20,861 --> 02:43:21,694
it's magazines,
it's TV tell you you have to make them 

3565
02:43:23,681 --> 02:43:24,514
come with like 5,000
ways to blow his mind and to do this 

3566
02:43:28,691 --> 02:43:29,471
with a feather.
You know,

3567
02:43:29,471 --> 02:43:32,530
that kind of keep coming up with those 
lists.

3568
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:36,730
I mean,
it's all the same episodes.

3569
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:37,593
How many issues have been made?
I mean it's the same thing with 

3570
02:43:40,970 --> 02:43:43,780
workouts.
The last ab workout you'll ever need.

3571
02:43:43,810 --> 02:43:44,643
Well then you better not tell me another
one because you just said this is the 

3572
02:43:46,391 --> 02:43:47,224
last one on eight.
Even though you'll say that next year 

3573
02:43:48,461 --> 02:43:51,040
too.
So there's endless things,

3574
02:43:51,041 --> 02:43:52,810
but I.
But my new thing is now,

3575
02:43:52,811 --> 02:43:55,570
like when I used to be so scared of 
hooking up with guys because I was like,

3576
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:57,760
if I agree to kiss a guy alone in a 
room,

3577
02:43:58,060 --> 02:43:58,893
then I'm probably agreeing to have sex 
with him and then I don't even want to 

3578
02:44:01,871 --> 02:44:04,600
put myself in that scenario,
so I just didn't even kiss boys.

3579
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,330
See,
that's something that a man doesn't have

3580
02:44:06,331 --> 02:44:07,051
to fear.
Right.

3581
02:44:07,051 --> 02:44:09,660
If a man is alone with a woman and he's 
making out with her in a room,

3582
02:44:09,661 --> 02:44:10,770
he doesn't think like,
oh my God,

3583
02:44:10,771 --> 02:44:12,690
I have to satisfy her.
She's going to be mad at me.

3584
02:44:13,210 --> 02:44:13,870
Yeah.
And it,

3585
02:44:13,870 --> 02:44:16,120
it,
it's not even about like it is,

3586
02:44:16,121 --> 02:44:16,954
it is exactly what you're saying because
I want to backtrack and say it's not 

3587
02:44:18,821 --> 02:44:20,830
about like he's going to force me to 
have sex with them.

3588
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:21,673
It's like he's going to be mad or 
disappointed in me and he's just going 

3589
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:25,753
like,
he's just going to be mad and I don't 

3590
02:44:27,371 --> 02:44:28,910
want a guy to be mad at me.
Right.

3591
02:44:29,050 --> 02:44:33,850
And so I always had an unpleasant 
experience for the other person.

3592
02:44:33,970 --> 02:44:35,200
Exactly.
You just don't,

3593
02:44:35,230 --> 02:44:36,063
you just want to be nice and 
accommodating and that's what I felt 

3594
02:44:40,841 --> 02:44:42,850
always felt like if,
if I,

3595
02:44:43,150 --> 02:44:45,730
if I make out with a guy I have so many 
times in my life,

3596
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:48,100
been making out with a guy and been said
in my head like,

3597
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:51,070
what's the least second day to make this
guy come?

3598
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:52,143
Like,
what,

3599
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:55,210
what,
what can I do that is gonna make me feel

3600
02:44:55,211 --> 02:44:58,570
the least bad about myself or like 
something I,

3601
02:44:59,050 --> 02:45:01,480
what do I want to,
what can I do to make what,

3602
02:45:01,481 --> 02:45:02,314
how can this guy get off and I can leave
feeling good about myself and like I 

3603
02:45:05,531 --> 02:45:07,300
didn't do something I didn't want to do.

3604
02:45:07,510 --> 02:45:09,520
Which a lot of times you do something 
you don't want to do.

3605
02:45:10,270 --> 02:45:11,860
It has happened to me.
I do.

3606
02:45:11,861 --> 02:45:14,050
I call rape on it.
Do I look back on that guy and go,

3607
02:45:14,051 --> 02:45:16,900
he raped me know.
Do you think that the thought I was into

3608
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:17,020
it,

3609
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:18,980
do you think the solution to that is 
way,

3610
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:21,670
way longer before you get intimate with 
someone?

3611
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:23,380
Like get to know them really well?

3612
02:45:23,470 --> 02:45:24,303
No,
I think the solution is educating women 

3613
02:45:25,841 --> 02:45:26,674
and telling them that it's okay if a guy
doesn't come and it is okay the second 

3614
02:45:29,381 --> 02:45:30,770
year,
like I'm not really feeling this,

3615
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:31,813
that's the case for sure,
but I mean personally for you to not be 

3616
02:45:34,121 --> 02:45:34,954
in that situation like no a guy really 
well before you're intimate with them 

3617
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:39,063
because isn't that part of the problem 
is a lot of times people get intimate 

3618
02:45:42,101 --> 02:45:44,020
with someone,
especially if alcohol's involved.

3619
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,033
You get intimate with someone before you
know them and then you may be in the 

3620
02:45:47,921 --> 02:45:51,790
situation and you're like,
this is not what I wanted and now I feel

3621
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:53,170
gross and I want to get out of here.
Yeah,

3622
02:45:53,570 --> 02:45:54,560
I think,
yeah,

3623
02:45:54,561 --> 02:45:59,330
that's part of it and to not.
I think it really is though as a woman,

3624
02:45:59,331 --> 02:46:01,610
just being able to be,
say,

3625
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:03,560
make the situation uncomfortable by 
being like,

3626
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,453
I'm done here.
I'm so sorry I'm not going to come and 

3627
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:10,730
either so neither are you and maybe 
we'll do this again sometime.

3628
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:12,313
I've done that recently,
like the lady who's in charge of the 

3629
02:46:14,091 --> 02:46:16,190
audition.
Thank you Nikki.

3630
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:19,490
I really reached that point with myself 
though.

3631
02:46:19,491 --> 02:46:22,920
We're a much.
I did that to someone recently.

3632
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:25,760
I was literally hooking up with them and
I was like,

3633
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:29,330
I just,
I think this is it.

3634
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:31,400
This is going to be like,
and it was,

3635
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:35,660
but here's my thing is like more.
I hate being this woman that,

3636
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:40,230
but if I'm going to get anything across 
to your listeners because it's.

3637
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:43,760
I sound like a hack eighties female 
comic right now,

3638
02:46:43,761 --> 02:46:47,450
but like more foreplay,
like I never thought I'd be a woman that

3639
02:46:47,451 --> 02:46:50,390
says that just like we need.

3640
02:46:50,930 --> 02:46:53,060
I couldn't always be convinced to have 
sex with you.

3641
02:46:53,061 --> 02:46:55,940
If I'm willing to make out with you,
then I am what I am.

3642
02:46:55,941 --> 02:46:58,730
Somewhere in the realm of things,
and I'm not giving this to every woman,

3643
02:46:58,731 --> 02:46:59,564
but for me,
I am willing to take a good decade from 

3644
02:47:02,721 --> 02:47:04,250
you.
You have that opportunity.

3645
02:47:04,251 --> 02:47:06,200
If I'm making out with you.
Yes.

3646
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:09,110
Convince me,
turned me on.

3647
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:12,830
Don't just try to stick your Dick in me 
right after making out.

3648
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:14,660
That's not going to be the way to fuck 
me.

3649
02:47:14,730 --> 02:47:19,580
Sometimes I think I know where she says 
no,

3650
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:21,870
why?
They're panicked,

3651
02:47:22,130 --> 02:47:23,390
but before she says,
no,

3652
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,224
no,
you have all this time to get me to say 

3653
02:47:25,881 --> 02:47:26,714
yes.
Some people are panickers just we need 

3654
02:47:29,181 --> 02:47:30,014
to bring back dry humping.
It is so hot to the point where I'm so 

3655
02:47:34,161 --> 02:47:39,161
revved up that I'm like,
I need it like girls or I want.

3656
02:47:39,530 --> 02:47:43,130
Because you know what it feels like to 
get fingered when you're not turned on.

3657
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:45,860
It feels like the way it feels when a 
girl,

3658
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:48,350
when a girl grabs your deck and you're 
not hard,

3659
02:47:48,351 --> 02:47:49,660
you know that feeling where you're like,
oh no,

3660
02:47:49,661 --> 02:47:49,941
no,
no,

3661
02:47:49,941 --> 02:47:50,691
too early.
Don't do it.

3662
02:47:50,691 --> 02:47:52,220
Don't do it yet.
Let me just get.

3663
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:55,040
That's the way it feels.
When a guy goes to finger you and you're

3664
02:47:55,041 --> 02:47:56,030
not wet,
you're like,

3665
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:58,520
I could get there,
but now I'm not going to because now I'm

3666
02:47:58,521 --> 02:47:59,354
insecure that I'm not wet and now it's 
like I just want to cut this thing so 

3667
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:03,733
don't touch us there until we're like,
please like until we take your hand and 

3668
02:48:07,251 --> 02:48:08,370
do it.
That is,

3669
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:09,883
if you get us there,
which you will by doing all the other 

3670
02:48:11,901 --> 02:48:15,470
stuff,
dry humping over the pants stuff,

3671
02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:19,220
a feeling.
Our tits kissing,

3672
02:48:19,250 --> 02:48:22,990
kissing,
get us revved up and we will ask you to.

3673
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:25,550
We will beg you to fuck us.
You should give a seminar.

3674
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:27,380
I like,
this is like,

3675
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:28,273
you feel that I feel like you're onstage
in front of a large audience telling 

3676
02:48:30,891 --> 02:48:32,240
people how to do this.
I really,

3677
02:48:32,241 --> 02:48:33,074
I could,
I want to give like sex ted talks 

3678
02:48:34,791 --> 02:48:39,320
because I think that I could get men and
women to have more sex and enjoy it more

3679
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:41,270
because I've just given this stuff so 
much thought.

3680
02:48:41,271 --> 02:48:42,104
But I,
I really hate being the girl to say 

3681
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:45,080
more.
Yeah,

3682
02:48:45,081 --> 02:48:46,430
I do.
I talk about this a lot.

3683
02:48:46,431 --> 02:48:49,460
I'm just starting to get into this area.
This is,

3684
02:48:50,130 --> 02:48:53,120
this seems like it's ripe for material.
Oh Man.

3685
02:48:53,150 --> 02:48:54,860
It's,
it's just true.

3686
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:55,730
And,
and um,

3687
02:48:55,730 --> 02:48:58,940
I'm also telling guys in the audience 
who I might fuck,

3688
02:48:58,970 --> 02:49:02,290
like I'm hoping that there's a guy in 
the back of the room that I'm into.

3689
02:49:02,291 --> 02:49:03,124
You know,
I've done that before where there was a 

3690
02:49:03,951 --> 02:49:05,870
guy I'm crushing on and I know he's in 
the room and I'm like,

3691
02:49:05,900 --> 02:49:06,740
here's the.

3692
02:49:09,060 --> 02:49:13,320
Just like do some over the pants,
fingering over the pants,

3693
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:16,050
fit jeans,
tight jeans over the pants.

3694
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:19,310
Use the seam on where you're the the,
the,

3695
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:21,800
that little notch.
That's a.

3696
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:25,590
that's a clip thing.
I'm sorry Joe.

3697
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:26,940
Thanks Nikki.
Thanks for being here.

3698
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:28,650
I appreciate it.
We just did three hours.

3699
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:32,740
Sorry to end it like that.
Oh No,

3700
02:49:33,070 --> 02:49:35,070
you're fine.
It's fine.

3701
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:35,913
To ended that way.
Keep going if you'd like just to like 

3702
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:39,410
settle it down.
No,

3703
02:49:39,420 --> 02:49:41,220
we don't need to.
I can,

3704
02:49:41,250 --> 02:49:43,050
I can.
I can get off on a high point.

3705
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:45,780
That was good.
It's good to get out there.

3706
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:48,630
I don't need any foreplay on the back 
end.

3707
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,640
Okay,
so I don't need to rev down.

3708
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:52,500
Okay.
Mickey laser,

3709
02:49:52,501 --> 02:49:53,760
everybody.
Oh,

3710
02:49:53,761 --> 02:49:57,330
tell everybody where they can find you.
Where can they send these dick pics that

3711
02:49:57,331 --> 02:49:58,290
are coming your way?
God,

3712
02:49:58,291 --> 02:49:59,570
please don't send any products.

3713
02:49:59,670 --> 02:50:03,260
I don't want any dick pics.
I'm on instagram.

3714
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:04,680
Nikki Glaser,

3715
02:50:04,681 --> 02:50:05,514
Nikki glaser.
I have a Sirius xm show every single 

3716
02:50:07,650 --> 02:50:08,640
morning,
Monday through Thursday.

3717
02:50:08,641 --> 02:50:12,060
You do that from a.
from New York in the Sirius building.

3718
02:50:12,090 --> 02:50:13,960
I live in New York City generally.
Yeah.

3719
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:15,200
Yeah.
See you on here so often.

3720
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:16,560
I'm here all the time,
but yeah,

3721
02:50:16,561 --> 02:50:20,820
it's every morning from 10 to 12 eastern
on a comedy central radio.

3722
02:50:20,821 --> 02:50:21,654
Sirius xm channel 95.
So you have to get up every morning at 

3723
02:50:24,871 --> 02:50:25,530
10:00
AM.

3724
02:50:25,530 --> 02:50:26,850
Yeah,
I know.

3725
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,820
That's a good job.
Is a job it.

3726
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:30,030
I love it.
Cool.

3727
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:31,500
It's really fun.
Yeah,

3728
02:50:31,610 --> 02:50:32,760
I love it.
This was fun.

3729
02:50:33,450 --> 02:50:34,920
I enjoyed it.
Thank you for having me.

3730
02:50:34,921 --> 02:50:35,754
I asked you to be on it.
I just confronted you backstage and I 

3731
02:50:37,921 --> 02:50:38,754
was scared,
but you're awesome and I really 

3732
02:50:40,981 --> 02:50:42,210
appreciate you having me.
Thank you.

3733
02:50:42,211 --> 02:50:44,370
You're awesome too.
It was really fun talking to you.

3734
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:45,870
Nikki Glaser,
buddy.
