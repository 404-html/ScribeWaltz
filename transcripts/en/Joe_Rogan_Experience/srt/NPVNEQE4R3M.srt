00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,110
Hello,
beautiful people with the Internet.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,720
It's time to party again.
Oh Shit.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,820

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,140
you can print.
Why does this sound weird?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,950
Something sound weird and weird.
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:27,090
There's some,
I think it's just the headphone.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,890
Oh,

shirts.

19
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,380
When you go to [inaudible] dot tv,
those sweet kitty cat.

20
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:04,440
Do you have a new one now?
I know you're far with new ones.

21
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,780
She's us.
Louisa,

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,170
Ladies and gentlemen,
go there.

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,210
Waste some money.
I spend,

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,990
uh,
enjoy.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,260
Purchase.
Um,

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,470
this is one of the new ones.
That blue one.

27
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,510
Is that a concept or is that one of the.
All the new ones are concepts I'm at.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm creating a whole new store.
It's gonna be a big store and all these 

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,470
new ones are test products that I'm 
seeing how the manufacturers are and all

30
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:30,471
of them will be set with stamps.com.
It's the fucking easiest way to send 

31
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:34,790
anything through the mail.
You don't have to fuck with the post 

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:34,790
office.
You do it all from your desk,

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,930
whether your desk at your office or your
desk at home,

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,430
what we all that stuff out.

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,340
Put the postage on and printed up from a
regular computer.

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,510
Slap it on the box and hand it to the 
postman and your diggity diggity done.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,820
It's so easy to do.

office and you can save up to 80 percent

41
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,420
compared to a postage meter,
a postage meters the way businesses used

42
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,400
to do this,
uh,

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,480
and it's a huge pain in the ass.
It's expensive and there's multiyear 

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,410
commitments and hidden fees,
but stamps.com

45

and allows you to do the exact same 

46
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,820
thing from your home computer.
And again,

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,850
use a code word jr even when you click 
on the microphone in the upper right 

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,890
hand corner and get your $110 bonus 
offer.

49
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,350
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,340
That's o n n I t a human optimization 
website.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,840
What we try to do it on a.com
is,

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,990
look,
I'm a big fan of supplements.

53
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,410
Some people aren't and I completely and 
totally understand that.

54
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,130
If you're curious though about 
supplements and curious of the benefits 

55
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,101
of supplements,
I believe that the benefits are 

56
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,920
substantial,
especially if you pay attention to.

57
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,130
I mean,
there's always going to be weird fat 

58
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,561
loss claims.
If you guys seen all this shit with Dr 

59
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:01,060
Oz,
Dr Oz's fuck dude,

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,270
he's bought.
They brought that guy in front of 

61
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,270
Congress.
They brought him in.

62
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,690
That's not good son because he's a liar.
He's a.

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,700
he's a creepy liar saying he's got 
miracle cures and these little berries 

64
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,970
that they make pills out of,
they give him kickbacks.

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,330
Doctors are human beings,
ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,620
and sometimes doctors do creepy shit and
that is a creepy fuck.

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,620
The fat thing to me is it's insidious.
It's extra creepy because people like 

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,300
the fat thing is a self esteem thing.
It's a discipline thing.

69
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,510
It's a health thing.
There's so much connected to fat.

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,010
It's like,
to me,

71
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,610
it drives me more nutty than people that
are claiming the making your dick bigger

72
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,880
because that's just so stupid.
If you bought big Dick Pills,

73
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,030
he's just an idiot,
you know,

74
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,760
but the fat thing is like,
God,

75
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,761
you're sad and you're just thinking,
if I could just get rid of all this 

76
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:57,121
extra me,
it's the porn of vitamins and 

77
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:58,270
supplements though that sells the most 
of any other thing that you'll ever see.

78
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,180
That's why they always have like 
celebrities like Anna Nicole Smith,

79
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,830
Dr Phil and all that,
stuff like that.

80
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,090
Or I may not.
Dr Ross and I'm sure Dr Phil does salt 

81
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,060
you need to do to make your relationship
birders lose some fucking white.

82
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,240
You've got to wonder what it is about a 
doctor getting on TV as well.

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,110
Like,
yeah,

84
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,990
that is true.
I was talking to,

85
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,991
I'm a researcher,
a friend of mine from up in Canada and 

86
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,440
he said,
you always have to know it was his take 

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,440
on it,
that there becomes an issue.

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,030
Even with like super intelligent people 
when you become a celebrity when you 

89
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,760
were a celebrity doctor,
when you're a celebrity astronomer,

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,900
where your celebrity,
whatever,

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,640
that there's the pitfalls of fame that 
fall into that and the monetary benefits

92
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,490
of twisting information.
In one way or another,

93
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,350
like,
like with Dr Oz is doing,

94
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,970
he's obviously getting paid by these 
companies.

95
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,720
Say that they have these fat pills,
but he's so stupid,

96
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,010
man.
They asked him,

97
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:57,400
would you say that a pill is a miracle?
You know,

98
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,090
and he's like,
no.

99
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:58,700
Well I,
you know,

100
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,840
I took the word miracle.

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,840
I'm,
you certainly couldn't say a miracle in 

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,020
terms of you sat miracle on your show.
You fuckhead more than one.

103
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,510
They showed a John Stewart or that other
guy,

104
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,780
the new guy on Hbo,
who's The new guy in Israel with the 

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:12,780
glasses.
John Oliver.

106
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,280
I trust people with English accent and 
glasses implicitly.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,580
Immediately trust those guys.
But he's really good at his shows.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Really good.
And he did a fantastic thing breaking 

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,600
down what a scumbag.
Dr Oz's,

110
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,860
you know,
sometimes you see those infomercials 

111
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,091
where there'll be a doctor who will 
vouch for something that's happening 

112
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,511
there.
You almost wonder if there shouldn't be 

113
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,071
some kind of regulation,
if that's some kind of abuse of their 

114
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,160
position in society or something.
Well you,

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,600
it's abusive.
And here's one of the more insidious 

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:44,600
things about it.
The real raw,

117
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,810
real problem is there are things out 
there that can benefit you,

118
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:50,650
but the only way to find out is to get 
things that have been backed by science,

119
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,170
double blind,
placebo controlled tests,

120
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,090
things that have been done where you 
know for sure and getting back to on it,

121
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,750
all the stuff that we sell is stuff that
we,

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,790
there's,
there's a history of human use,

123
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,791
it goes back a long time and there's a 
research pages on every one of the 

124
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,740
supplements and supplements are just a 
part of what we sell it on it,

125
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,550
but I think that supplements can give 
you things that you're just not going to

126
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:18,551
get from your diet when it comes to 
Alpha brain nootropics and things along 

127
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:18,590
those lines.

128
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,830
The amount of food that you would have 
to eat to get the same nutrients that 

129
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,950
you would get from four Alpha brain 
pills.

130
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,760
It's pretty fucking substantial.
You'd have to eat like bowls of Moss and

131
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,660
you gotta keep that shit fresh and you 
wouldn't be able to take it on a plane.

132
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,630
There's a lot of issues with it.
Um,

133
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,730
also I think that when we isolate and 
locate various components of food that 

134
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,910
are beneficial for people like that is a
scientific thing.

135
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Like there's this idea of anti-science 
in connection to nutrients and vitamins 

136
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,470
and nothing could be crazier.
The,

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,520
the issue is that some of them are being
sold without this science and that some 

138
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:01,331
of them are just bullshit and we add on 
it are very committed to making sure 

139
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,020
anything we sell has some sort of 
benefit.

140
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:11,021
That's absolutely provable.
If you go to Alpha brain and read the 

141
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,530
research page,
we've conducted our own studies.

142
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,590
We conducted our,
we're in the middle of the second one 

143
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:17,590
right now.
We conducted one a,

144
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,630
a double blind placebo controlled study 
that showed benefit and memory,

145
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,660
showed a couple statistically measurable
numbers and you could see those.

146
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:32,051
We have it all listed and we also have 
all the data that is currently 

147
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,101
available.
All the studies that have been on been 

148
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,111
done on the individual ingredients,
which is very important to point out 

149
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,880
before we sell anything.
Before we do it,

150
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,370
we make sure that there's data on the 
individual ingredients first.

151
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,520
The idea behind things like Alpha brain 
are that you can combine various 

152
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,960
nutrients and use them in a synergistic 
fashion,

153
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,570
but sound smart when I say that,
but I'm actually really dumb,

154
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,930
so don't listen to me.
Go to [inaudible] dot com and read all 

155
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:58,930
that shit.
On top of that,

156
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,640
we sell the very best strength and 
conditioning equipment that you could 

157
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:03,640
buy.

158
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,480
I like kettlebells.
I'm a huge fan of them because I believe

159
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:10,481
that you,
when you're swinging things and using 

160
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,240
momentum and using your whole body as 
one unit,

161
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,780
it mimics actions that you would have in
the real world.

162
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,200
Like even just like moving furniture or 
something like that.

163
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,740
Like there's Kettlebell exercises that 
would make you better at picking up shit

164
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,190
and moving around your houses,
practicals that kettlebell swings.

165
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Um,
when you're doing pass throughs in 

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,531
between your legs,
like you're doing figure eights in 

167
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:34,421
between your legs with kettlebells when 
you're doing cleans and presses and 

168
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,571
cleans and jerks.
All those different exercises to 

169
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:37,571
strengthen your whole body as an 
individual unit.

170
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,420
And when it comes to this,
the term human optimization,

171
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,460
I mean that it embodies it in my 
opinion,

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,760
that's what I'm interested in it.
I think the human body should be like a 

173
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,421
race car and I think that if you have a 
race car and for whatever reason you 

174
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:55,991
don't want to put race fuel in it,
and for whatever reason you don't want 

175
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:58,571
to give it a 500 horsepower engine and 
for whatever reason you want to give it 

176
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,310
a big fat tires that grip the road.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Guess what?
Fuck face your race car is going to 

178
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:04,640
suck.
It's going to suck.

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,781
It's just not gonna work as well as a 
race car that is designed and 

180
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,611
constructed by a guy who took his body 
or a Gal who took their body and did the

181
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,470
best thing they could do for it.
Drank a lot of water.

182
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:21,471
Eight fresh leafy green vegetables takes
in a lot of high quality protein and 

183
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:23,520
exercise.
Make that mother fucker work.

184
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
You got to exercise.
It's one of the most critical parts of 

185
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,460
life because if your body doesn't think 
that it has to do anything,

186
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,670
guess what?
It just starts to go soft and get 

187
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,161
useless.
If your body doesn't think that it has 

188
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:37,161
to work,
he goes,

189
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:37,161
well,
we don't have to use any resources.

190
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,400
Uh,
staying healthy and fit.

191
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,380
Let's just fucking turn into a ball 
mush.

192
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,480
Don't let that shit happen to you 
people.

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
All right,
go to [inaudible] dot com,

194
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,190
o n n I t,
and if you use the Codeword Rogan,

195
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,740
you will save 10 percent off any and all
supplements.

196
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,220
All supplements have a 100 percent money
back guarantee.

197
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,000
First 30 pills for 90 days.
You don't even have to return the pills.

198
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,080
Just say,
hey man,

199
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,850
I took new mood.
I didn't feel any better.

200
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,320
Well,
you're a fucking freak.

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,970
Here's your money back.
Okay?

202
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,970
And if you're mad at us,
you are selling snake oil.

203
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,940
Go read the research behind it.
There's a reason why we sell it.

204
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,530
And the reason is we are trying to give 
people an edge and edge in life and edge

205
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,110
that I,
myself personally enjoy.

206
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,700
God,
that sounds Douchey,

207
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,760
but it is true.
I think you get an edge in how I,

208
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,790
I will,
I will say it in reference to my own 

209
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:25,790
self because the only reference I really
have,

210
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,840
I don't know how other people feel,
but my own self when I'm eating healthy,

211
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,120
I exercise regularly and I take 
supplements.

212
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,890
I feel better on a.com
o n n I t use the Codeword Rogan save 10

213
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,740
percent off any and all supplements 
again tonight.

214
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,780
Uh,
is there any tickets left?

215
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,570
Uh,
yeah.

216
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:45,571
There's ice house comedy dot Com and 
it's a Sarah Tiana Joe Rogan a Tony 

217
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,270
Hinchcliffe,
Greg Fitzsimmons.

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,730
So powerful show.
Uh,

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,430
and it's in the little room at the Ice 
House,

220
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:56,250
which is so much fun.
And by the way,

221
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,900
Joey Diaz and Mad Flavor,
I'm Aka mad flavor rather.

222
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:04,440
And Dom irrera will be at the ice house 
in the big room at the same time.

223
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,970
So it's a fucking party.

224
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,950
The Ice House,
my friends.

225
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,400
All right.
Without any further ado,

226
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,490
Lewis from unbox therapy's here.
Let's fucking geek out.

227
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,390
Let's do it.

228
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,430
Experience podcast shows up

229
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,310
podcasts and he's got a bunch of shit 
that if I saw on the shelf,

230
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:31,890
I'd be like,
Ooh,

231
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,600
yeah,
I,

232
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,850
I figured coming straight from Google io
that it would make a lot of sense to 

233
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,480
bring some of this stuff inside would 
have been ashamed to.

234
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,900
What exactly is Google io?
Uh,

235
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,901
it's their developers conference,
so it's focused on bringing together 

236
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:51,521
people that are making apps,
sort of Google centric type of 

237
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:54,040
applications,
but it's also turned a consumer facing

238
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,430
conference because a lot of people are 
paying attention at that time.

239
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:02,410
I think they had a million concurrent 
streamers of the actual event.

240
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,140
So a million,
a million worldwide.

241
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,490
So current,
concurrent,

242
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,470
she's,
it's incredible.

243
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,680
It sounded like too much to me,
but I'm not going to question google.

244
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,650
Well that's a good television show on 
HBO,

245
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,480
right?
Isn't it?

246
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,680
I mean like if,
uh,

247
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,180
what does game?
I don't think they do.

248
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't think.
I don't know if they do a concurrent.

249
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,860
I guess it would be.
I would imagine.

250
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:26,130
I mean,
a lot of his dvr this day and age,

251
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:28,000
that's what I was wondering else.
Everything's Dvr,

252
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,600
so it has to be an event where you sort 
of feel like you need to capture your 

253
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,330
catchy and live or else you're going to 
miss something.

254
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,440
Whereas,
I mean,

255
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,390
you could watch the Google io conference
after,

256
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:42,391
but yeah,
a lot of people paying a lot of 

257
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:42,391
attention to the things they were doing.

258
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:43,270
What do those Mac world conferences,
those are the big ones,

259
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:43,990
right?
What do those.

260
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,940
Not Anymore,
not anymore.

261
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,450
A WWDC.
Apple holds its own conferences now,

262
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,510
so Mac world was actually like an 
independent body and they just used it 

263
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,280
as a vehicle to introduce new products.
It was like a convention for Mac,

264
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,340
apple and apple related stuff and they 
decided to opt out of all third party 

265
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,050
conventions.
They're not at ces in any form.

266
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:06,880
Apples,
not apple.

267
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,790
They want to control the entire 
experience.

268
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,791
And so many of them happened on their 
campus and then some happened in 

269
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,121
downtown San Francisco like Google Io.
That's a big point of debate and 

270
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:19,150
dispute,
isn't it?

271
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,380
With apple?
Yeah.

272
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,850
The controlled environment.
Yeah,

273
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,890
definitely.
For sure.

274
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,240
Uh,
I mean there's,

275
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,110
there's good sides and bad sides to that
kind of approach.

276
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:34,111
Obviously controlling the entire 
software and hardware experience means 

277
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,280
that you're going to get a product that 
generally is fairly polished,

278
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,340
but from an innovation standpoint it 
means you're sort of cutting off your 

279
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,930
limbs in a sense that you're not 
bringing people into that development 

280
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,351
circle that might have otherwise been 
there because it is sort of a walled 

281
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:49,351
garden effect.

282
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,140
Yeah.
Isn't that fascinating?

283
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,160
I always remember the back in the day 
when the clones were legal,

284
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,230
it was,
oh,

285
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,240
right.
Apple clones be able to go and there 

286
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,451
were stores that would construct you and
an apple computer like semi recently 

287
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,220
macintosh's they were called not even 
semi recently,

288
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,710
a long time ago.
Used to be actual retail distributors to

289
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:12,910
sell Mac products.
Way more powerful than apple was making.

290
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,810
It would sell them with five fucking 
hard drives and souped up.

291
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,730
I built a couple other way back and then
apple just put the Kibosh on that.

292
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,630
Yeah,
I,

293
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,300
I can almost remember the name of the 
big company.

294
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:28,740
It was like either cylon or something.
Yes,

295
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,930
I think it was siloed and there is some 
kind of court case and they had to stay.

296
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,440
I don't think you want to go up against 
apple in court.

297
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,990
Well,
back then apple was way weaker but still

298
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,380
formidable till scariest,
but they.

299
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,560
So they now are the one computer,
but the problem is if you look at it 

300
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,370
from the product point of view,
right?

301
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,500
They make the best shit.
They just do.

302
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,210
They make the best.
They make the best desktops.

303
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,340
They make the shit that crashes the 
least.

304
00:14:55,341 --> 00:15:00,341
They make an operating system.
That's the most I would say they make 

305
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:00,770
the best shit for the most people.
For the most people.

306
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,771
Yeah,
because I think that if you really want 

307
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:05,870
to get in there and tinker,
if you're like a heavy duty power user,

308
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,860
a lot of this like you look at this Mac 
book air or your Mac book pro,

309
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,250
there's so much of it that's embedded.
It requires the entire package top or 

310
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,571
you want to go in there and put more ram
in it or something or a swap out a hard 

311
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:19,571
drive.
It's not gonna happen.

312
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:22,880
You got to bring it somewhere and the 
geniuses at the apple geniuses.

313
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,540
Tentious you look,
I love apple,

314
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,541
but how fucking dare you.
How do you feel about the apple store 

315
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:31,550
experience in general?
I enjoy it.

316
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,190
Yeah.
You know,

317
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,010
for the most part,
I think it's um,

318
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,810
it's a very busy place when it comes to 
selling computers.

319
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Right?
Remember when windows tried to have a 

320
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:41,820
windows store and they're still trying 
coyote hunting.

321
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,760
They're fun coyotes.
I know nobody in those fucking things.

322
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,420
I took a picture of an empty one before 
and tweeted it out and everybody got it.

323
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,980
They don't,
they're not.

324
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,950
They're not known for selling hardware.
Right,

325
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,850
right.
They were a software company.

326
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,460
You see a Microsoft sign on a,
in a mall.

327
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,020
It's like,
what?

328
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,940
What am I buying here?
As an ignorant person,

329
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,040
I'm ignorant to it.
As far as development development of a 

330
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,340
product,
like a laptop,

331
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:15,341
I'm pretty ignorant.
I don't know too much other than the 

332
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:15,341
things I've vaguely paid attention to 
online.

333
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,120
What is stopping someone from making 
like a super high end windows laptop 

334
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,820
that looks like this,
that feels there are so many that look 

335
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,750
and feel like this,
that are this high quality and they give

336
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,010
you the same experience?
No,

337
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:33,011
because you're running windows is 
windows so much worse.

338
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:38,051
They have so much money.
Drop the ball out of the drought but 

339
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,790
pretty bad after the windows experience 
of 19 whatever.

340
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,070
Like they dropped the ball,
they dropped it and then they shit on it

341
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:45,410
and then they fell on it and then they 
broke their hip.

342
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,470
I know,
I mean I don't want to speak for 

343
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,971
everyone,
but I don't recall any experience with 

344
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,371
windows where I cracked open a laptop 
lid and felt that kind of experience 

345
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:59,981
ever.
So even when x p was the thing or even 

346
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:00,800
before that 95 or however far back you 
want to go,

347
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,840
you didn't get that same pleasure.

348
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,840
You get out of booting up an apple 
product and getting into the eos and 

349
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,260
seeing the cohesion of the whole thing.
Windows,

350
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:14,261
even in the old days was sort of like a 
necessary evil windows was the way to 

351
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,640
get to the shit you actually liked 
whether you wanted to download a game or

352
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,130
a web browser or whatever,
but on its own it was.

353
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,560
It's always been utilitarian.
It's always been ugly.

354
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,830
Yeah.
I always end with the dudes who ran nt 

355
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:26,830
windows nt guys.
So it's a really new thing.

356
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,380
Oh,
right,

357
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,100
right,
right.

358
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,400
He's running into.
Oh,

359
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,420
and there's a bunch of shit you couldn't
get like drivers for certain video 

360
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,050
cards.
Like if you wanted to play games,

361
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,080
if you rent and ti,
it'd be real issues for people do that 

362
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,240
now with Linux.
That's sort of the counterculture.

363
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,590
OSTP.
Yeah,

364
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,470
like off the grid.
Opensource savages.

365
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Yeah.
Ibm actually originally that and now I 

366
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,350
don't know who it.
It's just open source.

367
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,330
If it's in anyone's hands now I do think
apple is the best of making an operating

368
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,850
system slowly die,
like have a,

369
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,880
like a cancer instead of just 
immediately like I'm going through an 

370
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,580
experience right now where my Imac is 
just dying.

371
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,640
It's the operating time.
I read it a scratch,

372
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,650
I put new memory in it and stuff like 
that.

373
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,320
The operating systems,
just saying like this model,

374
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,060
you need to replace it soon.

375
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,730
This is the Brian redband conspiracy 
theory,

376
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,390
conspiracy theory.
When it comes to operating systems

377
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,260
with iphones,
everyone knows you.

378
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:28,010
You have an iphone four and you get the 
new operating system.

379
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,280
We've got all the new updates.
That's going to be way slower.

380
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,720
Even some programs might not work.

381
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,420
It's not always the case.
There is.

382
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:38,421
That does happen.
Like there are sometimes things that 

383
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:41,751
happen within an eos that require more 
hardware to be able to perform at the 

384
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:46,701
same level of non Brian's worlds goddamn
conspiracy to trying to get people to 

385
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,910
buy these new fucking things.
Well,

386
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,280
I mean if you want to get a Mac pro,
go for it.

387
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,600
Like there.
They're beautiful things,

388
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,980
but it seems like with this or with a 
Samsung galaxy note three or whatever,

389
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,880
when new shit gets made new 
possibilities,

390
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,470
you're going to need more processing 
power.

391
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,870
You're going to get an apps require 
more.

392
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,840
The new videos that they're taking,
the new photographs,

393
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,060
we take Bursa photographs.
God,

394
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,560
there's got to be some processing going 
on.

395
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,020
Definitely going to need a faster ship 
rig.

396
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,810
That's just the way it is.
There's no doubt that the.

397
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,470
Especially on the apple products,
but in general there's this.

398
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,470
There's this structure built in where 
the expectation is to upgrade your 

399
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,600
device every time that contract is up.
Right?

400
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,020
Well,
I think there's no option if you want 

401
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,020
to.
If you're in the game,

402
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,830
if you're in this loving electronics 
that everyone in this room's,

403
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,280
then we're all fucking dork and hammers 
when it comes.

404
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,810
That's right.
New Electronics.

405
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,010
When you're in that game,
you have to keep up.

406
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,240
If you do not keep up,
if you try to run an iphone three on the

407
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:47,241
newest iphone software,
it's going to be clunky because the 

408
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,240
iphone three didn't have near the 
capabilities and these new applications.

409
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,600
Each new video that you can take the 
photos,

410
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:54,910
you can take the new weird things.
You can measure your heartbeat with your

411
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,730
fucking,
with your camera lens,

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,380
with this watch.
You can do with your watch,

413
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,000
but you didn't do it with your iphone.

414
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,150
Can do it or an android phone can do it 
just by holding your finger over the 

415
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,020
camera lens and it measured.
Jamie showed it to me.

416
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,880
I thought it was written thing.
It would work.

417
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
I at work.
I don't believe it's a super active.

418
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,580
I know I did it with a regular heart 
monitor.

419
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,670
Yeah,
I did it with a chest heart monitor and 

420
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:19,670
I did it without at the same time.
It's dead on.

421
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,310
Wow.
It's dead on.

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
I have a new watch though.
That does it on your wrist.

423
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:27,801
You don't have to.
You don't have to wear a chest strap 

424
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:29,691
anymore.
He's got the newest watch that we're in 

425
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:29,691
now.
I can see it on the bottom.

426
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:34,671
There is.
That's the heart monitor on the bottom 

427
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:34,671
was watching.
Oh,

428
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,730
that's so pretty.
Oh,

429
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:38,310
so pretty.
How'd you make it green?

430
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,840
It was green for a second.
Oh,

431
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,960
it might've been.
That might've gone into sleep mode or 

432
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:44,960
something.
What's the model that watch?

433
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,070
So that's the uh,
gear live they're

434
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,600
calling it,
which is kind of bizarre.

435
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,610
They tried to get me into this at the 
verizon store.

436
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:52,950
I told him to go fuck themselves.
Yeah,

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
they probably try to get you into the 
old version of it because this isn't 

438
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,290
even on the market yet.
Are you devil you're one of those guys?

439
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,670
Yeah.
We'll look at that color.

440
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:05,200
I made it to go green.
So yeah,

441
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,840
uh,
the difference here between the previous

442
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:12,841
Samsung watches and this one is this is 
the first to be running the open 

443
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,130
platform that,
that Google has created.

444
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,160
So not a modified version of software.
It's running something called android 

445
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,110
wear.
And what Google is hoping to do to do on

446
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:26,350
your wrist is essentially replicate what
they've done on the phone.

447
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,510
And if you look into it,
this is the risk thing.

448
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,730
That thing in there is the monitor.
That's right.

449
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,120
So it's optical.
It's actually going to look under the 

450
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,270
surface of your skin and it has like a 
class on the back that locks into place.

451
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,130
It's crazy.
And so the,

452
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,200
the beauty of this going this direction 
with it is if you can build a platform 

453
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,750
instead of a one off device,
then uh,

454
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,770
the,
the likelihood that a developer will 

455
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,070
jump into it and build something really 
cool that you never foresaw happening is

456
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,490
that much higher because of the mass 
market effect.

457
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:59,560
If everyone's running the same software 
on their wrist,

458
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,770
it's better for everyone.
And uh,

459
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,280
so,
so there's this kind of love hate 

460
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,731
relationship between Samsung and Google 
over this because for the longest time 

461
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:13,201
Samsung has been trying to diminish its 
a reliance on Google as a,

462
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,770
as a whole for their brand.
It's so essential for them to sell 

463
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,991
products.
And so they've been moving into some 

464
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:22,270
different operating systems now that are
not very good.

465
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,540
But independent of Google.
Yeah.

466
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,930
This is awesome,
man.

467
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

468
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,140
So I can,
I can tell you some of what he does.

469
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,650
I mean,
it,

470
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:34,651
it,
it's not really that much new 

471
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,421
comparative to the old smartwatches.
Essentially you're gonna get your 

472
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,420
notifications here.
It has a microphone on it so that,

473
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,910
uh,
you can input a voice commands,

474
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,770
et cetera.
So if you,

475
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,050
for example,
want to text somebody back,

476
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,200
you can catch the notification here,
respond to the text right on your wrist 

477
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,590
and leave your phone in your pocket.
A,

478
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,830
they were saying on stage that they 
believe 70 percent of our interaction 

479
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,510
with our device could be curbed by 
having one of these on your wrists.

480
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,930
So essentially most of the day your 
phone could remain in your pocket.

481
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,070
But I was talking earlier with Brian 
about how really the goal here,

482
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,260
the end game is preemptive computing.

483
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
So,
uh,

484
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,510
the idea that this thing will know what 
you want to do before you know that you 

485
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:14,930
want to do it.
Uh,

486
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,810
and that's what Google now has been 
pushing,

487
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,170
has been pushing in that direction.
So your flight lands and it can,

488
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,930
it can estimate how long it's going to 
take you to get home.

489
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:25,540
Or the proximity sensor says that you're
in the airport,

490
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:30,541
so it looks at your travel itinerary and
brings up your boarding pass right on 

491
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,991
your wrist.
So those kinds of things are what make 

492
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:37,740
wearing something on,
on your exterior more interesting where 

493
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,500
a,
a buzzing in your pocket is maybe not as

494
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,300
effective as the information you can get
here.

495
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,630
Like so travel distance and things along
those lines,

496
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,040
things that updates those updates that 
you get on

497
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,650
your phone,
but your warnings.

498
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,990
So things like that.
But again,

499
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,991
I don't know that we can necessarily 
imagined all the potential uses for 

500
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:58,991
preemptive computing.
I mean essentially much like the nest 

501
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:02,321
Thermostat,
I don't know if you've heard of that 

502
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:03,731
before.
It's a really fancy thermostats you put 

503
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:04,250
in your house and it's alert.
It's a learning thermostat and they just

504
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,530
took over the marketplace.
They recently got acquired by Google,

505
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,520
by the way.
Uh,

506
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,060
and one of their designers was one of 
the original guys who worked on Ipod.

507
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,150
So really there's a,
there's a cool story there.

508
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:15,150
But,
uh,

509
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,060
anyways,
they acquired nest.

510
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,170
Nest product is a learning thermostat 
that never needs to be programmed.

511
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,830
The programming is just you using it.
So you come,

512
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:29,831
it's Wifi connected,
you come home and you adjust it and you 

513
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,240
don't realize there's patterns in your 
behavior that at 3:00

514
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:37,241
you always like it to be a certain 
temperature and at six it's different 

515
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,050
and eventually it will dry out in 
algorithm to deal with your behavior,

516
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,680
at which point you no longer need to 
ever worry about it or touch it.

517
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,400
The goal of the product is to require 
less and less interaction from you.

518
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,490
The more you use it.
What's weird about nest is that they 

519
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,220
also have these new products where they 
just,

520
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:54,260
they're now taking over washer and 
dryers.

521
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,290
They're getting to the point where it is
going to be like that old flintstones 

522
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,830
where they control their,
the central computer of your house.

523
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,180
And there's like,
hello computer,

524
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,210
what are you doing here?
But what they are.

525
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,580
And they also have these uh,
uh,

526
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,040
smoke detectors that also do carbon,
carbon monoxide and stuff like that.

527
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,990
So they could even turn off and be like,
oh,

528
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,310
this,
turn on the oven,

529
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,590
gas this guy and kill him.
So Google is going to be able to murder 

530
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,851
us in her house and warn you if 
someone's breaking into your house 

531
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:21,851
trying to murder,
you know,

532
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:22,600
they,
they just acquired drop camp,

533
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,710
which is a jack was preaching about 
forever because the drop cam is one of 

534
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,240
the greatest,
I think inventions in a long time.

535
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,750
It's these little cameras that film 
amazing hd,

536
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,950
uh,
and that you could put all over your 

537
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:37,950
house that connect to your Wifi and then
you get a text like,

538
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,780
oh,
somebody is walking through my house.

539
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:42,140
You're sitting there watching full hd.
It's recording in the cloud for you.

540
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,300
Recording our stuff.
Right.

541
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,440
And it could also learn certain things,
like,

542
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:47,480
just watch this part of the house,
you know,

543
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,481
if it's me walking around because it's 
doing detections of what kind of object 

544
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:56,381
motions it is.
Do you shut all that off cover with tee 

545
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:58,520
shirts when he fucked you put socks over
them when I remember.

546
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,210
And then of course that he needs that.
You need to have that in the cloud.

547
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:02,480
No,
no,

548
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:03,230
I need that.
No,

549
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:04,940
I need that in the clouds.
I can get hacked.

550
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,680
But I also need,
how about as proof,

551
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:11,681
whatever,
like that video we were talking about 

552
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:11,681
that,
that the,

553
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:15,010
that a guy that was doing the drone over
the beach and that woman attacked,

554
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,630
attacked him,
and he had recorded.

555
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,850
If it wasn't for that,
his little recording there,

556
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,130
what would have happened?
She said that he attacked her,

557
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:22,640
right?
Yeah.

558
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,570
There was beating the shit out of 'em.
But what if you meet a girl at a bar,

559
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,880
you're both drunk and you go back to 
your living room.

560
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,060
Like that comedian,
that judge.

561
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,130
I just happened to a comic I recently 
and Denver and uh,

562
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,310
and he got in a whole bunch of trouble.
How do you feel about that world though?

563
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,860
Everything being recorded.
That's the question I was going to ask.

564
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,080
It's going to be great once something 
bad happens,

565
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,840
when it's.
Nothing's bad to happen.

566
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,210
I

567
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,720
don't really care.
You know?

568
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,340
I'm sort of.
Except if you do something fucked up and

569
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,660
someone gets a hold of it.
Yeah,

570
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,100
just don't do anything fucked up.
It's great.

571
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:54,930
It's like that Lego movie.
Everything is awesome.

572
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,950
Is it really?
I don't know if it's really that simple 

573
00:26:59,950 --> 00:26:59,950
though because in,
I mean you've seen,

574
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,510
you've seen before,
like the effect of say for example,

575
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:06,450
editing on the end product on a show or 
something like that.

576
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,060
You can totally change context,
change narrative.

577
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Somebody having footage of you doing any
kind of behavior could potentially be 

578
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,561
used to harm you,
but we all know if you have a photoshop 

579
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:18,561
that there's wastage detective,
it's photoshop.

580
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:18,710
If there's an editor,
there's.

581
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,410
There's so much smart little algorithms 
that you can tell that there's one grain

582
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:27,411
that's not supposed to be there in a 
film as far as like actually altering 

583
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,940
the image itself,
but not the context of the image itself.

584
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:30,810
You know,
you could,

585
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,870
you could have someone doing something 
that's actually not fucked up and you 

586
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:35,870
knew the whole story,
but yeah,

587
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,940
that's yeah,
that it's an issue.

588
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:43,941
It's certainly an issue and it's 
certainly an issue because there's 

589
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:43,941
people that have that power over others.
You know?

590
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,860
That's what the real issue with the NSA 
is like,

591
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,240
wait a minute,
you're monitoring every single person in

592
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:51,180
the country that use,
assuming we're all criminals,

593
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,360
because if not,
then do you pick a target like that you 

594
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,360
know,
is innocent.

595
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,550
Is it okay for you to monitor them?
No,

596
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,810
it's not right.
We all agree.

597
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,960
So the only reason why it's okay as 
you're looking at us all as potential 

598
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,000
criminals,
that's a real issue.

599
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,020
That's for sure.
Definitely just that philosophy of 

600
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,760
government,
that philosophy of ruling over people 

601
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,610
because it's omnipotent.
For sure.

602
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,140
On my way over this just reminded me of 
something or before I left the hotel,

603
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:21,141
I saw on the TV about that guy whose kid
died in the backseat of his car.

604
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,460
I don't know if you've heard about this 
in Georgia.

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,830
His,
uh,

606
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,780
so he leave the kid in the back left.
How old was the kid?

607
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:30,590
The kid was toddler,
left him in the backseat,

608
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,680
overheated and died.
And today I guess they find out the dude

609
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,590
was googling hot car,
death,

610
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,720
backseat death prior to the event.
Just to see how long did it on purpose.

611
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,330
That's the thought.
Oh No,

612
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,610
he was saying how long he could leave 
his kid in there while he runs in and 

613
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:50,610
gets a fine,
but that's pretty.

614
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,220
That's pretty fucked up on its own,
man.

615
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,450
Either one is fucked up.
He tried to kill this kid.

616
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,480
He killed his kid pc.
It's the problem is stories like that 

617
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,190
resonate so close to home that you're 
like,

618
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,960
fuck it.
Give them all the power they need.

619
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,670
You can't.
You know what I mean?

620
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah.
Well that's how I feel sometimes telling

621
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,220
him,
pull this up,

622
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,220
dude.
I don't want to see that guy's.

623
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah.
No,

624
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,690
you don't like.
Sometimes I feel like that when it comes

625
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:17,691
to like location services,
do you want google to know where you 

626
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:17,691
are?
Right.

627
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,270
I got to think about where am I?
What am I doing?

628
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,220
I showed them on yesterday's podcast how
everyone's iphones has on default.

629
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,620
Just all the locations that they sit at.
Yep.

630
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,870
That's right.
Very strange that that's it is.

631
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,940
And you and you,
you really start to wonder about all of 

632
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,590
this power we give to these devices over
us,

633
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,940
uh,
to these companies that,

634
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,020
that we have this inherent trust.
We're at a point now where we rely on 

635
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,520
these things to a degree that doesn't 
really allow for an opt out.

636
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,100
You know,
I'm not for me,

637
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,470
obviously now for this podcast,
you know,

638
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,690
not,
not for all kinds of exercise.

639
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,690
And if we knew that the police and the 
dea and the whatever organization that 

640
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,430
might be investigating you was 
infallible and super ethical.

641
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:08,431
There was no corruption.
There was no issues whatsoever with the 

642
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:08,920
lying in order to close cases to go look
better.

643
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,720
Right?
But we know that's true.

644
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,930
We know that's true.
We know there's been a lot of 

645
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,760
prosecutors that have willingly put 
people in jail because they didn't want 

646
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:17,760
to admit they were wrong.
They got the wrong person.

647
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,670
One of those stories always messed me up
when this guy gets let out of jail 25 

648
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,451
years later on DNA.
It seems like the only truth is the 

649
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:27,470
scientific truth.
You know,

650
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,850
it seems there's no other truth once 
it's in human being's hands,

651
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,030
it's like Google with these self driving
cars like they can.

652
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,560
They can eliminate so much.
Yeah.

653
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,420
Almost like 90 percent are human error,
right?

654
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,890
Look,
look at airplanes,

655
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:45,160
how their safety records are insane and 
the majority of that pro,

656
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,400
we'll put a plane in the sky and let it 
fly itself,

657
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,890
but we won't let a car on the road do so
yet.

658
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,040
The number one way that you will die 
between the ages of four and 34 is in a 

659
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,560
vehicle.
Well,

660
00:30:56,561 --> 00:31:01,561
we're letting it happen.
When you say we're not going to let it 

661
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:04,381
happen,
like they're letting google cars 

662
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:04,381
happened.
They're driving them right now for.

663
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:05,290
Well they're out there but they're not 
publicly available.

664
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,580
There will be some.
You can't.

665
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I mean the oil and gas companies that 
dealerships liquidated to Tesla in New 

666
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,560
Jersey there.
I don't think there'll be able to do 

667
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,560
that.
Not long term,

668
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,560
not long term,
but they can put,

669
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,760
you know,
sorta like the marijuana thing in 

670
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Colorado.
Like it's.

671
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:20,860
It ebbs and flows,
right?

672
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Yeah.
It goes a little bit this way and I was 

673
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:25,920
back that way.
I think it'd be so transparent though.

674
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,821
It'd be the real issue,
like why would you try to avoid 

675
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,370
something that is easy,
convenient and unbelievably safe.

676
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:35,530
It'll just.
There'll be somebody with some kind of 

677
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,130
economic.
I think personal freedom issues are 

678
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,010
going to still apply.
Like I liked to be able to drive our.

679
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,270
Yeah,
that's true.

680
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,450
Could you imagine a point at which that 
becomes illegal?

681
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,570
I mean,
is that what happened?

682
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,740
Definitely.
I mean,

683
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,020
or you could have to take your car to a 
fucking race track.

684
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,070
You imagine if the only way you could 
drive your Subaru was taking on a 

685
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,070
racetrack.
Well,

686
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,780
but if you haven't,
if you haven't relic.

687
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I always,
I sometimes feel like on the regular 

688
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:57,840
roads if you have a really nice car,
it's kind of like,

689
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,990
you know,
putting a muzzle on the dog,

690
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,860
you know,
you really to to get the most out of it.

691
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,090
A race track would be good anyways.
That is definitely true to get the most 

692
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,090
out of it,
but you can get something.

693
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,560
Yeah.
No,

694
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:09,610
definitely.
Definitely.

695
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,550
You can still get something you get a 
lot out of it depends on where it rode.

696
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:15,420
Take like a angel's crest forest,
right?

697
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,990
The Angeles Crest highway.
You're,

698
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,610
you've been up there,
you know,

699
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:23,611
like out near where that gun ranges to 
all these crazy winding.

700
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,750
Beautiful.
So fun to drive.

701
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:30,751
There is a way.
It's just that unfortunately 98 percent 

702
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:32,320
of the way people drive sucks.
Like you're sitting in gridlock.

703
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,350
First of all,
your phone should not receive or send 

704
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,961
tax once it's in the phone.
Once it's in the car should be a thing 

705
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:39,961
where the,
the,

706
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:40,570
the car recognizes

707
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,810
actually a bluetooth that your phone is 
a good segue.

708
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,600
No tax.
Fuck.

709
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,640
That's a good segue because one of the 
announcements actually at Google io was 

710
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,800
googling the car,
which,

711
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:49,940
uh,
again,

712
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,941
talks to all these different devices and
is essentially going to overhaul your 

713
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:57,710
car dash unit.
Which by the way,

714
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,720
they all suck.
They're all terrible.

715
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:03,680
Everyone's experienced the shitty 
capacitive screens in the slow input and

716
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,860
pretty much everyone agrees,
just slapping your phone in the center 

717
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,831
of the dash that's going to give you a 
better experience than the three or 

718
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:14,891
$4,000
a unit that the car company installed a 

719
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:18,441
apparently.
Part of what holds them back is that 

720
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:18,441
they have to have approval so far in 
advance,

721
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,661
three years or four years or something 
to get to get approved to go into a 

722
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:23,990
motor vehicle that they can't.
You know,

723
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,170
that they're so far behind by the time 
you're actually driving it,

724
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,060
that you've got a crappy experience.

725
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,060
But the goal here for,
for Google is that your phone is 

726
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,280
actually the brain because this is 
modular,

727
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,380
this changes.
You upgrade this all the time.

728
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,970
Your car on the other hand,
not so much.

729
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,180
So if this is the brain doing all the 
processing and just outputting video to 

730
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,930
a monitor,
that also happens to be touch screen.

731
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,380
You don't necessarily have to worry 
about that.

732
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,690
So much new points of interest on Nav,
for example.

733
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,610
Uh,
they don't happen on these,

734
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,640
these locked off circumstances.
Whether you have a,

735
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,730
you know,
a vw or a Ford or whatever,

736
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,880
each one of those experiences relies on 
those companies to go input those new 

737
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,160
pos.
So a new restaurant opens,

738
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:03,710
it's not going to be there.
Whereas in the case of this,

739
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,420
it's always going to be current 
information.

740
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,930
So the phone will sort of the car rather
we're sort of act as an app sort of.

741
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,690
I would honestly think of it as more of 
an as an output method.

742
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:17,600
So like basically imagine when you plug 
this in,

743
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,500
when you plug this phone into a TV,
you would see this,

744
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,660
let's say you say see this image up on 
the screen there.

745
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,880
So let's imagine the same thing but on 
your car dash right?

746
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,540
Why not?
Why,

747
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,790
why we're all doing this anyway.
So that's say phone would be an APP,

748
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,820
but I'm in your car would be an APP.
Yeah.

749
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,050
Essentially your car where you'd plug 
into your phone.

750
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I mean that's ever seen.
Those dudes who run those really large 

751
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,140
lenses,
they take photographs,

752
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,330
they plugged it in and there's 
apparently there's software that allows 

753
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:46,880
you to use these lenses with certain 
cell phones.

754
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,260
Oh really?
You haven't seen that?

755
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,350
Yeah.
They make large lenses.

756
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,500
Jamie,
you know about all that shit.

757
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:51,740
Right.

758
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,730
The like a physical adapter.
Yeah.

759
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,850
They put like your lap and I've seen 
some of them have applications that go 

760
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,821
along.
Definitely sort of the car is sort of 

761
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:03,821
acting like that.
Yeah,

762
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:07,661
an extension and there's some sort of an
application that allow your car to 

763
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:09,380
interface with your phone.
The only thing is we would be.

764
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:14,381
You wouldn't have to do any work.
Essentially it would be baked into your 

765
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,020
phone and if you never used it you'd 
never need to worry about it,

766
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,470
but you would have to have a specific 
operating system though because like say

767
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:20,940
if you have a Subaru and Subaru only 
handles android,

768
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:21,620
but.
Exactly,

769
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,800
exactly.
So they announced like 50 auto 

770
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:26,800
manufacturers that are on board.
That makes sense.

771
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,530
That's a huge pain that dick though,
when it comes to switching phones,

772
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,120
like I like going back and this and this
is something that I wanted to talk about

773
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:40,121
how now with more and more devices,
it's becoming super important to pick 

774
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:41,040
your team.

775
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,110
Oh No,
you're separating people.

776
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,550
It's.
I like both.

777
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,380
I really do.
I love my note.

778
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,570
I love the screen.
The screen is incredible.

779
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:53,240
I love the online experience,
but you know what I got recently,

780
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,310
man,
I got to fucking IPAD air.

781
00:35:55,311 --> 00:36:00,311
The big one with a horizon connection is
that I got this connection happen.

782
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,210
Yep.
Yeah.

783
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,000
My web browsing with a laptop or you 
know,

784
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,530
I mean my website is done with a phone 
or basically over.

785
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,990
Do you know what's great about this I 
suggest is when you're on the road,

786
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,540
I had t and t as my wife or as my cell 
phone,

787
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:17,541
but a lot of places [inaudible] and t 
sucks or vice versa and you could just 

788
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,060
make a hotspot using this so you're 
always having the best time.

789
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,260
Could have a boy.

790
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,860
Well,
here's,

791
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,420
here's an interesting thing there in 
that picking a,

792
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:30,421
picking a platform,
maybe it won't be such an issue in the 

793
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,550
future anyways because I,
I sort of view as much as I like apple.

794
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:35,980
I mean I've got products here,
I use the iphone is in my pocket daily.

795
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:40,981
You've got this laptop here,
they have no track zero traction in 

796
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:43,810
emerging markets at all.
It's not even of interest to them.

797
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,270
They sell here and only here,
I don't know about you,

798
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:51,330
but I'm American.
I don't really give a fuck about some 

799
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,880
mud hut yet except that those people in 
those mud huts are making killer apps 

800
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,600
now.
Oh dammit.

801
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,690
And if their first device that they get 
their hands on happens to be an android 

802
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:03,880
device that matters,
right?

803
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,830
Yeah.
This is a global circumstance.

804
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,920
I,
I've been saying for awhile that it's 

805
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,680
almost like apple can't win because even
though they have really high level stuff

806
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,110
and you start looking at like the moto m
eight,

807
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:14,770
you go,
Ooh,

808
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,690
that's pretty God damn close to an 
iphone.

809
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,250
Right?
If it just had a better camera,

810
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,700
the camera's kind of whack.
Oh.

811
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,030
Oh,
I heard you guys talk about this before 

812
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,070
this.
I wanted to talk about this 

813
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,650
specifically.
Cell or cell phone cameras.

814
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:32,651
Okay.
Everybody in the tech world knows that 

815
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:33,710
distinct takes the best instagram 
photos.

816
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,990
Right.
Okay.

817
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,680
I said that specifically because it's 
the number one way or the way that we 

818
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,560
share photos and ultimately how you 
share it is the biggest part of it.

819
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,590
Who cares if it looks great on your 
phone when when other people have to 

820
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:47,600
have to look at it.
If it doesn't.

821
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,240
So other phones came out and you guys 
talked to him.

822
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:54,220
There was one from note instagram.
You saying this go.

823
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,860
I keep talking.
All right,

824
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,380
so other devices came out.
It was a Gnocchi devices,

825
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:04,640
a 41 megapixel phone.
I'm a windows phone 40.

826
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,410
What?
40 one megapixel.

827
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,130
But you see that device is not focused 
on the output method.

828
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,250
It's just like let's just make these 
crazy images that are huge.

829
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,370
Well,
how the hell do I get that thing on 

830
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,370
instagram for the longest time windows 
phone didn't even have instagram,

831
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,620
but here's the problem.
Okay.

832
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,880
Instagram is a piece of software and in 
order for it to work smoothly,

833
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:25,190
it has to compress your photos.
Okay,

834
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,430
so the thing you're taking on your phone
just in the camera app is not the same 

835
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,330
thing that other people end up seeing on
the other side of instagram.

836
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,530
Right.
You know what I mean,

837
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,750
and that compression algorithm is very 
sophisticated.

838
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,900
It has to go in there and figure out 
what can I remove and what do I need to 

839
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,180
leave in time to make a beautiful 
picture.

840
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Right now,
if you're building the Ios side of 

841
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:48,850
Instagram,
of that APP,

842
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,540
it's very easy to build because what are
your parameters?

843
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,880
It's the same camera every time,
right?

844
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,970
Android,
Holy Shit.

845
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,740
How many android phones are on the 
market?

846
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,800
A lot of fucking android phones.
So now how many parameters as a 

847
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,131
developer do you need to deal with?
Because all those phones have different 

848
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:11,191
attributes.
So the way they take a picture is 

849
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:13,441
different.
So going in and trying to figure out 

850
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:15,211
what to remove in terms of bits and 
bytes to still have a good picture on 

851
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:19,021
the other side is very difficult to do.
So it's not necessarily a technical 

852
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,670
limitation on the side of the device.
The galaxy s five for example,

853
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:26,671
has a great camera,
a great camera until you try to upload 

854
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:26,671
to instagram.
Well,

855
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,020
I'm talking,
I'm talking

856
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:33,050
talking about taking photos on my camera
on both and trying to take the best 

857
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:34,890
photos,

858
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,710
right?
No,

859
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,130
no,
that's.

860
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,940
That exists.
This is a great camera.

861
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:39,650
Don't get me wrong.
It has a big aperture.

862
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,120
Is still like in terms of mass market,
you can argue this against the Nokia one

863
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:46,490
just because that's how it hangs off the
back.

864
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:51,491
It's a giant thing,
but what I'm saying is the bigger 

865
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,881
problem,
I believe the bigger problem is the 

866
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:54,881
instagram problem.
People,

867
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:58,300
people,
people hit me up on twitter all the 

868
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,300
time,
like my photos look great.

869
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,460
Then I uploaded it,
looked like mud.

870
00:39:58,461 --> 00:39:59,710
They looked like shit.
You know,

871
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,360
once I get them up there.
So this,

872
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,390
this,
this goes deep tech guys will carry 

873
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:07,730
around two devices for that specific 
reason.

874
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,170
I will take pictures on,
even if I took a picture on here,

875
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,110
but if I uploaded it on here it would be
different.

876
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,700
That's good.
Yeah,

877
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,270
it's crazy.

878
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,900
I mean when I upload my photos from both
of my devices that note three and my 

879
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,701
iphone five s all my fucking phone's all
my gal or notes photos are shit compared

880
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:31,430
to this camera.
They're not as good.

881
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,580
And if you have a program like instagram
that is taking random,

882
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,220
there's a lot of times I use instagram 
but just like photos I find on the 

883
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,220
Internet,
like screenshots,

884
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:47,530
that's another good example.
And those programs should be able to be 

885
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:47,530
like,
okay,

886
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,250
we're going to make everything a 
screenshot that's uploaded through this,

887
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,110
you know,
algorithm like meaning.

888
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:53,090
Like if you have a photo that's taken on
one camera,

889
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,210
you have a screenshot,
you have a camera that you uploaded,

890
00:40:56,211 --> 00:41:01,211
whatever.
All those photos should be able to go 

891
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,641
through one single program and thing 
like we're all going to transfer this 

892
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:04,940
into what a screenshot is of that phone 
or whatever.

893
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,040
Meaning it shouldn't be like who cares 
if it what different photos that is.

894
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,520
It's the programming that should be able
to interpret it and no doubt about it,

895
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,550
but it's just.
If you say you're the developer on 

896
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,550
Instagram,
first of all,

897
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,580
instagram is not really making much 
money right now anyways,

898
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,230
but if you're good,
could they be.

899
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,640
That's a question.
I mean people pay for Instagram,

900
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,390
facebook,
facial recognition so that they can own 

901
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:30,390
all your apps.
One APP,

902
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,380
download it.
You downloaded for free or do you pay 

903
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,380
for it?
No,

904
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,380
it's a free app,

905
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,460
but at the u you will eventually start 
to see promoted instagram posts from 

906
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,640
brands in your feed.
No choice.

907
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,200
Twitter's doing.
Do they own what I was doing?

908
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,030
They gross me out when they do read 
them.

909
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,600
Promoting your friend is following x 
brand's instagram.

910
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,300
Own your photos.
Are they allowed to use whatever?

911
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Oh,
they recently they updated their tos 

912
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,821
because they said that and then people 
freaked out and then they monitored it 

913
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:04,181
and I'm not,
I'm not sure what the current state of 

914
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:04,181
their terms of services,
but uh,

915
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:08,830
honestly instagram is probably my 
favorite social network outside of 

916
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,700
youtube because it's streamlined.
It's images,

917
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,410
it's fast,
it's not too much.

918
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,930
Facebook is a disaster,
you know,

919
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:20,110
and I mean,
I'm pretty sure that's why they 

920
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,110
purchased them.
For example,

921
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,570
if I put a picture on Instagram from an 
interactivity stamp,

922
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,020
this is how,
you know,

923
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,850
software is working when people want to 
use it.

924
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,090
If I put a picture on Instagram,
I think the comment stream is happening 

925
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:28,670
faster than anywhere else,
even though I don't have the same number

926
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,671
of followers.
There were a lot of douchebags on 

927
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:33,671
instagram though.
Oh,

928
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:35,240
maybe more than on twitter.
Oh yeah.

929
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,850
Lauren,
can we do a Douche bag?

930
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,720
Is Definition when you say douchebag 
there,

931
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,200
I'm curious as to the what specifically?
Just dumb assholes.

932
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,620
Oh,
okay.

933
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,540
Dot.
Oh yeah.

934
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:51,541
Lots of the assholes.
Like you ever go to Kim Kardashians 

935
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,180
instagram page,
none of them a little weasel.

936
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,640
Go there and just read some of the 
fucking comments about children.

937
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,480
Anything.
Anything that's a fucking.

938
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,610
Hey,
I'm sure it's.

939
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,890
I'm sure it's there.
Diluted Youtube.

940
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,980
It's because it's you're,
you're,

941
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:09,981
you're commenting on a photo or a video 
instead of a twitter where you're just 

942
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:11,750
talking about words.
I honestly think anything worth anything

943
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,370
should be comments,
deleted,

944
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,290
comics disabled,
because the problem is they very rarely,

945
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,510
it's,
it's rare that you.

946
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,810
It generates a really fascinating 
conversation in the comments.

947
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,650
It's super common.
That is just shitheads.

948
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,060
It depends on the subject matter.
In my case,

949
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:31,250
sometimes I do get relevant discussion 
in the comments,

950
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,640
a tech discussion,
like they're pretty respectful,

951
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:37,520
but you do get this weird fanboys and 
stuff that gets militant.

952
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,070
Surprisingly.
It's like a more way.

953
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,080
I don't know.
I have this theory like,

954
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,420
you know when you go to a coffee shop 
and you look around you at starbucks,

955
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,510
everyone has their phones on the table.
You notice that like it's in a public 

956
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:52,510
space.
It's like,

957
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,930
it's like representative of you in some 
way and I have this feeling that this is

958
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,750
for a lot of people,
this is a major investment,

959
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:01,400
you know,
outside of their car or whatever.

960
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,260
It's really close to you.
It's in your pocket all the time.

961
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,530
And so I think people are really 
concerned with making the wrong 

962
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:08,530
decision,
you know,

963
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,310
they're really concerned that their 
thing is not the best.

964
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,880
And so in my case,
what will happen is I'll put up a video 

965
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:15,880
within,
you know,

966
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,200
they haven't even had time to finish 
watching it and apple socs or android 

967
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,320
sucks or whatever.
And really it's fear.

968
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,340
It's fear that you made the wrong 
decision and so,

969
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,140
well,
like many places in life,

970
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:29,450
you get angry when you're afraid.
And so,

971
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,630
God forbid a new product comes out that 
obsoletes yours and you don't have the 

972
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,850
money to replace it.
So you,

973
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,920
you,
you take this position of defending the 

974
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,770
other thing because that's easier than 
justifying the cost of the new one.

975
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,990
So,
uh,

976
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,810
I've,
I've actually,

977
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,890
uh,
there were a couple of really cool 

978
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,190
articles on Fanboy ism that I was 
interviewed for and you know,

979
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,980
we went,
we went deep into how,

980
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,840
you know,
how people sort of figure that out.

981
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:57,170
But uh,
there's definitely this undercurrent 

982
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,130
below the tech space,
the consumer product space where these 

983
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,430
are becoming more and more like fashion 
symbols,

984
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:04,080
like,
like a,

985
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,590
you know,
rep,

986
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,280
representative of your personality maybe
more so than this then as a tool,

987
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:08,850
you know,
less,

988
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,360
less of a hammer and more like a,
a piece of jewelry,

989
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,140
like a watch or something.

990
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,050
Isn't it also that people just love 
being on teams,

991
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,140
whether it's team.
Oh,

992
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,000
Publican team shelly most,
most definitely.

993
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:23,190
And I've done some rants on this in the 
past.

994
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:28,191
Like I,
I feel the need to tell people like I'm 

995
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,191
a fan of technology when I was coming up
as a kid,

996
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,750
like if anybody brought me any of this 
stuff I would,

997
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,320
I would be super excited of course.
And I'm cool with saying that,

998
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,300
you know,
but uh,

999
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,650
but yeah,
there is,

1000
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,890
there is definitely a team aspect where 
people,

1001
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:45,210
they want to belong to something I say 
belong to team technology if that's what

1002
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:50,211
you're into because the truth is these 
devices and these platforms push one 

1003
00:45:50,211 --> 00:45:54,261
another that the positive things that 
happened in android push ios to be 

1004
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:58,791
better in the positive things that 
happened in Ios push android to be 

1005
00:45:58,791 --> 00:45:59,490
better.
And the same thing goes for laptops,

1006
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,570
desktops really anywhere.

1007
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:05,570
There's innovation.
Having a little bit of competition is a 

1008
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:05,570
positive thing.
Yeah,

1009
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,831
unquestionably.
And I think that it's important that 

1010
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:11,340
there's all this competition out there 
and it's important that there's debate,

1011
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:15,050
but people just have to be good is just 
assholes.

1012
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,680
So solar,
that's true as well.

1013
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,970
Really what it is,
they're out there.

1014
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
People just getting off slobber mouth.
Well if there their various platforms 

1015
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,650
need to do right,
getting angry is probably the easiest 

1016
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:27,650
thing to do.
You know,

1017
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,240
like I mean in terms of emotions,
anger is,

1018
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:33,600
is a reaction that people that don't 
have the ability to process something,

1019
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,370
they choose anger.
It's the easiest one.

1020
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,020
So,
but yeah,

1021
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:40,770
any kind of like those,
those are not the dominating comments.

1022
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:45,771
I not definitely not on my stuff.
The dominating ones are more along the 

1023
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:47,130
lines of uh,
you know,

1024
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,720
like I said,
technology in general,

1025
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:49,890
being happy about innovation.

1026
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,890
You post a new unboxing video of one of 
these things and everybody's cool with 

1027
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,011
it and everybody's interested and that's
part of the reason why people watch my 

1028
00:46:58,011 --> 00:46:58,740
videos is because they sort of want to 
see.

1029
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,810
They want to see the whole movement of 
the place in general.

1030
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:03,210
Like I could,
it could have been an apple channel.

1031
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,160
A lot of people do that,
like they'll have like an,

1032
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,220
an ios related channel,
whether they'll do app reviews 

1033
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,220
specifically for a platform or 
something.

1034
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,320
But,
uh,

1035
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:15,620
but yeah,
I don't want to give them a bad rap 

1036
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:15,620
completely.
They're not all Douche bag.

1037
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:15,620
No,
no,

1038
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:15,620
no,
there's not.

1039
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,680
Yeah.
I mean it's a small,

1040
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:18,510
loud minority really.
I mean,

1041
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:21,960
but that loud minority can ruin.
That's a problem.

1042
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,040
I mean a youtube implemented this idea 
where you have your real name,

1043
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,380
that's a great idea.
You know,

1044
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,110
I love that idea.
They show a fucking picture of you two

1045
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,530
and a picture of you when you wake up in
the morning.

1046
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:36,580
What the fuck.
So and so cocky now about Kim Kardashian

1047
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,220
run little cute.
So yeah,

1048
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,700
I mean that's one way to remove 
anonymity on the web,

1049
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:44,710
but a lot of people don't necessarily 
like,

1050
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,060
like for example,
on Reddit.

1051
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,120
I mean,
could there ever be your real identity 

1052
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,120
on reddit?
That's interesting.

1053
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,120
You know,
there's,

1054
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,900
there's benefits,
there's pros and cons.

1055
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:57,901
There's benefits to anonymity because a 
lot of times you'll get truth that 

1056
00:47:57,901 --> 00:47:59,430
someone might shield from you because of
the social stigma,

1057
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,690
you know,
just social cues and interactions.

1058
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:03,320
They might just back off of it and go 
out.

1059
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,800
I wasn't honest with them.
If you go to see someone in a movie,

1060
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,150
you know,
like when you think man,

1061
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:11,260
like Oh fucking piece of shit to say 
that you go home,

1062
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,400
it's pretty fucking good man.

1063
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,390
If you were a random guy that there's so
many things wrong with this movie,

1064
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:19,000
they should burn it on the Marae for 
sure.

1065
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,550
Say something like that.
And you would really mean that.

1066
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,910
So I don't know.
Do you think that things are better for 

1067
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,350
people having that ability or would they
be better in the alternative space where

1068
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,300
you.
Because you know anyways,

1069
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:36,301
right when somebody really isn't into 
something they don't really need to say 

1070
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:36,301
it.
Do they know?

1071
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:36,820
You know,
you can feel it,

1072
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:41,020
but I think that interaction in general,
I think first of all,

1073
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:46,140
I think this stage that we're in this 
stage of commenting and being able to 

1074
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,840
interact with people online,
just like you put up a video,

1075
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,050
they could just shit all over your face.
You know the face guys doing something.

1076
00:48:56,681 --> 00:49:01,681
Anything.
Just decide that this is a new ability 

1077
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:01,681
that's never existed.

1078
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:04,090
A decade ago,
two decades ago,

1079
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:06,250
there was nothing remotely similar to 
this.

1080
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:11,370
Not that we don't really know how to 
deal with it and there's so many people 

1081
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,640
that just get away with doing things on 
it.

1082
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,820
They would never do in real life share 
just because they really shouldn't have 

1083
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:17,820
that ability.
It's not a natural ability.

1084
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:22,910
The natural ability to communicate with 
each other is it's an ebb and flow 

1085
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,280
interact.
It's not send a missile and sit back and

1086
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:26,440
wait to explode.
Well,

1087
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,100
that's the thing.
I mean,

1088
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,110
not that you have the art form of 
trolling,

1089
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:32,260
like that's a whole thing and it is an 
art form when done.

1090
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:37,261
Well,
I mean it's sometimes there's this new 

1091
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:40,921
website that I just started following or
new twitter feed that I just started 

1092
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:40,921
following.
It's a total troll.

1093
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:42,490
It's kind of a parody account.
Troll,

1094
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:44,680
but it,
it turns into a troll.

1095
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,070
I shot almost not say the name.
Anybody.

1096
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,080
Yeah.
Well fuck it.

1097
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:52,210
It's,
it's all about salon.com

1098
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,660
and it's salon like their,
their twitter handle.

1099
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:59,140
I think his salon.com,
like there's salon.

1100
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,320
That is one.
Twitter handle their salon.com.

1101
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:07,321
Hello?
Say I'll find out who it is on salon is 

1102
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:10,180
the official verified one.
Exactly,

1103
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,810
exactly.
It's called Salon yet.

1104
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,940
Salon.com
and it's hilarious.

1105
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,830
It's.
It's really funny.

1106
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,320
The unfortunate part of that is them 
using that name.

1107
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:25,321
Maybe a problem in the long run.
You're the one that you're want to 

1108
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,500
announce that.
Listen,

1109
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,710
they need more people.
It's.

1110
00:50:28,711 --> 00:50:30,650
It's really funny.
There was a,

1111
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,480
there was one about a kid,
a misogynist superheroes,

1112
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,300
why?
Men's rights activists are wearing capes

1113
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,390
and they're just trolling.
It's really funny,

1114
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,040
man.
Yeah.

1115
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,600
If it's sophisticated and well thought 
out,

1116
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,220
it's acceptable.
In my opinion,

1117
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,250
Gary,
the six most popular video games that 

1118
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:54,250
allow you to kill female players online.

1119
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,820
Uh,
the last antisemitic slur.

1120
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:01,250
We need to stop using the j word 
already.

1121
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,510
Oh,
they're just trolling.

1122
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,150
This is good.
That's gold.

1123
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,850
I like this kind of trolling because if 
you go to the fucking comments,

1124
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,880
God,
there's a lot of people that do not 

1125
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:12,880
think this is trolling.
Really?

1126
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:12,880
Isn't this the kind of trolling you 
eight.

1127
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,210
Awesome.
Well,

1128
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:16,040
no,
because this is obvious,

1129
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:21,310
but mom errands or gay for 10 year olds 
vile rant to proves what a homophobic 

1130
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:26,141
patriarchy we live in.
I think it.

1131
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,360
I think there's a place for it.
This place.

1132
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,660
Come on,
man.

1133
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:35,240
Anybody fucking reading that?
If it's look,

1134
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,510
you don't deserve to be able to come and
it should be your,

1135
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,890
your test.
If you really believe this,

1136
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:41,780
you either not paying attention like 
you're half awake.

1137
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,410
How do you feel about that?
How do you feel about this?

1138
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:50,411
What if,
what if there was some like reputation 

1139
00:51:50,411 --> 00:51:52,421
attached to your name,
like because that's essentially what's 

1140
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:52,421
happening on Youtube,
right?

1141
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:55,940
Right.
If you log onto a video and it happens 

1142
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,150
to be somebody in your google plus 
circles,

1143
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:58,270
for example,
they'll rise to the top of the.

1144
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,710
Well,
that's why you shouldn't use google plus

1145
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:04,250
because that's retarded.
You don't have a choice for commenting.

1146
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:06,430
Now,
10 signs your cat might be racist.

1147
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,220
Look,
you know,

1148
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,280
there's.
There's a bunch of different ways to 

1149
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,280
look at it.
I don't think there's any,

1150
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,210
there's any absolute,
but I think ultimately the real issue is

1151
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:25,010
that we're just not used to this kind of
freedom,

1152
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,340
this freedom of communication and 
freedom of interaction,

1153
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,730
freedom of reaching people,
feeding them.

1154
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,820
You mean there's websites dedicated to 
just like anything.

1155
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,670
Like you could reach people,
you can contact people,

1156
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,320
you could comment on people,
you could,

1157
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,660
you could start your own website and 
boom,

1158
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:42,890
people comment on you.
Me,

1159
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,540
this kind of interaction.
It's just,

1160
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,410
it's completely.
It's an adolescent thing,

1161
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,580
so when you have cases like that guy 
that got fired because they outed him on

1162
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:57,581
Reddit,
he used to do a lot of creepy shit on 

1163
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:57,581
reddit.
I remember that guy in Texas,

1164
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:57,990
I believe he lived.
Yeah,

1165
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,130
his name was something acres or 
something.

1166
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,280
Um,
and it was a really interesting debate 

1167
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,860
because obviously the guy was really 
creepy online,

1168
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,400
but to him it was like a role that he 
was playing to him.

1169
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:15,401
He got enjoyment out of this trolling 
and posting pictures of dead people and 

1170
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,320
whatever the fuck he was doing.
His big one was creep shots,

1171
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,270
right?
I think so,

1172
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,300
like an up the skirt type picture,
which surprisingly,

1173
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,100
for a long time if you searched for

1174
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,580
reddit it was the top hit was like slash
creeps shots.

1175
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,550
So I want to know who's searching reddit
for creep shots.

1176
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,900
No,
they.

1177
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:37,910
But here's the thing.
They banked a lot of dough on that guys 

1178
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,910
work,

1179
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,910
right?
Oh,

1180
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:38,780
read it did.
Of course,

1181
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:43,810
if they're,
if they're accumulating traffic through 

1182
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:43,810
Google searches right to that particular
thread,

1183
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,980
ultimately they earn money through 
advertising revenue.

1184
00:53:45,981 --> 00:53:49,160
Like anyone else keeping people.
They're going to write,

1185
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:52,000
but they're an open forum.
Completely Open Forum.

1186
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,920
Not Completely.
Not completely because of moderated.

1187
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Is that what you mean?
So you're saying that by them 

1188
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,490
tolerating.
If so,

1189
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,610
if it could be proved to the stollery 
though he got,

1190
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,320
he got a,
a red or a trophy,

1191
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,570
a statute for being one of the best 
moderators.

1192
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,900
Uh,
and he did a lot of ups shots.

1193
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:17,170
Yeah.
Creep shots was I think maybe the most 

1194
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:17,170
famous thread or a subreddit.
Sorry.

1195
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,460
Oh No.
He ran a subreddit called creep shots 

1196
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460
shots.
And there was another one.

1197
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,460
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1198
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,070
Wait.
So reddit knew about the subreddit?

1199
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,620
Yeah.
Oh,

1200
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,800
that shit's sexy.
I don't care what you guys all.

1201
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,920
Kilts.
All Scottish.

1202
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,040
Still a,
you know,

1203
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,110
like the idea,
the under age ones though.

1204
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:39,820
He was also on.
So I'm under 18 only and I think,

1205
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:44,500
I believe the goal was to attempt to 
harvest pictures from girls,

1206
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:47,560
facebook accounts.
So you would pretend to be,

1207
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,930
you'd have like one of their friend's 
profile pictures.

1208
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,240
You'd beat somebody at their school or I
don't fake it,

1209
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,870
get access and then pulled.
Pulled down the facebook photos and 

1210
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,240
upload them to the girls.
Had no idea they were showing up on this

1211
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,550
subreddit until they found out at school
the next day.

1212
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,630
Damn,
that is so fucked up.

1213
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:04,820
And that was a grown man doing that to a
little girl.

1214
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:09,850
And guess what the moderator's job was 
to remove pictures of girls that look 

1215
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,260
too old.
Oh my God.

1216
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,070
So what do you think about that?
What's your thoughts about that?

1217
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:16,720
I,

1218
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,710
I have a love hate relationship with 
reddit.

1219
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:24,740
Like this idea that,
that it's an open forum is one that 

1220
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,430
everybody believes,
but the vast majority of reddit users or

1221
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:29,640
consumers and producers right there just
user to consume content.

1222
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:32,850
You would never know if you're actually 
seeing an open forum or not.

1223
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,040
You're not managing it in any way.
So,

1224
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:40,100
uh,
they're like super against self 

1225
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,100
promotion.
Right?

1226
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,780
And this is how I've bumped into them a 
number of times because I'll tweet out 

1227
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:44,780
if somebody's talking about me on 
Reddit,

1228
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,570
I'll tweet the link right on numerous 
occasions tweeting that link brought the

1229
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:49,230
whole post down.

1230
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,220
Wow.

1231
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,440
I just stayed in my sobriety.
I don't go out of Reddit March.

1232
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,750
I think it's good for certain things 
like,

1233
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,800
like I use it for episode discussions,
a podcast,

1234
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:06,050
the subreddit and Joe suburbs.
Still human beings.

1235
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,920
There's obviously cool people.
They're like,

1236
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:12,950
that's not up for discussion,
but these veiled moderators in the 

1237
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,430
background Canis essentially shape your 
experience.

1238
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:14,730
There

1239
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,950
is also been issues with censorship.
Alexis Ohanian,

1240
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:23,951
when he was on the podcast,
talked about issues of things being 

1241
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,550
censored,
a technology forums.

1242
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,540
Oh,
definitely.

1243
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah,
yeah,

1244
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,090
yeah.
Certain certain keywords.

1245
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,150
Yeah.
Certain keywords would knock the post 

1246
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:33,150
down immediately.
You couldn't type in those keywords.

1247
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,690
Bull or whatever.
I strange list of keyword.

1248
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,670
Someone did a little investigation on 
it.

1249
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,500
They did a little study.

1250
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,440
I wonder if that's still the case.
I haven't attempted it.

1251
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,880
We actually found this out.
I believe it was after Alexis was here,

1252
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:45,620
so we didn't get a chance to ask him.
Yeah,

1253
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,030
yeah,
yeah.

1254
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:52,031
I mean,
if they're making money off of the fact 

1255
00:56:52,031 --> 00:56:55,931
that their forum gets a tremendous 
amount of traffic and you have a 

1256
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:58,100
subreddit that you're aware of,
someone must be aware of that,

1257
00:56:58,101 --> 00:56:59,000
correct?
Oh,

1258
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:00,350
definitely.
It's not there anymore,

1259
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:05,380
but how crazy is that?
The you're censoring things like the 

1260
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,970
word apple or Samsung or whatever,
whatever the technology words are,

1261
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,080
you're censoring that,
but you're not censoring obscured shots 

1262
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,080
of 18 year old.
Here's the thing on fishing,

1263
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,980
an 18 year old girls don't buy ads,
right?

1264
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,930
It's the free promotion.
They don't want.

1265
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,380
They don't want people come.
They don't want people hacking their 

1266
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,251
system in a way finding a way to get 
exposure through their platform without 

1267
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:28,251
paying for it.
Right?

1268
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:28,650
So,
you know,

1269
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,450
twitter,
facebook,

1270
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,040
doing the same thing.
Now if facebook promoted posts,

1271
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,870
I don't know how active you guys are on 
facebook,

1272
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,220
but uh,
you know,

1273
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:37,350
your post is reaching what,
like five,

1274
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:41,340
10 percent of the actual audience that 
signed up to see your posts and Oh,

1275
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:42,900
you want to reach more,
pay US money,

1276
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,310
right?
That's,

1277
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:49,330
that's inevitably where we end up on any
of this shit is that eventually they 

1278
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:49,890
hook you and then they find a way to 
monetize.

1279
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,410
What do you,
how do you feel about bitcoin?

1280
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,970
How do you feel about electronic 
currency and love it.

1281
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,080
Love it.
Super Cool.

1282
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,320
Fascinating.
Right?

1283
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,070
I think,
oh yeah,

1284
00:57:59,071 --> 00:57:59,560
I don't,
I,

1285
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,510
I'm not an expert,
but I think that money is super low tech

1286
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:05,340
right now.
Money socks right now,

1287
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:10,510
like this idea that there's this 
intermediary body that needs to sit in 

1288
00:58:10,561 --> 00:58:13,620
between you and I,
if we want to exchange money that that's

1289
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:18,621
bizarre in today's Day and age.
I mean I can send you email that can be 

1290
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:18,621
encrypted and here's how,
you know,

1291
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,890
it's fucked.
They have all the money

1292
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,560
deal is rigged.
It's messed up.

1293
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,200
What they're providing is really not 
that big of a deal.

1294
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,040
Are they storing,
what do they do?

1295
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,500
Their processing a bunch of things 
mostly in computers today.

1296
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:33,610
And that's

1297
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:38,610
what bitcoin proved.
Bitcoin proved it because bitcoin was 

1298
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,230
able to process transactions on an 
enormous scale that was bigger than a,

1299
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:45,610
than an independent institution and they
were able to do it in a,

1300
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:46,300
uh,
in a,

1301
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:51,301
in a fashion that's completely secure 
and they were able to do it for free 

1302
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:52,960
without any kind of venture capital.
Right?

1303
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,380
If he didn't like you,
think about the fees you paid or how big

1304
00:58:56,381 --> 00:59:01,381
the banks or go to any city.
The biggest skyscrapers or the big 

1305
00:59:01,381 --> 00:59:01,381
banks,
right?

1306
00:59:01,381 --> 00:59:03,490
Insurance companies,
financial institutions,

1307
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,520
crooks,
all the crooks in their big fucking 

1308
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:08,520
capital.
I mean,

1309
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,660
you think about a bitcoin came out and 
out and all those guys,

1310
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,610
but in a way because it said you don't,
you don't need to take all this money to

1311
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,190
achieve the transaction to achieve the 
end game,

1312
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:19,360
you know.
So,

1313
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,320
uh,
I mean,

1314
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:20,620
um,
yeah,

1315
00:59:20,621 --> 00:59:22,850
I'm a big fan of alternative currencies 
in general.

1316
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,580
I don't know if it's going to be bitcoin
or something else.

1317
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:29,550
We're probably at a super early point 
right now with it and it's,

1318
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,580
uh,
it's going to be,

1319
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:35,610
you know,
it's hard at any time when you're 

1320
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:35,660
looking at something in its earliest 
form to see the end game to see where it

1321
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:37,220
ends up.
But uh,

1322
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,660
you know,
when the first,

1323
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:43,661
like for example,
when the first iphone jumped on the 

1324
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:43,730
scene,
I'll never forget that moment you before

1325
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:46,190
that,
the devices before that and after that,

1326
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,220
how much they changed in an instant.
And so I feel like once when there's 

1327
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,661
some big dynamic moment that that 
bitcoin is able to achieve or 

1328
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:59,201
alternative currencies are able to 
achieve some really cool feature where 

1329
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:02,381
we can tap watches and spend money and 
we never have to pull anything out of 

1330
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:02,510
our pocket like the starbucks APP.

1331
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,810
I'm using that shit all the time.
Do you,

1332
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:09,811
um,
is it one of those things that pull you 

1333
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:09,811
scan?
So yeah.

1334
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:11,480
So what it is is like you can,
you don't have to,

1335
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:15,050
but you put in your favorite locations 
and when it sends its proximity nearby,

1336
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,080
you just swipe over and as a barcode and
you're done or you could just shake it.

1337
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,840
Now the new,
the latest one you can shake and it just

1338
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:22,650
brings up your payment.
And uh,

1339
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,240
it collects your,
you know,

1340
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,240
every 10 times you get a free drink 
loyalty programs and then also gives you

1341
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,700
free music and free apps.
I mean that starbucks did their APP,

1342
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:32,390
right?
Oh,

1343
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:35,370
the starbucks happens every 10 times.
You get a free one every time.

1344
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:36,870
Amazing.
Yeah,

1345
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,870
that's incredible.
Automatically uploads.

1346
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:40,480
So like you'll always have,
you know,

1347
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:45,570
the thing,
the thing is like in the past I've been 

1348
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:45,890
so reluctant to do rewards programs like
this.

1349
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,890
So bizarre.
You're at a department store and it's 

1350
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,240
like every thousand dollars you get to 
earn a dollar.

1351
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,820
It's like Oh fuck it,
I don't care.

1352
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,440
But this one,
they,

1353
01:00:55,450 --> 01:01:00,450
they,
they made it in such a way that it's a 

1354
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:00,450
more convenient purchasing process.
So it's like,

1355
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,840
oh,
I'll take the loyalty on the side to 

1356
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:04,840
side deal.
Not,

1357
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,020
that's a cool way of looking at it too.
That's nice that they did that.

1358
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:07,820
That's so clever.
And 10 to one,

1359
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:11,480
it's like a really good ratio.
Like by 10 drinks you get one free.

1360
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,020
That's really,
really is it 10,

1361
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,910
10.
And you get to get whatever you want.

1362
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,370
So that's when you go.
I'll have seven shots.

1363
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Chocolate by throwing and I know it's 
not even a commensurate drank so he 

1364
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:29,990
could buy like five shots of Espresso 
and I've done it before.

1365
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,280
You can get a super drink and they give 
you one on your birthday as well to give

1366
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:34,660
you a.

1367
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,100
because of the APP,
the APP,

1368
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:41,110
just tell them they go get a free drink.
So when you're at the store you hit the 

1369
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,420
APP and then just shake it and then it 
pays for the world's getting ridiculous.

1370
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,780
How do you feel about Google glass?
Actually,

1371
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:52,781
that's a good.
That's a good thing to talk about 

1372
01:01:52,781 --> 01:01:52,781
because I feel like these are the 
interim glass.

1373
01:01:52,781 --> 01:01:57,040
These watches interim that's going to 
get you to a glass one day glasses.

1374
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,550
Nowhere near ready for mass mass 
consumption it.

1375
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,040
Well it's $1,500
first of all,

1376
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,680
uh,
which to some people might see,

1377
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,110
might not seem like a huge hurdle,
but it's gigantic.

1378
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:14,350
And second of all it's obtrusive.
Like I just got back from San Francisco 

1379
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:14,740
where there's,
you know,

1380
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,780
glasses,
there's a huge percentage of people 

1381
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,931
wearing glass.
Didn't someone get in trouble for 

1382
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:22,931
driving with

1383
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:22,931
them on.
I didn't hear that story,

1384
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:24,870
but I think they could imagine.
I think they had to drop the case.

1385
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,430
Right.
But the thing the guy got in trouble for

1386
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:29,490
driving with the mom because they were 
saying that he was using was driving.

1387
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:34,620
I'm sure that's happened.
I know some bars have outlawed them 

1388
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:34,620
should.
Yeah,

1389
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,550
that's fucking cool.
They have those weird cameras you can 

1390
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,061
buy that look like buttons.
They have those and they'll also have 

1391
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:41,190
stan hope used.
Stan hope had a,

1392
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:46,191
a,
a hidden camera show for awhile and he 

1393
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:46,191
had glasses.
This was a long fucking time ago.

1394
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:46,600
Camera.
The.

1395
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,110
Yeah.
I want to say this isn't the nineties.

1396
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Might've been the nineties.
Doug had a really funny fucking like 

1397
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,920
hidden camera show and one of the things
he did is he had these glasses and there

1398
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:59,130
just like this little center thing and 
you couldn't tell.

1399
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:00,540
Oh,
definitely the.

1400
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,880
So that's.
That already exists.

1401
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,660
Yup.
Yeah.

1402
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,070
But anyway,
in.

1403
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,100
Yeah,
in the case of glass I don't.

1404
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,200
There's this really weird experience if 
you,

1405
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,420
if you own it,
you can't really wear it.

1406
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,200
If you go out wearing that,
some people have no problem doing it,

1407
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:21,201
but it becomes the whole event.
Everybody wants to ask about it or try.

1408
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:23,300
It may not nuts.
Maybe not so much anymore,

1409
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,730
but it's just not a.
there's something wrong with it.

1410
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:28,860
I don't know what it's hard to pinpoint.
Right.

1411
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:30,930
But if I came in here wearing glass 
immediately,

1412
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:35,931
you would go work.
He would have a different perception of 

1413
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:35,931
me.
Yes.

1414
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:38,310
And I don't think we're ready to make 
that kind of a statement.

1415
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,110
I think it's going to have to look up 
your glasses.

1416
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:40,730
Yeah,
it'll have.

1417
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,460
It'll have to be regular glasses and a 
game.

1418
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,640
It's got to be.
I mean,

1419
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:47,190
as things get smaller and smaller,
that shouldn't be prohibitive.

1420
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,420
Right.
Just the,

1421
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:51,360
the lenses themselves though,
the bars on the side of the lenses.

1422
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,180
Just some sort of like right now it's a 
little oversized.

1423
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:55,390
And you swipe it.
Yeah.

1424
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,550
You know,
and I've done it.

1425
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:57,660
Yeah,
I didn't like it.

1426
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,170
No,
no,

1427
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:58,450
no.
It's,

1428
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:03,451
it felt silly to me.
I don't want this thing in front of my 

1429
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:03,451
face.
Right?

1430
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.
And there's this prism and I actually 

1431
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,420
got the version,
but I wear sunglasses all the time.

1432
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,070
So if I went out and I had no navigation
in my car,

1433
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:14,160
I just slap these bitches on and I see 
everything that's coming at me.

1434
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:17,670
I see the weather up here for sure.
I mean that would be the shit.

1435
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,590
Why haven't they done this shit?
I haven't.

1436
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:24,591
They just created some dope ass Oakley 
style sunglasses that have a fucking 

1437
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:24,900
screen in it.

1438
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,900
Like your goddamn movie theater and I'm 
driving around and all my information 

1439
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,530
you're done with your girlfriends is 
right over here.

1440
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,540
That's what.
That's what every year at target.

1441
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:39,020
I think what it's going to be like.
We're all gonna have our own google 

1442
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,721
glasses,
but it's also going to have something 

1443
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:41,721
that broadcast is our Avatar,
so it's not going to.

1444
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:43,850
We're going to feel comfortable.
You recording me because you're acting.

1445
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:47,280
My face is going to be replaced with a 
cat face and my voice has to be replaced

1446
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:49,430
with something else.
That's just your retarded world.

1447
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,250
No one's buying it the fuck out of here.
Some ways there's like a,

1448
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,380
there's a,
there's a race between,

1449
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:59,560
between a glass and other forms of 
augmented reality to like,

1450
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,350
uh,
like this thing I brought over here,

1451
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:06,530
this little piece of cardboard,
but ultimately isn't like glasses the 

1452
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,210
most convenient to have more common 
because people have all the time anyway.

1453
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,110
Oh No,
definitely.

1454
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:10,680
What is this,
Brian?

1455
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:12,750
What do you got here?
This is Oakley airwaves,

1456
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:14,670
which is kind of like their version of 
like,

1457
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,930
I dunno like a google glass where it 
has.

1458
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,100
It's like

1459
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,160
a ski goggles to drive around with 
those.

1460
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:26,060
That is.
That's when I said that the,

1461
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:27,190
the,
the privacy.

1462
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,970
A face.
That's what I was kind of pulled up.

1463
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,370
That it has navigation.
Yeah.

1464
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,630
Wait a minute.
Back that up.

1465
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,470
It has fucking navigation and your ski 
gone.

1466
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,060
Do you want to listen to this?
The fuck can't play that shit.

1467
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:45,061
Okay.
That's the craziest thing I've ever 

1468
01:05:45,061 --> 01:05:45,061
heard in my life.
If we can get this to work,

1469
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,550
that's amazing.

1470
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:54,560
Airways.
One point five technology that delivers 

1471
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,601
the goods straight to your brain.
So what we're seeing right now is the 

1472
01:05:57,601 --> 01:06:00,571
speed.
How fast you're going out to the Albert 

1473
01:06:00,571 --> 01:06:01,900
who'd vertical,
your jump analytics.

1474
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,960
So how high you're jumping and it's 
showing as you're looking down the 

1475
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,951
speed,
your air time buddy.

1476
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:16,621
Tracking your phone.
You can play music with this fucking 

1477
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:17,320
thing.
You're getting text messages,

1478
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,360
looking at your navigation screen,
looking at your,

1479
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,740
you picking your music.
All dog shit music.

1480
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,440
Jesus Christ.
I guess it's cool tech.

1481
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:29,070
Better skier skiing.
Fuck

1482
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:34,230
man.
How are you interacting with all that 

1483
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,230
stuff?

1484
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,750
Um,
poorly trees.

1485
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,160
Sonny Bono in yourself.
Left and the right.

1486
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,460
We'll get the fucking.
Oh,

1487
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:41,320
it slips off different lenses.
Yeah.

1488
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,510
You can put on sunglasses.
Do you can go terminator style.

1489
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,980
I think I'm just going to wear this 
little mall.

1490
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,840
That's what I'm saying.
Is this the Paparazzi glasses thing that

1491
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:52,250
I was talking about?
Like it's going to be the star wars now.

1492
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:57,251
He's had a really big one that went over
your whole face that pitches smart with 

1493
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,260
that idea.
This is amazing man.

1494
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:00,270
But if you're a skier,
ski Brian.

1495
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,800
Yeah,
go skiing.

1496
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:03,120
I used to be in ski club.
Dude.

1497
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,370
Ski with one of these bitches on God 
down.

1498
01:07:05,371 --> 01:07:07,800
That'd be cool as fuck.
That's amazing.

1499
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:08,980
Oakley.
Fuck you.

1500
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,290
Oakley.
Oakley.com.

1501
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,520
Airwave,
if you want to watch it.

1502
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:12,390
If you're listening to.
Cool.

1503
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,640
That's amazing.
What a great idea.

1504
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,650
It's only a matter of time before 
someone did that.

1505
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:18,480
That's way better than Google.
$600.

1506
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:20,460
I ain't had.
Yeah,

1507
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:25,490
that's not bad.
That's way better than Google glass 

1508
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:27,840
sometimes.
Feel like when I watched those promos 

1509
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:27,960
though,
that it's bullshit and you should be you

1510
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:28,740
doing it.
Well,

1511
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:30,780
you know that's what you do.
That's what I do,

1512
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:32,400
man.
I take the bullshit out of it.

1513
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,130
What's been the most disappointing 
product that you had to do that too?

1514
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:40,810
Wow.
That was your one product that you 

1515
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:40,810
sometimes like trying to think right 
now.

1516
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,220
Somebody's like,
oh,

1517
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:46,221
I hope sometimes it's so shit that I,
I wouldn't even want to give it the 

1518
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,580
exposure,
you know,

1519
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,460
that's smart.
Like what?

1520
01:07:50,461 --> 01:07:52,500
Give me an example of that so we can 
give him some exposure.

1521
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,790
Some guy.
I hate doing this though.

1522
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,170
Some guys.
It's like the dream.

1523
01:07:58,171 --> 01:08:00,930
They got like a pro product.
Fuck them.

1524
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:03,720
They're shitty ideas.
One guy had,

1525
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:08,130
this was back in the day and when a lot 
of people were into like,

1526
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,760
like little docking stands for your 
phones and shit like that.

1527
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,120
And some guy had one kind of like 
essentially glued onto your phone like 

1528
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,830
this sloppy material.
I regretted it immediately.

1529
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,960
I was upset.
So that's an example.

1530
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,660
So you put it on your phone?
Yeah,

1531
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:26,180
yeah,
yeah.

1532
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,360
Oh,
how'd you cleaned it off?

1533
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,010
Like rubbing on?
Yeah,

1534
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,620
that's it.
So glue was glorious thing.

1535
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,400
Shitty gluten.
No,

1536
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,810
I mean,
let me think.

1537
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:38,500
Chinese big time stuff like.
Oh,

1538
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,640
or a laptop?
That was dog shit.

1539
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,950
Oh Wow.
You want to go there?

1540
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,210
I do want to go there.
I was upset with my playstation four 

1541
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,480
really come because the controllers are 
not very durable.

1542
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,580
I had within,
within a few weeks I had the,

1543
01:08:54,581 --> 01:08:59,581
uh,
the rubber from the thumb sticks 

1544
01:08:59,581 --> 01:08:59,581
starting to degenerate.
I posted a video.

1545
01:08:59,581 --> 01:09:01,340
It has almost a million views.
Oh my goodness.

1546
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,220
I tell you when I'm sick of Berenger 
mixers,

1547
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:10,090
I found out that Berenger as a company,
I've always used [inaudible] because I 

1548
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:11,080
always go to the budget and budget 
stuff.

1549
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,390
German brands.
It was created Germany,

1550
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:16,100
right?
Or something like that.

1551
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:19,090
I think they just use a German.
So hilarious.

1552
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,640
Brian's done.
His research pro.

1553
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,280
You always use German.
Wait,

1554
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:24,500
what?
I don't know if it's that.

1555
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,020
I'm pretty sure it's not German.
There's been.

1556
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:31,021
No,
actually it was just the first mixer 

1557
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:31,021
every got.
Sorry,

1558
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:31,021
I just went with it,
but I had to.

1559
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:35,300
I haven't had to replace,
like I've spent more on mixers in the 

1560
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:35,420
last five years and then I researched 
it.

1561
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,560
Podcast mics,
stairs.

1562
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,260
I just had to replace my third one and 
this time I went with the Yamaha,

1563
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,890
just whatever.
But uh,

1564
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:46,030
I found out that there's like class,
like in the past they've had lawsuits 

1565
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:49,660
and stuff are pretty much they just take
a good concert and just copy it was 

1566
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,351
shitty parts,
like the first version of like when you 

1567
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:53,600
go get a,
a fake iphone in China,

1568
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:56,420
it's the exact same shit.
But like I,

1569
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,220
I went to guitar center the other day 
and they're like,

1570
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,060
yeah,
we uh,

1571
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:04,090
we stopped carrying all of or because 
this and I just now found out after 

1572
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:07,450
spending so much money on Berenger and 
having so much shit fry out.

1573
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,100
Do you want to do so?
Yamaha is a good move though,

1574
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:11,150
right?
Omaha is pretty good.

1575
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:13,160
There's something with an m I can't 
remember.

1576
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:18,161
Like Moki Makie.
Makie supposedly is what everyone else 

1577
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:18,161
loves.

1578
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:18,680
How many times have you burned out?
What is,

1579
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,750
what do we have here?
What is that?

1580
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,320
This is a parent in church and the 
headphone,

1581
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,620
but yeah,
the,

1582
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,710
I've replaced three,
uh,

1583
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,780
like 400,
$500 mixers in the last two years.

1584
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:34,781
Three years down the headphone Jack just
went out like the yesterday or second 

1585
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:36,500
headphone Jack headphone jacks went out 
all the time.

1586
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:38,720
They all fucking suck.
I'm sorry.

1587
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,960
Not a candidate even leaving these mics 
are the shit.

1588
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:45,050
I just want to say that.
These are the statements.

1589
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:50,051
You just heard the opinion only that of 
Brian's my opinion do not represent the 

1590
01:10:50,051 --> 01:10:51,700
rest of this podcast.
So in Gen,

1591
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,990
in general though,
products have gotten a lot better.

1592
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:56,780
They have to,
they've gotten just like market wide.

1593
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,750
You can't get away with a nod.
Nope.

1594
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,880
It's this too much.
Too much pr now.

1595
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:07,370
Total exposure exposure.
Like that's one thing I fucking love.

1596
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:12,371
And one of the reasons why I wanted to 
have you on is the kind of videos that 

1597
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:14,070
you do and there's a lot of other that 
are doing them now.

1598
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,640
There's so comprehensive.
It would have never existed on a network

1599
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,070
television show.
Like even like the,

1600
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:22,290
like when you used to have the whole 
tech tv days,

1601
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,580
which was excellent.
I love the screensavers.

1602
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:29,660
I love that they didn't have the time to
do what you're doing and specific to 

1603
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,590
that device.
You don't have to worry about,

1604
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:32,670
you know,
oh,

1605
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:35,610
I have to be off the air in six minutes.
That's when the commercial goes.

1606
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:37,230
We have to go to break.
There's no break.

1607
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,330
There's no.
All that stuff is dog shit.

1608
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,470
That's a dumb.
With that silent movies,

1609
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:46,950
you're doing a puppet show.
You might as well be shown this was a 

1610
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,950
real monster girl.
No,

1611
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,520
it's not.
Okay.

1612
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:49,590
You can't use the rubber claymation 
anymore.

1613
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:54,120
It's 2014 and you can't keep reviewing 
tech items on television.

1614
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:59,121
So essentially what's going on as the 
Internet has created a platform for you 

1615
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:01,560
guys to completely change the technology
review market.

1616
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,300
Right?
And make it super interactive.

1617
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:08,301
Like say,
if you're thinking about getting a new 

1618
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:08,301
iphone,
you go online,

1619
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:08,301
go to cnet,
go to your site,

1620
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:13,191
go to all these different sites and 
you'll just hit review after review 

1621
01:12:13,191 --> 01:12:16,341
after review informed detailed in depth 
reviews that many times the guy will 

1622
01:12:16,341 --> 01:12:21,231
say,
I've had this phone for the past five 

1623
01:12:21,231 --> 01:12:21,231
days,
fucking with it.

1624
01:12:21,231 --> 01:12:22,150
Here are my thoughts.
You're just not gonna.

1625
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,710
Get that anywhere else?
No,

1626
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:27,900
it's the platform.
The platform has enabled that to happen.

1627
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,050
Like like it's enabled so many new forms
of entertainment to happen.

1628
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:32,940
Like this podcast is.
For example,

1629
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,360
if somebody would have given us a show,
not a fucking chance in hell,

1630
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,610
a radio show.
Now bringing this guy with me.

1631
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:39,770
We're gonna.
Yeah.

1632
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,230
He started shit because it's kind of 
cute because of the.

1633
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,700
Because of the.
Even the way you said that,

1634
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,860
like in the old days,
old media,

1635
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,330
somebody had to give you something.

1636
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,150
You know what I mean?
Right now you go out and get it.

1637
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,760
Well,
the old days someone had to hire you for

1638
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:54,590
a show.
That's what I mean.

1639
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:57,830
There's no way you had to.
There was a predetermined time slot,

1640
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:02,831
like if you had a radio station,
all you have on that radio station is 

1641
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:05,370
the times that you're broadcasting.
We could simultaneously broadcast.

1642
01:13:05,371 --> 01:13:08,100
I mean we could if we wanted to.
Brian and I got together and said,

1643
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,400
you know what,
let's start a fucking podcast empire.

1644
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:13,320
Let's right everybody that we can 
contact online,

1645
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,200
have those centers.
We could start hiring people before,

1646
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:21,201
you know,
we get up 50 podcast going on at the 

1647
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:21,600
same time just dumping them out into the
Internet.

1648
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,870
You don't have to have a 24 hour time 
period where you know,

1649
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,210
frosty.
Heidi and frank are from eight to 10 and

1650
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:29,760
then after that it's fucking conway and 
steckler.

1651
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,290
You don't have to have that anymore.
No.

1652
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:36,390
And brings it.
Brings up a lot of deficiencies in the 

1653
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,790
traditional media model that now that 
everything is same,

1654
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,920
everything is essentially on demand and 
it,

1655
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:45,150
it honestly feels strange for me to plan
my day around a live event and about 

1656
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,490
watching commercials.
But you want to fucking throw up in your

1657
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,280
pants like,
what are you showing me?

1658
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:53,210
Why is the program stopped vs Horse 
Shit?

1659
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:58,250
To be honest with you,
commercials don't need to be as bad as 

1660
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:58,470
they are.
Now Look at Art Formula Joe.

1661
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:03,471
Now we might do it a little long,
but what if we were advertising Coca 

1662
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:04,140
Cola in 30 seconds so we can do whatever
the fuck we want.

1663
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,750
I would watch that.
But here's the thing,

1664
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:11,751
like when the super bowl happens,
everyone has come to replenish glycogen 

1665
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,100
corn

1666
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:17,100
syrup.
If you put a frog inside that can of 

1667
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,170
cook for two weeks,
coke bad for you.

1668
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,130
Fuck yeah,
it's bad.

1669
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,660
I was living in a city you fuck face.
How about coconut smile and shut the 

1670
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,850
fuck up pitch.
It's old school.

1671
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:26,410
Yeah.
Um,

1672
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:32,070
but they don't.
The only reason why that works is 

1673
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,440
because that forced that,
like they're constantly trying to get me

1674
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:34,030
to do ads in the middle of a podcast.
Yeah,

1675
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:39,031
definitely.
Every new ad that's like one of the 

1676
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:39,031
first things that comes up.
It's a debate.

1677
01:14:39,031 --> 01:14:41,080
It's like they want to interrupt the 
show and insert ads.

1678
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:43,180
It's not a,
that's not an option.

1679
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,720
It's a super stupid crappy models and 
work.

1680
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,430
No.
It doesn't and defensive.

1681
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,130
It's a holdover.
It's a holdover from a time that doesn't

1682
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:52,000
exist anymore.
It's like,

1683
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:57,030
well,
let's just take the platform that 

1684
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,351
existed and and bolted onto this new 
thing instead of developing something 

1685
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:00,340
from the ground up that fits with this 
language.

1686
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:05,370
This is a whole new language.
I even feel this way about indi 

1687
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,330
individual social networks.
Like I feel like youtube has a language.

1688
01:15:07,331 --> 01:15:09,370
Facebook hasn't language.
Twitter has a language.

1689
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,060
Instagram that sort of when you're a 
content producer,

1690
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:18,061
you sort of feel like all those places 
at the same because you're broadcasting 

1691
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:19,360
to all of them,
but ultimately more often than not,

1692
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:21,460
those users,
our platform independent,

1693
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:26,550
they have a place where they like to get
at you more than one other place and 

1694
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,361
that becomes their habit and so since 
their consumption model is unique,

1695
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:35,490
so say your people who people who viewed
this podcast on youtube versus who 

1696
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:39,310
listened to the audio only versus who.
Those are all independent people,

1697
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:43,240
all with their their own mindset and 
trying to.

1698
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:48,690
Trying to figure out the right way of 
interacting with all those groups is 

1699
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,290
something that big brands are trying to 
do now through their,

1700
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,600
their,
their social experiments and et cetera.

1701
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,620
So,
uh,

1702
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,150
when,
when people come and talk to me,

1703
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:58,600
brands or advertisers or whoever it 
might be,

1704
01:15:58,601 --> 01:15:59,380
it's like,
listen,

1705
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,640
we need to build something from the 
ground up native to this platform.

1706
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,100
Don't bring me something from somewhere 
else.

1707
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:10,350
This is not a national ad campaign.
This is 850,000

1708
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:15,360
very sophisticated viewers with a super 
high sensitivity to bullshit,

1709
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:21,570
right?
Because they're not used to getting it 

1710
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:21,570
here.
It's not getting any of it.

1711
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,780
They're not getting any of it about your
own life.

1712
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:28,470
People who are hosting podcasts will 
tell you the truth about their own 

1713
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,470
personal fuck off.
Exactly.

1714
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:30,130
And so that's it.
It's a,

1715
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,980
it's a really unique proposition.
Huge value,

1716
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:38,070
huge value for a brand.
In some ways I feel like this whole 

1717
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,600
marketplace is heavily undervalued.
When you compare a CPM figures like from

1718
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,280
the traditional media world to this 
world,

1719
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,990
these people are more fucking dedicated 
there.

1720
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,160
They're loyal.
They know that you're kicking them the 

1721
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,160
real deal.
Unbox therapy is not going to lie.

1722
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,110
You're not allowing your deep,
your eyes and you're also,

1723
01:16:55,151 --> 01:17:00,151
you're.
You're deep into discovering the flaws 

1724
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:01,510
which is actually essential to the 
development process,

1725
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:06,670
like for to ensure that you still have a
job and that these companies create an 

1726
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,170
innovative,
but it might be painful for them.

1727
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:10,250
They might not enjoy some of your 
criticisms,

1728
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,630
but it's.
It's critical.

1729
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,330
I'll give you an example right now.
Please do live example,

1730
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,580
example.
Samsung.

1731
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,300
Samsung keeps making these shitty ass 
chargers.

1732
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,230
Okay?
Yes.

1733
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,560
Look at this damn thing.
This is just the charger for their 

1734
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:26,560
watch.
This is a beautiful looking device,

1735
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,200
right?
That's the charger.

1736
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,550
Installed the charger.
Joe,

1737
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,630
go for it,
bitch.

1738
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,980
You know who also done that in the past?
Sony used to do that shit all the time.

1739
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,530
If they're like Bluetooth headsets and 
you say,

1740
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,870
oh,
you mean proprietary stuff?

1741
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,790
Well these are.
These are all going to be proposed.

1742
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,470
That's what you gotta do every night 
before bed.

1743
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,200
You're not doing that.
You had a few drinks.

1744
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:47,230
Well,
that's why the new Apple Watch is going 

1745
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:47,230
to be a dude.
I'm coordinators.

1746
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:47,230
Fuck no,
no,

1747
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:47,230
no,
no,

1748
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,080
no.
I'll be on heroin.

1749
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,390
I'll do this.
I'm not saying you can't do it,

1750
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:52,220
but that's not a pleasurable experience.

1751
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:56,270
You're so funny that you would like it 
to be just like a regular usb.

1752
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:58,760
You remember what I said before about 
opening up an apple laptop.

1753
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:02,060
That breath of fresh air that you get 
it.

1754
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,840
You can't measure it.
It just keeps you liking in using the 

1755
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,140
device is sort of like their keyboards 
and the mice.

1756
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,350
They're so clean and everything is just 
like I want.

1757
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,510
I just want to look at the damn thing.
You know what I mean?

1758
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:16,910
If a beautiful thing will always be more
attractive.

1759
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:19,010
I forgot the damn charger for the LG g 
watch,

1760
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:21,440
but no worries.
Lg on the other hand,

1761
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,970
the entire back is a magnet.
All you do is you just drop it.

1762
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,010
Lg Winds better.
Apple's new watch.

1763
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:33,070
You just lay it down on the of course,
but the minute you laid down on the 

1764
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:35,090
counter that charger.
Hold on.

1765
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,960
How's that possible?

1766
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:36,740
Go ahead.
Hey.

1767
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,840
Well,
a lot of you could do this right now.

1768
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:42,670
You can go to best buy and buy these 
things that fit on the back of your mind

1769
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,430
and some phones you need to buy anything
is already ci enabled.

1770
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:47,570
Yeah.
Where you could just lay down on the mat

1771
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:52,571
and we'll show a map.
A specific part thought you were saying 

1772
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:56,231
it charges in the air.
I like apple is a watch supposedly has 

1773
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:56,990
it where you could just lay it down on 
this.

1774
01:18:56,991 --> 01:18:57,710
Matt,
you know,

1775
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,260
I'll tell you my one criticism of the 
mat.

1776
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,070
The problem with that with the mat is 
traveling,

1777
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,240
traveling with a Goddamn Matt.
Yeah.

1778
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,490
Unless it's becomes as big as the iphone
and then Hook,

1779
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,800
just have that mat which is probably 
gonna have if,

1780
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,660
if,
if it's gonna take awhile,

1781
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:16,580
but starbucks actually are starting to 
implement ci enabled surfaces so it will

1782
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:18,140
happen but it's definitely not there 
yet.

1783
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,510
And in the meantime the little charger 
for this LG is,

1784
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:23,260
it's super thin and it's about the size 
of the watch and they,

1785
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:25,520
they can connect if you put them 
together in your bag.

1786
01:19:25,521 --> 01:19:28,640
So because it has a magnet,
but I had to watch before this,

1787
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,570
the galaxy gear.
Okay.

1788
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,070
This is the gear live.
The naming conventions are terrible.

1789
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,230
That's one of the hardest parts of the 
job actually.

1790
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:41,440
Just getting the names right.
Well it's better than like the old days 

1791
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:41,440
off model numbers like.
Yeah,

1792
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:41,440
I guess so.
But anyway,

1793
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,470
the galaxy gear had this wacky thing 
that strapped around the whole device.

1794
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,530
It was shit,
it screwed up the experience for me.

1795
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:51,650
And I think that ruined the device if 
the UI.

1796
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,080
So Ui doesn't end here.
User interface.

1797
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:54,860
Uh,
yeah,

1798
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:55,670
exactly.
Or,

1799
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:00,720
or you,
he used going to fuck or user or user 

1800
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,121
experience in general.
It's a lot of people assume like if 

1801
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:07,841
you're a developer,
you're building it for this and that's 

1802
01:20:07,841 --> 01:20:07,841
it.
No,

1803
01:20:07,841 --> 01:20:07,841
this is Ui,
this aluminum or,

1804
01:20:07,841 --> 01:20:12,141
or you eat it's user experience.
The whole experience is encompassed in 

1805
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,190
the way you interact with the damn thing
to do.

1806
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:18,210
Selling a wine connoisseur who sound 
like one of those dudes is really in a 

1807
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:18,510
certain grade.
I think I'm getting fired up right now.

1808
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:25,830
I like this guy.
I agree with you 100 percent and I think

1809
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,350
that also what were saying before is 
that your,

1810
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,790
these criticisms,
this,

1811
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
this very detailed review that you'll do
about these products is super critical,

1812
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,280
super critical for the development and 
will be hiring you.

1813
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:43,610
Oh,
I get lots of interesting to get offers 

1814
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:43,610
to join apple.
Tell you.

1815
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:44,040
Shut the fuck up.
Just come over here.

1816
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,370
I'm sure.
Shut the fuck.

1817
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:50,510
I'm sure apple is not a huge fan of mine
because I did some leaking of different 

1818
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,530
components.
How dare you do that?

1819
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,580
You've got it offline from China.
Yeah.

1820
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:57,150
It's on the Internet.
It's out there on the ocean.

1821
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:59,310
So deal with it.
Probably not a big fan of mine.

1822
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,960
It's funny.
They did their keynote.

1823
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,400
I didn't.
I had leaked,

1824
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:04,350
um,
the IPAD air chassis,

1825
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:08,340
the entire body before it came out.
So I had the entire form factor,

1826
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:08,610
right?

1827
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,620
It was on Forbes.
They get mad at you.

1828
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:11,810
No,
they didn't.

1829
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,820
I never heard a word about it,
but in the keynote they addressed it 

1830
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:17,790
like the big keynote that everyone was 
watching.

1831
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,040
They're like,
we think you guys might be familiar with

1832
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,050
this next device,
like Tim Cook addressed it,

1833
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:27,140
so I was like,
did you feel like certain amount of 

1834
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:27,140
power on the radar?
Ooh,

1835
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,470
did something he made?
No,

1836
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:34,670
I didn't.
I didn't really because I feel like 

1837
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:34,670
these things are going to,
they're going to leak out regardless.

1838
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:35,970
There's just because of guys like you.
It's like saying people,

1839
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:40,980
it's almost going to murder someone 
regardless because of a murderer I 

1840
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:40,980
guess.
You know,

1841
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,110
I guess I guess you're right about that,
but I,

1842
01:21:42,111 --> 01:21:43,870
I honestly,
I'm,

1843
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,870
I'm much more interested in the demand 
for it.

1844
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:51,200
Like why do people care so much?
That's another thing that shows about 

1845
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:51,780
how our attachment to these devices.

1846
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:55,470
It's insane that I put out a video like 
that and he's like,

1847
01:21:55,471 --> 01:22:00,471
you know,
I don't know 2 million views or it's on 

1848
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:00,471
Forbes.
It's,

1849
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:00,750
it was,
it was everywhere.

1850
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:03,600
Like it was posted.
All I had to google notifications turned

1851
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:08,601
on for whenever it was getting.
I was getting a news notification every 

1852
01:22:08,601 --> 01:22:11,631
time my name was being used and we're 
just going off like it was on all these 

1853
01:22:11,631 --> 01:22:13,450
different sites that we're embedding my 
video and they're uh,

1854
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:18,730
they're doing it because investors want 
to make adjustments to their plans 

1855
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:23,490
preemptively based on the,
based on what they like.

1856
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:25,140
No,
I mean not the review.

1857
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:26,460
I mean like the,
the leak.

1858
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,640
So they see the IPAD air chassis before 
it actually comes out and you go home 

1859
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,540
and people going like that chassis or 
people are going to buy that chess.

1860
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:35,730
Do you review when there's a leak?

1861
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,920
You give opinions on the leak?
Yeah,

1862
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:39,750
I can share.
I compare it to the old one,

1863
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,690
like I do physical dimensions.
I pulled a measuring tape out.

1864
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,960
Have you ever known of anyone that's 
given some sort of review and it's 

1865
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,861
actually changed the final product 
because they listened to what people 

1866
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,260
were saying about a leak product and we 
hit the bricks.

1867
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:55,500
It can be a disaster.
Good question.

1868
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,750
Probably like on kickstarter or 
something like that,

1869
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:03,230
but not in a big.
Don't feel like they would ever let you 

1870
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,230
know.
You know what I mean,

1871
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:07,420
but,
but I think brands are definitely paying

1872
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:12,421
attention to the chatter they need to 
and the market research is going deep 

1873
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:12,421
now.
You know,

1874
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:16,951
they,
they invest way too much money in 

1875
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:18,130
creating these things to take a risk 
that everyone's going to hate it.

1876
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:23,131
So.
And a guy like you is a direct line to 

1877
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:23,131
that because.

1878
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:23,131
Yeah,
I'm,

1879
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,060
I'm tapped into the pipeline.
You're doing this all day long.

1880
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,260
Access to the vein.
Yeah.

1881
01:23:26,261 --> 01:23:27,610
Yeah.
This is my thing.

1882
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,240
When I used to do cameras,
I used to,

1883
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,920
when those little baby video cameras 
used to be,

1884
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,250
became really popular,
whatever those were called.

1885
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:40,260
Remember used to have a couple of them 
are hd ones with the SD cards and a 

1886
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:44,260
Kodak had one and I did a really bad 
review on one of codex,

1887
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:48,800
a little exactly what you're telling me.
And it was because of low,

1888
01:23:48,801 --> 01:23:53,801
uh,
went during low lighting and stuff like 

1889
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:53,801
that.
It had a bunch of fucked up problems.

1890
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:55,420
Kodak,
Kodak contact me and they actually did a

1891
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:58,780
firmware upgrade based on just wondering
if there's an example.

1892
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,270
That's tremendous.
Yeah.

1893
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,450
Yeah.
Look,

1894
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,910
that's a super valuable resource for a 
company.

1895
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,270
Definitely they're not going to get that
kind of objectivity from the people that

1896
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:10,720
work there and it was also a hierarchy 
with managers and people that work under

1897
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:15,721
the managers and maybe the managers a 
dick and he doesn't want to listen to 

1898
01:24:15,721 --> 01:24:16,240
Mike's Advice and Mike,
you know Mike is kind of soft spoken,

1899
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,500
but it's got really good ideas.

1900
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:22,710
There's a lot of that social shit that 
goes on to incorporate something that 

1901
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:25,000
doesn't get talked about is the is the 
cultural aspect,

1902
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:28,060
like the vast majority of this stuff 
comes from halfway across the world.

1903
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:28,990
Right?
We all know that.

1904
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:36,090
I don't know what I can say on this,
but are you withholding information 

1905
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:36,560
information?
I'm just.

1906
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,800
He doesn't want to burden.
There's A.

1907
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:44,250
Yeah.
I'm not going to just try a way to name 

1908
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,790
any brands,
but some rhymes at ams young.

1909
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:51,940
Some are completely out of touch with 
the way life works over here.

1910
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,170
Okay.
In America,

1911
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:59,070
I see.
That makes sense and it shines through 

1912
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:03,031
and certain decision making when it 
comes not only to products but to the 

1913
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:06,601
way they market those products to the 
way they communicate with press or the 

1914
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:07,480
way they communicate with their own 
people.

1915
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,110
It's um,
I've,

1916
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:14,120
I've been in some certain circumstances 
where it's been very foreign that makes 

1917
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,310
a tremendous amount of sap and seems 
like,

1918
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:23,610
of course it seems obvious,
but everyone wants to pretend that a 

1919
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,460
user experience and in Asia is the same 
thing that we're going to want here.

1920
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,980
You know,
like how many.

1921
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:35,100
Okay.
I'm going to go on a bit of an android 

1922
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:35,380
rent.
This is a nexus five.

1923
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,520
Okay.
Beautiful phone.

1924
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,560
This is a google a google product.
This is the unadulterated android 

1925
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:43,420
experience.
The Way Google intended.

1926
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:45,310
I don't know if they would have attended
that wallpaper.

1927
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,150
No,
they probably didn't.

1928
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,380
Actually,
that's a good friend of mine.

1929
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:50,800
Please don't say anything.
I don't even know what it is.

1930
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:51,880
I'm just fucking around.
Okay.

1931
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,620
No,
no,

1932
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,830
you're right.
It wouldn't be stock.

1933
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,840
That's not a stock wallpaper.
But um,

1934
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:01,410
uh,
so they have the best developers in the 

1935
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:01,410
world.
If you're a bad ass developer,

1936
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,800
where are you going to work?
Apple,

1937
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,040
Google,
Amazon,

1938
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:04,940
I mean,
whatever.

1939
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,910
Somewhere in silicon valley,
somewhere in the Pacific northwest,

1940
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:13,240
you'll be all set.
If you're the best developer in the 

1941
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:13,240
world,
you go in Asia,

1942
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,150
is that your number one priority?

1943
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,890
Is that where you're going to go?
Like Asian chick and heroin,

1944
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,510
you Japan in September,
so I'll let you know so,

1945
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,710
but anyway,
here's the.

1946
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,760
Here's the problem,
the R and d that goes into that 

1947
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:26,760
software.
Extensive,

1948
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,700
so much money,
so many smart people,

1949
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,890
right?
What does Samsung do?

1950
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,960
Three weeks,
they overhauled a motherfucker.

1951
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,110
Come on,
how are you going to take something that

1952
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:41,111
took that long to develop and you're 
going to skin it and you're going to 

1953
01:26:41,111 --> 01:26:42,590
change everything about it is three 
weeks while no,

1954
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,700
I'm exaggerating.
Oh,

1955
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:47,090
if you pick up a samsung device,
it's not the same as an LG device.

1956
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:48,890
Not the same as a Motorola device.
It's not the same.

1957
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:52,080
There's this fragmentation and that's in
those,

1958
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:54,350
because in the tech space,
it's called the f word by the way,

1959
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,000
fragmented for,
they call it the f word.

1960
01:26:56,001 --> 01:27:00,350
It's a big deal because they decide to 
add their own user interface.

1961
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:05,380
They're old shit.
Samsung has their own thing that they 

1962
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:05,380
do.
What is it called?

1963
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:08,270
Samsung is called Touchwiz.
Yeah.

1964
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:10,340
What's that?
You're not touching my dick.

1965
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,490
That's what I hear.
Now you have.

1966
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,980
You have the ring,
right?

1967
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:17,080
So that's the original operating system 
and everything.

1968
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:19,100
Do you.
Is it night and day difference?

1969
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,980
Because I've always used I guess a skin 
version.

1970
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,500
Balls.
You San Francisco Mall.

1971
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:26,120
Fuck all that shit.
He's got his hardcore dude.

1972
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,760
He's super hardcore.
He's like Antonopoulos.

1973
01:27:28,761 --> 01:27:31,010
Remember Antonopoulos that he breaks 
everything down.

1974
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:32,840
Roots it and yeah.
Here's the thing.

1975
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:37,870
It's like I just really believe in the 
intelligence level of the original 

1976
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:43,241
developers and I can't imagine how they 
sleep at night knowing that most 

1977
01:27:43,241 --> 01:27:45,260
people's interpretation of android is a 
galaxy device.

1978
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,240
Get one of these next disease.
They're like smashed.

1979
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:53,290
You're sitting there.
This is their art form and they're 

1980
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:55,751
sitting there putting all of this energy
into simple decisions like the shape of 

1981
01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:55,751
an icon.

1982
01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:58,250
You know what I mean?
Design and then someone goes and goes,

1983
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,530
I will build a better gun,
will be happy face.

1984
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,920
No big deal is.
It doesn't make any sense.

1985
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:09,070
It would be like you'd get some 
beautiful painting and you send it half 

1986
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:09,410
way across the world to Asia and tell 
them,

1987
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:12,120
do what you want with it.
Right.

1988
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:14,030
We never do that with any other kind of 
art.

1989
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,770
That's interesting.
So you're,

1990
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,530
you're accepting it as an art form.
I guess you're right,

1991
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,780
it's created some.
Creates it.

1992
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:22,560
Someone draws the whole thing up,
man.

1993
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:23,270
Yeah.
With the,

1994
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:28,300
this uh,
the guy behind this isn't Mathias 

1995
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:28,300
Duarte.
He was at Google Io.

1996
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,000
He's their lead designer on the uh,
and,

1997
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,700
and it's about to get overhauled as 
well.

1998
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:35,780
The new version is called L and it's 
even more beautiful in my opinion,

1999
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:40,810
than,
than what this four point four point 

2000
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:40,810
four that I'm working on right now.
But here's another problem.

2001
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,390
I'm using four point four point four.
That's the latest android Ios.

2002
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,520
What's that called?
Um,

2003
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,510
it's always candy Kit Kat,
Kat.

2004
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,480
Uh,
the next,

2005
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:55,620
the dispersion,
the specific iteration of this software 

2006
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,350
is you will not find it on any galaxy 
device right now,

2007
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,350
right.
The updates and this,

2008
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:01,320
this,
Holy Shit,

2009
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:02,010
this is a big

2010
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,340
discussion because we're going to 
involve the carriers.

2011
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:10,341
Now.
The carriers are really to blame for 

2012
01:29:10,341 --> 01:29:13,611
enabling this process.
So android in the beginning of Andrew 

2013
01:29:13,611 --> 01:29:17,811
has had to meet so many sacrifices to 
catch up and one of those sacrifices is 

2014
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:20,490
letting carriers dictate how they're 
going to implement these devices.

2015
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,620
Verizon,
atnt,

2016
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,970
etc.
So you buy a phone from verizon,

2017
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:26,760
there's a bunch of bullshit from boot it
up and you see a verisign logo.

2018
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,910
The whole juSt discussed dude,
in some cases they put the logo right on

2019
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,100
the outside of the phone.
There was a galaxy,

2020
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:35,430
I think the [inaudible] had verizon on 
the button on the front,

2021
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,700
tiny little button strapped with 
verizon.

2022
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:42,090
So those are,
those are changes that the carriers want

2023
01:29:42,091 --> 01:29:47,091
to make because they're hoping to build 
their own ecosystems and capitalize 

2024
01:29:47,091 --> 01:29:47,091
more.
The carriers are,

2025
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,950
they're not in an innovative business.
They're in,

2026
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:55,010
in an accounting business of finding a 
way to just use you for a few more 

2027
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:55,010
pennies.

2028
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,050
You can do a little ting spot right now 
if you,

2029
01:29:56,060 --> 01:30:00,210
except for the pockets.
They're clever.

2030
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:05,570
Now,
when an economy moves in that direction 

2031
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:05,570
where their objective is just a pinch 
more pennies,

2032
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:10,040
what happens to innovation takes a 
fucking nosedive because knows I'll 

2033
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:14,100
fucking nosedive it does.
And because all of a sudden now the 

2034
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,590
bottom line is effected by someone,
some nerd with a,

2035
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,580
uh,
a report in front of them saying,

2036
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,420
just get rid of that,
you know,

2037
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,310
whatever.
It's made through subtraction,

2038
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:26,340
not addition.
That's fascinating.

2039
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,930
That's a really interesting way to look 
at it.

2040
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:30,240
I really liked the idea that it's a 
piece of art.

2041
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,940
I love that you were looking at it that 
way because you're absolutely correct.

2042
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:37,970
I think of it as technology,
but it is something that's created 

2043
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:38,310
anything created as art and it's 
certainly beautiful.

2044
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,740
You know,
I love like scrolling through.

2045
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:45,740
I love how android,
like my galaxy note three has like a 

2046
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:45,990
different thing when I'm flipping 
through the pages.

2047
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,830
I like animation or something.
I love the fucking pen,

2048
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:51,760
I love that they figured out how to do 
that.

2049
01:30:51,761 --> 01:30:53,490
And you're doing,
you're using the pen on a regular basis.

2050
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,580
Well,
I'm a comic notes.

2051
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,910
I knew that part.
I'm a big.

2052
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:05,060
I think there's something about 
physically writing things that there is 

2053
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,060
a different impact.
So.

2054
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,890
And then I upload them to um,
uh,

2055
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,920
to evernote.
So I have the actual note itself on my 

2056
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:12,990
iphone as well.
Definitely.

2057
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,700
So yeah.
Oh dude.

2058
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:16,430
Evernote is fucking fantastic.
Yeah.

2059
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,290
But what I really love about it is that 
you take like,

2060
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:21,500
like a note like this year.
Yeah.

2061
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:26,340
This is a note that I wrote on on the 
note.

2062
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,080
Wow.
Decent writing yet.

2063
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:28,920
Not bad.
Right.

2064
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:31,620
So you could put it here and it comes 
out like,

2065
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:32,360
you know,
it's good man.

2066
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,600
Yellow paper.
Cool.

2067
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:38,660
It's really big.
Can you see that you're not gonna be 

2068
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,381
able to see it because of the phone 
itself that just the glare but 

2069
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:44,700
handwritten notes come off.
So responsive.

2070
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,620
The pen is.
So it is definitely.

2071
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,780
I agree.
Any handwritten note that you make?

2072
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,800
It looks really like alex ohanian did a.
He made a little reddit alien on the 

2073
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,380
note.
We put it up.

2074
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:55,830
I mean,
you,

2075
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,130
you do things with it.
There's no doubt that the

2076
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:05,050
pen is a far more.
He has far more precision than your 

2077
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,050
fingertip.
Yeah,

2078
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,230
no doubt about it.
So,

2079
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,570
uh,
there's all kinds of industries that are

2080
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:09,670
affected by that.
Comedy is one as you,

2081
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,400
as you said,
but also like artists for example,

2082
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,490
are doing insane illustrations on the 
note.

2083
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:18,500
Like,
like top quality stuff on there.

2084
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,990
It's the apps that exist,
like a different sketching out.

2085
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
What do you got there?
So it's something for an ounce of 

2086
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,000
sketching up.
Yeah.

2087
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,090
This is actually an art app and it's 
great because it has,

2088
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:33,120
it's called color box hd and it has like
every single pen you could possibly 

2089
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,961
imagine that uses the photoshop if you 
have a favorite pen that you actually 

2090
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:37,880
like.
Kerrick.

2091
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:38,260
Yeah.

2092
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,470
So now when you draw with a pen of 
stylists,

2093
01:32:42,471 --> 01:32:44,510
what kind of stylist to use?
So you have a specific one.

2094
01:32:44,511 --> 01:32:44,590
Yeah.

2095
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:49,650
You know,
I mean I just got this app recently 

2096
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,440
because I've been trying to draw more on
my ipad.

2097
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,870
I've been trying to use my ipad more.
Actually.

2098
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,010
I have two ipads and I've been trying to
just carry this around.

2099
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,630
Stiff a laptop lately,
a surface,

2100
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,330
microsoft's version of it,
you know,

2101
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:01,940
it just released this whole thing where 
they,

2102
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:07,050
you could trade in your old mac book air
or and get like $650 credit towards 

2103
01:33:07,391 --> 01:33:12,391
their new surface,
which is like their version of this 

2104
01:33:12,391 --> 01:33:15,391
mixed with a laptop or a mac book air.
I've been trying to see if I could just 

2105
01:33:15,391 --> 01:33:19,501
use this more.
Tony hinchcliffe doesn't even have a 

2106
01:33:19,501 --> 01:33:21,961
computer.
Everything that he uses is just on an 

2107
01:33:21,961 --> 01:33:22,030
ipad.
That's ridiculous.

2108
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:27,031
I know that when I'm trying to see if I 
can get to though because I love this 

2109
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:27,031
thing.
There's no.

2110
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:27,040
One of my favorite things at tech.

2111
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,160
Just bond that's a hasn't been delivered
yet,

2112
01:33:29,161 --> 01:33:31,350
but I'm looking forward to it.
I bought a mechanical keyboard.

2113
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,970
Yeah,
I want to hear it.

2114
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:36,900
You just got a major street cred in the 
tech world for doing that.

2115
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:37,590
Yes.
You did.

2116
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,550
Oh nice.
And I missed that.

2117
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:41,960
Of course you do.
Yeah.

2118
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,370
It comes back to user experience in 
general.

2119
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:49,430
Well,
I think about user experience is very 

2120
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,430
critical.
I think about things that I enjoy.

2121
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:50,610
I drive a manual transmission most of 
the time.

2122
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,180
I like that.
I like shifting the gears like wow,

2123
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,330
I'm a part of it and an enjoyable 
experience.

2124
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:02,360
Tactile feel the snicks of the gear.
I mean I wouldn't want to do it if I was

2125
01:34:02,361 --> 01:34:03,600
stuck in traffic all the time.
Right.

2126
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:08,660
But if I'm not stuck in traffic,
I know I'm not going to be driving that 

2127
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,530
car and I think there's something to 
that tactile experience for sure.

2128
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:12,930
Like there's a lot of,
there's a lot of pushback happening now.

2129
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,400
Digital interfaces,
people miss all kinds.

2130
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,220
Like mechanical keyboards are a perfect 
example.

2131
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,590
It's also an issue with cars.
Electronic steering,

2132
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,590
electric steering is the new thing in 
sports cars.

2133
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,360
Really?
Yeah.

2134
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:25,020
What people don't like about.
There's a,

2135
01:34:25,021 --> 01:34:29,040
there's actually a blowback and more 
people are buying older sports cars that

2136
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:34,041
have no steering,
no power steering like the old 

2137
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:34,920
porsche's.
Wow.

2138
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:38,310
The old porsches were super light car 
and they had manual steering.

2139
01:34:38,311 --> 01:34:40,950
So you turn the wheel,
you felt everything.

2140
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,560
Yeah,
you're connected to those front wheels,

2141
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:47,370
like a go cart and the new ones are so 
totally electric,

2142
01:34:47,371 --> 01:34:49,740
so it's sort of like a video game.
There's no difference.

2143
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:52,440
Like if you have a hard turn or if you 
have an easy turn,

2144
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:54,360
there's no difference in the amount of 
correcting.

2145
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,880
It's just going same as the 
transmissions.

2146
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:00,740
A I drove a gtr which has a.
Oh yeah,

2147
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,280
the electronic transmission that's a can
can behave,

2148
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:09,281
can,
can shift more efficiently than any 

2149
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:09,281
human,
but it's like,

2150
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:10,330
what is that really about,
you know,

2151
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,100
what are we really,
what are we really connected to?

2152
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:18,101
Like is it,
do we really need to go that split 

2153
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:18,440
second faster or do we get more out of 
it?

2154
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:21,050
Like you said,
through feeling more of it.

2155
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,740
It's hard to really pinpoint if you have
an old school muscle car and it's an 

2156
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,981
automatic,
you're missing out on half the fun of 

2157
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:29,981
having an old school muscle car.
Right,

2158
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:29,981
right,
right.

2159
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:34,010
Shifting those gears yourself is I had 
an automatic barracuda and I hated it.

2160
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,290
I hated the fact that it was automatic.
You used to drive me crazy,

2161
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:37,880
but that's how they,
when they were building it,

2162
01:35:37,881 --> 01:35:41,300
they were saying there's no way to put 
this engine with a manual transfer.

2163
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,630
They're just knuckleheads.
but I talked to a guy who I was going to

2164
01:35:44,631 --> 01:35:49,631
have it fixed up before I want.
I want them to selling it and getting 

2165
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:49,631
rid of it.
cause it was just.

2166
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:53,640
There was a negative connotation 
probably associated because of the 

2167
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,350
automatic transmission.
It was because of the bill.

2168
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,740
I had a bill for a television show and 
there was always behind the scenes drama

2169
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,680
from the people that made the show with 
the builders of the car itself.

2170
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,550
oh,
it's a lot of nightmares.

2171
01:36:02,551 --> 01:36:04,180
Shit that I don't want to get into.
Right,

2172
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:04,400
right,
right.

2173
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:07,160
The big nightmare shit was that I don't 
trust those things.

2174
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:10,040
I got it home and as I was pulling into 
my driveway,

2175
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:13,900
the suspension,
I say yes,

2176
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,850
I was just on the highway 10 minutes ago
going 65,

2177
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:21,410
70 miles an hour and a a death man,
which would have been horrendous if that

2178
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:22,010
blew out.

2179
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:25,060
I would have crashed into other people.
Who knows what,

2180
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,800
if I was responsible for someone else 
being injured or killed,

2181
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,230
I would have felt horrible just to drive
this cool thing.

2182
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:31,580
yeah,
it's true.

2183
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:35,630
I sometimes get that feeling about a 
fast cars in general,

2184
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,900
like I feel like home great 
responsibility.

2185
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:42,910
Like you drive that car and you get in 
an accident and is completely not your 

2186
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:42,910
fault.
And then he goes,

2187
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:43,460
look at the dickhead in the,
in the fast car.

2188
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,280
Absolutely.
And they should.

2189
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:48,830
I guess they should because it does say 
something about,

2190
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:54,450
uh,
I guess it says something about your 

2191
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:54,450
personality.
Well,

2192
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:57,480
it auto insurers would say it does.
It also says something about your 

2193
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,731
ability to control something.
And The problem with buying a fast car 

2194
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:05,351
is that they don't have any gauge 
whatsoever on your ability to control 

2195
01:37:05,351 --> 01:37:05,351
it.
No.

2196
01:37:05,351 --> 01:37:06,620
Say like tanner foust,
who's a race car driver,

2197
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:11,621
the guy and tie him,
yet that guy walks into a corvette 

2198
01:37:11,621 --> 01:37:11,621
dealership and buys a corvette.

2199
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:14,450
You can be rest assured he knows how to 
handle that,

2200
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,610
but there's a lot of people that get in 
those things.

2201
01:37:16,611 --> 01:37:18,000
They hit the gas,
they just spin and,

2202
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:23,330
and slamming.
I know sometimes I feel like it is kind 

2203
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:25,811
of bizarre that they let people walk out
of the shop with 500 horsepower more.

2204
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,590
How about in the shitty chassis?
Shelby mustangs?

2205
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:32,800
I fucking love the shelby mustangs.
Right?

2206
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:33,280
Um,
they're,

2207
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,720
they're not that good.
They're like,

2208
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:38,450
they have a solid rear axle there.
There.

2209
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:43,460
I mean it's a massive piece of 
engineering to control that solid rear 

2210
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,560
axle.
But you could get one for like $50,000

2211
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:49,400
and it has 670 fucking horsepower.
That's insane.

2212
01:37:49,401 --> 01:37:51,410
It is.
And it's so fun to drive.

2213
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:53,750
They're one of the most fun american 
cars ever created.

2214
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,040
The new shelby mustangs.
They're not the best

2215
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:01,040
handling car.
They don't break the best brakes are 

2216
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:01,230
mushy.
That dog shit.

2217
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:02,580
Right?
If you get a convertible,

2218
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:04,740
you might as well be driving around in a
fucking wetland,

2219
01:38:04,741 --> 01:38:09,741
sanya noodle bouncing.
But the tactile field that you get from 

2220
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:14,040
those is so fun though.
The engine,

2221
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:17,520
the wine of the fucking supercharger 
whine.

2222
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:20,250
I mean,
I think sometimes efficiency is boring.

2223
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,470
Fuck yeah.
Prius is suck.

2224
01:38:22,471 --> 01:38:24,150
Yeah.
those are boring as shit.

2225
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,560
Not,
not just fuel efficiency,

2226
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:28,590
but efficiency in general.
Like think about coffee for example.

2227
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:34,190
You can,
you could find some crazy way to 

2228
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:36,681
precision engineer some coffee bean and,
and get it into a form factor that could

2229
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:40,430
ship to you already made,
but you talked to any coffee connoisseur

2230
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,260
and it's like they got to get the beans.
They got a roast the beans,

2231
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,870
they got to put them in the grinder.
You know,

2232
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,590
part of the experience is not just the 
consumption of it,

2233
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,360
but everything leading up to it.

2234
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:52,440
Yeah.
Actually,

2235
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:54,020
I heard you talking about addiction,
uh,

2236
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,090
last night.
And I was thinking,

2237
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,320
and we were talking about ritual on the 
podcast last night.

2238
01:38:58,321 --> 01:38:59,490
Yes.
And,

2239
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:00,450
um,
I really,

2240
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:03,120
it seems to me that at least in my 
business,

2241
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:04,640
the ritual is the thing.
Yeah,

2242
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,630
so wanting is way better than the 
having.

2243
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:12,070
It's a lot of it.
I think it's better than having because 

2244
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:16,640
you want to know what happens when you.
When you have something is you 

2245
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,910
immediately start to think about whether
or not you should still have it.

2246
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,330
You know,
iT has to enter your mind at some point.

2247
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,110
I think that's an attitude though.
I think that's a matter of focus because

2248
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:30,111
there are things that I have that you'll
never get rid of or feel like that that 

2249
01:39:30,111 --> 01:39:33,210
you'll never get rid of my car.
I mean I might one day sell if you will,

2250
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:33,600
one day.

2251
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:36,180
I'd love it.
I've had it for a couple of years.

2252
01:39:36,181 --> 01:39:41,181
I'm not saying you can't love products,
I'm just saying it's like a 

2253
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:44,421
relationship.
It just changes you when you see a 

2254
01:39:44,421 --> 01:39:45,960
really hot girl and you start to hit it 
off or whatever.

2255
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,920
That's a certain type of magic that 
can't ever happen again.

2256
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,030
That's true.
Yeah.

2257
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:56,031
You can never recreate that and some 
people go their whole lives trying to 

2258
01:39:56,031 --> 01:39:56,520
get to that first.
Hi.

2259
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,350
I have a friend who did that for the 
longest time.

2260
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,660
Eventually got married and had a kid,
but one of the things he said,

2261
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,880
he goes,
I just want a lot of beginnings.

2262
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,620
There you go.
He goes,

2263
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:05,880
I don't like relationships,
man.

2264
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:06,990
He goes,
in the beginning,

2265
01:40:06,991 --> 01:40:08,720
everybody's trying so hard.
Everybody.

2266
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,950
Everybody's so excited,
everybody's so friendly,

2267
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:15,820
and he goes and then all of a sudden 
bItches are yelling overnights.

2268
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,240
I just want a bunch of beginnings where 
people like,

2269
01:40:18,241 --> 01:40:23,241
but not not to make this,
not to pull this back and make it super 

2270
01:40:23,241 --> 01:40:23,241
nerdy,
but it's the same thing here,

2271
01:40:23,241 --> 01:40:24,120
right?
My channel,

2272
01:40:24,121 --> 01:40:29,121
it's called unbox therapy for a reason 
that there is some kind of intangible 

2273
01:40:29,121 --> 01:40:30,690
thing that happens when you get some new
thing.

2274
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:36,620
Yeah,
I think there's definitely something to 

2275
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,121
it,
but there's also what you people would 

2276
01:40:38,121 --> 01:40:39,951
say it's material fetishism that you're 
definitely constantly obsessing about 

2277
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:41,910
materials.
Maybe you should go for a hike,

2278
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:45,480
go out and look at the birds.
See the meadows.

2279
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,630
Except that except that the eventual 
futures.

2280
01:40:48,631 --> 01:40:53,631
Everybody lying down on a couch with a 
vr headset interacting with a world 

2281
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:55,600
isn't real.
I think that's possible.

2282
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:57,610
I.
I think it's probably inevitable.

2283
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:02,910
I mean,
scientists believe that may be going on 

2284
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:04,801
right now.
That might be the world we actually has 

2285
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:04,801
written.

2286
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:04,801
It's just so complex and so good.
Oh,

2287
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:05,860
really?
Could be this.

2288
01:41:05,861 --> 01:41:07,720
I wanted to talk about this cardboard 
over here.

2289
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,550
What is it?
Getting back to vr.

2290
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,920
There's just.
I could tell you were excited when I 

2291
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,380
first picked it up because it's a piece 
of bark or something inside of it.

2292
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,600
There's nothing inside of it.
Oh,

2293
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:20,260
for real.
Oh,

2294
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:21,940
let's play this game.
Guess what it is.

2295
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:25,690
Okay,
but you can't open it though.

2296
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,730
It stays this way.
Yeah.

2297
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,770
You know nothing of this.
I know.

2298
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:30,820
Absolutely not.
Okay.

2299
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,880
To me,
I would assume there's like a memory 

2300
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:36,130
card in here or a screen or something 
that you're protecting.

2301
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,960
Okay.
That this is the shipping material.

2302
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:42,990
That's what I would assume.
This is the first thing they gave us at 

2303
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:46,021
io before they gave us any watches and 
this is the world's cheapest vr headset 

2304
01:41:46,021 --> 01:41:46,021
right here.

2305
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:47,050
Okay.
There you go.

2306
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,890
That's what it is.
So it opens up,

2307
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,140
it opens up.
There's lenses inside of it.

2308
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:58,141
You build it and it.
There's a place that the phone sits 

2309
01:41:58,141 --> 01:41:58,141
there,
and this is nfc enabled.

2310
01:41:58,141 --> 01:42:02,610
Your phone sits on that,
so your phone mounts inside of here and 

2311
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,941
the nfc on the back of the phone will 
launch an application and that 

2312
01:42:05,941 --> 01:42:10,201
application on the screen then is going 
to display a,

2313
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,360
uh,
uh,

2314
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:15,400
through the lenses in interactivity 
similar to oculus rift,

2315
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,690
but right here with a piece of cardboard
for $5.

2316
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,000
See,
that's what happens,

2317
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:20,030
man.
Someone gets cocky,

2318
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:23,230
they spent billions of dollars to 
helping oculus rift.

2319
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,380
Someone comes along and says,
not only fuck you,

2320
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,260
fuck you with cardboard.
Here's google.

2321
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,680
Google did say fuck you with cardboard.
But the real reason for that is because 

2322
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,960
vr is going to be tough to sell in the 
long,

2323
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:38,560
in the long run.

2324
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,810
It's too expensive,
it's too elaborate.

2325
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:44,980
And so developers won't get on board.
So this is a development material,

2326
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,770
a development kit,
so that,

2327
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:51,930
uh,
the imaginations of developers 

2328
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:51,930
everywhere,
they can,

2329
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:54,990
uh,
they can check out what their app might 

2330
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:54,990
be like if they did a virtual reality 
version of it.

2331
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:56,890
So for folks who are listening to this,
which is most people,

2332
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,560
most people download this and listened 
to it,

2333
01:42:58,561 --> 01:43:03,561
right.
What we're 

2334
01:43:03,561 --> 01:43:03,820
looking@islikesayifyoueverorderabookonamazon.com
and
it
comes
in a
little
box,

2335
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,420
it was very similar to that.
Or maybe back when used to buy cds.

2336
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:12,450
Yup.
You buy a cd on amazon that would get 

2337
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:12,450
delivered to you.
Maybe you still do that.

2338
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,510
Um,
that would look like that.

2339
01:43:13,511 --> 01:43:15,790
It's a small,
maybe like 10 by eight.

2340
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:17,920
Ten by eight probably.
Yeah.

2341
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:19,600
Something like that just looks like a 
piece of cardboard.

2342
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,370
Have you done this yet?
Nope.

2343
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,680
Can we do it now?
I don't know how smooth it's going to 

2344
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,761
be.
We'll just know that we'll talk about 

2345
01:43:29,761 --> 01:43:29,761
other shit while you do it,
but let's just check it out.

2346
01:43:29,761 --> 01:43:29,800
Let's see how long it takes.
Let's do it.

2347
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:34,840
Here we go.
I am completely fascinated and I'm sure 

2348
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:34,840
we can hashtag think of things to talk 
about.

2349
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:39,200
Hashtag cardboard a.
It's a g.ceo/cardboard,

2350
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,680
I believe is the site if you want to 
know more about it.

2351
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:46,681
So lewis is opening this stuff and um,
there's my good things in there,

2352
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:47,700
uh,
for,

2353
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,720
for,
for folks who are listening magnet as 

2354
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,571
well,
a controls your interactivity with the 

2355
01:43:54,571 --> 01:43:54,571
device.
So you click by touching this magnet.

2356
01:43:55,330 --> 01:43:55,750
Whoa.

2357
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:59,330
Okay.
So what is god here is?

2358
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,570
He's unfolded the amazon box.
It looks like an amazon,

2359
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:04,010
but I need scissors guys.
Oh,

2360
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:05,000
do we have.
Oh no,

2361
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,440
I don't.
This is perforated.

2362
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:09,440
Of course it does show scissors,
but I don't think I need to.

2363
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,430
Yeah,
let's get the scissors.

2364
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:12,320
Let's not fuck this up.
This is the first time.

2365
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:14,990
I'm sure we have scissors here.
That's how we cut our butter.

2366
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,380
So this,
this is cut her butter.

2367
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:19,970
Oh,
perfect.

2368
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:25,910
So he's taking this apart right now.
He's a exclusive by the way,

2369
01:44:25,911 --> 01:44:26,480
is it?
No,

2370
01:44:26,481 --> 01:44:27,440
I don't think so.
No.

2371
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,190
Okay.
So I'm gonna.

2372
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,780
Pretend it is.
Some other developers.

2373
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:30,420
Why?
To me bro?

2374
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,030
Probably did it.
You know how this works,

2375
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:35,540
but it's a,
it's a mass media exclusive right now.

2376
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,430
Um,
so he's,

2377
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:38,060
he's cutting this,
um,

2378
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:43,090
this box open and inside the box or 
inside this folded up piece of 

2379
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:46,670
cardboard,
there's lenses to that looked like those

2380
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,940
little instamatic things.
What are those things called?

2381
01:44:49,941 --> 01:44:51,530
The,
you press that button and those,

2382
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:52,610
those.
No,

2383
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:53,960
you know,
it's sort of like a polaroid,

2384
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,150
but you remember those old school 
things?

2385
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:59,660
We had press and there will be a picture
of a dinosaur and you'd look at it.

2386
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:00,970
Ooh,
viewmaster.

2387
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:04,220
Yeah,
very much like a viewmaster lenses,

2388
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,710
but I'm assuming they're a high quality 
lens.

2389
01:45:06,711 --> 01:45:10,550
It's just embedded in this plastic 
because they look pretty slick.

2390
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:13,490
Does it look good?

2391
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,160
I don't,
I'm not supposed to be looking at 

2392
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:19,160
distance.
Oh yeah.

2393
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,661
We'll put this all together.
Going through the user experience or 

2394
01:45:21,661 --> 01:45:22,270
not.
I'm not,

2395
01:45:22,271 --> 01:45:27,271
I'm just,
I'm a little bit perplexed right now to 

2396
01:45:27,271 --> 01:45:29,551
insert.
I think you should have to build this 

2397
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:31,210
google cardboard.
So good idea.

2398
01:45:31,211 --> 01:45:32,020
Is there any,
um,

2399
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:35,200
directions the directions are only 
what's on there and a finished product.

2400
01:45:35,201 --> 01:45:36,130
Take care.
Assemble.

2401
01:45:36,131 --> 01:45:41,131
Insert the numbered tabs into the 
corresponding slots at four,

2402
01:45:43,091 --> 01:45:44,050
four,
three,

2403
01:45:44,051 --> 01:45:46,500
six,
two of the salt.

2404
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,910
So everything's numbered.
That's interesting how they did it.

2405
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:49,570
Oh,
you know what?

2406
01:45:49,571 --> 01:45:51,160
In the meantime I'm going to hop on the 
wifi.

2407
01:45:51,161 --> 01:45:52,780
Would this device.
So it's ready to go?

2408
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,020
Um,

2409
01:45:55,870 --> 01:45:57,580
yeah.
This is not good for a podcast.

2410
01:45:57,730 --> 01:45:58,640
No,
not at all.

2411
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,690
I told you we'll try it out after.
Yeah,

2412
01:46:01,691 --> 01:46:04,840
we'll try it out after and we'll uh,
we'll post a quick video here.

2413
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:05,520
Yeah.
Here.

2414
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:06,340
Yeah,
we could do that.

2415
01:46:06,341 --> 01:46:11,341
We can do a quick video experimentation,
but the role here is not only to say 

2416
01:46:11,341 --> 01:46:13,420
fuck you to facebook for spending 
$2,000,000,000,

2417
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:18,750
but to essentially say that vr is not 
going to get anywhere in its current 

2418
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,781
state and to give up a sort of a way to 
prototype applications without 

2419
01:46:22,241 --> 01:46:24,790
necessarily investing in a vr headset 
is,

2420
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,050
that's,
that's the objective of this.

2421
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:31,310
I mean the,
the games on the iphone didn't kill 

2422
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,370
playstation one or for whatever the fuck
it or kill it.

2423
01:46:33,371 --> 01:46:37,380
But the rumor is these are the last of 
the consoles really the last for,

2424
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:42,390
for example,
the three 60 and the playstation three 

2425
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,390
lasted for a decade.
Yeah.

2426
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,000
Yeah.
But the,

2427
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,820
the experience of like,
I just got an xbox one recently.

2428
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,370
He played that ufc game.
No,

2429
01:46:47,371 --> 01:46:49,820
I haven't played it yet.
I think you and I should do one.

2430
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:50,180
One,

2431
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:52,230
one,
one versus one.

2432
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,030
You'll get a shit ton of views.
Yeah,

2433
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:54,740
that'll be fun.
Yeah,

2434
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:56,480
definitely do that.
I narrated it.

2435
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:59,880
So it'd be weird playing with my own 
voice saying I'm right.

2436
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,320
That's true.
Narrate.

2437
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:03,120
Yeah,
I forgot about that.

2438
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,120
That'd be extra cool.
That shit took forever.

2439
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,420
I had to narrate all of the specific 
movements.

2440
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,690
Specific combinations came out well 
though.

2441
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,740
Oh,
they know what they're doing,

2442
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:15,030
man,
because was a bad mother.

2443
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:20,031
The old days you boot up like a 
basketball game or something and it's 

2444
01:47:20,031 --> 01:47:20,280
all the cadences off,
you know.

2445
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:22,680
And you can tell where the different 
phrases are inserted.

2446
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,440
Yours is smooth,
man.

2447
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:26,790
They're bad motherfucker.
They know what they're doing.

2448
01:47:27,070 --> 01:47:28,860
And did you go up to vancouver for that?
No,

2449
01:47:28,861 --> 01:47:30,780
no,
we did it all in calabasas actually.

2450
01:47:30,781 --> 01:47:31,490
Oh really?
Okay.

2451
01:47:31,491 --> 01:47:36,491
Yeah,
I know they have a big studio in 

2452
01:47:36,491 --> 01:47:36,491
vancouver.
They have studios think they rent studio

2453
01:47:36,491 --> 01:47:36,750
space here too.
Oh,

2454
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:41,751
okay.
I'm warning the following glitches or 

2455
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:42,600
very rarely occur in the game actually 
kicks all sorts of ass also.

2456
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:44,310
This isn't actually rogan and goldberg.
Silly.

2457
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:49,311
Oh,
this is tommy to tom or tommy told joe 

2458
01:47:49,311 --> 01:47:49,320
rogan.
Let me put the volume on.

2459
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:50,550
Impersonation.

2460
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,910
Yeah,
it's using glitches from the game.

2461
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:56,780
Good.

2462
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:05,820
Go ahead

2463
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:08,360
and joe connotate,
ufc glitches.

2464
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:13,850
Mikey's pretending to be a turtle that 
can't flip over.

2465
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,920
He's trying to confuse great beer.
Well,

2466
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:21,921
that was only his feet and he got it.
Here's some great books.

2467
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,460
He is not happy about this right now.
Oh,

2468
01:48:34,461 --> 01:48:36,810
you know what?
I think they might have no,

2469
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:37,880
no.
Dude,

2470
01:48:37,881 --> 01:48:39,390
this kid.
This guy is going to get fucked up.

2471
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:44,810
Oh my god.
Look how bad the glitches freezing your 

2472
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:48,580
body.
Well,

2473
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,020
one of the advantages is that your 
opponent is completely confused,

2474
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:55,850
unsure if you're a real person anymore.
Look how good that call me.

2475
01:48:55,970 --> 01:49:00,970
A body move as you can see,
and the ice man,

2476
01:49:04,821 --> 01:49:07,390
his back on his feet.
This crowd is going crazy,

2477
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:07,860
joe.

2478
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:20,420
Total disregard for the laws.
This is funny.

2479
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:26,730
Spin take down.
He's been leading those effectively all 

2480
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,501
night.
Joe gustafson is the guy just flew 

2481
01:49:30,441 --> 01:49:35,441
through the air.
What are they doing to make a guy do 

2482
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:35,441
that?
I want to know what they do.

2483
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:41,210
I mean it's a glitch obviously,
but like what does the combination that 

2484
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:44,591
makes the character behave like this?
Gustafson for folks listening to this,

2485
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:50,530
he's flying through the air,
like around and flipping and then 

2486
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:52,630
landing on his head and flipping around.
70 foot sliding.

2487
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:53,560
Take them.
Oh,

2488
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:58,561
she's out too.
She's out and liz carmouche doesn't 

2489
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:01,231
realize it.
Doesn't know that ronda rousey's out 

2490
01:50:01,231 --> 01:50:01,360
punching it.
The air.

2491
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:07,270
We'll be looking intensely at the action
tire herself out.

2492
01:50:07,271 --> 01:50:09,370
Mike rod.
It needs to be careful not to hit her in

2493
01:50:09,371 --> 01:50:14,371
the back of the head.
Answer for this mummy guard.

2494
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,680
Yeah.
People listening to this.

2495
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:20,500
You're not gonna get anything out of it,
so just go to ea.

2496
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,990
Ufc glitches.
Tommy toehold,

2497
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:25,960
he's a really funny guy.
He does a lot of these videos.

2498
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:29,530
He's got a whole series of them.
Really funny stuff

2499
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,240
on most of it on a ufc and mma.
Watch how it ends I think,

2500
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:35,840
and

2501
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,010
nothing happens.
It's funny.

2502
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,520
So those little glitches.
Not good.

2503
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:46,780
No very upset.
They're upset that you just showed the 

2504
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,590
actual tough shit because a,
it's not going to keep people from 

2505
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,460
buying a patch a wave to fix that.
I think that's just funny enough.

2506
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:52,210
Two people go,
wow,

2507
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:55,120
there's a new ufc game out.
Right,

2508
01:50:55,121 --> 01:50:58,390
but that's the reason I'm like,
I'm not fully on board with it,

2509
01:50:58,391 --> 01:51:03,391
is only because it kind of fucks up or 
the relationship between independent 

2510
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,440
content creators and game developers 
because what they do is,

2511
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:10,441
and the reality are,
you're going to take a hard line stance 

2512
01:51:10,441 --> 01:51:12,100
and then it happened with nintendo.
They fucked up.

2513
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:16,210
They were guys making a career posting 
videos about nintendo shit gone complete

2514
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:18,460
career over.
Well,

2515
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:22,480
that's bad on nintendo and nintendo got 
shit for it,

2516
01:51:22,481 --> 01:51:24,880
but it doesn't change.
It doesn't change the reality.

2517
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:28,060
You know my joke because I couldn't 
attach all there that money,

2518
01:51:28,061 --> 01:51:30,160
all that advertising youtube money too.

2519
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:35,080
That's extra income now for a nintendo 
to be able to put an intender videos up.

2520
01:51:35,081 --> 01:51:38,550
Now tendo owns the rights to it,
so they get money off all of these.

2521
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:43,710
There's a real discussion about whose 
intellectual property that is that we 

2522
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:47,641
just watched.
Did we watch something for me a or did 

2523
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:48,130
we watch something from tommy toehold,
toehold.

2524
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:50,560
And he see he doesn't have a product 
without them,

2525
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:55,860
right.
He doesn't have a product without them 

2526
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,480
in this instance.
So they might put a block on that 

2527
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:57,480
particular video.
Oh,

2528
01:51:57,930 --> 01:52:02,930
why don't they would.
Because the ufc sanctions his show that 

2529
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:02,930
like his show.
Cool.

2530
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:04,570
So I'm sure he has some sort of an 
arrangement with them.

2531
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:09,620
Yeah.
So I don't think it's going to be an 

2532
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:09,620
issue,
like,

2533
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:12,540
go for the record.
I think it's funny as hell and I w I 

2534
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:12,540
would totally watch it at all.

2535
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:17,010
I was trying to say is that I've seen,
I have a lot of friends in the gaming 

2536
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:17,980
side of youtube and fucking disaster.
Yeah.

2537
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,360
Um,
how does that work?

2538
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:22,960
Like when guys are doing comments when 
they're commentating on a match,

2539
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,750
who owns that?
Like star crash or.

2540
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:28,300
Yeah.
Those are big things,

2541
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:28,780
right?
True.

2542
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:33,790
Yeah.
Podcasts and most of the super 

2543
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:33,790
competitive,
uh,

2544
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:37,530
gaming.
The developers are on board with it 

2545
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:38,700
because that's the big part of their 
community business model,

2546
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:44,010
but generally speaking they're also 
involved in the events themselves and 

2547
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:48,601
the setup and whatnot,
so they have a more control than an 

2548
01:52:48,601 --> 01:52:49,630
independent guy in his bedroom or 
whatever his office shopping together,

2549
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,640
something like that know,
but there are enormous youtubers like 

2550
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,280
tens of 10 million subscribers,
20 million subscribers,

2551
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:01,220
whatever,
that their whole model is playing games,

2552
01:53:01,221 --> 01:53:06,221
other people's intellectual property and
there is no clear guideline yet on 

2553
01:53:06,221 --> 01:53:07,310
what's considered fair use and what 
isn't,

2554
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,590
especially when you're commercializing 
the content.

2555
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:14,770
Well,
the guys who make create the video 

2556
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:17,411
games,
so it would be foolish to try to stop 

2557
01:53:17,411 --> 01:53:17,570
any sort of an interactive community.
Like that's what we all think.

2558
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:22,660
But again,
you've got some gray hair dudes sitting 

2559
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,151
in an office that they actually got the 
job after blockbuster went under these 

2560
01:53:25,151 --> 01:53:27,440
motherfuckers and uh,
and you know,

2561
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:29,580
that's,
that's their way of that.

2562
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:31,970
That's the way they behave and that's 
not going to change overnight.

2563
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,950
Malicious.
How blockbuster went down.

2564
01:53:33,951 --> 01:53:36,290
I warned them.
I was on the board.

2565
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:41,291
I told him you got to be careful because
these dvds or on the light and laser 

2566
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:44,780
discs that have ruined our market,
it's amazing.

2567
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:49,930
Well,
pretty much everything within the next 

2568
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:49,930
couple of years.
I mean,

2569
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:50,510
I,
I have a cd slot that I,

2570
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:52,870
a usb cd slot that I attached to this.
Oh,

2571
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:55,820
external or dvds on.
Never used it once.

2572
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:56,900
Never touched it.

2573
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:02,160
And it made me realize like,
remember when the floppy disk went away 

2574
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,160
and everybody fucking freaked out.
Like apple said,

2575
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:06,611
no more floppies no.
Well that's the weird thing about 

2576
01:54:06,611 --> 01:54:08,900
technology.
We were talking earlier about how,

2577
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,680
about how about how uh,
these devices are becoming almost a 

2578
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,500
status symbol.
Having old shit.

2579
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:20,890
People were going to sneer at you.
You rock and old computer and old 

2580
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:21,740
district hand somebody a cd.
See what they do.

2581
01:54:21,741 --> 01:54:23,360
They get upset.
Go over some chicks house.

2582
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:25,730
She's got some old ass computer.
You're going to be like,

2583
01:54:25,731 --> 01:54:29,830
this bitch is crazy ass old ass computer
is.

2584
01:54:29,831 --> 01:54:32,210
There's a weird,
there's a weird,

2585
01:54:32,211 --> 01:54:34,280
uh,
it's like a tech prejudice.

2586
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,300
Do you have an archi?
You'll have an rq park.

2587
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:38,870
You just press that button.
You know,

2588
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:42,500
where they put a piece of tape over that
thing,

2589
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:47,501
folsom tape up,
draw the letter or on it and stick it 

2590
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:47,501
over that little button.

2591
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:47,930
Do you,
do you save old tech?

2592
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:51,170
Like I just found my own a dash the 
other day.

2593
01:54:51,171 --> 01:54:54,300
I was just wanting to have the stats.
I have a dash that's not.

2594
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:57,710
There's a certain age at which I think 
it becomes cool again,

2595
01:54:57,711 --> 01:54:59,780
kind of like cars.
Like I recently,

2596
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:01,160
uh,
showed my four year old,

2597
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:06,161
the original second genesis and we were 
playing streets of rage heat and he 

2598
01:55:06,161 --> 01:55:10,241
fucking dominating what you said for 
that because it gave me that game at 

2599
01:55:10,241 --> 01:55:10,910
four.
I'd be crying,

2600
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:12,080
you know.
So,

2601
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,010
uh,
yeah.

2602
01:55:13,011 --> 01:55:17,030
I like to sort of go back and those 
origin stories in my childhood and stuff

2603
01:55:17,031 --> 01:55:17,770
like that.
Uh,

2604
01:55:17,771 --> 01:55:20,420
I did an unboxing video of the original 
nes,

2605
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:25,050
nintendo 1985 found going one in mint 
condition in the box seat.

2606
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:26,480
People in the comments were telling me 
like,

2607
01:55:26,481 --> 01:55:28,100
listen,
this brought tears to my eyes,

2608
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:31,430
just swear to god,
but it's not because of the product,

2609
01:55:31,431 --> 01:55:33,410
right?
Is that because of the promise?

2610
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:38,770
If you remember being a kid and that nes
being under that christmas tree at that 

2611
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:39,450
moment,
if you,

2612
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:42,320
if your dad was a fuck up,
you know your mom was a bitch,

2613
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,010
that console

2614
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,040
strong words,
that console for a moment guaranteed a 

2615
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,730
certain number of hours together because
people use the game together.

2616
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,970
Like for me and my friend,
for me and my brother,

2617
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:56,340
that's what it was.
The thing is under the tree,

2618
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:57,470
you look at one another,
you're like,

2619
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,620
I know what this means.
It's not about the console and,

2620
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:04,410
and this is a huge problem with gaming 
now is that it's all online.

2621
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:07,260
Yet the most beautiful shit happens in 
real life.

2622
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:10,980
You want to fuck up the guy next to you,
not some dude in who knows where.

2623
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:12,780
Right?
That's why land part is they're so fun.

2624
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,740
Yeah,
exactly.

2625
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:14,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2626
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,980
High five each other.
I have to fucking do it in my,

2627
01:56:16,981 --> 01:56:20,670
in my parents' house,
a main floor upstairs.

2628
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,760
And then immediately after the 
multiplayer match will be over.

2629
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:28,940
The losing team would run up to where 
the winning team wasn't immediately 

2630
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:28,940
start fighting,
you know,

2631
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:28,940
whatever.

2632
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:29,780
Goofing around.
Like get pissed,

2633
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,590
yell at one another,
go back to another round,

2634
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,640
et cetera.
Yeah,

2635
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:33,710
those are fun,
man.

2636
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:35,380
Land parties are fun.
That's so.

2637
01:56:35,381 --> 01:56:40,381
It's so true too,
about so many games taking place online 

2638
01:56:40,381 --> 01:56:43,341
now.
So much of the experiences people not 

2639
01:56:43,341 --> 01:56:46,161
interacting with other people online.
That's a very different experience than 

2640
01:56:46,161 --> 01:56:49,041
being in a room.
Like if we set up computers on this 

2641
01:56:49,041 --> 01:56:49,530
beautiful big ass table,
this would be a great place for India.

2642
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:52,410
A safe place.
This will be the who was land party ever

2643
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:54,270
down.
Definitely mario kart.

2644
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:56,700
We should totally have a fucking party 
here down.

2645
01:56:57,130 --> 01:57:00,630
I haven't played quake forever.
I bet I suck my ass.

2646
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:02,040
I was never.
I was never that good.

2647
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:07,041
So while I was never good,
but it was good compared to regular 

2648
01:57:07,041 --> 01:57:09,351
people.
But listen to this elitist talk over 

2649
01:57:09,351 --> 01:57:09,900
there.
It's true.

2650
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:10,140
Good.

2651
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:12,270
Compared to regular compared to regular 
people.

2652
01:57:12,271 --> 01:57:15,510
I'll fuck you up compared to like those 
real quake players.

2653
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,220
Right?
Like those guys always killed me.

2654
01:57:17,221 --> 01:57:22,221
Yeah.
Well see this is about like the brands 

2655
01:57:22,221 --> 01:57:24,441
trying to to own the entire experience.
I want to own not just your money when 

2656
01:57:26,941 --> 01:57:31,941
you buy the game,
but they want to own everything you do 

2657
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:33,861
with that game after the fact.
You take this psychological approach 

2658
01:57:33,861 --> 01:57:37,611
though,
because I think that it's a very 

2659
01:57:37,611 --> 01:57:38,751
interesting,
not just the psychological approach to 

2660
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:38,751
the reason why people become fanboys,
but particular brands,

2661
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:44,030
but the interactive experience of two 
people enjoying the video game together 

2662
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:48,030
been like those,
those fight games,

2663
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:49,830
those karate games,
you know,

2664
01:57:49,831 --> 01:57:52,410
like mortal kombat duking it out with 
each other.

2665
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,560
That's half the fun is that you're doing
it with another person.

2666
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:56,360
We used to,
uh,

2667
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:58,250
you know,
get home from school and I mean,

2668
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,340
you knew who was good.

2669
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,590
The guy who was good was the guy down 
the street,

2670
01:58:01,970 --> 01:58:02,550
you know,
and it's like,

2671
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:03,690
dude,
beat the game.

2672
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,320
Didn't die once,
you know,

2673
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:07,890
it were legends.
Legends were made,

2674
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:12,891
you know,
now it's an anonymous face somewhere 

2675
01:58:12,891 --> 01:58:12,891
else and everyone's bitching and 
complaining online.

2676
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:15,060
You get on xbox live.
It's a disaster.

2677
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:19,920
The thing about those games though is 
that they can make the day vanish.

2678
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,750
Oh definitely.
They are magic.

2679
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:25,200
You throw those games on your day and oh
look,

2680
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:27,000
you're starving to death and it's three 
in the morning.

2681
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,880
That happened at world of warcraft.
That baby died more than one.

2682
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:36,240
More than one.
There was a few of them.

2683
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:41,430
It was war.
See those games scare the shit out of 

2684
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:43,791
me.
I won't get invested for that reason 

2685
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:43,791
too.
I think what's going to happen

2686
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:47,010
though is especially with all the apple 
tv's and and like google tvs and stuff 

2687
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:48,520
that we're getting going to,
there are going to start taking over the

2688
01:58:48,521 --> 01:58:51,400
game market to a point where all our 
phones are going to be controllers.

2689
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:56,640
If you have an apple tv you can use.
We could download a angry birds and we 

2690
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,000
all come over to my house.
We all pull out our phones.

2691
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:00,210
I can hit up your controller app and we 
all are applying.

2692
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:02,620
It can already send.
We have apple tv.

2693
01:59:02,621 --> 01:59:07,621
You can already send images and video 
screen and you could watch it up on a 

2694
01:59:07,621 --> 01:59:08,500
big screen,
but I'll touch a video.

2695
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:11,650
Ultimately they can't if you.
Unless you're connected,

2696
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:16,950
if,
unless you're tapped in oculus rift 

2697
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:18,901
style plugged in,
they can't monetize what's going on 

2698
01:59:18,901 --> 01:59:19,660
here.
The enjoyment we're having,

2699
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,270
they don't want that.
Doesn't do fuck all for them.

2700
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,460
Like they intend to wheat.
When it first launched,

2701
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:26,590
it was all about getting together with 
friends.

2702
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:31,680
Right.
It didn't even have online gaming I 

2703
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,181
believe,
and you play sports and people are 

2704
01:59:33,181 --> 01:59:35,550
goofing around in front of the fucking 
tv and dancing and doing whatever it 

2705
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:35,550
was.
It was too.

2706
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:39,571
It got to a point and then didn't.
Now nintendo has all kinds of problems 

2707
01:59:39,571 --> 01:59:42,691
because at first it was like it was 
immediately appealing and then it 

2708
01:59:42,691 --> 01:59:43,270
eventually fizzled out.
It didn't have that same kind of.

2709
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:45,090
Nobody gives a fuck about.
We're never here when.

2710
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,660
Exactly.
Exactly.

2711
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:48,520
But in your bedroom it changes 
everything.

2712
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,660
Yeah.
What happened?

2713
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,560
Oh,
you're back to playing.

2714
01:59:50,561 --> 01:59:51,620
I took.
I took my wig.

2715
01:59:51,621 --> 01:59:53,620
You never used it.
I got the new eu.

2716
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:56,320
Has a nice big controller,
a tablet and stuff.

2717
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:58,150
Never touched it.
Decided fuck it.

2718
01:59:58,151 --> 02:00:00,280
I'm going to put in my bedroom tv,
use it for netflix.

2719
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,320
Now I can't get enough of it because 
it's got a huge screen,

2720
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:05,980
so you're scrolling through netflix,
surfing the net,

2721
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:11,010
and then you watch it on the screen and 
you watch on the screen is the perfect 

2722
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:13,540
bedroom pool video games so better as a 
controller than as a video game console.

2723
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:15,220
It kind of is,
but,

2724
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:20,250
but it's,
it's just great because your controller 

2725
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:22,681
is like,
it's like having an ipad and you're 

2726
02:00:22,681 --> 02:00:23,170
searching for videos on netflix or stuff
like that,

2727
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:25,450
which is way better than using your 
remote control.

2728
02:00:25,451 --> 02:00:27,230
The fund,
the r dot,

2729
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:32,760
o dot s and when you're trying to find 
the name of a movie that is annoying as 

2730
02:00:32,921 --> 02:00:36,520
fuck that you can't just go like that 
and put apocalypse now,

2731
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:37,660
you know.
Um,

2732
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:39,620
what do you think about the microsoft 
version of that,

2733
02:00:39,621 --> 02:00:41,110
of the xbox,
that connect?

2734
02:00:41,111 --> 02:00:43,330
Is that what it's called?
What is it called?

2735
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:44,230
Connect.
Yeah.

2736
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,830
And it's like a video thing to camera 
sees your body move.

2737
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,080
How is that not ready for prime time?
Oh,

2738
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:51,400
it works.
You don't look excited.

2739
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:56,970
That's great.
There was a huge controversy with it 

2740
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:58,680
over them having it all be always on,
right,

2741
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:02,300
so they could watch fuck on the couch.
So I don't do,

2742
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:07,630
we came,
we seem to keep coming back to that 

2743
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:09,390
welcome to the podcast,
but we're immature.

2744
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,170
Perfect spot.
Um,

2745
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:14,770
so there was a big controversy at first 
that,

2746
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:19,810
that,
that nobody wanted it and they were 

2747
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:19,810
including the names then it was going to
be always on and then,

2748
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,190
and then it was gonna be expensive and 
all that shit.

2749
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:23,380
And,
and the reason I think people don't want

2750
02:01:23,381 --> 02:01:28,381
it is because like an xbox buyer,
you've got to look at the core 

2751
02:01:28,381 --> 02:01:28,381
demographic of who's going to get an 
xbox.

2752
02:01:28,381 --> 02:01:29,220
The minute it comes out it's,
it's,

2753
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:31,870
there's a certain sex in a certain age 
group,

2754
02:01:31,871 --> 02:01:32,420
et cetera,
that,

2755
02:01:32,421 --> 02:01:37,421
that stuff is popular with and they want
to run around shooting people online 

2756
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:39,010
essentially the vast majority or play 
sports games,

2757
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:39,740
whatever it is.

2758
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:44,330
And there's just only so much you can do
right now in terms of emotion game.

2759
02:01:44,910 --> 02:01:46,820
I do I want to do dance dance 
revolution.

2760
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,110
Yes.
Do I want to.

2761
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,260
Do people learn martial arts on those 
things?

2762
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:53,310
It's striking.
Martial arts could learn.

2763
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:54,320
That's the joe rogan game,

2764
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:59,400
the fitness apps joe,
or some of the best things about the 

2765
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:02,731
connect because it reads your body and 
so like if you're doing like some kind 

2766
02:02:02,731 --> 02:02:05,350
of hard workout that they have available
using xbox fitness,

2767
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:07,240
it will tell you if you're not bending 
your arms,

2768
02:02:07,241 --> 02:02:07,500
right?

2769
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:08,830
Yeah,
and your arms,

2770
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,960
big drums and it tracks how much 
calories,

2771
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:13,690
so I want you to do that with martial 
arts techniques.

2772
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,580
Yeah.
He goes,

2773
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:15,470
no,
no,

2774
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,060
no,
no,

2775
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:16,330
no,
no,

2776
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:16,930
no,
no.

2777
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,800
Not somebody with his credibility.
No,

2778
02:02:18,801 --> 02:02:23,801
no.
That would be something that would be 

2779
02:02:23,801 --> 02:02:26,251
really beneficial to someone learning 
martial arts techniques because most of 

2780
02:02:26,251 --> 02:02:30,751
the striking techniques,
whether it's a striking with your hands 

2781
02:02:30,751 --> 02:02:31,300
or with your feet,
knees and elbows,

2782
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:36,750
you're learning them in the air before 
you ever strike things as like a 

2783
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,350
beginner sort of not even just as a 
beginner,

2784
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:42,730
like one of the most important things 
when I teach people a kicks,

2785
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:47,910
specific kicks is practicing them in 
there because if you're constantly 

2786
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:52,320
relying on hitting something to maintain
your balance and to maintain the 

2787
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,930
distribution of your weight,
you bounce off of things and you'll.

2788
02:02:54,931 --> 02:02:59,931
You'll rely on those things if you don't
penetrate them enough and one of the 

2789
02:02:59,931 --> 02:03:04,051
keys to learning how to kick correctly 
is actually learning how to kick in the 

2790
02:03:04,051 --> 02:03:04,051
air.

2791
02:03:04,051 --> 02:03:08,070
It's also controlling the dexterity of 
your legs because you're not relying on 

2792
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:09,280
anything to stop the momentum of your 
shot.

2793
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:14,430
You have to tighten up your entire body 
on on the extension of the kick or the 

2794
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:15,460
punch.
And so in doing so,

2795
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:19,510
you actually strengthened the tendons 
and if you're doing it correctly,

2796
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:21,700
you develop more dexterity,
more dexterity.

2797
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:26,701
When you're throwing kicks your ability,
there was always a thing in 

2798
02:03:26,701 --> 02:03:26,701
demonstrations.
Um,

2799
02:03:26,701 --> 02:03:28,120
my instructor,
when I was a kid,

2800
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:29,140
uh,
jay hahn,

2801
02:03:29,141 --> 02:03:34,141
kim will do these,
do these really impressive 

2802
02:03:34,141 --> 02:03:35,320
demonstrations where they would throw 
kicks at your face,

2803
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:38,740
like you would stand there and they 
would stop them like right here,

2804
02:03:38,741 --> 02:03:39,650
like,
stop at all.

2805
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:41,120
We would all do that and demonstrate.
Right,

2806
02:03:41,121 --> 02:03:41,470
right,
right,

2807
02:03:41,471 --> 02:03:42,490
right.
Michael o'malley,

2808
02:03:42,491 --> 02:03:44,710
who's another one of my instructors 
who's this incredible,

2809
02:03:44,711 --> 02:03:47,680
a taekwondo black belt,
multiple times national champion,

2810
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:52,150
and he's a big tall guy and he would 
throw these insanely impressive kicks,

2811
02:03:52,151 --> 02:03:56,520
like half an inch from your face.
Just we'll kicks where the toad just,

2812
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:00,550
just he knew because he threw so many 
kicks in the air,

2813
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,590
he knew where objects,
where he knew how to stop.

2814
02:04:02,591 --> 02:04:05,140
So you developed this dexterity so you 
could use that.

2815
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:10,720
The teaching is correctly.
All you would essentially need is an 

2816
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,150
open area where you could extend your 
left,

2817
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:17,160
but I was just about to say is that how 
many people are going to put their foot 

2818
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,900
through their tv on?
There's actually actually two

2819
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,720
games that I know of.
It's one's called ufc trainer,

2820
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,310
which is a game that does,
does that,

2821
02:04:24,311 --> 02:04:29,311
it teaches you different ufc moves,
but there's a new ronda rousey one also 

2822
02:04:29,311 --> 02:04:29,610
that,
uh,

2823
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:31,770
that you just does that pretty much 
does.

2824
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:35,520
It uses your connect and it,
it teaches you different moves.

2825
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:37,400
Kick to the balls.
Kids

2826
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:41,530
kick the balls when you're ready.
Go and kick you out.

2827
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,170
This is ridiculous guys.
The fuck can you do.

2828
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:48,810
Can you do a.
Okay.

2829
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:53,040
I just want to identify something.
As you had that video up,

2830
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:58,041
did anybody notice the physique of the 
two guys playing the average video game 

2831
02:04:58,041 --> 02:04:58,041
player?
Like,

2832
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:00,480
here's your problem.
Have you ever seen the magic?

2833
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:05,481
The gathering photo with a dude went to 
a magic the gathering place and took 

2834
02:05:05,481 --> 02:05:06,080
pictures of everybody's asked cracks,
you know,

2835
02:05:06,081 --> 02:05:10,060
like giving a thumbs up front of all 
these different ass cracks like,

2836
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:15,140
and you know,
that's what I'm getting at though with 

2837
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:16,310
the connect is it's like for guys that 
are really into that thing,

2838
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,150
you don't have a problem getting out of 
the house anyway.

2839
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:22,870
You know what I mean?
It's like this is their god damn.

2840
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:24,600
People move their bodies.
That's right.

2841
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:26,190
Exactly.

2842
02:05:26,190 --> 02:05:31,190
So I don't know.
I don't know if motion gaming will ever 

2843
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:33,210
be will ever be a big thing or if it is 
a big thing,

2844
02:05:33,211 --> 02:05:36,060
it's going to be so far down the road 
that it's just so immersive.

2845
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,490
So amazing.
I like it more for skype.

2846
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:42,220
I like it more for like different 
applications connect game.

2847
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:48,170
It's so cool.
Being able to skype with like I could 

2848
02:05:48,170 --> 02:05:50,210
call you on my xbox called joe rogan and
video skype with you and you're on my 

2849
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:54,060
projector screen.
It's pretty goddamn science fiction shit

2850
02:05:54,061 --> 02:05:55,290
right there.
And that was pretty dope.

2851
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,680
Do you ever do that on the road?
Do you ever bring a laptop on the road 

2852
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:01,080
and html to the tv and skype through the
tv and.

2853
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:02,410
Yeah.
Uh,

2854
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:07,430
I know I was at the airport the other 
day and some kid was bringing this 

2855
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:10,140
console console the whole deal.

2856
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,940
Controllers,
games.

2857
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:14,340
Do that suitcase opened it up.
Do that.

2858
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:15,810
I mean,
to be honest,

2859
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:20,811
I'm not that addicted.
I feel like this whole process of doing 

2860
02:06:20,811 --> 02:06:22,710
what I do has actually desensitizes me 
in a way to a lot of this stuff.

2861
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:25,760
Like I think I was in in some ways more 
of a fanatic before then.

2862
02:06:25,761 --> 02:06:29,940
Now that make any sense.
How come you're jaded?

2863
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,270
Maybe you don't see my kids.
No,

2864
02:06:33,271 --> 02:06:36,090
I'm not.
Maybe you're just normalized.

2865
02:06:36,230 --> 02:06:40,950
What it is is it's like so much for a 
lot of people.

2866
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:45,980
Like I said,
these devices are really important to 

2867
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:45,980
them.
You get,

2868
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:45,980
they get some new thing that's like a 
super highlight,

2869
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:50,750
et cetera.
Of course you're going to be 

2870
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:51,330
psychologically impacted when companies 
are just sending you fucking everything.

2871
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:54,750
[inaudible] how can it not?
It affects you get everything for free.

2872
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:56,190
Everything.
Everything.

2873
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:57,540
do you get to keep?

2874
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,320
No,
not everything.

2875
02:06:58,321 --> 02:07:00,960
I shouldn't say everything.
You get to keep them and this and this.

2876
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:02,910
I don't.
You have to pay for your laptop.

2877
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:06,490
That's apples.
Apple won't give you shit really ever.

2878
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:08,570
Well,
why don't you use something that's.

2879
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:13,580
You said.
If you say there's all these windows 

2880
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:13,580
computers that are grades,
just the user experience was not as good

2881
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:18,390
when he loves windows.
Joe,

2882
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,660
interesting windows.
I'm interested.

2883
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:21,430
No,
I'm not.

2884
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:25,830
I'm not paid by an ied between the line.
I think for yourselves,

2885
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:27,890
ladies and gentlemen,
you hear this clearly as I.

2886
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,340
Let me put it this way.
Let me put it this way.

2887
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:33,540
Pretty much that the vast majority of 
people in my business on youtube,

2888
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:36,370
I know them all personally use apple 
computers.

2889
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:41,700
Yeah.
It's kind of universal amongst anybody 

2890
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:41,700
who has enough money to buy an apple 
computer.

2891
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:44,590
Dell pc people are going to fucking not 
like you saying that.

2892
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,370
Listen,
I'm sorry,

2893
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:47,470
folks tried windows aids,
dark shit.

2894
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:52,050
Tried windows seven diggity diggity dog.
There's a reason why apple is,

2895
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,340
is the company they are and microsoft is
a company there.

2896
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:55,570
That's,
that's the way I like to say it.

2897
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:58,220
We used alienware for the podcast for a 
while,

2898
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:03,470
which makes fucking awesome computers.
We use it for the podcast for awhile 

2899
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:07,320
because they were sponsoring us,
so they gave us some free computers and 

2900
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:07,570
and I liked that.
They sponsor fighters too,

2901
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:08,860
so I wanted to do.
Right?

2902
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:11,950
Yeah.
They have quite a few little guy.

2903
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:13,300
Mighty mouse.
Yeah.

2904
02:08:13,301 --> 02:08:14,350
He makes his johnson.
Oh no,

2905
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:14,860
no,
he's not.

2906
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:17,590
Sorry.
He's got a big sponsor though.

2907
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,460
Oh,
xbox.

2908
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,340
Yes,
he does.

2909
02:08:19,340 --> 02:08:20,180
Last box.
Yeah,

2910
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:22,810
but a lot of guys had been sponsored so 
we,

2911
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:25,150
we really.
The computers are incredible.

2912
02:08:25,151 --> 02:08:28,250
I mean and they are as far as like high 
end laptops,

2913
02:08:28,251 --> 02:08:30,220
like for gaming.
They're monstrous.

2914
02:08:30,221 --> 02:08:31,960
Definitely.
But I didn't like the interface.

2915
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:34,270
The windows notifications kept popping 
up.

2916
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:39,540
All these different.
The notification is driving me fucking 

2917
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:39,540
crazy.
That shit was ridiculous.

2918
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:43,390
This is a clunky operating system.
You guys are clunkers.

2919
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:44,110
It's true,
man.

2920
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:46,930
They the gates too busy chasing pussy.
that's what he's doing.

2921
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:48,580
Yeah,
he doing coke.

2922
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:53,670
He's flying,
flying around his private fucking 

2923
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:53,800
spacecraft.
Allegedly.

2924
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:58,300
Allegedly because tooling around fucking
harbor and his boat.

2925
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:01,190
Microsoft does,
does some good things like the xbox.

2926
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,340
It's a success.
The xbox is success.

2927
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:06,460
Why?
If microsoft is so god damn popular,

2928
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:10,220
why if microsoft is so immersive,
microsoft's prop problem is that they're

2929
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,650
so damn popular.
That's it.

2930
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:17,010
They had to fucking hold on to vintage 
retro stuff for so long because 

2931
02:09:17,591 --> 02:09:19,200
otherwise they would give up a 
percentage of the mark.

2932
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:22,960
God forbid somebody can't type a word 
document or open their excel spreadsheet

2933
02:09:22,961 --> 02:09:25,990
from 1997.
that's really what held them back.

2934
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,970
I think it's a part of it.
I mean,

2935
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:30,430
how do they hold them back in the user 
interface though?

2936
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:35,320
Because when they put out,
when they put out windows a seven,

2937
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:37,990
they put this new.
Was it seven or eight?

2938
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:38,380
No,
sorry,

2939
02:09:38,381 --> 02:09:43,381
windows eight new ui,
which they didn't really want to give a 

2940
02:09:43,381 --> 02:09:43,500
name,
but uh,

2941
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:47,170
it was essentially a touch based ui that
it was a huge overhaul,

2942
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:52,240
right?
Where now they wanted one platform to 

2943
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,240
work on tablets,
laptops,

2944
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,750
desktops,
etc.

2945
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,450
People freaked out.
People were like,

2946
02:09:55,451 --> 02:09:56,860
how am I going to do this?
A,

2947
02:09:56,861 --> 02:09:57,400
b,
c,

2948
02:09:57,401 --> 02:09:59,260
d,
because of the market penetration of the

2949
02:09:59,261 --> 02:10:02,290
old ostp windows seven and xp before 
that.

2950
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:07,290
So on and so forth.
The voice of the people that their old 

2951
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:09,880
customers was louder than that of the 
new customers.

2952
02:10:09,881 --> 02:10:12,320
They didn't have yet much like the 
automakers in,

2953
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:13,020
in,
you know,

2954
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:16,480
the domestic automakers I think had the 
same problem here.

2955
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:21,481
Your user base gets so big that your 
user base gets so big that you're more 

2956
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:27,571
worried about pissing them off.
Then you are about attracting new 

2957
02:10:27,571 --> 02:10:27,571
people.
Wow,

2958
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,170
that's weird.
It is.

2959
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:31,930
They have to take those things into 
consideration when they,

2960
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:34,400
when they innovate,
they have to pull back all the time,

2961
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:40,630
but if you think about it,
you don't want ever bought a mac book 

2962
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:40,630
because they were worried about 
microsoft word.

2963
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:44,740
It's true.
That's the key is you bought a macbook 

2964
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:47,170
because it was a tool,
just a platform and essentially like 

2965
02:10:47,170 --> 02:10:47,510
when you deal with things like 
documents,

2966
02:10:47,511 --> 02:10:49,410
spreadsheets,
you know,

2967
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:52,280
dot doc things almost anything can open 
those now.

2968
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:54,080
It's not just microsoft word.
Exactly,

2969
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:59,081
and that's their problem,
is that what the exclusivity that they 

2970
02:10:59,081 --> 02:11:00,620
had for so long,
he's not really that important anymore.

2971
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:02,690
It doesn't make any sense.
Once upon a time it was,

2972
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:04,040
but now,
I mean google has everything.

2973
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:05,770
You do everything in the cloud.
Google docs does everything.

2974
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:07,490
I haven't.
I haven't touched a microsoft product in

2975
02:11:07,491 --> 02:11:11,270
a very long time in terms of software,
which brings me to those google laptops.

2976
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:13,610
How do you feel about those chromebooks?
Do you like them?

2977
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:15,100
I love them.
Well,

2978
02:11:15,550 --> 02:11:16,140
you fuck with them.

2979
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:21,400
I think it's.
It's the perfect finally price point to 

2980
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:25,301
be able to give somebody like your mom a
laptop and have her do exactly what she 

2981
02:11:25,431 --> 02:11:30,431
wants to do with no extra bullshit.
Like my mom just probably wants to just 

2982
02:11:30,431 --> 02:11:32,240
surf the net.
Maybe look at some photos,

2983
02:11:32,241 --> 02:11:35,840
watched some netflix and that's all 
she's really probably going to do to the

2984
02:11:35,841 --> 02:11:38,300
max.
She's not going to be editing videos and

2985
02:11:38,301 --> 02:11:43,301
if she desert,
I'm sure there's an app that she can 

2986
02:11:43,301 --> 02:11:43,301
actually do it at if she wanted to.
The problem is a lot of people

2987
02:11:43,301 --> 02:11:46,210
saying with chromebooks is why aren't 
chromebooks just android books,

2988
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,880
right.
Is enormous ecosystem of apps available 

2989
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:52,200
on android.
Is it because of the fact that chrome is

2990
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:54,510
their browser and they're trying to.
Chrome is their browser.

2991
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,410
Make the leader.
It's the girl,

2992
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:58,000
is it?
Yup.

2993
02:11:58,060 --> 02:11:58,830
Wow.
By,

2994
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:03,900
by far too crazy.
They beat out microsoft internet 

2995
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:06,660
everywhere.
ASk people who ask the average person 

2996
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:07,740
how they feel about google in general.
You know,

2997
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,780
and everyone always thinks it's a 
positive brand.

2998
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:15,430
Ask them how they feel about microsoft 
and it's a completely different.

2999
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:17,710
So maybe there's some,
some,

3000
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:22,760
some public relations issues.
I don't know exactly what he got fucked 

3001
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:25,981
up there,
but google appears like this company 

3002
02:12:25,981 --> 02:12:29,041
that's giving us all this great shit and
not asking for anything because what 

3003
02:12:29,041 --> 02:12:31,000
they're asking for is fucking way deeper
than that.

3004
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:33,790
Yeah.
They're asking for connection with you.

3005
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:35,650
They're asking for you.
they're asking for.

3006
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:40,670
Yeah.
they're immersing themselves in your 

3007
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:40,670
world and to control.
They want more than your wallet.

3008
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:43,480
Google and microsoft and apple and 
everybody else.

3009
02:12:43,481 --> 02:12:45,220
Remember that song?
we want your soul.

3010
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:48,760
You are dead.
Your house is it?

3011
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:49,510
oh wait,
no,

3012
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:50,560
no,
no,

3013
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:52,060
no.
Somebody else.

3014
02:12:52,270 --> 02:12:53,080
anyway,
cool song.

3015
02:12:53,470 --> 02:12:56,890
But essentially about that.
This immersive connection.

3016
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:02,020
Yep.
Do you think that microsoft fucked up 

3017
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:03,601
because they were a part of.
They were essentially one of the very 

3018
02:13:03,601 --> 02:13:06,120
first like portals into this new world.
Yeah,

3019
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:08,920
like using windows and this world of 
technology,

3020
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:13,921
but now there's new world has kind of 
emerged from the people who grew up in 

3021
02:13:14,351 --> 02:13:19,351
the internet and they grew up with the 
accountability of forums of social 

3022
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:23,680
media.
I take it as a given that this,

3023
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:27,110
this accountability has sort of shaped 
the way they do business were,

3024
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:32,400
which is what I've been saying for a 
long time is what gives me hope because 

3025
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,050
I think the smartest,
most innovative,

3026
02:13:34,051 --> 02:13:39,051
most progressive people in,
in terms of technology and innovation 

3027
02:13:39,051 --> 02:13:39,060
also are very ethical.

3028
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:39,900
Right?
It's,

3029
02:13:39,901 --> 02:13:42,330
it seems to be a part of the whole 
package.

3030
02:13:42,331 --> 02:13:45,690
Like you don't hear about evil,
big new tech companies.

3031
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,840
You hear about companies like google 
companies that are trying to do things 

3032
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:55,101
correctly.
That there were a couple of protests at 

3033
02:13:55,101 --> 02:13:56,340
google io.
Of course they're a,

3034
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:59,250
they recently acquired a boston 
dynamics.

3035
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:00,660
Yeah.
They make robots.

3036
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:04,230
You make pretty fucking gnarly robots 
are robots pro and so,

3037
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:05,340
um,
they also,

3038
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:10,630
they also,
some of their technology goes into some 

3039
02:14:10,630 --> 02:14:10,630
of those drones doing that activity out.
Well,

3040
02:14:10,630 --> 02:14:12,000
how about artificial intelligence as 
well?

3041
02:14:12,001 --> 02:14:17,001
I mean,
they also have kurzweil on board who 

3042
02:14:17,001 --> 02:14:17,001
wants to make people turn into fucking 
computers.

3043
02:14:17,001 --> 02:14:20,870
So The overlords.
I don't honestly don't be scared.

3044
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:26,460
I feel like super technologically 
advanced people are insanely secular.

3045
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,250
I don't know where their moral compass 
is.

3046
02:14:29,251 --> 02:14:33,890
I think they get off on control really.
In what way?

3047
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:36,030
Well,
this.

3048
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,380
Look at google's ecosystem for example,
or even apple's.

3049
02:14:39,450 --> 02:14:41,310
Okay.
Everywhere you go.

3050
02:14:41,311 --> 02:14:43,980
The objective of one product is to get 
you to buy the next one.

3051
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:46,920
Is it though is the objective of their 
products?

3052
02:14:46,930 --> 02:14:48,990
Let's talk about google maps.
Google.

3053
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:54,020
Google is an advertising company and 
it's funny that I'm talking about them 

3054
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,470
because in a sense that employee,
the both of us,

3055
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:59,820
we both post shit on youtube and yeah,
I'm a big fan since monday and I love.

3056
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:03,000
I have a unique insight as well because 
a good friend works there.

3057
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:04,170
Yeah.
At a very high level.

3058
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:09,190
My friends worked there too and it's.
I'm not trying to say anything negative 

3059
02:15:09,190 --> 02:15:09,300
about it,
but.

3060
02:15:09,301 --> 02:15:10,020
No,
I know you're not.

3061
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:14,760
But the model is such that for us to get
the most out of technology,

3062
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:16,980
we technology has to get the most out of
us.

3063
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:19,380
Yeah.
But isn't that just a side effect of the

3064
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:20,310
immersion?
sure.

3065
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:21,810
I mean,
I don'T think that's what I said.

3066
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:24,310
It's not negative or positive,
it's just is.

3067
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:29,900
But that's what we're talking about 
today about your phone preemptively 

3068
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:34,551
knowing how far you are from work 
because you're going to work and it's 

3069
02:15:34,551 --> 02:15:36,030
right.
We always look at the negatives,

3070
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:39,780
but the positives of that,
let's go back to the porsche or let's go

3071
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:44,781
back to the muscle car.
That there will always be individuals 

3072
02:15:44,781 --> 02:15:44,781
that liked it better the way it was 
before.

3073
02:15:44,781 --> 02:15:46,890
Yes,
but the good thing is you can have both,

3074
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:48,570
but you can't.
With phones,

3075
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:50,220
you can't.
Some do.

3076
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:53,660
Do they go back to the flip phone?
We sell them on ting tang.

3077
02:15:53,690 --> 02:15:57,540
So they sold the beautiful fucking 
shitty button phones.

3078
02:15:58,590 --> 02:16:01,350
My guess would be that that's not an 
expanding market.

3079
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:06,380
Dana white,
he fucking uses one of those all the 

3080
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:06,380
time.
That's how he does all his texting.

3081
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:06,930
Whenever you do appreciate you telling 
that to everybody.

3082
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:08,640
He loves it.
He jokes about it.

3083
02:16:08,641 --> 02:16:13,641
He takes.
I have pictures of him holding up his 

3084
02:16:13,641 --> 02:16:13,641
phone.
He um,

3085
02:16:13,641 --> 02:16:16,790
he can do it at a dinner.
He could be at dinner and he's so good 

3086
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:20,631
with his thumb.
[inaudible] he can be underneath the 

3087
02:16:20,631 --> 02:16:23,511
table texting you.
That's a very bizarre use case scenario 

3088
02:16:23,511 --> 02:16:24,960
I liked.
I really like it.

3089
02:16:24,961 --> 02:16:27,510
He's a real wizard with it.
So I've had him show me.

3090
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:30,130
He's done it before where he'll,
he'll go,

3091
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:36,120
he'll look at his phone real quick and 
then he puts it out because he gets it 

3092
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:36,340
onto my number and he puts it under the 
table and just.

3093
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:37,630
And then all of a sudden,
my thing,

3094
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:39,350
dude,
I'm texting you right now and I'm like,

3095
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:45,080
this is crazy.
He does it all with his thumb because 

3096
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:47,470
it's thumb is so educated as to where 
like three presses to get an s.

3097
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,660
That's right.
Doing all that shit.

3098
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:49,290
Nine.
yeah.

3099
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:51,520
He's doing all that shit.
That's ridiculous.

3100
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:52,900
That's a skill he doesn't want to give 
up.

3101
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:54,130
You know,
he's got to stick with it.

3102
02:16:54,131 --> 02:16:59,131
It is a skill.
I was reading this thing the other day 

3103
02:16:59,131 --> 02:17:01,891
about typing and handwriting recognition
and one of the things that they were 

3104
02:17:01,891 --> 02:17:05,620
talking about was shorthand.
Is that like,

3105
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:08,140
people forget that short really writing 
thing.

3106
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:08,790
Yes.
Yes.

3107
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:10,780
Gregg shorthand.
I think it's called.

3108
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,810
I forget the,
it's like really old technology from the

3109
02:17:13,811 --> 02:17:15,220
18 hundreds.
Oh wow.

3110
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,890
The,
the implementation of it when they first

3111
02:17:17,891 --> 02:17:20,530
started using it and like what things 
stand for,

3112
02:17:20,531 --> 02:17:25,531
what vowels and what things.
And you could write hundreds of words 

3113
02:17:25,531 --> 02:17:27,040
per minute in shorthand faster than you 
could ever fucking type.

3114
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:27,970
Wow.
Yeah.

3115
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,920
But it never took off.
Well it did.

3116
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:34,950
It just took off for people didn't have 
computers and once people develop 

3117
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:39,361
typewriters and computers,
there's a new pen that they have that 

3118
02:17:39,361 --> 02:17:39,550
uh,
I haven't,

3119
02:17:39,790 --> 02:17:44,790
I,
I ordered it just to see like what the 

3120
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:44,790
fuck the technology was like.
Oh,

3121
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:45,400
one of those scribe pens.
It.

3122
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:46,750
Yes.
This is what it does.

3123
02:17:46,751 --> 02:17:50,440
It doesn't just know this is what it 
does as you're writing,

3124
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:53,590
it takes a photograph of your notes.
Cool.

3125
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:58,770
It also transcribes and audio,
like if there's an audio recording 

3126
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:59,360
capability.

3127
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:00,940
So say if you.
And I were talking,

3128
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:03,550
I was doing an interview with you and I 
was asking you about all these different

3129
02:18:03,551 --> 02:18:06,580
things and I was writing down my notes,
it would take photos of the notes and it

3130
02:18:06,581 --> 02:18:11,581
would take photos of the notes and 
correspond those notes to the audio 

3131
02:18:11,581 --> 02:18:13,720
recording.
So if I said at that time has come,

3132
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:18,790
no biggest dick is right.
And then like I would click on that and 

3133
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:21,931
then it would go back to the 
conversation where You were talking 

3134
02:18:21,931 --> 02:18:22,150
about women always being in pain when 
you have sex.

3135
02:18:22,151 --> 02:18:22,770
Like,
oh yeah,

3136
02:18:22,810 --> 02:18:24,250
that's why,
you know.

3137
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:27,590
So for students,
a student lecture,

3138
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:30,040
whatever that perfect example,
perfect example,

3139
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:32,100
as long as it didn't lecture was clear 
enough.

3140
02:18:32,101 --> 02:18:34,030
You didn't take in too much extraneous 
noise.

3141
02:18:34,031 --> 02:18:39,031
Yeah,
they were close to the actual yes or 

3142
02:18:39,031 --> 02:18:39,031
whatever.
But what a great idea.

3143
02:18:39,031 --> 02:18:39,031
I mean,
I,

3144
02:18:39,031 --> 02:18:40,350
I think I should pull up the,
uh,

3145
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:43,620
the name of it just in case I've heard 
of them.

3146
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:44,560
I've never tried it.

3147
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:49,570
One,
I'd like to have the old one where you 

3148
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:49,700
just had a little memory card and it 
just remembered what you wrote.

3149
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:55,080
And I just never really does he,
does this translate the written word 

3150
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,990
into a digital form?
That's a very good question.

3151
02:18:56,991 --> 02:18:57,950
Icd,
I think.

3152
02:18:58,010 --> 02:18:59,720
I think it did back.
I don't,

3153
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:04,990
I never really played with it too much,
but I know like a lot of things can do 

3154
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:04,990
that now with most scanners.

3155
02:19:05,310 --> 02:19:09,810
it's called a live scribe guy.
Why fly pen?

3156
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:11,820
It's really interesting,
man.

3157
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:14,220
I'm really curious to try this thing 
out.

3158
02:19:14,221 --> 02:19:16,680
I mean,
I wish almost that I was a reporter will

3159
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:19,890
report on it when you get hit much work.
But um,

3160
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:25,060
the,
the idea behind it is quite fascinating 

3161
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:25,060
and I love that.
I,

3162
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:27,950
I had read something about shorthand and
that's where,

3163
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,680
uh,
it,

3164
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:29,450
it,
uh,

3165
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:32,090
yeah,
these guys have been around for a bit,

3166
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:35,120
but this is obviously a new product.
Yes.

3167
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:37,910
Yeah.
Shorthand is fucking interesting,

3168
02:19:37,911 --> 02:19:39,860
man.
It's interesting.

3169
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:41,600
Yeah,
it is gregg shorthand.

3170
02:19:41,601 --> 02:19:46,601
That's what it's called,
named after the inventor who's named 

3171
02:19:46,601 --> 02:19:46,601
john robert.
Greg,

3172
02:19:46,601 --> 02:19:48,560
system of penn stenography that gained 
popularity,

3173
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:53,980
popularity in the early 20th century.
But it was a crate created a long 

3174
02:19:54,231 --> 02:19:55,550
fucking time ago.
No kidding.

3175
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:56,870
No.
Um,

3176
02:19:56,900 --> 02:20:01,900
but I love the idea that this pen 
records an audio of us having a 

3177
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:04,130
conversation and then like I should use 
it for podcasts.

3178
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:08,780
That's really what I think I might 
actually use it because I have stacks of

3179
02:20:08,781 --> 02:20:13,781
these things sometimes that I go over 
like these nodes during shows.

3180
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:16,070
Shit,
I feel like I'm underperforming you only

3181
02:20:16,071 --> 02:20:18,110
I don't think you took like one note so 
far today.

3182
02:20:18,170 --> 02:20:19,880
Well,
it's really usually things that I wanted

3183
02:20:19,881 --> 02:20:24,881
to talk about that I forgot or that I 
knew I was going to look that or didn't 

3184
02:20:24,881 --> 02:20:29,141
want to forget or an idea that I had 
while it was happening because I don't 

3185
02:20:29,141 --> 02:20:31,430
remember half of these fucking things.
Nigerian gay marriage.

3186
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:32,840
Okay.
What the fuck does that mean?

3187
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:37,010
The world's end herbie's infected monkey
in Florida?

3188
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,050
Uh,
emotional needs dog.

3189
02:20:39,051 --> 02:20:41,660
Some juicy stuff there.
Yeti attenborough.

3190
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:42,920
Colorado floods.
Yeah.

3191
02:20:42,921 --> 02:20:46,550
I mean I don't know what half these 
fucking things mean what the point was.

3192
02:20:46,551 --> 02:20:51,551
But if I had,
if I had written them down with a 

3193
02:20:51,551 --> 02:20:51,890
corresponding audio recording,
I mean,

3194
02:20:51,891 --> 02:20:53,370
then I would really be able to click on 
it.

3195
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Possibly jr.
The that's when he was talking about 

3196
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,000
this and I wanted to bring up that 
amazing.

3197
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:04,590
Just I love that aspect of uh,
of new technology and apparently it 

3198
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:05,840
works on a special type of paper as 
well.

3199
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:07,250
Yeah.
I'll find out all about.

3200
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:08,870
I won't do an unboxing,
but I'll,

3201
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:11,800
I'll talk about it on this.
I think you should do.

3202
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:14,300
I think you should do not doing it.
I think you should.

3203
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,920
I'll tell you about it and you could do 
it.

3204
02:21:15,930 --> 02:21:20,420
That's why I have decided to limit 
myself as far as how many things I do.

3205
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:23,600
If I don't,
I will just keep doing things true.

3206
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:24,320
And next,
you know,

3207
02:21:24,321 --> 02:21:26,840
I'll be a professional racquetball 
player or something stupid,

3208
02:21:26,841 --> 02:21:28,820
which would be pretty cool.
Take up a lot of time.

3209
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:33,320
Whatever it is that I have,
whatever my disease is,

3210
02:21:33,321 --> 02:21:34,760
I know how to manage it.

3211
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:36,230
That's good.
Don't do too many things.

3212
02:21:36,231 --> 02:21:37,930
So no unboxing videos?
No,

3213
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:38,140
no,
no,

3214
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:43,150
no.
I'm just joking around what you want to 

3215
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:45,401
know.
Something like the origin of unboxing 

3216
02:21:45,401 --> 02:21:46,460
videos is the everyday guy.
Not in this world.

3217
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:47,920
Yes.
You know,

3218
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:53,170
getting something and giving you his 
reaction in some ways you become 

3219
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:57,311
sophisticated to a point where you might
not be addressing the things that the 

3220
02:21:57,311 --> 02:21:57,311
everyday guy is looking to have 
addressed.

3221
02:21:57,311 --> 02:22:02,310
It's possible,
but essentially you are the everyday 

3222
02:22:02,310 --> 02:22:03,830
god.
I sTill am the everyday guy but immersed

3223
02:22:03,831 --> 02:22:08,831
in this world of technology and a far 
deeper level and isn't it the everyday 

3224
02:22:08,831 --> 02:22:11,890
guys opportunity to listen to that.
Watch those and then I'm on.

3225
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:15,740
I'm on the joe rogan podcast right now.
So you know,

3226
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,470
in some ways,
yes you already everyday guy,

3227
02:22:18,471 --> 02:22:20,630
but when you start talking to these 
brands directly,

3228
02:22:20,631 --> 02:22:23,840
things get fucking weird,
but things get weird.

3229
02:22:23,841 --> 02:22:25,440
It affects you,
you a does.

3230
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:25,660
It

3231
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:27,660
does.
It doesN't affect us.

3232
02:22:27,750 --> 02:22:28,980
I mean it does,
but it doesn't.

3233
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:33,640
It goes men.
And what way did you do,

3234
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:37,010
do you like put on kid gloves for lg?
No,

3235
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:37,800
no,
no,

3236
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:38,440
no.
I just,

3237
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:41,490
I'm having a hard way to.
I'm finding it hard to articulate,

3238
02:22:41,491 --> 02:22:43,380
but tech news,
right?

3239
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:45,770
Big tech sites that are out there,
right?

3240
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:49,890
They have a report underneath on a 
review,

3241
02:22:49,891 --> 02:22:54,891
for example,
the product they're reviewing does a 

3242
02:22:54,891 --> 02:22:56,070
huge banner ad right above it.
Yeah,

3243
02:22:56,071 --> 02:23:00,180
but if they are honest and always 
committed to being honest,

3244
02:23:00,210 --> 02:23:03,210
I mean that isn't that goddamn essential
for the company themselves.

3245
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:05,040
If you.
If you put out a dud,

3246
02:23:05,250 --> 02:23:07,050
I'm sorry,
but you put out a fucking done.

3247
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,200
Well you need to do is get rid of those 
weak ass engineers and designers to put 

3248
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:12,200
out that.
Doug,

3249
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:12,590
if you don't,
your fucking business is gonna.

3250
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:13,920
Go under.
They do do that.

3251
02:23:13,921 --> 02:23:16,530
There's a tide coming.
If you've got a shitty foundation,

3252
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:18,990
fucking house is going to get into the 
ocean definitely,

3253
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:24,200
but all these tech websites have a floor
full of salespeople in a floor full of 

3254
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,250
reporters.
Those floor for whoever's the problem.

3255
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:28,200
Then they need to say anybody's a 
problem.

3256
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:31,260
I'm saying thrown into the water.
We're not reporting on a murder.

3257
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:36,380
You're reporting on something that 
somebody spending a lot of money to try 

3258
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:36,380
and sell,
but if it's dog shit,

3259
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:37,800
dog shit.
I agree with that,

3260
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:43,040
but that's not so much of an issue 
anymore because this is getting really 

3261
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:43,950
iterative.
It's not so much an issue anymore of dog

3262
02:23:43,951 --> 02:23:44,970
shit,
dog shit.

3263
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,770
It's.
we're talking about a sliver.

3264
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,940
In fact,
a popular tech website that I won't name

3265
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:54,990
for a very long time has been running 
ties.

3266
02:23:54,991 --> 02:23:59,580
They do appoint analysis on devices and 
he'd been running ties on the flagship,

3267
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,680
a android phones and the iphone.

3268
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:05,640
A tie on a point,
like a decimal point analysis.

3269
02:24:05,820 --> 02:24:07,680
How the fuck do they tie?
Exactly.

3270
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:10,590
We'll do.
They tie exactly because they just tie.

3271
02:24:10,591 --> 02:24:11,430
Exactly.
No,

3272
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:16,460
they do not because they're doing it 
because they don't want to piss people 

3273
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:16,460
off.
So you don't believe them.

3274
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,210
I don't.
I won't make that leap,

3275
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:22,250
but when I see something like that,
I automatically might.

3276
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:25,590
My mind starts telling me that there's 
something more here than meets the eye.

3277
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:30,100
Isn't there an issue also with putting a
quantitative value on a roof?

3278
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:32,570
Oh,
most dedicated five stalls,

3279
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:38,040
four and a half star,
so I'm talking like eight point three 

3280
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:41,790
decimal point analysis.
What we saw that about the ufc game when

3281
02:24:41,791 --> 02:24:46,791
you were watching that connect ufc game,
it was like six point five and it's 

3282
02:24:46,791 --> 02:24:47,640
review.
That's right.

3283
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:52,820
Because those exist because people want 
to be told what to buy.

3284
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:57,840
They don't want to do the work and I'm 
not hating on the audience.

3285
02:24:57,870 --> 02:25:00,330
Everybody's busy as fuck.
You know,

3286
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:04,020
if you can tune in and find out what the
best shit is in five minutes or less,

3287
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,730
so be it,
do it.

3288
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:10,810
Yeah.
The problem is that the more you take 

3289
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:13,671
your guard down and the more that you 
allow for yourself to be programmed to 

3290
02:25:13,741 --> 02:25:18,741
respond to those things,
the less likely that you're going to be 

3291
02:25:18,741 --> 02:25:19,080
able to get any kind of accuracy out of 
it.

3292
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:21,900
Totally makes sense.
Yeah,

3293
02:25:22,550 --> 02:25:23,970
I,
I see what you're saying.

3294
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:26,530
It's certainly opens up the door to that
possibility.

3295
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:29,350
So you've got all these people in the 
business calling themselves journalists.

3296
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:31,990
I've always been against it.
I've always been against it.

3297
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:34,330
I don't think you can be a product 
journalists,

3298
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:37,810
but you know,
that's a very interesting situation when

3299
02:25:37,811 --> 02:25:39,520
someone's an embedded journalist.

3300
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:41,350
Right.
And what do you mean by embedded?

3301
02:25:41,380 --> 02:25:46,380
Well,
you were also in bed with the company 

3302
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:46,380
that literally.
Yeah,

3303
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:46,380
yeah.
Got it.

3304
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:46,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

3305
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:51,360
I mean there's an issue with mixed 
martial arts and the ufc has had 

3306
02:25:51,551 --> 02:25:55,720
problems with companies that have been 
critical of the ufc and it's damaged the

3307
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:58,780
relationship they have with the,
with the reporters.

3308
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:04,170
But if you're a real reporter and you 
have a real opinion that the problem is 

3309
02:26:04,601 --> 02:26:09,601
when you work for a corporation,
when you're an independent like 

3310
02:26:09,601 --> 02:26:12,421
yourself,
it is the responsibility of that 

3311
02:26:12,421 --> 02:26:14,941
independent to be completely objective 
because that's what everybody turns to 

3312
02:26:14,941 --> 02:26:15,850
you for.
And as soon as we can't count on you for

3313
02:26:15,851 --> 02:26:20,851
that,
the whole process of having an 

3314
02:26:20,851 --> 02:26:21,010
independent,
it becomes irrelevant.

3315
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:22,930
it doesn't matter.
You're not an independent.

3316
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:25,380
You might say you're an independence,
but you're an lg fan boy.

3317
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:30,440
There's no doubt that there is no doubt 
that the reason channels like mine have 

3318
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:34,330
successes because we are third parties 
because we are not in any meaningful way

3319
02:26:34,331 --> 02:26:35,080
attached to anything.

3320
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:38,370
And because for the most part we look to
be a like,

3321
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:40,270
like everybody else.
Like here we are.

3322
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:45,271
We started a youtube channel,
well anybody could start a youtube 

3323
02:26:45,271 --> 02:26:45,271
channel,
so the context helps,

3324
02:26:45,271 --> 02:26:48,931
helps to support the messaging in a way,
but the problem is that the further 

3325
02:26:48,931 --> 02:26:53,371
along this path you go,
the more important you become and the 

3326
02:26:53,371 --> 02:26:53,550
and the treatment changes,
you know,

3327
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:56,170
it's like if you were walking,
it's like a.

3328
02:26:56,260 --> 02:27:00,640
If you're a really good looking person,
lets me bitch to future rogan and you're

3329
02:27:00,641 --> 02:27:02,140
walking around.
Yeah,

3330
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:03,370
you know what?
Fuck it.

3331
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:05,890
Let's use joe rogan as an example.
So just brian red band,

3332
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:08,320
too late,
too late,

3333
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:10,210
sexy face.
If you're walking around,

3334
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:15,540
you get a certain kind of treatment and 
that treatment that you get develops 

3335
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:16,360
character.
You can't help it.

3336
02:27:16,380 --> 02:27:17,750
So like hot women,
hot women,

3337
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:20,230
women grow.
They have a certain amount of worth that

3338
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:22,900
they attached to themselves because they
are everywhere they go.

3339
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:25,240
They treated like,
like royal hate him for it.

3340
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:27,610
That's the world.
We're a product of the environment.

3341
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:32,640
Right?
And I can't pretend that I am not a 

3342
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:32,640
product of the environment that I have 
to exist within.

3343
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:36,790
Well,
I just have specIfic rules that I.

3344
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,010
When I,
when I engage in,

3345
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:44,100
in,
in my environments where I have 

3346
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:44,100
privileges,
I have very specific.

3347
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:44,740
Okay,
let's hear about it.

3348
02:27:44,830 --> 02:27:49,830
like martial arts,
it's a huge one because the ufc that I 

3349
02:27:49,830 --> 02:27:52,240
work for is the biggest,
greatest mixed martial arts organization

3350
02:27:52,241 --> 02:27:53,440
ever.
However,

3351
02:27:53,530 --> 02:27:58,530
along the way,
during the time that I've been employed 

3352
02:27:58,530 --> 02:28:01,771
with them over the past 12 years,
there have been instances where I've 

3353
02:28:01,771 --> 02:28:05,101
actively promoted fighters that were in 
other organizations really because I 

3354
02:28:05,101 --> 02:28:08,641
liked them because I liked him because I
think they're really good and they 

3355
02:28:08,641 --> 02:28:08,641
didn't have to be honest,
but they didn't pay you anything.

3356
02:28:08,641 --> 02:28:09,250
Not a fucking penny.
Right,

3357
02:28:09,251 --> 02:28:10,660
okay.
Because I have to be honest,

3358
02:28:10,810 --> 02:28:15,810
when fate or amelia danko was in pride,
he was one of the best heavyweights in 

3359
02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:16,450
the world.
I constantly,

3360
02:28:16,451 --> 02:28:20,320
we talk about him on broadcasts to the 
point where like some people didn't like

3361
02:28:20,321 --> 02:28:22,790
it and some people thought it was like 
not smart.

3362
02:28:22,791 --> 02:28:24,560
Not over there,
but it is smArt.

3363
02:28:24,561 --> 02:28:27,140
You know why it's smart?
Because I have to be honest,

3364
02:28:27,350 --> 02:28:32,350
if there's some guy out there that's 
murdering motherfuckers and some other 

3365
02:28:32,350 --> 02:28:35,621
organization and I pretend that the guys
that we have and the only guys that I 

3366
02:28:35,621 --> 02:28:39,881
want to see fight,
then that's ridiculous that I'm a 

3367
02:28:39,881 --> 02:28:39,881
ridiculous person and I don't deserve 
that position.

3368
02:28:39,881 --> 02:28:42,500
I completely agree with you.
So in that same vein,

3369
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:44,900
isn't it the case with tech reporting 
like.

3370
02:28:44,901 --> 02:28:48,110
Yes,
you do get a very privileged position.

3371
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,340
Lg center,
they you,

3372
02:28:49,350 --> 02:28:51,660
they're sexy new watch and you're 
getting all this.

3373
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:52,760
Let me explain.
Let me,

3374
02:28:53,090 --> 02:28:55,850
let me give you an example of this.
This phone,

3375
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:58,340
the most popular single device on the 
planet.

3376
02:28:58,341 --> 02:28:59,600
You paid for it.
Yes,

3377
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:04,490
but this phone,
this phone specifically is,

3378
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,380
it's,
it's,

3379
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:10,460
it's probably the best way to do an 
analysis of the entire market because of

3380
02:29:10,461 --> 02:29:13,940
how popular it is and because of how 
important it is as a piece of news,

3381
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:15,620
iphone,
iphone,

3382
02:29:15,621 --> 02:29:18,350
iphone five s with little thumbprint 
thing,

3383
02:29:18,351 --> 02:29:20,990
you can use your dick for as well.
Yes,

3384
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:22,370
I did this.
You did.

3385
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:24,950
And you could spoof it and you could 
spoof it with a little bit of wax.

3386
02:29:24,951 --> 02:29:25,710
But anyway,
who fit?

3387
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:26,480
Yeah,
hack it.

3388
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:31,880
So chop off somebody's finger and use in
april battery or you could do that.

3389
02:29:31,881 --> 02:29:32,930
Yeah,
eight volt battery.

3390
02:29:32,990 --> 02:29:35,780
I think if you catch a person sleeping 
and dip their finger in hot wax,

3391
02:29:35,781 --> 02:29:36,660
that will do the job to.

3392
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:42,020
Yeah.
You don't have to chop terrible level.

3393
02:29:42,350 --> 02:29:46,310
This device.
This device moves the needle.

3394
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:51,880
The reason apple doesn't spend as much 
money on marketing and samsung because 

3395
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:51,880
they don't have to.
This phone comes out.

3396
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,330
It's on the cover in the New York times 
has done.

3397
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:55,520
Why is that?
Well,

3398
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:57,800
it's the best because there's a couple 
of reasons though.

3399
02:29:58,150 --> 02:30:00,380
It's actually,
it's actually not that easy.

3400
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,810
When they are about to launch a new 
device.

3401
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:05,510
They give this out to people.
They sent it to.

3402
02:30:05,570 --> 02:30:08,480
Apple does send stuff to people.
Read that to me,

3403
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:12,260
but to come out to you,
oh god knows.

3404
02:30:12,261 --> 02:30:17,261
I picked some south american traditional
media people fucking business week.

3405
02:30:17,901 --> 02:30:19,220
That kind of shit.
Exactly.

3406
02:30:19,250 --> 02:30:20,920
Wall street journal.
Bingo.

3407
02:30:20,930 --> 02:30:23,110
Some fucking crook over there.
You got it.

3408
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:27,740
Let me tell you how it works.
You.

3409
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:29,810
Oh,
I just noticed that was shot in toronto,

3410
02:30:29,811 --> 02:30:31,190
that jimi hendrix pictures.
oh yeah,

3411
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:34,460
man.
Got arrested for heroin down there on.

3412
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:37,220
Um,
okay.

3413
02:30:37,221 --> 02:30:40,190
So a very selective group of people gets
this device,

3414
02:30:40,250 --> 02:30:42,590
then they maintain something,
uh,

3415
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:47,850
beside it called the black list.
And black list is people who are never 

3416
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:48,290
going to get the device for one reason 
or another.

3417
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,610
There are many ways to get on that list.
Are you blacklisted?

3418
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:55,660
No,
there's no public record of the black 

3419
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:55,660
list,
but it's just a black list.

3420
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:56,150
Everyone in business knows that it 
exists.

3421
02:30:56,180 --> 02:30:58,310
I want to do a fucking documentary on 
this by the way,

3422
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:01,890
because nobody would watch it except you
and your friend that review shit.

3423
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:03,200
no,
because apple,

3424
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:08,230
apple is a giant.
Like apple affects our lives in ways 

3425
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:09,860
everyone's life in a way that might not 
be or I might not be articulating.

3426
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:13,460
But um,
so how does that process work?

3427
02:31:13,461 --> 02:31:15,490
How do they decide who gets that device?
Well,

3428
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:19,260
you would assume that the people with 
the biggest audiences maybe would get it

3429
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:20,100
or maybe just

3430
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,720
send it to anybody who wants to talk 
about it.

3431
02:31:21,721 --> 02:31:23,370
You'd think all the exposure would be 
good,

3432
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:28,480
right?
Well why is it that when this device 

3433
02:31:28,480 --> 02:31:31,200
launched like 15 motherfuckers got it 
worldwide,

3434
02:31:31,650 --> 02:31:36,650
like a super limited number in inner 
circle of reporters because they can 

3435
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:42,201
count on those people to only give 
glowing reviews and if those people 

3436
02:31:42,201 --> 02:31:46,790
working for whoever decide that they're 
going to write something different 

3437
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:51,051
guests where they can find their new 
home to blacklist some motherfucking 

3438
02:31:51,051 --> 02:31:51,051
black.
Yeah,

3439
02:31:51,051 --> 02:31:52,290
but that's their fault.
Whose fault?

3440
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:55,860
Their fault really,
because the reason that newspapers doors

3441
02:31:55,861 --> 02:31:57,930
are open is because of the fucking 
device.

3442
02:31:57,990 --> 02:32:02,990
The coverage sells the ads.
The reason why newspapers doors is open 

3443
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:04,110
while they're barely fucking burned to 
the ground,

3444
02:32:04,450 --> 02:32:06,930
great fires,
but truthfully,

3445
02:32:06,931 --> 02:32:11,931
it's not just the newspapers.
There's big tech sites that get them as 

3446
02:32:11,931 --> 02:32:11,931
well,
I'm sure.

3447
02:32:11,931 --> 02:32:11,931
Yeah,
so there's a.

3448
02:32:11,931 --> 02:32:15,210
There is a group that gets it,
but the problem is you have this fear,

3449
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:20,330
this inherent fear that if you don't do 
what the controlling party says to do,

3450
02:32:20,761 --> 02:32:25,761
you don't get that access to the device 
anymore and unfortunately it's the 

3451
02:32:25,761 --> 02:32:28,320
access to the device that drives the 
trafficking.

3452
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:33,560
Because if you get this review up a week
before anyone else gets what happens to 

3453
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:36,660
everybody else's reviews,
what happens to the value of them dips,

3454
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:41,720
because the majority of the purchasing 
and purchasing decisions are made based 

3455
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:45,531
on the very initial reviews.
But how much value is there in a high 

3456
02:32:45,531 --> 02:32:49,650
traffic site these days?
Big massive values.

3457
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:51,800
Fucking you.
So a site like,

3458
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:55,620
like ars technica.
Is that a high traffic one?

3459
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,580
Yeah,
that's a big one.

3460
02:32:56,581 --> 02:33:01,581
Diverge is with the verge verge.
So a guy who writes for one of those is 

3461
02:33:02,371 --> 02:33:03,390
going to get access.

3462
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:04,340
Let me say,
let me put it this.

3463
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:05,850
Let me.
Let me say this like this.

3464
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:10,880
If you're a reporter working at the 
verge and you get the task of doing the 

3465
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:10,880
new iphone,
and listen,

3466
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:14,420
I am not fucking attacking to verge.
The Iphone is a great phone call,

3467
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:17,220
arguably the best phone in the market 
and nobody really comes out and says,

3468
02:33:17,221 --> 02:33:22,221
shit that's untrue about it.
I'm just talking about a potential that 

3469
02:33:22,221 --> 02:33:26,061
exists that steers in a direction 
outside way outside the world of 

3470
02:33:26,061 --> 02:33:30,891
journalism.
That doesn't happen when somebody is 

3471
02:33:30,891 --> 02:33:32,691
murdered or you're investigating a crime
or you're whatever it is that 

3472
02:33:32,691 --> 02:33:36,141
investigative journalism is when the 
story is something that somebody else 

3473
02:33:36,541 --> 02:33:39,540
controls and dishes to only certain 
parties.

3474
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:44,010
There's behavioral patterns that exist 
because of that relationship of course,

3475
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:49,190
and there's also behavioral patterns 
that exist in it being financially 

3476
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:50,640
beneficial for you to support certain 
companies.

3477
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:55,670
That's what I was saying,
and this is also the psychological 

3478
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:57,561
aspect of knowing that you're on this 
elite list of 15 journalists that are 

3479
02:33:57,561 --> 02:33:58,200
going to receive a new phone that's 
going to be like,

3480
02:33:58,201 --> 02:33:59,760
look at.
You can't write that.

3481
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:01,090
do you think guys?
Right,

3482
02:34:01,091 --> 02:34:04,070
like really scathing reviews and then 
like park them aside and go,

3483
02:34:04,071 --> 02:34:05,190
ha ha ha,
that was just for fun.

3484
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,740
LeT's suck some dick.
Definitely.

3485
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:12,770
There's guys,
there's guys that have written stories 

3486
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:12,770
after the fact,
after they've been blacklisted,

3487
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:13,650
uh,
about blending the,

3488
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:15,810
explaining what happened.
And I getting a device anymore.

3489
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:19,210
And the problem,
the verge for example,

3490
02:34:19,211 --> 02:34:20,980
has record page views.
The days these,

3491
02:34:21,130 --> 02:34:24,580
these devices launch record page views 
I'm sure.

3492
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:27,010
So they have to,
they have to have it early.

3493
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:32,340
They have to can't the door,
like literally people are employed on 

3494
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:36,391
that paycheck.
You're seeing a percentage that came 

3495
02:34:36,391 --> 02:34:37,600
from that fucking report from having 
access to that product.

3496
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:42,630
BuT if you get one,
like if how much difference would it 

3497
02:34:42,630 --> 02:34:44,710
make if you get one of the day comes out
like when everybody is just what I do,

3498
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:50,040
which is wait in line like a fucking 
idiot who could junior old school you 

3499
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:51,250
have to but for this,
for this stuff.

3500
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:56,400
The other stuff I get,
I get early now and the other brands do 

3501
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:56,400
it.
They like fuck it,

3502
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:57,430
let's get this shit out there.
You know,

3503
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:01,840
apple fuck note.
Their pr team is like,

3504
02:35:01,841 --> 02:35:03,850
I'm definitely blacklisted after this 
podcast.

3505
02:35:03,851 --> 02:35:05,460
So are you this podcast?
Yeah.

3506
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:07,750
Why I'm using.
We're both using apple products.

3507
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:09,580
I'm the phones both.
Both have.

3508
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:12,730
it doesn't matter because I've even 
brought up the notion.

3509
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:16,030
The notion is enough.
That's by the apple.

3510
02:35:16,031 --> 02:35:18,910
Engineers write me all the time.
They love listening to this show.

3511
02:35:18,911 --> 02:35:20,210
I think we have like this weird shit.

3512
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:23,290
Fuck up.
I just fucked it all up.

3513
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:26,320
or everybody.
I love the shit.

3514
02:35:26,321 --> 02:35:31,321
I love the shit,
I love the stuff they're making all the 

3515
02:35:31,321 --> 02:35:34,351
rest of it.
I'm just talking about people prancing 

3516
02:35:34,351 --> 02:35:35,410
around calling themselves journalists 
when that's not the reality.

3517
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:40,440
It's not an open access story.
It's not like some shit went down in 

3518
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,640
some foreign country and you and another
guy both have the same opportunity to go

3519
02:35:42,641 --> 02:35:45,410
there and investigated.
This is way different.

3520
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:46,690
Right.
I see what you're saying.

3521
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:51,720
I absolutely see what you're saying and 
when there such a large financial 

3522
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:56,221
benefit to having early access,
especially when you look at page views 

3523
02:35:56,221 --> 02:35:57,970
and things along those lines.
I mean when an iphone comes out you have

3524
02:35:57,971 --> 02:36:01,360
essentially 24 to 48 hours where people 
were really freaking out.

3525
02:36:01,361 --> 02:36:06,361
RIght.
And during that time that you can 

3526
02:36:06,361 --> 02:36:06,361
accumulate millions and millions of 
hits.

3527
02:36:06,361 --> 02:36:06,361
Right?
Oh,

3528
02:36:06,361 --> 02:36:07,840
it's tricky shit man.

3529
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:12,100
But if everybody did it ethically,
you see with the iphones,

3530
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:17,310
iphone maybe a bad example because it's 
such a stellar product and it's really 

3531
02:36:17,310 --> 02:36:19,930
an a uniquely couldn't controlled 
situation,

3532
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:21,580
which is what we were talking about 
earlier,

3533
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:24,310
which is their whole argument like,
look what we've done.

3534
02:36:24,311 --> 02:36:29,311
Like the reason why we have this 
controlled environment is that we put 

3535
02:36:29,311 --> 02:36:30,520
together the hardware we put together 
the operating system,

3536
02:36:30,521 --> 02:36:33,610
we make everything compatible,
uses nothing that fucks up.

3537
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:34,900
Right,
but why?

3538
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:39,960
But why are they sending out 15 units if
they know their shit is bad ass because 

3539
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:39,960
you're tired of your bullshit,
bro.

3540
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:45,210
Tardy fucking snarky comments.
They are there because they deep down 

3541
02:36:45,790 --> 02:36:50,590
they are fucking masterminds that 
controlling public relations.

3542
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:53,560
Yeah.
Mastermind climate.

3543
02:36:53,561 --> 02:36:58,561
Any different with tim cook as opposed 
to a steve jobs fanboy alert.

3544
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:00,520
I know.
Who's the ceo of apple?

3545
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:01,450
That's pretty good.

3546
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:06,730
Uh,
I don't know that I can accurately 

3547
02:37:06,730 --> 02:37:06,730
answer that.
I don't.

3548
02:37:06,730 --> 02:37:08,260
I think people always say that's under 
steve's influence.

3549
02:37:08,261 --> 02:37:10,890
They had product,
got guidelines,

3550
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:14,260
forecasts for way,
way after his death.

3551
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:19,650
So I think they're probably still 
executing on stuff that he had in the 

3552
02:37:19,650 --> 02:37:19,650
pipeline.
What a fucking maniac.

3553
02:37:19,650 --> 02:37:24,411
That guy was definitely.
I know there was an article at some 

3554
02:37:24,531 --> 02:37:28,400
billionaire investor guy dumped all his 
apple stock after you read the biography

3555
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,800
because he said steve jobs as an 
asshole.

3556
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:33,030
Oh,
probably swipe.

3557
02:37:33,170 --> 02:37:38,170
Dumped it.
I should pull that up is because it's a 

3558
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:41,380
fascinating story.
I think it's pretty hard to manage a 

3559
02:37:41,380 --> 02:37:41,380
company of that stature and not be an 
asshole.

3560
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:45,140
Also,
you gotta think about what is an average

3561
02:37:45,141 --> 02:37:48,380
person's life and average person's life 
is you have a job,

3562
02:37:48,381 --> 02:37:50,840
but you also have like a fucking family 
and a lot of other shit you do.

3563
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,760
Your job is not your whole life.
No.

3564
02:37:52,820 --> 02:37:57,200
To steve jobs.
Apple was his whole fucking life and his

3565
02:37:57,201 --> 02:37:59,060
personal life suffered because of it.
Yeah,

3566
02:37:59,061 --> 02:37:59,660
I'm sure.
Well,

3567
02:37:59,661 --> 02:38:01,880
that's probably had something to do with
his health as well.

3568
02:38:01,910 --> 02:38:05,840
Probably no investor drop dumps.
Apple stock.

3569
02:38:06,050 --> 02:38:07,550
I need to get one of these nexus phones 
now.

3570
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:12,560
Now I can't stop thinking that.
I may never have ever used the actual 

3571
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:16,181
fucking operating dude.
You can find clips of the even newer 

3572
02:38:16,181 --> 02:38:16,700
one.
They're calling it l.

3573
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:19,790
I saw the saw the dude.
it looks so beautiful.

3574
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:23,660
Just the way they're looking at design 
and working with dimensions up and down.

3575
02:38:23,661 --> 02:38:25,240
Now is the next.
Uh,

3576
02:38:25,620 --> 02:38:27,450
is that five?
This is fine.

3577
02:38:27,451 --> 02:38:28,550
Yeah,
it's the nexus five.

3578
02:38:28,551 --> 02:38:33,551
They only one that does that or this,
somebody like sony or somebody running 

3579
02:38:33,551 --> 02:38:36,791
four point four percent for it now is 
just the nexus will always get updates 

3580
02:38:36,791 --> 02:38:37,120
first because it doesn't have to come 
through the carrier.

3581
02:38:37,121 --> 02:38:39,140
This isn't unlock device.
Completely open.

3582
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:40,590
Oh,
is it?

3583
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:43,660
This guy's name was julian robertson.
He's number five.

3584
02:38:43,661 --> 02:38:47,200
Oh,
three on forbes billionaire list and cnn

3585
02:38:47,201 --> 02:38:49,660
reported monday.
This is while ago.

3586
02:38:49,661 --> 02:38:54,661
this was way back in 2013 and october,
right after the book came out that the 

3587
02:38:54,661 --> 02:38:57,730
guy,
this hedge fund investor sold all of his

3588
02:38:57,910 --> 02:39:01,910
shares in apple because he's read the 
biography of steve jobs and uh,

3589
02:39:02,170 --> 02:39:07,170
decided that apple,
the founder of apple was a really awful 

3590
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:10,711
person.
He admits this stock did very well for 

3591
02:39:10,711 --> 02:39:14,461
him,
but he would rather let someone else 

3592
02:39:14,461 --> 02:39:15,400
make the money from now on.
So the cnn investment show,

3593
02:39:15,401 --> 02:39:16,240
closing bell,

3594
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:19,730
see even that I'm off.
I'm always skeptical of that whole.

3595
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:25,660
That's crazy though.
He's saying it caused a crisis of 

3596
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:25,660
consciousness.
Yeah.

3597
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:30,940
Wow.
A guy who's worth billions saying 

3598
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:34,271
anything it says,
I came to the conclusion that it was 

3599
02:39:34,271 --> 02:39:36,710
unlikely that a man as really awful as I
think steve jobs was,

3600
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:39,980
could possibly create a great company 
for the long term.

3601
02:39:40,430 --> 02:39:43,400
I just don't believe that bad guys do 
well in the long run.

3602
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:46,190
Well,
who fucking wrote that book though?

3603
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:48,670
You know?
How does he.

3604
02:39:48,730 --> 02:39:50,690
I mean,
how well does he know steve jobs?

3605
02:39:50,691 --> 02:39:55,691
I mean,
obviously you can decide to paint us a 

3606
02:39:55,691 --> 02:40:00,100
show.
You don't know your best friend all the 

3607
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:02,741
time.
You know him when you're hanging around 

3608
02:40:02,741 --> 02:40:04,661
with true.
There's a lot of times when people are 

3609
02:40:04,661 --> 02:40:06,761
alone like to paint a portrait of steve 
jobs without a deeply intimate 

3610
02:40:06,761 --> 02:40:10,460
relationship with him.
I think you could go all sorts of ways.

3611
02:40:10,461 --> 02:40:15,461
You could go the way of these 15 
companies that their apple phones in 

3612
02:40:15,461 --> 02:40:18,150
advance and paint this really glowing,
glamorous picture,

3613
02:40:18,151 --> 02:40:21,570
or you could just paint some picture 
that you think is going to sell a lot of

3614
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:22,280
fucking books.

3615
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:25,110
Scathing,
awful depiction of.

3616
02:40:25,470 --> 02:40:28,650
It's like you ever watch a historical 
depiction,

3617
02:40:28,651 --> 02:40:32,080
like a historical documentary like,
like lincoln received the show.

3618
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:33,510
No,
the problem is,

3619
02:40:33,511 --> 02:40:35,130
you know,
those people didn't really say that.

3620
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,790
Oh,
right,

3621
02:40:35,791 --> 02:40:36,350
right.
You know,

3622
02:40:36,351 --> 02:40:41,351
you know,
they dIdn't say that in that arthur 

3623
02:40:41,351 --> 02:40:41,940
reenacted or so when you have like a 
book on steve jobs,

3624
02:40:41,941 --> 02:40:46,941
life mean you have some vague facts that
you don't maybe know the tire 

3625
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:50,250
circumstAnces,
the context of the conversations.

3626
02:40:50,610 --> 02:40:51,600
It's like you're,
you're,

3627
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:54,240
you're flavoring things.
You have facts you can't,

3628
02:40:54,241 --> 02:40:59,241
and then you're throwing those flat 
facts in and pouring your own colors on 

3629
02:40:59,241 --> 02:41:02,280
them and your own shapes to paint your 
own picture.

3630
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:03,440
I,
I,

3631
02:41:03,530 --> 02:41:05,100
I,
I sort of wonder though.

3632
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:06,270
Okay,
getting back,

3633
02:41:06,271 --> 02:41:09,600
getting back to the asshole comment,
like in the movies and stuff as well.

3634
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:12,660
He'll come in and fire somebody in front
of everyone else.

3635
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:13,380
Oh,
wait a minute.

3636
02:41:13,381 --> 02:41:15,750
This guy's an idiot because listen to 
the rest of his quote.

3637
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:20,800
an interesting twist of logic.
Robertson also said that a steve jobs 

3638
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:21,330
was still alive.
He'd still be an apple investor.

3639
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:22,920
Oh,
and then he said,

3640
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:27,070
after watching the ashton kutcher movie,
he thought steve jobs was sexy as though

3641
02:41:27,310 --> 02:41:29,510
you didn't say that.
It's not even steve jobs is.

3642
02:41:29,511 --> 02:41:31,650
Ashton kutcher says,
no question in that.

3643
02:41:31,651 --> 02:41:33,150
He's the man who killed three and a half
men.

3644
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:34,550
What does that?
Two and a half years,

3645
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:38,130
they're all fucking crazy.
I was a billionaire.

3646
02:41:38,131 --> 02:41:40,160
I wouldn't do any interviews.
I just be bawling.

3647
02:41:40,300 --> 02:41:43,770
I just be flying around in spaceships 
and throwing champagne of people.

3648
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:48,980
Why would you even do interviews?
Like I sold my apple stock fall 90 

3649
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:54,830
fucking old.
The objective there is to influence the 

3650
02:41:54,830 --> 02:41:54,830
market.
That's it.

3651
02:41:54,830 --> 02:41:54,830
That's what he's doing.
Yeah,

3652
02:41:54,830 --> 02:41:59,710
so that I can go.
When you're that big and you hold that 

3653
02:41:59,710 --> 02:42:02,730
much stock,
your behavior affects so many things.

3654
02:42:02,731 --> 02:42:04,000
He might be hedging.
Well,

3655
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:05,920
we don't know how much stock you had.
No,

3656
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:06,870
no.
He's sold his stock.

3657
02:42:06,871 --> 02:42:08,330
We know he's a billionaire.
He.

3658
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:11,940
He probably.
He could afford to influence the market.

3659
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:16,860
This is interesting.
I don't know,

3660
02:42:16,861 --> 02:42:17,910
man.
Who knows,

3661
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:19,560
but nobody.
Nobody,

3662
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:21,170
nobody knows.
But it took.

3663
02:42:21,210 --> 02:42:26,210
I find the stock market to be a bizarre 
place because you're talking about the 

3664
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:28,680
evaluatIon of a company and it's 
impacted by confidence.

3665
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:31,950
That's a fucking ski to ridiculous 
scheme.

3666
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:35,520
So one of the weirdest methods of 
controlling an economy ever.

3667
02:42:35,521 --> 02:42:38,790
It's bizarre.
The idea that it's actually what we rely

3668
02:42:38,791 --> 02:42:39,300
on.
Yep.

3669
02:42:39,570 --> 02:42:42,540
That's confidence games that like those 
things have stock,

3670
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:46,470
those fucking those movies of wall 
street where people are on the floor and

3671
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:53,150
like that's the underlying system that 
keeps foundation on your table and your 

3672
02:42:55,471 --> 02:42:58,720
mortgage paid roof over your head.
Goofy antics.

3673
02:42:58,721 --> 02:43:03,210
Shit's so crazy and that's that some 
archaic shit that may be worked out with

3674
02:43:03,211 --> 02:43:07,520
something like bitcoin that like when 
digital currency starts taking over,

3675
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:12,250
we have a sort of a different idea of a 
monetized value

3676
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:14,350
because of digital currency.
It could.

3677
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:17,740
That could be something that eventually 
gets reworked as well.

3678
02:43:17,741 --> 02:43:18,250
For sure.
I,

3679
02:43:18,251 --> 02:43:23,251
I,
I mean you have to worry about the 

3680
02:43:23,251 --> 02:43:25,270
financial companies getting a hold of it
and we'll do it.

3681
02:43:25,310 --> 02:43:30,310
Do you think that that in that sense 
that that's one of the reasons why 

3682
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:31,300
transparency is a good idea because 
people who are,

3683
02:43:31,330 --> 02:43:35,440
who do have ulterior motives and obvious
bad attentions,

3684
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:40,920
financial intentions and bad social 
consequences of transparency to like to 

3685
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:43,750
what degree will transfer?
That's a good question because I,

3686
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:47,230
because because you were mentioning 
earlier that you are transparent.

3687
02:43:47,231 --> 02:43:48,970
I'm saying I'm transparent,
but again,

3688
02:43:48,971 --> 02:43:51,250
I don't necessarily share everything 
about,

3689
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:53,010
you know,
I don't know.

3690
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:58,020
There's a level of transparency that 
makes sense and then at some point it 

3691
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:58,020
gets weird,
right?

3692
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:59,170
Like if a financial,
a finance guy had to,

3693
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:05,310
if we were able to grasp the amount of 
money these fucking guys are making by 

3694
02:44:05,310 --> 02:44:07,710
trading one inanimate thing for another 
anatomy thing,

3695
02:44:08,110 --> 02:44:10,660
I don't think society would be very 
happy about it.

3696
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:12,790
That's a good point.
You know,

3697
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:17,500
like it's essentially a gambling ring,
like so many of these hedge funds now.

3698
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:19,780
it's not even about investing in a 
company you believe in.

3699
02:44:19,781 --> 02:44:24,781
It's in making a play.
Well that's one of the reasons why the 

3700
02:44:24,781 --> 02:44:26,140
bernie madoff situation was so confusing
because I was like,

3701
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:27,490
oh my god,
like this guy,

3702
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:31,530
he was involved in,
you know,

3703
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:36,600
people that were incredibly rich and he 
was moving their money and he was doing 

3704
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:40,771
it in full view of the world.
It wasn't like he had a huge business 

3705
02:44:40,771 --> 02:44:42,530
building a whole floor man.
I mean,

3706
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:47,260
you watch them move money around and all
these billionaires and millionaires were

3707
02:44:47,261 --> 02:44:50,650
investing with him and he did it in 
front of everybody.

3708
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,000
That's right.
That,

3709
02:44:52,120 --> 02:44:55,000
that exposes the entire system.
What about the crash?

3710
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:56,410
Yeah.
What about the bailout?

3711
02:44:56,740 --> 02:44:57,840
What about the bail?
Yeah,

3712
02:44:57,990 --> 02:45:00,820
I mean that was in front of all of us,
so it's all so crazy.

3713
02:45:00,880 --> 02:45:04,060
It's also crazy and I think that like 
the news,

3714
02:45:04,061 --> 02:45:09,061
like the evening news,
like a lot of things we're dealing with 

3715
02:45:09,061 --> 02:45:13,320
dinosaurs.
We're dealing with these forgotten 

3716
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:14,440
relics or,
or not forgotten,

3717
02:45:14,441 --> 02:45:19,441
but current relics,
young of an age where they're not 

3718
02:45:19,441 --> 02:45:19,441
relevant anymore.
It's just there.

3719
02:45:19,441 --> 02:45:21,130
The ideas behind them that make them 
aren't relevant.

3720
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:26,160
Nope.
And they've also been compromised to a 

3721
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:26,890
point where they're so unstable when it 
comes to things like the stock market.

3722
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:29,230
When you look at derivatives and I tried
to,

3723
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:31,990
peter schIff,
try to explain to riveting to me and,

3724
02:45:31,991 --> 02:45:33,610
and,
and you know,

3725
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:38,660
the how people bet on things failing and
that's what I'm saying there is in that 

3726
02:45:39,071 --> 02:45:44,071
aspect of the economy and it's so 
bewildering that anybody ever let that 

3727
02:45:44,071 --> 02:45:45,790
happen and it's not about,
it's not about what makes sense.

3728
02:45:45,850 --> 02:45:48,670
It's about what you can convince people 
that that's the problem.

3729
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:50,830
It's much like a betting line on a 
fight.

3730
02:45:50,870 --> 02:45:52,300
ufc fight.
It's not,

3731
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:56,140
it's the vegas.
It's not necessarily about you.

3732
02:45:56,310 --> 02:45:58,930
I was listening to one of your fight 
broadcast.

3733
02:45:58,931 --> 02:46:03,931
There were,
you were saying you had a great record 

3734
02:46:03,931 --> 02:46:03,931
picking winners.
Yeah,

3735
02:46:03,931 --> 02:46:04,030
but you will never say it or something 
like that,

3736
02:46:04,050 --> 02:46:06,910
but I never give predictions.
You don't want to give predictions,

3737
02:46:06,911 --> 02:46:10,010
but I would imagine be being who you 
are,

3738
02:46:10,011 --> 02:46:12,230
that you can fairly accurately predict 
winners.

3739
02:46:12,231 --> 02:46:13,250
Right.
Over And over again.

3740
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:15,230
Pretty accurate,
but not 100 percent.

3741
02:46:15,231 --> 02:46:17,210
There's certain fight,
like here's a perfect example.

3742
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:19,400
Well name one that you got surprised.
oh,

3743
02:46:19,401 --> 02:46:20,780
I get surprised all the time.
Okay,

3744
02:46:20,781 --> 02:46:23,000
so this weidman,
anderson silva surprised me.

3745
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:25,550
I thought it was going to give him some 
troubles,

3746
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:30,580
but I never thought he would win by 
knockout in the first round or the 

3747
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:30,650
second round.
That fight surprised any.

3748
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:32,540
There's no.
There was no way,

3749
02:46:32,541 --> 02:46:37,541
but I guess you don't necessarily need 
to be perfect in order to make a lot of 

3750
02:46:37,541 --> 02:46:37,541
money.
Tj dillashaw,

3751
02:46:37,541 --> 02:46:39,040
hanan barao.
There's another one at hidden brown,

3752
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,890
one of the best fighters on the planet 
or a tj dillashaw dominates him for five

3753
02:46:42,891 --> 02:46:45,240
rounds and then head kicks him.
Yeah,

3754
02:46:45,241 --> 02:46:46,280
I know.
It's crazy.

3755
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:47,380
So yeah,
it's not a.

3756
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:50,090
It's not a science,
but that being said,

3757
02:46:50,091 --> 02:46:55,091
I think you could knock it out of the 
park a good enough percentage of the 

3758
02:46:55,091 --> 02:46:55,091
time to make a killing.
Oh yeah,

3759
02:46:55,091 --> 02:46:57,320
man.
If I wanted to bet money on fights every

3760
02:46:57,320 --> 02:46:57,980
week,
that's what I'm saying.

3761
02:46:58,010 --> 02:47:00,530
Oh,
What could make solar so the law,

3762
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:04,040
the lIne that they draw is based on what
they can sell.

3763
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:08,030
So it's relative to what?
To the bedding that's already occurring.

3764
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:09,380
That's why the line moves,
right?

3765
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:11,840
It's no different in the stock market.

3766
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:14,150
If you can convince people that have 
stock is valuable,

3767
02:47:14,151 --> 02:47:15,260
guess what?
It's valuable.

3768
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:17,720
Do you think is unethical?
If I bet on fights,

3769
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:21,350
I can't affect the outcome.
if I bet on fights myself,

3770
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:24,830
if I decided to do it right,
don't think so.

3771
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:26,480
Really?
I don't think so.

3772
02:47:26,510 --> 02:47:28,400
This is breaking news right now,
joe rogan.

3773
02:47:29,010 --> 02:47:29,840
I don't.
I don't.

3774
02:47:29,841 --> 02:47:33,320
I mean I'm not a player player or a 
coach.

3775
02:47:33,350 --> 02:47:36,140
Then I would think that betting on 
fights can be very problematic.

3776
02:47:36,141 --> 02:47:38,180
Contact you have contact with the 
fighters.

3777
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:42,590
That insider trading that.
I don't know.

3778
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:48,010
I would do it.
You should have your own show on 

3779
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:48,010
youtube.
Like who was that guy that got ousted?

3780
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:49,730
He used to be the bedding machine and 
football.

3781
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:51,020
Jimmy,
the greek champion.

3782
02:47:51,021 --> 02:47:51,710
The greek.
Yeah,

3783
02:47:51,711 --> 02:47:54,170
but that was because he was racist,
but he wasn't even racist.

3784
02:47:54,171 --> 02:47:56,670
He was just kInd of being accurate about
how they used to breed slaves.

3785
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:58,890
Right,
exactly.

3786
02:47:58,970 --> 02:48:03,970
So fucking exactly.
But he had a segment on national tv 

3787
02:48:03,970 --> 02:48:04,280
about bedding.
That's crazy.

3788
02:48:04,281 --> 02:48:05,640
Like people care,
you know,

3789
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:10,960
you don't.
many people would watch a show of you 

3790
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:11,330
giving your pics on an upcoming event.
It's too mean.

3791
02:48:11,410 --> 02:48:13,280
It's too rude.
How is it rude?

3792
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:14,840
It's rude.
I've been rude before.

3793
02:48:14,841 --> 02:48:16,700
Pull up kimbo slice versus seth 
prejudice.

3794
02:48:16,701 --> 02:48:17,960
Ellie.
I was.

3795
02:48:18,010 --> 02:48:20,630
We were in.
This is a perfect example of it.

3796
02:48:20,631 --> 02:48:25,631
We were backstage in atlanta.
I was working at the punchline in 

3797
02:48:25,631 --> 02:48:30,281
atlanta and while we were there it was 
when elite ecc was on tv and ken 

3798
02:48:30,471 --> 02:48:32,390
shamrock was supposed to fight kimbo 
slice,

3799
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:37,540
but ken shamrock got cut backstage like 
while he's warming up and the doctors 

3800
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:39,470
wouldn't let him fight so because it was
going to be on tv.

3801
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:44,800
Seth pictures.
Lee who was on earlier on in the card 

3802
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:44,800
already been approved by athletic 
commission,

3803
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:49,121
already made weight,
decided to fight kimbo in the main 

3804
02:48:49,121 --> 02:48:49,121
event.
He had already fought that night?

3805
02:48:49,121 --> 02:48:49,150
No.
Oh,

3806
02:48:49,170 --> 02:48:50,430
okay.
Approved to fight.

3807
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:52,190
It all happened that day.
I see.

3808
02:48:52,191 --> 02:48:57,191
I see.
So they rearranged the car that day of 

3809
02:48:57,191 --> 02:48:57,191
the fight.
They paid the other guy money.

3810
02:48:57,191 --> 02:48:57,460
Got a got kimbo to fight.
Seth.

3811
02:48:57,680 --> 02:49:02,680
Ellie got it.
And so we're backstage and I found out 

3812
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:02,680
about it literally as it was going on.
I was like,

3813
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:04,390
oh my god,
seth petrocelli's gonna.

3814
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:08,190
Fuck him up and then the fight happens 
and it literally six seconds of seth

3815
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:10,050
veggies.
Ellie knocks him out and I was like,

3816
02:49:10,051 --> 02:49:12,210
see,
I told you where it is.

3817
02:49:12,670 --> 02:49:16,990
Play it petro silly,
but is this the fight?

3818
02:49:16,991 --> 02:49:18,250
Is this me watching the fight?

3819
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:23,810
This is not me watching the fight.
Pull up the video of me predicting it 

3820
02:49:23,810 --> 02:49:27,470
because I predicted and we were watching
it backstage as it was happening on the 

3821
02:49:27,470 --> 02:49:28,590
screen.
it was very mean because I was like,

3822
02:49:28,591 --> 02:49:30,300
seth,
pressure is always going to fuck him up,

3823
02:49:30,301 --> 02:49:31,210
but I like him.
Oh,

3824
02:49:31,230 --> 02:49:36,230
he's a nice guy.
So I felt bad after I said it even 

3825
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:39,741
though I was.
Here's the weird thing about fighting 

3826
02:49:39,741 --> 02:49:40,950
that when it's over,
you're on the ground in bloody.

3827
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:41,520
Here it is.

3828
02:49:42,620 --> 02:49:44,660
Oh no,
it's a last minute replacement.

3829
02:49:44,890 --> 02:49:46,690
Got to parts of san francisco.
He's gonna.

3830
02:49:46,710 --> 02:49:49,470
Fuck him up.
If I'm wrong,

3831
02:49:49,471 --> 02:49:54,471
you never see this sitting backstage.
What's wrong with it?

3832
02:49:57,250 --> 02:50:02,250
Here we go.
Watch how fast.

3833
02:50:13,410 --> 02:50:15,020
I felt bad

3834
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:15,910
about that.
I mean,

3835
02:50:15,911 --> 02:50:18,010
I probably shouldn't do I look in that 
picture.

3836
02:50:18,011 --> 02:50:18,800
Boom.
TattooS,

3837
02:50:19,750 --> 02:50:20,720
beard,
look,

3838
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:21,540
sexy.
BeArd.

3839
02:50:21,541 --> 02:50:25,960
But I looked very intoxicating.
Well,

3840
02:50:25,961 --> 02:50:28,000
you were like,
you were motivated at the time.

3841
02:50:28,001 --> 02:50:32,680
I think he was a lIttle more composure 
will not only was I motivated,

3842
02:50:32,681 --> 02:50:33,890
it was in the moment.
Yeah,

3843
02:50:34,380 --> 02:50:37,890
I got offstage quite yet.
Yeah.

3844
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:38,950
It was like,
oh shit.

3845
02:50:38,951 --> 02:50:42,190
So I literally had just gotten off stage
and boom,

3846
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:44,320
you're in the dressing room and oh they 
haven't fought yet.

3847
02:50:44,321 --> 02:50:49,321
And black seth.
So he's gonna find out and then we made 

3848
02:50:49,321 --> 02:50:51,871
the video.
See if with a little more preparation 

3849
02:50:51,871 --> 02:50:52,720
you could phrase it in a way that isn't 
insulting.

3850
02:50:52,721 --> 02:50:57,721
I think.
Well my partner at on it opry is an act 

3851
02:50:57,721 --> 02:50:57,730
active.
Better undermined.

3852
02:50:57,750 --> 02:51:02,750
I heard him,
I heard him betting on one of the fight 

3853
02:51:02,750 --> 02:51:02,800
broadcast.
Very strong average,

3854
02:51:02,801 --> 02:51:04,330
like well into the 80 percent.

3855
02:51:04,330 --> 02:51:05,920
At one point in time we were at 90 
percent.

3856
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:09,310
We've gone full cards where we are 100 
percent correct.

3857
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:10,470
Wow.
Yeah.

3858
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:14,090
Yeah.
He fucking doing this page.

3859
02:51:14,380 --> 02:51:16,090
Let me tell you,
if you're 90 percent,

3860
02:51:16,450 --> 02:51:18,530
you need to be spending some money.
No,

3861
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:21,290
because I would get addicted.
The problem is this,

3862
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:23,050
one of the reasons why don't gamble on 
it.

3863
02:51:23,051 --> 02:51:25,810
It's not that I worried it would affect 
my commentary because I absolutely would

3864
02:51:25,811 --> 02:51:30,811
not let it sit.
I've been accused of being biased 

3865
02:51:30,811 --> 02:51:32,971
before,
but if I am biased because I enjoy 

3866
02:51:32,971 --> 02:51:33,160
certain styles,
it's certainly not biased because I want

3867
02:51:33,161 --> 02:51:38,161
one person to win.
I juSt think I like when people fIght 

3868
02:51:38,161 --> 02:51:38,800
effectively in an intelligent way.
I liked that.

3869
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:44,160
I like when people are exciting.
I liked when I have like very specific 

3870
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,210
things that I like about the sport of 
fighting and one of them is I,

3871
02:51:46,211 --> 02:51:50,680
I enjoy technique and someone who's a,
a real technician,

3872
02:51:50,681 --> 02:51:53,390
a craftsman,
somebody really immerses himself.

3873
02:51:53,390 --> 02:51:58,390
It doesn't mean they're going to win.
Like sometimes a fighter was just 

3874
02:51:58,390 --> 02:51:58,390
stronger,
faster.

3875
02:51:58,390 --> 02:51:59,620
Just club someone.
I mean there's fighters.

3876
02:52:00,130 --> 02:52:03,400
Fights have been lost where the other 
guy was clearly the better fighter,

3877
02:52:03,401 --> 02:52:06,160
but he's still lost like right.
A perfect is our nesto.

3878
02:52:06,180 --> 02:52:10,060
Hoost fought bob sapp.
It's a weird example because it was in k

3879
02:52:10,061 --> 02:52:12,330
one have a huge guy.
Exactly.

3880
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:15,760
And ernesto hoost is one of the greatest
kickboxers of all time,

3881
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:19,630
but bob sapp is beat him twice and it 
doesn't make any sense.

3882
02:52:19,631 --> 02:52:24,631
it was only because bob sapp is 375 
pounds a fucking solid steroids and just

3883
02:52:24,821 --> 02:52:29,821
running out.
I'm in donkey kong and I mean if you 

3884
02:52:29,821 --> 02:52:30,080
watch the fight,
you see ernesto,

3885
02:52:30,140 --> 02:52:32,440
who's,
who's this masterful technician,

3886
02:52:32,830 --> 02:52:37,830
but he just can't deal.
Pull up some of the viDeo of it because 

3887
02:52:37,830 --> 02:52:38,290
it's three minutes.
We got three minutes.

3888
02:52:38,490 --> 02:52:40,930
Alright.
Probably shouldn't pull the video up.

3889
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:44,980
Then three minuteS left over.
That's it.

3890
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:49,060
Look at three hours and 10 minutes say 
dear god.

3891
02:52:49,180 --> 02:52:51,340
Now I know why everyone says that at the
end.

3892
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:56,420
Flies.
What the hell he's talking abOut 

3893
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:56,420
technology.
We Did.

3894
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:56,420
We did.
Okay.

3895
02:52:56,420 --> 02:53:01,200
Talked a lot about technical.
We could definitely do this again 

3896
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:01,200
though.
WhEn are you going to be in town again?

3897
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:02,230
I don't know right now.
Come on son.

3898
02:53:02,290 --> 02:53:03,520
Come up with a schedule.
I should know.

3899
02:53:03,970 --> 02:53:06,120
I could make a reason.
Probably listen.

3900
02:53:06,650 --> 02:53:07,990
A lot of fun talking to you though,
man.

3901
02:53:07,991 --> 02:53:10,360
I'm really enjoying having me.
We'll definitely do this again for sure.

3902
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:12,730
Follow him online.

again we could just go on for days and 

3905

so we'll have to do this again.

3906
02:53:23,141 --> 02:53:23,950
