1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,031
dude.

3
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:07,210
I just had a Twitter argument
with Chelsea Clinton last night.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,790
It's like these people don't understand,

5
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,860
never respond to someone who's
like way less than a year.

6
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,061
You know,

7
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:13,510
she like,

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,751
she like,

9
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:14,920
I called her basically,

10
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:16,750
I called her parents war
criminals and she was like,

11
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:16,991
yeah,

12
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:17,824
you know,

13
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,160
I should have listened more during,

14
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,710
during the 2003 war,

15
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,670
Iraq war two,

16
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,730
they antiwar activist,

17
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:25,111
but she,

18
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:29,080
she initially called people
who were protesting the
Afghanistan war and like the

19
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,580
AUMF anti American.

20
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,170
And so she was like,

21
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:32,471
yeah,

22
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:36,340
because there was a story that came out
that said Chelsea Clinton actually with

23
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:40,910
like American flags and all these things
like when and disrupted an antiwar

24
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,360
protest flat after nine 11.

25
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,751
Yeah.

26
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,290
Like a group of like patriots
including Cold Joshi,

27
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,480
Quinn props like 22 or something.

28
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:49,691
I mean,

29
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,470
I don't know,

30
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,891
maybe,

31
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,850
maybe younger.

32
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,901
Um,

33
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,580
so then people were calling
her out and being like,

34
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:54,851
you know,

35
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,050
like mother like daughter,

36
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,580
cause there's stories of Hillary Clinton,

37
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:00,280
like really working hard
to quell the protest,

38
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:04,140
the Vietnam war protests on campus and
stuff as the president of the dump.

39
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,370
The Republican Young Republicans club.

40
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,300
She was the president.

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,310
Really?

42
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,090
Yeah.

43
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,680
It's just pre or post Kent state this.

44
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,310
Ooh,

45
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,143
good question.

46
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,321
Really good question.

47
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:14,710
I don't know.

48
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,543
It was when the whole,

49
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,390
it'd be hard to defend it after that.

50
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:21,040
Right after people are shot.

51
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:21,281
But yeah,

52
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,810
so Chelsea actually responded to me.

53
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:24,250
I was floored because I was like,

54
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,810
your dad killed 500,000 babies in Iraq
with the sanctions and your mom voted for

55
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:29,471
the Iraq war.

56
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:30,304
I was like,

57
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,420
why don't you protest them?

58
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:31,931
And she was like,

59
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:32,670
you know,

60
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,011
I was like,

61
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:33,844
what?

62
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,523
She just said,

63
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,221
she was like,

64
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:36,401
you know,

65
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,091
I wasn't really,

66
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:37,380
she was,

67
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,610
I don't think that people
protest in the Afghanistan war,

68
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,391
anti American.

69
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:40,990
And she was like,

70
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,823
you know,

71
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,690
140 characters limiting.

72
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,021
I was like,

73
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,360
do you see that I just called your
parents war criminals and you're actually

74
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,750
responding to whatever,

75
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,660
whatever WTF.

76
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,940
Just put the blinders on.

77
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,601
Oh my God.

78
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,231
And then she was like,

79
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:57,460
I was talking about the Americans who
denounce like you know that America a an

80
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:58,810
imperialist warmonger I was like,

81
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,640
it is the country's imperialist
warmongering country
that's killed millions of

82
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,031
people.

83
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,230
You serve the democratic processes of
dozens of countries and the world actually

84
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,240
thinks that America is the number
one threat to global peace.

85
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,280
So I actually agree with the Americans.

86
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,300
You denounce Chelsea,

87
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,553
it was nuts.

88
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,480
So that was a highlight of the day.

89
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,471
Yeah,

90
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,790
that's not a good look for her.

91
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,270
No,

92
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,160
she should probably stay
off Twitter for a few years.

93
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:21,411
Yeah,

94
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:21,640
she's,

95
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,241
it's like dude,

96
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:22,511
just,

97
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,380
just step back.

98
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,310
I mean you sound awful.

99
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,180
I know that you're trying to
get in the public spotlight and,

100
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,850
and get that momentum behind you.

101
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,770
I mean people are already talking
about her running in 2020 yeah.

102
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,750
Michelle Obama.

103
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,770
Chelsea Clinton.

104
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,604
Yeah.

105
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,040
You imagine what they are finding is
that there's like two parts of our

106
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,840
operating brain,

107
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:47,560
and this is going to be me paring it down,

108
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:50,200
but one is the analytical thinking,

109
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
deciding thing.

110
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,680
And the other is this
social awareness sprain,

111
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:58,681
which is always like always checking
in on how am I in relation to others.

112
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,300
It's also the part of that
brain that actually we can,

113
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:01,931
you know,

114
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,150
like the metacognitive part
and the part that I can,

115
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,620
they call it mind reading,

116
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,341
but really it's just,

117
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,110
it's just by US sitting here,

118
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,290
I can kind of get a sense of how you
feel and what you're thinking right.

119
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,590
Just by the,

120
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,380
the connection that we have and just,

121
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,460
it's part of who we are.

122
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,160
So when our analytical brain is offline,

123
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:18,760
this other one,

124
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,860
the social one pops on immediately.

125
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,211
So,

126
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:26,211
so what they're theorizing is that that
is like the fundamental need for humans

127
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:33,061
in safety and survival is how are
we relating to each other as a,

128
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,943
as a group.

129
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,320
But it makes sense if you look,

130
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,090
I mean to me it makes sense in,

131
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,953
um,

132
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,441
you know,

133
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,580
we are social animals.

134
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,331
We forget that,

135
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:40,661
I think,

136
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,680
but you look at other species of
monkeys or wolves or whatever,

137
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,360
I mean,

138
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,691
you know,

139
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,750
there might be a period of time where say,

140
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:49,991
Oh,

141
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:53,170
a wolf will will get kicked out of a pack
for awhile and he'll go do his thing,

142
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,820
but eventually come back to a pack.

143
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not safe for us
as humans and animals,

144
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,450
social animals like these to be isolated.

145
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,660
It's,

146
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,380
it's not.

147
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,840
And,

148
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,110
and so there's all these
parts of us that just,

149
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,080
if we're not connected
to other people in a,

150
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,550
in a very direct and true way,

151
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,790
there's these sort of a deep down,

152
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,800
emotional and physiological,

153
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,180
uh,

154
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,440
fears that come up,

155
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,130
right?

156
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,431
And they,

157
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,390
and they're the real,

158
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,160
and that's what the
neurobiology is showing,

159
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,520
which is really an interesting and mean.

160
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,770
We can just think about that,

161
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,340
but they're actually showing it now that
if we're not really connected to each

162
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,090
other,

163
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,110
we're going to be freaked out.

164
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,340
We're not going to be okay.

165
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,150
And,

166
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,983
um,

167
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,501
you know,

168
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:36,970
I really believe that this really drives
a lot of the internal struggle we have.

169
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,103
And we're really,

170
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,990
and this is part of,

171
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,250
you know,

172
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,811
getting into it,

173
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:40,644
but that's part of my,

174
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,670
what I'm trying to bring into
the world and my platform now is,

175
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,560
is just to,

176
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,240
you know,

177
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,991
stand up and say,

178
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:47,530
hey,

179
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,390
we need each other and we can do it.

180
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,224
It's not,

181
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
and for guys specifically,

182
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,301
right?

183
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:57,301
It's such a social stigma of ours to
not be real or open or connected or

184
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,570
vulnerable with guys.

185
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,553
And uh,

186
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,331
and it's,

187
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:01,870
uh,

188
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,990
it's cool to see the science
coming out because it's,

189
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,690
I've all this anecdotal evidence of being
out the woods in the woods with kids

190
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,850
or being in a,

191
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,010
in a management with guys are running
a retreat or whatever this is of how

192
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:17,011
powerful it is to like set down all
of our differences and just be there.

193
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,430
But now the science is really
lightened it up and yeah,

194
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:21,760
man,

195
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,241
loneliest.

196
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:22,481
I mean,

197
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,430
we can all think about
a loneliness isn't fun.

198
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,510
It's not a,

199
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,560
it doesn't feel good.

200
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,430
But the other,

201
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,430
this is crazy too that they're showing
that emotional pain lights up the same

202
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,600
centers of our brain.

203
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,920
It's physical pain.

204
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,530
And that the one study showed that,

205
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,443
um,

206
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,520
an insult to someone had much more
painful and longterm effects than slamming

207
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,630
somebody with a hammer,

208
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,770
hitting their hand with a hammer.

209
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,070
So like our emotional pain literally
actually exists in the body.

210
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,530
Like it is actual pain and the
reason that it's so uncomfortable

211
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,840
to feel our emotions,

212
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,681
which it is,

213
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,100
you know,

214
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,440
I mean I'll just say it is,

215
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,960
is that it actually hurts
like actually hurts.

216
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:09,890
I mean and there's like people say things
like you broke my heart or I'm dying

217
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,000
of heart ache or whatever,

218
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:15,080
but the science is catching up and
showing us that this pain is actual,

219
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,123
it's real.

220
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,730
Um,

221
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,310
I know you're really interested
in this and I am too.

222
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,330
And um,

223
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,230
the,

224
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,970
there are some misconceptions and that,

225
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,580
well I shouldn't say their misconceptions.

226
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,670
I would say that there's a
distortion of what's going on.

227
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,590
And this is not to say it's,

228
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,230
it's actually to say that it's
worse than you think it is.

229
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,480
So what most people who are outside of
academia think is going on is not quite

230
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,314
what's going on.

231
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,730
We think it's something worse.

232
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:40,831
Well,

233
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:41,121
I know,

234
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,240
cause I've heard you and lots and
lots of other people talk about it.

235
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,380
And it's not your fault at all because
you're not there and all you do is get

236
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,460
the media reports about it.

237
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,990
So I think what most people,

238
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,470
I get it from Gad sad and
Jordan Peterson or professors,

239
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,760
they end day.

240
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,600
If you listen to them,

241
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,350
actually they will,

242
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,981
they themselves,

243
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,180
we'll talk about it a little differently,

244
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,590
but people still consume it differently.

245
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:02,591
Cause the news right is all about the
crazy thing that the 18 year old said

246
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,720
right at Wesleyan or whatever
or the not the 18 year old,

247
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,780
it's the 45 year olds and then
sometimes the 45 year old.

248
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,230
Yeah,

249
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,441
okay.

250
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:09,951
But here's the,

251
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,730
so that stuff that really
sort of loony stuff,

252
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,031
you know,

253
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,480
that you hear coming out or um,

254
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,271
protests,

255
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:17,571
you know,

256
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,950
people saying that they are going
to die because you said a word.

257
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,240
Um,

258
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,140
that happens.

259
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,581
It does.

260
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,340
It's all true.

261
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,910
It's all there.

262
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,690
I've seen it,

263
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,690
but I've seen it maybe at most one time
a year in the colleges where I've been.

264
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,490
Maybe not even less than that.

265
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,353
Okay.

266
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,800
What is,

267
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,210
and if it were just that,

268
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,770
that's not actually a big deal.

269
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,270
It's much worse than that.

270
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,840
What's,

271
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
what's worse is that if there is a self
censorship going on that's universal and

272
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,330
profound,

273
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,403
constant,

274
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,490
omnipresent.

275
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,440
Like for instance,

276
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,340
you know,

277
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,320
I never talk about my love for boxing
around academics or I'm very careful if I

278
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,010
do,

279
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,821
but it's not even that.

280
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,760
It's that we know that there are certain
things that can't be set on a college

281
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,800
campus and so we just don't say them.

282
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,070
Therefore there's no need to police us.

283
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,250
There's no need to yell at us
and scream at us and protest.

284
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,450
And what's the motivation for the for
which are the people that are holding back

285
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,540
on thoughts that maybe they would
normally express because they don't?

286
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,691
Well,

287
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,750
here's what I think it is for the
senior faculty who have tenure,

288
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,370
meaning lifetime appointments,

289
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,653
cowardice.

290
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,483
That's all it is.

291
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,570
I think they're cowards.

292
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah.

293
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,200
If you are an adjunct like me with no
job security or if you're an assistant

294
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,520
professor up for tenure and
if you don't get tenure,

295
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,450
you have no career.

296
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't blame them.

297
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,130
I get it.

298
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,970
That's what I've done too.

299
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,610
I police myself cause you
have to to stay in the game.

300
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
If you have tenure,

301
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,490
lifetime appointment,

302
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,420
your senior professor,

303
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:49,370
you make the decisions
there on curriculum,

304
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,870
hiring and firing and tenure.

305
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,900
The faculty make those decisions and
you don't challenge these crazy ideas in

306
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:57,570
any way.

307
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,620
Or if you police yourself,

308
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,090
you stop yourself from
saying things that you,

309
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,070
you think are right that you believe in.

310
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,230
You're a coward.

311
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm sorry.

312
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,000
Those people are cowards.

313
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,760
I've seen it.

314
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
It's just overrun by cowards.

315
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,480
Yeah.

316
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,111
Oh yeah,

317
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:10,350
yeah.

318
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,501
No,

319
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,160
I mean this,

320
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,270
they are very though.

321
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,380
So here's the thing,

322
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,520
I can't prove this.

323
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,101
This is just so,

324
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm just saying this is,

325
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,340
this is my belief,

326
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,160
but I think it's pretty well informed
cause I've been around these people a long

327
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,830
time and in part I share this the,

328
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,860
I think the worst fear of all those people
is being called a racist or a sexist

329
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,263
publicly.

330
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,680
I think that is their
version of being in a cave,

331
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,770
crawling on their bellies
in the pitch black.

332
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,180
I think that's their worst fear.

333
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,850
[inaudible]

334
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,000
okay.
