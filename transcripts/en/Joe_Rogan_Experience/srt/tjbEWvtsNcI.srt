1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,380
Bonus podcast.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,243
I don't even hear myself.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,143
There we go.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,070
Does that mean bone in his podcasts?

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,030
You dirty little freaks,

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,500
uh,

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,230
to Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,920
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and entering

9
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:17,371
the code name,

10
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:17,910
Rogan,

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,760
you get 15% off the number
one sex toy for men.

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,830
It's fucking awesome product.

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,090
It's embarrassing.

14
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,020
It's ridiculous.

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,140
You'll feel bad once you
actually come inside this thing.

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,790
It's not a proud moment.

17
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,800
It's not the peak of your existence.

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,780
But if you just look at it,

19
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,990
if you separate yourself
and look at it objectively,

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,921
all it is,

21
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:41,010
is a tool that allows you to
masturbate more efficiently.

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,140
And I'm a firm believer that masturbation
is a certain type of body maintenance.

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,370
I think it's necessary.

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,470
So this allows you to do that better.

25
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,930
Just clean it and just erase,

26
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,220
erase bad memories.

27
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,503
Okay.

28
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,531
Entering the code name,

29
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,280
Rogan Kate,

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,640
you saw 15% off and go fuck that thing.

31
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,720
And flashlights don't fart.

32
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,823
They don't.

33
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,210
You've got foreign problems.

34
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,661
No,

35
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:03,910
no.

36
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,681
But most girls,

37
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,810
you know and you don't have to cuddle.

38
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,630
Yeah,

39
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,200
exactly.

40
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,033
I like coddling.

41
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,470
I don't know,

42
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,303
but

43
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,113
no,

44
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,993
I don't like that at all.

45
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,100
Still waiting for the
disposable flashlight.

46
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,100
That's going to be big whenever they
fucking have the balls to come out with

47
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:17,281
that.

48
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,420
I'm going to see people will wash it.

49
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,830
Just like you used to wash condoms.

50
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,693
It's got a camera.

51
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,820
Just make it so cheap.

52
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,590
That's for like a dollar 99.

53
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,320
You can,

54
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
you can call it a bad idea.

55
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,980
If it could be like five bucks,

56
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,970
so you can be like a chief day.

57
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,804
Just real quick.

58
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,920
I don't want to wash it.

59
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,754
I've tried it.

60
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,010
I tried the fleshlight
before you even fucking,

61
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,540
yeah,

62
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,373
you told me.

63
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,710
Yeah,

64
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,470
it's true.

65
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,390
You actually bought one
because of a bad date.

66
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:39,840
Right?

67
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,130
I was on a bad date.

68
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,300
I thought girl flu came
in to visit you guys.

69
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,120
I met this girl online and this is back
when I was a whore back in the hor days.

70
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,170
Um,

71
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,180
she looked hot on my space,

72
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,690
flew around and I'm like,

73
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,261
damn,

74
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:57,180
she looks nothing like your mind space.

75
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,470
That happens every now and then.

76
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,620
She was using some them bitches
should be working for Pixar.

77
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,523
You know what I mean?

78
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,530
Then bitches from Photoshop
masters when my space is big,

79
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,160
if you didn't have a fucking background
and being a hot bitch on my space,

80
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,630
you're not going to
get the job at fucking,

81
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,261
you know,

82
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,310
Disney or Pixar.

83
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,150
You know what I mean?

84
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,290
Those are the best.

85
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,920
That eight years of fucking mice space
was the first time we ever encountered

86
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,170
someone able to completely
lie about what they look like.

87
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,540
Damn good pitches got really good.

88
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,360
They didn't know shit a word or anything
like open up that Photoshop they,

89
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,530
you have to,

90
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,170
it's like you have to learn
how to get your nails done.

91
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,410
You're going to have to learn
how to fuck with the Photoshop,

92
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,980
your photos.

93
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,010
A lot of girls actually became famous
just through being a hot chick on my

94
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:44,430
space.

95
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,790
Totally.

96
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,750
That actually became a love my space,

97
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,630
so I fly this chicken and it was one
of those where you fly them in for the

98
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:51,631
weekend,

99
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:51,811
you know?

100
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,860
I thought she was hot enough.

101
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,450
As soon as I picked her up the airport,

102
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:54,730
I'm like,

103
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,590
Damn God damn it.

104
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,770
She was the good pictures.

105
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,700
God dammit.

106
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,120
Good from

107
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,381
far,

108
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,214
far from God.

109
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,440
And so she was our eye
so she wasn't eating.

110
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,011
This bit's,

111
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,850
I flew this pitch in.

112
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,680
If she wasn't even given me any play,

113
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,380
she wasn't no physical play.

114
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,690
Well you were probably like,

115
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,160
yeah,

116
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,993
come on in.

117
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,190
What's up man?

118
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,520
You don't want to fuck you or what?

119
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,080
You know what she was used to?

120
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,620
She was used to that.

121
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm sure I wasn't the first guy.

122
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
She's just a guy's gone.

123
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,910
Aw,

124
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,020
I got my space.

125
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,210
Well there's a lot of also,

126
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,030
there's a lot of girls who feel
like once they give up the pussy,

127
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,050
once they have sex with you,

128
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,310
they've lost all their power.

129
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,310
Their whole power is ain't
no holding back something

130
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,570
after getting dog like
six times they took,

131
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:40,404
I damn,

132
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,430
this sucks dude.

133
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,540
What is all into her,

134
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,080
dude,

135
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,070
I'll buy you this.

136
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:44,761
I'm going to do this.

137
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm putting up with all of your shit.

138
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm gonna get that.

139
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,370
And then once you bust that
nut and it's Friday night,

140
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:50,731
you're like,

141
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,564
damn,

142
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,130
this bitch is going to stay here
Til Sun Day and I'm done Friday.

143
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,133
And you know what I mean?

144
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,421
Yeah.

145
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,880
This bitch wasn't giving
me any play at all.

146
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,600
This again,

147
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,020
this is back when I was a whore and
I flew around just giving me no play.

148
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,370
So I decided to take her to the
hustlers store and have her,

149
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,260
you know,

150
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,480
you know,

151
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,330
we ended up buying a
fucking flashlight and a

152
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,130
good,

153
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,510
Laurie,

154
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,343
this is awesome.

155
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,433
I like how

156
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,503
fucking distance.

157
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,973
I didn't know.

158
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,790
I didn't know where to
go without Jesus Christ.

159
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,800
So why did you step in and I
don't know what happened there.

160
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,180
I thought it was going to end it nice.

161
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,170
It was a Tacos rainmaker.

162
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,850
We come again.

163
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,683
That was a door was,

164
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,960
but it was a bunch of light jabs and
there was a big right hand come up behind

165
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,480
it all to Joe Rogan.

166
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,930
Dot.

167
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,740
Net experience without the fuck we're
on is also brought to you by [inaudible]

168
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,500
some raw.

169
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm not hearing well on this thing.

170
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,731
For some reason.

171
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,700
I tried to turn it up,

172
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,870
but it's not working.

173
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,763
How do I turn it up?

174
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,120
His father cable.

175
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,511
Yeah,

176
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:51,860
I did mountain stop doing shit.

177
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,380
It's on full blast.

178
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,880
You don't have your mute on maybe.

179
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,430
Oh,

180
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,030
don't have the meat on
them unless it's this side.

181
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,980
The Alpha brain pills.

182
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:05,180
You can find out [inaudible] dot
namba.com but I think I made the vote.

183
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,260
The input louder.

184
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:06,510
No,

185
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,250
can't do that.

186
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,083
You have that?

187
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,750
This is only,

188
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:08,931
no,

189
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,610
you can do the whole
entire headphone unit.

190
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,361
Just headphones,

191
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,111
but not input.

192
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,040
I can't change my input.

193
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,400
Right.

194
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,890
You can change the input up
everybody else's headphones by no,

195
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:16,041
no,

196
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,251
no.

197
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,660
I mean a input of the headphones.

198
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,880
I mean you can microphone.

199
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,280
No.

200
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,611
Okay,

201
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,271
so it's louder.

202
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:20,630
It's good.

203
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:20,930
Yeah,

204
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,250
I did.

205
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,740
Yeah,

206
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,130
I did it.

207
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,530
All right.

208
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,050
But if you go to [inaudible]
dot net you know,

209
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,290
go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and
and and it makers of Alpha brain,

210
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:27,921
what's Alpha brand?

211
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:28,754
It's a cognitive news,

212
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,600
nutrition,

213
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,433
whatever the fuck it is.

214
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,280
It's some brain pills that recently
got reviewed in the Atlantic favorably.

215
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,220
They enjoyed them and they said that it,

216
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:36,470
it,

217
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,190
uh,

218
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,490
oh,

219
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,061
how dare you,

220
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,380
Eddie Bravo shut that shit off.

221
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,251
He said that,

222
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:40,580
uh,

223
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,881
they,

224
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,520
they work great for when you
haven't gotten enough sleep.

225
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,360
And uh,

226
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
that's what I found him for as well.

227
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,400
Um,

228
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,611
I,

229
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,020
I love taking them on jet lag to it.

230
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,530
What they are as a cognitive
enhancing supplement,

231
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,230
a supplement that allows your brain
to produce more neurotransmitters.

232
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,730
I don't understand the science behind it,

233
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,040
but I've read a lot it
and I tried to memorize

234
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
it but it's really just goes
in one ear and out the other.

235
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,340
But the bottom line is we're,

236
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:06,341
we're funding a university double blind
placebo tests on it from a prestigious

237
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,000
university in Australia.

238
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,541
Uh,

239
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,230
and uh,

240
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,600
there were trying to do it as
scientifically as possible.

241
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,770
There's something to all this stuff.

242
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,410
There's something to nootropics
you don't have to believe,

243
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,050
but if you're interested in
Google the word nootropic,

244
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,730
then once you've done that,

245
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,300
explore all the options before you
even think about buying an Alpha brain.

246
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,430
Try all kinds of shit buying in bulk.

247
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,750
And if you want to take our
ingredient list just taken off and,

248
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:29,200
and it's,

249
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,470
it's too expensive view.

250
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,090
This is the best way to do it.

251
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,650
Steal the ingredient lists,

252
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,131
copy it.

253
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:34,910
That's not stealing it.

254
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,743
Just copy it.

255
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,790
You have full right to it's online.

256
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,960
Copy it and make it,

257
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,070
mix it all up yourself.

258
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,903
You'll save some money.

259
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
I hope you do and I hope it works.

260
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,180
If you don't want to do that,

261
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,014
we sell it.

262
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,360
If you buy it and you don't like it,

263
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,600
you get for the first order for 30 pills,

264
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,510
you get your money back 100% you don't
even have to send the pills back.

265
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,750
We're trying to make it
like as easy as possible.

266
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,540
The last thing I want is
anybody to feel ripped off,

267
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,840
but I use this shit and I enjoy it
and I think it's fucking awesome.

268
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,340
I love nootropics.

269
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,720
I've been taking nootropics before.

270
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,890
I got involved with Alpha brain.

271
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,030
I've taken a bunch of them.

272
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,691
They work.

273
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,080
There's vitamins that can enhance
the way your mind operates.

274
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,351
You know,

275
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,131
it's not great.

276
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,931
It's not significant.

277
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,710
It's not going to turn
a morning into a genius,

278
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,400
but it,

279
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,941
for me,

280
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,080
it helps me run smoother.

281
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,740
Uh,

282
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,480
but I believe in a lot of
nutritional supplements.

283
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,620
I believe in fish oil.

284
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,000
I take a lot of probiotics.

285
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,590
I believe in a lot of
things that I don't sell.

286
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,250
I think it's very important to take
a lot of nutritious supplements.

287
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,084
And what happened Brian,

288
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,030
for scream at bright scary is this
the internet see something better.

289
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,410
Why he's scaring me with this big
bright Ufo type fucking shit by my head.

290
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,040
Uh,

291
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,700
anyway,

292
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,320
we also make shroom tech immune,

293
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,550
which is an immunity supplement.

294
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,650
All this is explained on,

295
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:45,484
on at.com.

296
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,513
And like I said,

297
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,383
first order,

298
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,950
a hundred percent money back guarantee.

299
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,270
We used to have it for everything,

300
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,960
but then some people went online and
they sold it on Ebay and they got their

301
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:54,620
money back.

302
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,453
They hacked us,

303
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,503
so they win.

304
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,613
So now we changed it.

305
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,071
So that's it.

306
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,100
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and
and it entering the code name Rogan.

307
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,610
Oh,

308
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,241
and by the way,

309
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,290
it's only for your first order.

310
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,610
After that you got to pay full price.

311
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,491
The codename Rogan.

312
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,800
Apparently it's only good for one time.

313
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,510
I should probably try
to have that for change,

314
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:09,210
right?

315
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,620
Yeah.

316
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,160
Yeah,

317
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,580
I should.

318
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:10,850
Right.

319
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,210
Okay,

320
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,840
I'll do that.

321
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,650
That's it.

322
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:12,861
Good.

323
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,120
I chose over.

324
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,133
Listen.

325
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,700
[inaudible] dirty bitches.

326
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,680
The Internet has made something happen.

327
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,670
We've pulled together
in less than 24 hours.

328
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,250
No other interaction with this young man.

329
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,310
But the Internet's a man

330
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,863
and that

331
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,151
stupid cat.

332
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,984
You're not a DJ.

333
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,030
[inaudible]

334
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,380
that's the professor.

335
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
That's the actual video.

336
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,090
That's the way the video looks.

337
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,050
Is there a way you can shut those music
off where it doesn't do this for 10

338
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:49,650
minutes?

339
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,483
What is this?

340
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,060
This is my fate out.

341
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,130
This is terrible,

342
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:53,950
right?

343
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,860
We got to stop speaking dizzy for real.

344
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,910
It's really obnoxious.

345
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,870
There you go.

346
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,370
So was that the actual video,

347
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,200
the music video?

348
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,680
No,

349
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:00,891
no,

350
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,020
that was just some random
bullshittery at the house.

351
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,061
Oh,

352
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,150
so that wasn't the video cause I thought
it was the video and I thought that was

353
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:08,290
fucking genius.

354
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,243
Oh Wow.

355
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,330
I thought this motherfucker had the balls.

356
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,040
He had such confidence in the God goddamn
music that the music video is going to

357
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:23,041
be a fucking cat hits this electronically
and the song's coming out and the

358
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,620
cat's tripping out on this fucking
song was what was actually,

359
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:26,921
that was,

360
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:27,910
I thought it was brilliant.

361
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,440
I don't think anything
with maybe random radio.

362
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,340
I can't really remember.

363
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,483
Wow.

364
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,040
I thought that was the video
and I thought you were a genius.

365
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,821
Well,

366
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:38,340
yes,

367
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,173
it is

368
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,770
bored,

369
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,101
man.

370
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,690
I just want to say that I think this is,

371
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,533
uh,

372
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,800
one of the first times the Internet
has ever pulled people together this

373
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:46,550
quickly.

374
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,050
Like within 24 hours.

375
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:49,860
That's the fucking towards tweet for,

376
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,050
yeah.

377
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,150
That's how the hoard was from Omaha.

378
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah.

379
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,100
It's pretty bad ass,

380
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:55,371
man.

381
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:55,551
I mean,

382
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:56,091
how it happened.

383
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:56,580
I mean,

384
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,960
I got,

385
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,010
I got a,

386
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,540
I don't know how many fucking retweets,

387
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,540
but I get on my computer and
I just see our dead mouse,

388
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
dead miles dead mouse.

389
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,531
Like,

390
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:03,831
oh,

391
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,850
what the fuck's going on here?

392
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,200
And then I click on one of them.

393
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:06,530
I'm like,

394
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,801
oh,

395
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,850
he wants to do a podcast.

396
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,361
Oh fuck.

397
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:08,810
Yeah.

398
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,410
So I,

399
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,681
you know,

400
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,530
do you back and then all of a
sudden Brian's on it and Brian,

401
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:12,741
you know,

402
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:13,574
sorts of the whole thing.

403
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,620
About three months ago I started
watching because he's been on,

404
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:18,950
he goes,

405
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,840
you go on Ustream all the time and
just like pretty much like work you,

406
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,620
you just talk to people and stuff.

407
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,330
And I was wanting it in
the chat room once going,

408
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,770
please come on the Joe Rogan podcast,

409
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,220
please come.

410
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,860
And the next thing I know I started
asking Twitter followers to help me.

411
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,250
So we'd just like attack your chat rooms.

412
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,120
Like please come on you
that what got you in?

413
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,690
Did you get pestered by by hand?

414
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Like a hostile takeover?

415
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,893
No,

416
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,760
I mean what got you
intrigued to come here?

417
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:41,031
You don't,

418
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,200
you've never listened to the podcast.

419
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:42,561
Yeah,

420
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,030
you're right.

421
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,540
I've actually never listened to it.

422
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,950
Of course I know your work and I've seen
you here and there and this and that

423
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:49,784
and shit.

424
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,091
You know,

425
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:50,811
I'm like thinking,

426
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,620
fuck man.

427
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,061
You know what?

428
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:52,370
Cause I've,

429
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,100
I've actually that everyone's

430
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,251
like,

431
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:54,581
oh dude,

432
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,660
get on the Joe Rogan thing.

433
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,950
Get on the Joe Rogan
thing and I'm thinking,

434
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,813
fuck,

435
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,180
does this guy get it to like tear
me a new asshole or I don't know.

436
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,014
You know what I mean?

437
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,750
Dude,

438
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,570
why do other people do other things?

439
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,271
People,

440
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:07,571
man,

441
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:07,801
I've,

442
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,430
I've heard people on people's shows,

443
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:09,731
you know,

444
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:09,971
we're,

445
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:10,151
we're,

446
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,410
someone will get hostile and it's,

447
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,420
it's real uncomfortable
and it's fucking shitty.

448
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:14,254
And it's like,

449
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,150
I've had that happen to me before.

450
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,630
I was invited out to this radio show
in Australia and they were like,

451
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,811
oh,

452
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,770
he's kind of a joker.

453
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:21,041
I'm like,

454
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,221
dude,

455
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:21,500
whatever.

456
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,140
I can fucking counter troll the troll,

457
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,711
whatever.

458
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,310
No big deal.

459
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,360
He thought I'd just been fun.

460
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,590
I thought it'd be fun and funny.

461
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,061
You know what I mean?

462
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:28,630
It's like a big piss take on everything.

463
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,051
But Dude,

464
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,250
the guy was like basically,

465
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,030
hey,

466
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,863
fuck you.

467
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,031
You know what I mean?

468
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:34,451
It's just like,

469
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:34,661
you know,

470
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:34,941
like,

471
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:35,681
and all this shit.

472
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:35,950
Like,

473
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,101
Oh,

474
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:36,660
you want,

475
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,430
your music sucks,

476
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,263
so,

477
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,191
Hey,

478
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,600
what the fuck is this rumor about you?

479
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:40,901
And I'm like,

480
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:41,300
dude,

481
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,570
are we getting into a punchline
with any of this shit?

482
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:43,701
And I,

483
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:44,980
and I ended up actually just,

484
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,820
well not getting like,

485
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,241
Ooh,

486
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,170
I didn't rage quit.

487
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,660
I just went through it.

488
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,950
I am I doing it.

489
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,350
Thanks.

490
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,640
Thanks for the interview later.

491
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,691
That's okay.

492
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:53,920
Do Ratings.

493
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,341
Hey,

494
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,174
I just

495
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,470
want that one little fucking snippet
off you that they think is going to ruin

496
00:12:59,471 --> 00:12:59,921
your career,

497
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,980
but it's actually going to just
throw it overboard or dinosaurs,

498
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,800
those morons that are
like making conflict up,

499
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,440
they're dinosaurs and not
enough of those assholes.

500
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:08,890
But I mean,

501
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,240
I won't lie to you.

502
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:10,691
You know what I mean?

503
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,240
A little bit of that little
shit was in the back of my head,

504
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:13,661
so I'm like,

505
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:13,931
no,

506
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:14,381
but you know what,

507
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,220
I'll tell you what it was.

508
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,941
It was,

509
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,660
um,

510
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,060
I had a chat with Carson Daly
the other day and I said,

511
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:19,420
hey,

512
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,253
Joe Rogan,

513
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,153
come on.

514
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,581
He's like,

515
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:21,911
dude,

516
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:22,241
do it.

517
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:22,511
Do it.

518
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,181
You have so much fun.

519
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:23,471
And I'm like,

520
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:23,621
yeah,

521
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,011
you don't want,

522
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,844
fuck it.

523
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,260
Mccarson talked you into it.

524
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,620
Yeah.

525
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,050
Beautiful.

526
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll give him a hug and next
time I see him come in here,

527
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:30,051
right?

528
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:30,141
Yeah,

529
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:30,581
he's going to do it.

530
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,980
Eventually we had to reschedule it.

531
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:32,801
So I think to me,

532
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,590
I think I forgot when we rescheduled too,

533
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,500
but um,

534
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,741
yeah,

535
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,560
he's gonna come in and do the podcast
and bring a show in here as well.

536
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,610
We're going to do his
whole show from here.

537
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,200
He's a good dude.

538
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,411
Yeah,

539
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:41,850
he's really good.

540
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,101
Yeah.

541
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,000
I mean if I didn't know me,

542
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,470
I might think I'd be a Douche bag too.

543
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,310
That's all right.

544
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,810
I look exactly like a Douche bag.

545
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:47,644
Should look.

546
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,620
This is uncomfortable with me and
this is going to get fucking off.

547
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:54,454
Can I go?

548
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,273
Uh,

549
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,931
to a degree.

550
00:13:58,931 --> 00:13:59,220
I mean,

551
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,290
I'm actually friends with Dana and uh,

552
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,490
Jamie and Jamie.

553
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,790
Jamie.

554
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,040
Fuck.

555
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,441
I could ever,

556
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:05,561
ever,

557
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,394
no worries.

558
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,780
You know him.

559
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:07,991
I know.

560
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:08,340
You know,

561
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,600
hang on,

562
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,131
I got to,

563
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,990
what is that a video game
character on the neck.

564
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:11,920
It's not a space invader.

565
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,540
That is a space invader.

566
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,374
Congratulate.

567
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,641
Everyone always asks me,

568
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:15,851
hey,

569
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:18,760
that's from that show or you know,

570
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:23,761
but also it's actually more the
tattoos from the street artist invader.

571
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:24,821
What he did,

572
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:28,270
he went around England and did all
these little tiles sets all over these

573
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,721
buildings.

574
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:32,320
So now I'll let you replace the tile
with his own tiles that had a pattern in

575
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,640
enter through the gift shop.

576
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,700
I remember in that movie,

577
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,100
I never watched that movie.

578
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,311
Oh,

579
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,240
it's one of the best movies,

580
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,270
but it tells me that,

581
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,540
but it tells me it's one of those movies.

582
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,640
Like I was saying last
night about Restrepo.

583
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,960
Everybody tells me I have to see it.

584
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:47,441
I have it.

585
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,850
I have it sitting there on the shelf.

586
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,420
I just,

587
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,021
when I'm at home,

588
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:50,770
I'm like,

589
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,170
let's see,

590
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,310
south park did this week.

591
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,990
You know,

592
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm looking at the DVR.

593
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,520
I always go to silly.

594
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,890
I go to Anthony Bordain or fights.

595
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,450
That's all I really ever want to watch.

596
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,501
Movies are really,

597
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,910
it's really hard to get
me to watch a movie.

598
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,960
Right.

599
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,590
You know?

600
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,861
But,

601
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,260
um,

602
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,093
uh,

603
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,480
anyway,

604
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,530
I just thought it was a cool thing.

605
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,850
It was a cool thing how it all happened.

606
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,730
I was excited and I'm,

607
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:09,564
I'm glad.

608
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,371
Glad.

609
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:10,850
Uh,

610
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,351
we could,

611
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:11,570
uh,

612
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,130
soothe your fears with me being a cunt.

613
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,880
How many tattoos do you actually have?

614
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:15,970
It.

615
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,080
You have a last time you were in la?

616
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,960
I think you got a tattoo and I,

617
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,640
I,

618
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,473
you're young.

619
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,241
You're a young Jewish man.

620
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,074
It's amazing.

621
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,040
31 I just turned 31 31.

622
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,710
I was going to guess less than 30,

623
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:29,991
20.

624
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:30,371
I was going to,

625
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:31,550
there's 28 that'll do,

626
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:31,911
yeah.

627
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,151
You're,

628
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,920
you're all flooded up
with tattoos on a young

629
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,700
kind of poised to be the
next to the straight up man.

630
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,091
I guess.

631
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:38,391
I don't know.

632
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:38,811
What is the,

633
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,880
a hearts on the left elbow.

634
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,091
Oh,

635
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,110
that's the legend is all there.

636
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,311
So let me ask you this,

637
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:43,611
man.

638
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:43,940
You're,

639
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,900
you're a fucking huge
electronic creative music guy.

640
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:48,241
You're,

641
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:48,401
yeah.

642
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:48,741
You know,

643
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:51,080
I had no idea how big you
are to be honest with you.

644
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,130
I had heard of you before.

645
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,050
I thought the logo was cool as fuck.

646
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,160
Like I'd seen some imagery and
some electronic imagery of the,

647
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:58,401
you know,

648
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:58,641
your,

649
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,840
your mouse logo and shit.

650
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,081
I'm like,

651
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:00,321
wow,

652
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:00,770
that's like,

653
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,210
this is something compelling about it.

654
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,141
It's like an evil,

655
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:03,591
twisted,

656
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,180
psychedelic Mickey Mouse type thing.

657
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't know,

658
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:05,990
whatever,

659
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,890
whatever it was.

660
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:07,540
But,

661
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:07,970
um,

662
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,470
then I started looking into it
and I read something that you,

663
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,580
you guys were at the fucking Roger Center.

664
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,900
You guys did the Roger Center.

665
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,111
Yeah.

666
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,040
That was fucked up.

667
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,520
And I'm like,

668
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,271
oh my God.

669
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,150
Cause we did the UFC there and
it was the biggest UFC ever.

670
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,560
It was 60,000 people.

671
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,440
I'm like you're rocking out
to 60,000 fucking people.

672
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,490
Well we did 20 cause we just had the floor
and some of the seats but like to see

673
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:31,130
that place filled with 60
must be fucking insane.

674
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:34,670
I've never seen it with 60 you know that
place is so big that you know the whole

675
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:35,331
deal how it works.

676
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:39,560
But for people who don't know at home
there's a hotel inside the arena and the

677
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,410
windows face where they play baseball.

678
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,110
Like it's so fucking big
and this is all indoors.

679
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,381
You know,

680
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:50,381
cause Canada gets cold as fuck in the
winter and so it's so big that you can

681
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:54,440
play baseball at guys like Jose Conseco
can hit home runs inside this fucking

682
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:55,180
place and,

683
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,150
and not and still have room to
spare and still not hit the hotel.

684
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,170
I mean it's insanity.

685
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:00,770
It's like a,

686
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,450
it's one of the most amazing
constructions I've ever been inside of.

687
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,130
It's also the most insanely
fucking impossible to rig
to because of the way that

688
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:09,891
that dome is,

689
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:11,180
the retracting dome part,

690
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,560
those rigging points.

691
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,480
So if they wanted to get,

692
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:13,691
I didn't,

693
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,290
I didn't see the UFC show there,

694
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,260
but like if they wanted like
lights on top of the ring,

695
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,580
well they can't just float.

696
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,510
They have to be rigged all the
way the fuck up to the top of it.

697
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:27,440
And we're at the top and my dad to do
it with ours cause we had a big spider

698
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,950
trust going across the whole thing that
was only maybe about 30 feet up from the

699
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,190
floor but less 200 feet from the ceiling.

700
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,300
So it's just like this fucked up frigging,

701
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,450
that's a big thing with traveling artists,

702
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:38,721
right?

703
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,280
Like the sets that you guys bring.

704
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,540
That's like a big thing,

705
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:41,931
right?

706
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:42,530
Yeah.

707
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,660
You too apparently has some monstrous,

708
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,950
gigantic oh set.

709
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:49,680
That takes like a whole different
picture as part of their DLA.

710
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,600
So they

711
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,290
permanently build those structures,

712
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,890
uh,

713
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,150
like they literally lay cement and
then build the fucking building.

714
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,740
So when they get to each arena,

715
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,221
they do this.

716
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,054
Yes they have,

717
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,200
but they've only done it like

718
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,520
they have different versions of it
that they can scale down or scale up.

719
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,260
So when they do do it at the Roger Center,

720
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:09,690
it's like a kind of a
cheaper version of it,

721
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:11,160
but looks the same kind of thing.

722
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,180
But they had some in,

723
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:12,450
uh,

724
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:12,720
you know,

725
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,990
in Europe that they actually had to
permanently build a structure for it.

726
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,110
And the structure's still fucking
there and they're trying to

727
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,430
salame whoa.

728
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,701
Yeah.

729
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,200
It's all part of the thing,

730
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,920
but it's fun.

731
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,610
Crazy.

732
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,810
I don't think I'll ever go that way.

733
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,210
Yeah.

734
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,330
How did you get to be this guy?

735
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,631
What,

736
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:26,960
what,

737
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,261
what,

738
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:30,380
what separated you from the pack
when so many people making music

739
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,670
electronically,

740
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,091
you know,

741
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:32,511
it's so,

742
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,290
it's so a,

743
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,670
it's such a popular genre.

744
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,000
Now.

745
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,920
Did you start off as a DJ like,

746
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,461
no,

747
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:37,671
no,

748
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:39,620
I've never spun a fucking
record in my life.

749
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,551
So a matter of fact,

750
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:42,290
you actually don't like
being called a DJ mixer?

751
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,590
No,

752
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:42,780
I,

753
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,910
I don't like that phrase.

754
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,230
What do you,

755
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,811
how can I say?

756
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:45,321
I don't like it.

757
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,140
It's so generalized that you kind
of have to walk in and it's like,

758
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,501
you know,

759
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,430
I'm not a comedian.

760
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,750
I'm a fucking laugh technician.

761
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,620
Right,

762
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:51,900
right,

763
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,141
right,

764
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:52,411
right,

765
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,090
right.

766
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,660
What would you call it,

767
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,180
yourself?

768
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,100
I don't know.

769
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,730
Musician,

770
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,310
musician,

771
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,710
artist,

772
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,543
producer,

773
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,670
whatever it is,

774
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,530
besides being a Jujitsu master is,

775
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,220
um,

776
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,581
he is,

777
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:02,580
he's a Jujitsu master.

778
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,110
That's what he does.

779
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,550
No Shit.

780
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:03,680
Yeah.

781
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,080
Yeah.

782
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,060
It's how is Larry's,

783
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,790
but now he's like one of the top
Jujitsu instructors in the world.

784
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,001
All right.

785
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,940
I'll keep my famous martial artist.

786
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,330
Yeah.

787
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:11,541
Yeah.

788
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:11,931
For Real.

789
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:12,081
I mean,

790
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:13,700
he doesn't look like he's
a famous martial artists,

791
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,390
but uh,

792
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,961
besides that,

793
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,820
he makes a lot of music.

794
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:17,061
He's,

795
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,920
it makes a lot of electronic
music and shit like that.

796
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:19,754
So I know like,

797
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,630
Hey,

798
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,810
you're,

799
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,381
you're fucking,

800
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:22,580
you're that karate guy.

801
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,460
I'm a musician first.

802
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,540
And I started Jujitsu when I was 24.

803
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,260
I was been producing music and Sally's
10 I got into Jujitsu just to stay in

804
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,510
shape and the Jujitsu blew up.

805
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,020
But I'm like,

806
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,130
I'm a fucking musician.

807
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,581
I'm a music.

808
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:34,971
Right,

809
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:35,181
right,

810
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:35,451
right.

811
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:36,284
That's what I do.

812
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,800
And the Jujitsu is a total hobby
on the side and that blew up.

813
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,000
So you know,

814
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,700
so now over the last five years,

815
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm trying to prove to all the people
that know me through Jujitsu fail.

816
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,030
They think,

817
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,181
oh,

818
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:48,200
he's trying to do music.

819
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,590
They never took my music seriously.

820
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,710
I know people like that around the block.

821
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,200
Well,

822
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,931
there's always going to be,

823
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:53,480
hey listen,

824
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,820
every well it took,

825
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,780
I understand it because no one ever in
athletics has ever made it in music.

826
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,770
So they're looking at me as like some
famous athlete who's trying to make it in

827
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:04,161
music.

828
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,401
I'm like,

829
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:04,611
dude,

830
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:09,320
I've been pushing the whole time that
you Jitsu was brand new and it was part

831
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:09,950
time.

832
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,150
So it's like a weird thing.

833
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,680
Yeah.

834
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,280
What about the Superbowl shuffle?

835
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,050
Are you ignoring the Superbowl shuffle?

836
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,980
What does he say?

837
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,960
No famous athletes I've
ever made it in music.

838
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,451
What's the story?

839
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,284
The whole shelf.

840
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,030
Go bears the Superbowl show refrigerator.

841
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:28,420
Perry Shaq did an album.

842
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,590
I thought his album with Brian,

843
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,220
I think get an RMB record.

844
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,091
Doe He get the fuck.

845
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:34,924
Shut the fuck up.

846
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,790
Coby rides and not to R and B record.

847
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,691
Oh my God.

848
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:38,980
I would love to listen to that.

849
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:40,750
Just for the fucking pure comedy of it.

850
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,590
You can find Coby.

851
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,121
Brian,

852
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,020
please Google that.

853
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,320
I need to know that this is real.

854
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,540
No one need to have the Koby Bryan

855
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,540
professional music won't give you both.

856
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,190
Okay,

857
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,881
so how did you,

858
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,271
uh,

859
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,170
that's the problem.

860
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,981
The problem is like,

861
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,710
I've been a musician my whole
life and I'm not an athlete.

862
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm not an athlete.

863
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,860
Well,

864
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
the world says fuck you.

865
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,590
We don't care where.

866
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,240
Only one.

867
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,560
How did you become,

868
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,000
how did you get through?

869
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,651
What did you,

870
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:08,081
what did you,

871
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:08,914
what did you do?

872
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,910
I guess the way it kind of
looks over the last five years,

873
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:13,151
right?

874
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:17,170
As you get fucking a lot of people
thinking this is like some culminated

875
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,960
overnight bullshit story that's
happened over the last three.

876
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,130
But you know,

877
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,331
in my mind,

878
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,280
and I know because I've grown up with it,

879
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:24,700
it's,

880
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,410
uh,

881
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,630
you know,

882
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:25,871
it's a,

883
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,940
it's a culmination of a fucking,

884
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,410
you know,

885
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,580
just 10 years of just
wanting to do something,

886
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,300
have some predefined bullshit
goals and then work towards it.

887
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:34,571
You know,

888
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,111
because I mean,

889
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:39,220
I really got interested in
computer music when I was about 16,

890
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,660
17 and it was at such a time in,

891
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,120
in the world where computer
music wasn't really feasible.

892
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:46,954
It was like,

893
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,290
you know,

894
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,460
Russell Peters comedian?

895
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:48,870
Yeah,

896
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,091
yeah,

897
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:49,211
yeah.

898
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:49,751
He's Canadian.

899
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,584
He loves you.

900
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,850
We all know he's on his way down.

901
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,031
Oh,

902
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:52,491
is he really?

903
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,324
He's coming.

904
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:55,800
Well,

905
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,633
he wants to hang out with you.

906
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:56,861
Oh,

907
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:57,490
okay.

908
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,050
Fuck yeah.

909
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,050
We want to be a part of the story of how
I actually met dead mouse at a shell.

910
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,261
What do you prefer?

911
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,610
Do you prefer your actual name?

912
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,120
Well,

913
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,830
if we start fucking saying dead,

914
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,300
there's going to be another death rumor.

915
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,590
I've had three in the last four months.

916
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:15,424
Yes,

917
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,081
definitely.

918
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,070
That's what you have a
Whitney Houston today.

919
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,350
Yeah.

920
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,510
I,

921
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,001
you know what?

922
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,170
I just heard about it
about like three hours ago.

923
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,733
Who knows?

924
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,951
You know,

925
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:24,460
who knows?

926
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,300
I have no idea.

927
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,650
But she's 48 years old.

928
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:27,430
You got to wonder,

929
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,270
you know what happened.

930
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Oh it's fairly young to just be dying.

931
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,670
It's very sad if it is,

932
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,260
if it is a cocaine thing,

933
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:36,250
if all the rumors are true,

934
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,180
obviously I don't,

935
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,230
I'm never hanging out with her.

936
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,210
I don't know if she's really
doing coke or wasn't doing coke.

937
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,370
Joey Diaz told us those great stories.

938
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:43,150
Remember that?

939
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,630
Yeah.

940
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,321
Oh my God,

941
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,590
I tweeted that today and people got
mad at me cause I tweeted that story.

942
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,420
Well I'm hoping,

943
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,930
well who's amazing artists,

944
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:51,860
but you know,

945
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,110
so were you into Depeche mode?

946
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,780
Tears for fears?

947
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,440
That was like the closest thing to
electronic music has always been.

948
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,890
That's,

949
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,671
that's my soul.

950
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,180
Is that,

951
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,410
what were you saying
about Whitney Houston?

952
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:04,370
You were kind of hoping what?

953
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,731
Well,

954
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:09,380
I mean I'm just kinda like morbidly
hoping it's not too drug related or drug

955
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:10,960
related for that matter
to know what I'm saying.

956
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,670
It's like a Shitty fucking Shitty,

957
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,890
just be an extra Shane if it was all,

958
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,720
well the only thing that would help,

959
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,570
if anything is that some may be,

960
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:24,200
it might influence some people
to avoid those particular drugs.

961
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,981
You know,

962
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:25,610
it's,

963
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,300
there's no,

964
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,240
there's no happy ending coke
stories has nobody is like,

965
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:29,421
you know,

966
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,970
it wasn't until I started doing coke
that I really got my shit together,

967
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,371
you know?

968
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,330
I mean we always talk about,

969
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:34,900
we like,

970
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,290
you know,

971
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:35,611
Eddie,

972
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:35,851
you,

973
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:37,930
you and I in particular are so,

974
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,764
um,

975
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,131
we're,

976
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,540
we're always so positive about weed.

977
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,060
You don't have to use hand signals
about do you want another corona?

978
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,110
Hey someone,

979
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:44,944
can I help you?

980
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,010
Can I

981
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,350
send you a run or sent home?

982
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:49,640
Girl don't want to eat her up.

983
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,690
The talking people pay a
penthouse pet of the year.

984
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,910
That's how strong this place is.

985
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,470
You just got over yard it.

986
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,700
I'll give you that award here.

987
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,260
Give this to the bartender.

988
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,111
Dang.

989
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:08,030
Just go and just go
get a a bunch of beers.

990
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,880
He was thinking too,

991
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,550
I was totally thinking right before.

992
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,170
You sound like there's no beer.

993
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,681
You know what?

994
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,700
We can't go to the bar.

995
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,250
So it's the rest of the show with
no more beer that's going to get by.

996
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,800
You know why he was thinking that?

997
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,630
Cause he's the Indians out.

998
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,670
Less than three corona come out tonight.

999
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,090
No,

1000
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,450
I'd have to have like four or
five shots come on to the Indians.

1001
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,690
The Indians here right now.

1002
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,251
He's here right now,

1003
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:37,790
bro.

1004
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,500
He's sharpening his Tomahawk with a,

1005
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,430
with a file.

1006
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,650
Are we on the air?

1007
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,790
No,

1008
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,610
definitely not.

1009
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,750
Definitely no.

1010
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,700
We're on the air man.

1011
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,151
Oh Shit.

1012
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:47,451
Oh yeah.

1013
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:48,284
We're not going anywhere.

1014
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,880
So bring us back to it.

1015
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,680
So you uh,

1016
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,130
you tears for fears?

1017
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,490
Yeah.

1018
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:52,941
Oh yeah.

1019
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:53,421
You know what?

1020
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,120
My Dad tried music since
he went to Columbia House.

1021
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,600
Thank God they're not fucking around too
much now these days because they'd be

1022
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,411
the first on dibs.

1023
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,720
But with the whole Columbia
House deal and as you know,

1024
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:06,720
my dad got this new Luckman CD player
cutting edge fucking technology at the

1025
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,810
time and he bought into that,

1026
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:09,644
um,

1027
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,251
you know,

1028
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:13,010
get x CDs for a penny.

1029
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,933
Shit.

1030
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,770
How did they ever make any money?

1031
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:21,521
Exactly right?

1032
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:21,671
Well,

1033
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:24,250
they must've made it
least fucking 100 cents.

1034
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,760
Something.

1035
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,700
Must've had a pain.

1036
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,190
It's totally forgot about that.

1037
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,800
Never came up on there.

1038
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:30,340
I did it.

1039
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,260
I did it twice with cassettes,

1040
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,330
cds for a penny.

1041
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,130
I don't think I ever got to the CDS.

1042
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:39,930
I think I want to do something ridiculous
like that and they send them to you

1043
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:43,620
and you nor him and you don't send
them back yo money or something.

1044
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,720
Yeah,

1045
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,950
that actually was part of it.

1046
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:46,970
That's how they afford it.

1047
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,820
She was completely ridiculous names.

1048
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:49,970
You just put any name,

1049
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,790
your address,

1050
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,010
any name that me.

1051
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,210
Do you remember that?

1052
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,103
However,

1053
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,510
pastors marketing strategy
we're going to give you,

1054
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:57,050
at the time,

1055
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,240
they were fucking cds for 99 cents.

1056
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,850
How do you split that with the bands?

1057
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,560
All this shit?

1058
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,751
What was it?

1059
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,070
Just like extra stock.

1060
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,920
I mean what it was that there's,

1061
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,800
what is the re having more foreigner
albums were distributed that way.

1062
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:13,634
Then anything

1063
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,370
foreigner and journey,

1064
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,910
those fucking journey
cassettes just flew out door.

1065
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,060
That was the first thing that people
picked on the list that was working in a

1066
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,781
record store.

1067
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:27,840
Right when cds were coming in and
like cassettes were like going down.

1068
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,440
We still had records
because record stores.

1069
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,283
That's what,

1070
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,300
Oh did you just get all,

1071
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,563
all this?

1072
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,200
I'll have a chronic coronas are cool.

1073
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:42,531
Thank you,

1074
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:42,830
sir.

1075
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,663
Here.

1076
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,603
So anyway,

1077
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,500
so you started creating
music and how did you get,

1078
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:49,951
I mean you,

1079
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:53,700
you obviously there's been some sort of
a massive leap somewhere along the line

1080
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,700
that you've gotten to be this guy who
could fucking sell the Rogers Center.

1081
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,530
That's incredible,

1082
00:26:58,531 --> 00:26:58,711
man.

1083
00:26:58,711 --> 00:26:59,490
It took a while.

1084
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,323
You know it

1085
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,780
like,

1086
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,090
you know,

1087
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,923
four years,

1088
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,680
four years.

1089
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,570
I know I of that.

1090
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:05,051
That's crazy.

1091
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:05,884
How did that happen?

1092
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,300
Fucking say that's a wild man.

1093
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,831
That's crazy.

1094
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,221
You know what I mean?

1095
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,420
People are screaming at their,

1096
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:12,691
their,

1097
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:12,931
their,

1098
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,931
their computer right now a while to go
from four years of creating music to all

1099
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,770
of a sudden be selling
off the Roger Center.

1100
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,604
That's amazing.

1101
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,540
That is really cool.

1102
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,340
Staggering.

1103
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,640
You know,

1104
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,520
like it's just,

1105
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,610
I guess I'm super lucky to be in this
climate of the development of what I'm

1106
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:32,370
trying to get at is how do you
think you hit this resonance?

1107
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:32,551
I mean,

1108
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,460
what you're doing is,

1109
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,380
is really like funky electronic shit,

1110
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:42,381
but you obviously have hit a residence
that people are really drawn to.

1111
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,890
It's not simply,

1112
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,491
you know,

1113
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,390
you've been in the business,

1114
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:46,181
he got lucky.

1115
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,014
You've stumbled in,

1116
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,460
no.

1117
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,060
Did they,

1118
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,270
there's people that love
the sounds you're creating.

1119
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:51,971
Yeah.

1120
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:52,271
Okay.

1121
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,250
I mean there's definitely
a music element in that.

1122
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:54,940
Of course,

1123
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,520
you know,

1124
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,540
I ate,

1125
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,040
you know,

1126
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,500
my parents put me in like
piano boot camp after school.

1127
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:02,380
So between the time hours of like
three and when they got off of work,

1128
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,210
I was classically trained the whole time.

1129
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,083
Wow.

1130
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,970
That's like,

1131
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,420
but,

1132
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,330
but I forgot all that shit when I was 16
because computers kind of came out and

1133
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,010
then,

1134
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,490
you know,

1135
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,330
fuck a piano.

1136
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,363
Right?

1137
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,190
Yeah.

1138
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,540
Uh,

1139
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,871
but,

1140
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:16,141
but,

1141
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:16,921
but fuck me.

1142
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,270
Did that ever come in handy later?

1143
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,991
I'm sure.

1144
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:19,321
You know,

1145
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:22,230
cause you just work out melodies,

1146
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:22,921
countermelody melodies,

1147
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,620
all that stuff requires a
certain amount of intelligence.

1148
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,920
It's not just fucking know
how to float that mouse,

1149
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,080
that mouse heads a good move to.

1150
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:31,380
Dude,

1151
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,100
I'll tell you what,

1152
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,060
the listening to you because of the
mouse head makes me feel cooler.

1153
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,521
When I was,

1154
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:40,260
I was watching some youtube clips and
you were on stage and you had the mouse

1155
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,260
head on and you were rocking out and the
crowd was rocking out and I was like,

1156
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,730
do something dope about that.

1157
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,330
There's something I liked the fact that
this fucking guy's wearing a crazy giant

1158
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:48,810
mouse head.

1159
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,800
He was actually a big influence on my
idea for the logo because I've always

1160
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,970
recognized him as his mouse
head and so then I was like,

1161
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:57,241
dude,

1162
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:57,941
he you,

1163
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,920
you are a master almost of
marketing because you know the,

1164
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,220
the idea of the mouse.

1165
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,480
I did do a lot of that was Disney night.

1166
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,820
You know the Dick off.

1167
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,450
Well No,

1168
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,560
me and Disney are cool now.

1169
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,200
You're cool.

1170
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Yeah.

1171
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,390
Actually it was really funny.

1172
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:14,010
We had to play a show in Anaheim once at
a this at the thing and they were like,

1173
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:14,641
dude,

1174
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,740
you know Disney called and they
want you to come play a dude.

1175
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:19,710
I'm thinking I get to be led
into this like fucking dark.

1176
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,040
Mickey and goofy are going to come
out with some cool shit on me or Joel.

1177
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,460
Nope.

1178
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,620
Disney has never had an
issue with it at all.

1179
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,191
No,

1180
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:33,401
we're,

1181
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:35,470
we're totally cool because
it is a different shape.

1182
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,550
It is a different shape,

1183
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:39,100
but since I'm a math thing and
I'm not and they're not really,

1184
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:41,980
well I guess the today that

1185
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,870
are in the music business
and stuff like that,

1186
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:47,980
but it's so distinguishable between the
two identities that they're just like,

1187
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:48,071
yeah,

1188
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:48,904
that's cool.

1189
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm wondering at the same time too,

1190
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:55,921
because when I did file for a design
patents on my logo and stuff like that,

1191
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,260
it's like one of the first things I had
to do was go to different countries and

1192
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,930
apply for logo copyrights
and stuff like that.

1193
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,441
Right now,

1194
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:07,060
Disney must have a crack fucking team
of experts of people doing this shit

1195
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:07,894
because I'll tell you,

1196
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,540
I used to work for a software company
in Belgium that used to have a,

1197
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,550
uh,

1198
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,010
a studio software and it
was called fruity loops.

1199
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,840
One of my favorites.

1200
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,670
Kellogg's put a fucking cease
and desist serious on the name.

1201
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:21,941
And,

1202
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:22,361
and dude,

1203
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:26,050
we're talking cereal
and music application.

1204
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,160
Nothing to do with each other,

1205
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,480
but for whatever reason,

1206
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:28,691
you know,

1207
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,640
they gave in to the machine and said,

1208
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,720
we're going to have to rename this studio.

1209
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,270
But everyone still calls
it if they own the name,

1210
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,070
they don't want you using it for anything.

1211
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,130
I can understand what
the true like mouse it,

1212
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,761
danger mouse,

1213
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:43,431
a dead mouse,

1214
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:44,840
fucking mighty mouse.

1215
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,510
Everyone's animal.

1216
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:47,931
You get,

1217
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:48,540
you don't get to,

1218
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,430
I'm lying.

1219
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,560
I'm the only lawyer.

1220
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,411
You know,

1221
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:52,460
you don't get to own that.

1222
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,481
That's silly.

1223
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,051
There's true.

1224
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:54,884
But so the actual,

1225
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,200
the similarities of the,

1226
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:56,501
you know,

1227
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,520
the circle in this thing,

1228
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,930
I thought that was a little close.

1229
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:03,890
So I kind of thought that maybe someone
was asleep at the wheel when we had,

1230
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,810
when that had gone through,

1231
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:06,190
because basically it was one day,

1232
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,390
it was a call from my lawyer saying,

1233
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,601
dude,

1234
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:08,111
you got the patent.

1235
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:08,320
You're,

1236
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,153
you're good.

1237
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,840
Wow.

1238
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
Virtually untouchable right now.

1239
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,100
And I'm like,

1240
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,700
oh,

1241
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,320
thank God there's so baller.

1242
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,180
They don't give a fuck Disney.

1243
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:15,840
They're just,

1244
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,470
the executives are sitting around and
gold underwear laying on stacks of cash.

1245
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,830
That bitch have his fucking logo,

1246
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,761
whatever.

1247
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:26,840
Who gives a shit me back so much.

1248
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Disney are suing other
departments of disease for real.

1249
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:30,781
Well,

1250
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:31,614
I'm sure,

1251
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,070
do you know this for fact lie down,

1252
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,070
but I,

1253
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,950
to be really careful,

1254
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,560
selection happens,

1255
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:38,101
you know what I mean?

1256
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,540
So it probably doesn't happen.

1257
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,130
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say it doesn't have a,

1258
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,740
Disney was actually where I got
my very first development deal.

1259
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,680
I did a Sitcom for Disney and now
and then I'll just shut the fuck up.

1260
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:47,940
Then they were very nice,

1261
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,540
you know?

1262
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,320
And I was a dirty comedian man that
was fucking terrible dirty comedian.

1263
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,030
And they gave me a development deal.

1264
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,230
They were pretty cool.

1265
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,610
They did.

1266
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,330
They're a lot more open
minded than you would think.

1267
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:57,650
You know,

1268
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,400
they're essentially just
in entertainment company,

1269
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,630
but the name Disney,

1270
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:04,170
like you automatically
associate everything with
like super family values type

1271
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:04,560
Shit,

1272
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,711
you know?

1273
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:05,100
Yeah,

1274
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,933
right.

1275
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,880
I was up to Jonas brothers and all that.

1276
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,160
That's just smart business.

1277
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,531
You know,

1278
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:10,981
like there's,

1279
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,230
there's a lot of money and
that babysitting money.

1280
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,670
It's a fucking a lot of money man.

1281
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:14,971
You know,

1282
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:15,804
it's out there.

1283
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,460
Like Bill Hicks used
to talk about with the,

1284
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,680
you know,

1285
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,870
I remember when um,

1286
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,760
Tiffany and Debbie Gibson
where all the shit,

1287
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:25,910
that's when Bill Hicks was a alive and he,

1288
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,810
I have all these jokes about Tiffany
and Debbie Gibson and how ridiculous it

1289
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:28,981
was.

1290
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:31,590
But the bottom line is
somebody likes that man.

1291
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,483
Somebody likes that.

1292
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,870
There's babysitting money out there.

1293
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,220
You know?

1294
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,460
When

1295
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,840
you met me at Modo,

1296
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:37,591
how one,

1297
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:38,161
how did you,

1298
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:38,960
where did you meet him?

1299
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,980
I think it was the only guy

1300
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,270
that was able to spot him out,

1301
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,370
walk by because that's the game
designer or a super Mario brothers,

1302
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,300
all that stuff.

1303
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,590
And like were,

1304
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,060
where are you?

1305
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,390
Whoa.

1306
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:49,680
Hey.

1307
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,513
Wow.

1308
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,630
Where were you at when that happened?

1309
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,950
I was actually in my trailer.

1310
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:55,730
We um,

1311
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,211
he was,

1312
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:56,690
he was,

1313
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,160
he was not to be announced.

1314
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,070
This is last name me a
Moto Moto his last name?

1315
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,390
Yeah,

1316
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,210
it should guru or a Shogi Japanese.

1317
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:04,360
Yeah.

1318
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,721
Um,

1319
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:05,530
if you were,

1320
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,860
if your name was like Miyamoto Musashi,

1321
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,520
if that was your name,

1322
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,960
you would say Musashi Miyamoto,

1323
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:11,290
right?

1324
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,123
You would say I,

1325
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,821
I believe so.

1326
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:13,361
What's going on there?

1327
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,740
Brian being assaulted.

1328
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,780
Your mind was totally done.

1329
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:16,901
Oh,

1330
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:17,734
there you go.

1331
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,250
Um,

1332
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,030
so he has another aim is
that the Musashi's is last

1333
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,860
Miyamoto's his last name
Shigeru is his first name.

1334
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,350
Miyamoto.

1335
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,990
She grew up,

1336
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,651
cause you,

1337
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:27,720
even in your live shows
you incorporate like,

1338
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,140
like,

1339
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,740
like your,

1340
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,670
your logo inside,

1341
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:31,860
like video games and stuff
like on your led wall.

1342
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:32,180
Right.

1343
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,100
I've seen that before.

1344
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,780
So,

1345
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,460
uh,

1346
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,830
did,

1347
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,041
did,

1348
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:35,191
did,

1349
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,240
did he know who you were?

1350
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,250
Did you don't know?

1351
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:38,911
But he,

1352
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:39,241
he's,

1353
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:41,010
he's very Japanese.

1354
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,170
He had a translator
with them and all that.

1355
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,450
So it was actually kind of
funny when I talked to him,

1356
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,760
obviously I told him I was
big fan and he was like,

1357
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,091
oh,

1358
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:48,361
okay.

1359
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:48,930
And then you know,

1360
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,180
I've got this ghost,

1361
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,320
the Bu Tattoo on sign your arm.

1362
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:52,630
Yeah,

1363
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,170
he did.

1364
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,870
He signed my arm and now you tattooed
immediately called up peewee on sunset.

1365
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:58,291
And I'm like,

1366
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,124
Bro,

1367
00:33:59,130 --> 00:33:59,761
I got a tattoo.

1368
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:00,200
This

1369
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,800
that's uh,

1370
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,011
yeah.

1371
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:04,790
I've seen a few people have a other
people's names tattooed on their arms.

1372
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
Mark Marin recently did that.

1373
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,780
Some guy had marked sign his arm they had
tattooed on that's gotta to be a trip.

1374
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:11,951
Well,

1375
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:13,400
I've done that for a lot of fans too.

1376
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,150
You know,

1377
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,310
it only seems right.

1378
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:15,761
You know what I mean?

1379
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:16,990
Because you're thinking
for a while I'm like,

1380
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:17,231
man,

1381
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:18,064
this kid's crazy.

1382
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,641
And you're like,

1383
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:18,911
he's like,

1384
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:19,421
so my arms,

1385
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm hiring you going to get this,

1386
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm going to get this tattooed and I
signed this arm and then Lo and behold,

1387
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:24,040
I see them at a future gigs.

1388
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,830
I did memory something.

1389
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,990
I'm fucking got a tattooed.

1390
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:26,231
I'm like,

1391
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:26,470
dude,

1392
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,400
that's nuts.

1393
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,540
That happens with kiss a lot.

1394
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,490
I have a tee shirt.

1395
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,510
Shit,

1396
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,470
I have a tee shirt company.

1397
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:32,620
It's called higher prime mate.

1398
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,943
It was one of them,

1399
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,560
a little wearing.

1400
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,190
It's all mostly just monkeys and
weeds and monkeys and psychedelics,

1401
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:39,024
monkeys,

1402
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:39,691
DMT,

1403
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:40,710
monkeys and mushrooms.

1404
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,750
But a lot of people have taken the images
and turn them into tattoos and it's

1405
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,381
crazy.

1406
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:46,560
I,

1407
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,180
I've collected a bunch of images,

1408
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:48,421
but it's,

1409
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:49,860
it's really a trip to me and they're like,

1410
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,390
these teachers that I'm sounding like,

1411
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:55,110
one dude has the whole back of his
neck is this psychedelic monkey.

1412
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:58,620
A monkey in the Lotus position is
third eyes glowing and it's like,

1413
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,330
it's pretty fucking bad ass.

1414
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,910
He's sitting on the DMT molecule in a,

1415
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,690
in a inside of a lotus flower and this
guy's got it tattooed on his neck.

1416
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:06,931
I'm like,

1417
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:08,310
well this is kind of crazy.

1418
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,560
And that thing that the Brian's logo,

1419
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,420
the death squad logo,

1420
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:13,710
but it's actually changed.

1421
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,910
The new one is different.

1422
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,950
So unfortunately for
those people that got it,

1423
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,740
that one who was telling me about
this on the way and change it,

1424
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,790
I don't like the change
that the new one's sucks.

1425
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,653
I'm going to be honest with you.

1426
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,440
This one's the shit I liked.

1427
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:27,260
I don't like the main,

1428
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,093
the chaplain

1429
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,493
chaplain,

1430
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,330
but I do like the fact that
he strapped the other way.

1431
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,471
The new guy,

1432
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:33,871
it's like a,

1433
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:34,710
it's like he's,

1434
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,973
you know,

1435
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,650
a bunny from planet

1436
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,920
Bunnings please.

1437
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,793
I love bunnies.

1438
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,760
Delicious.

1439
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,420
You must have it.

1440
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,480
You don't even fight with mashed potatoes,

1441
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:44,761
you know,

1442
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:45,594
fuck you up.

1443
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,620
You were saying that like millions of
people have your tattoo and it has to be

1444
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,861
true is,

1445
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:55,861
I even thought about it definitely in
the hundreds of thousands or hundreds of

1446
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,340
twos actually even thought
about getting your logo.

1447
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,861
I have the first,

1448
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,090
why don't you get us the first?

1449
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:03,331
Wow.

1450
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,420
That's the first issue that,

1451
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,610
oh wow.

1452
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,560
And what is on the right
hand side of the mouse?

1453
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:07,831
Actually,

1454
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:08,700
I'll tell you a funny story.

1455
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:09,121
It's a,

1456
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:13,740
it's a UPC barcode because I was working
with a software company at the time and

1457
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,380
they did a barcode measurement
system kind of thing,

1458
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,214
and I thought,

1459
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,641
wow,

1460
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:21,450
I wonder if you could actually scan a
barcode that if it was like tattooed on

1461
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,260
you and then it,

1462
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,093
it didn't work.

1463
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,293
Oh,

1464
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,250
well myth myth.

1465
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,020
Fucking busted.

1466
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,540
Yeah,

1467
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,373
there you go.

1468
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,200
Did you,

1469
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,780
you started off doing web design,

1470
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:31,110
right?

1471
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,680
Yeah.

1472
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,750
I also did it.

1473
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,510
I hated it.

1474
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,870
Did you,

1475
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,820
did you enjoy it?

1476
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,700
I enjoyed it when it was cool and fun
and I had a really client and he's like,

1477
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:38,851
yeah,

1478
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:39,450
that's Rad.

1479
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,130
But I hated it when he,

1480
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,570
it's,

1481
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:41,790
it's,

1482
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,990
it's a little too blue.

1483
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,120
Maybe we can add some brain was like,

1484
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:45,391
dude,

1485
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,920
well I'm the fucking designer.

1486
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,310
Right?

1487
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,020
So how about I designed the fucking thing?

1488
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,261
Well,

1489
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,990
if you've got all the ideas in your
head and you know how to do it,

1490
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,640
then what the fuck do you need me?

1491
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,670
If you had a client,

1492
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,120
one client came to you and said,

1493
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,930
Bro,

1494
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,660
if you had a client and the
client came to you and said,

1495
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,290
hey,

1496
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:01,700
you know,

1497
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,680
have a dairy farm,

1498
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,140
we're trying to build a
website and you're like,

1499
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:04,291
all right,

1500
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,011
I'm going to do it my way,

1501
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:05,460
bitch.

1502
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,080
Well my way in because
they're going to kind of cool.

1503
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,250
You work with a customer to agree,

1504
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,260
but some of the customers are just like,

1505
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
some of the clients are just like,

1506
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:14,881
dude,

1507
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,140
you're doing this wrong.

1508
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:16,950
And uh,

1509
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,570
and I think that the balance of the way
that this load understand what you're

1510
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:22,230
saying right.

1511
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,520
Then why don't you do it?

1512
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,180
Yeah.

1513
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,140
You have to have a certain amount of
artistic license to do anything that you

1514
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:29,370
don't actually go to them.

1515
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,060
That's also one of the reasons why
you're probably so great at your music is

1516
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:33,451
that you know,

1517
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,820
you have a very specific
vision and you're,

1518
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,490
you're really enchanted by that vision.

1519
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,390
You want to follow it.

1520
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,840
One thing about being a
producer of electronic music
because electronic music is

1521
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:45,090
had this stigma for like,

1522
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:45,391
you know,

1523
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:46,770
a good decade and a half of,

1524
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,130
you know,

1525
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,620
basically people taking
other people's music and,

1526
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,460
and then,

1527
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:50,730
you know,

1528
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,490
working in all these justifications
as to why it's an art form.

1529
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:53,761
Okay.

1530
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:54,031
Yes.

1531
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:55,410
Turntablism in itself,

1532
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,610
definitely a fucking art form.

1533
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:56,841
You know,

1534
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,340
it's like look at the fucking key berets,

1535
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,041
you know,

1536
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,080
and all that shit and just
going fucking crazy with that.

1537
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:01,621
That's fine.

1538
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:02,431
But you don't say,

1539
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:03,264
can you do it?

1540
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,111
Can I do it?

1541
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:04,710
I can't do it.

1542
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,100
Well there's gotta be an art form and no,

1543
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,943
it's gotta be,

1544
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,400
you can't tell me that there's not as,

1545
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,290
I think carpentry is an art form.

1546
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,183
Absolutely.

1547
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,271
Everything is,

1548
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,090
you know,

1549
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,050
everything with focus in a tent
and you use your creativity.

1550
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,681
But you know,

1551
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,410
since you know the term Dj,

1552
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,670
you know it was coined and then people
started getting like kind of lazy with it

1553
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,960
to the point well with electronic music
to where you could just play the hit big

1554
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:32,400
track and then just fade out that last
30 seconds and then fade in the first 30

1555
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:33,530
seconds of the other one done.

1556
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,240
That's to me that's not
very archetypal and,

1557
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,370
and it's not you and you're not
adding any unique element into it.

1558
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:43,180
So to have the kind of control where your
making the music that allows you to do

1559
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,590
that and in different ways,

1560
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:45,131
you know what I mean?

1561
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:49,180
That's what makes it special and unique
to that one guy as opposed to unique to

1562
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:50,770
that one group of fucking guys,

1563
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:51,071
you know?

1564
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:51,610
And,

1565
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,680
and it was getting really
stagnant and there was DJ,

1566
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:53,891
this,

1567
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,131
Dj,

1568
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,850
that Dj stage of that when it was all
down to the playlist at the end of the

1569
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:57,851
day.

1570
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:02,140
And none of those guys had any of their
own shit in there that made it unique to

1571
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,974
them.

1572
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,150
Just a part of the natural
evolution of music.

1573
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:08,040
And that sort of had to
happen before everybody went,

1574
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,221
hey,

1575
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,054
you know what man,

1576
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,960
you guys are just copying what
the Ibv your own man styles.

1577
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:13,221
Right?

1578
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:13,990
And you got a guy

1579
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,270
fucking log and he's going
down on the fucking log.

1580
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,721
And Aaron was like,

1581
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:16,931
yeah,

1582
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:17,231
right.

1583
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,580
And then this other dude was like,

1584
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:18,781
yeah,

1585
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:19,810
we'll fucking check this out.

1586
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:20,621
He takes a fucking log,

1587
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:21,550
does the exact same thing,

1588
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:22,090
you know what I mean?

1589
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,730
It's just not,

1590
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,730
and then he's like debunking
the other fucking dude,

1591
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,970
right.

1592
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,380
It escalating it.

1593
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,191
[inaudible] so the,

1594
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:28,341
the,

1595
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,560
like the people would criticize you,

1596
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,420
all you're doing is playing
other people's shit.

1597
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,140
And then people go,

1598
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,441
okay,

1599
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:34,610
well I'm going to make my own shit.

1600
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,390
Is that what happened?

1601
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,141
I think that's what happened.

1602
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:36,340
Yeah.

1603
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,000
And it had to happen because,

1604
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:38,301
you know,

1605
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,140
it was a,

1606
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,530
you know,

1607
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,070
to legitimize the music well to both that

1608
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,521
and,

1609
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:42,821
and,

1610
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:43,270
and,

1611
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,090
and make things unique for that.

1612
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:46,721
We're like,

1613
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:46,931
you know,

1614
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:50,320
associated with that one person as opposed
to something that was this group of

1615
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,920
people that you weren't quite sure who
was doing what and which Dj was better

1616
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,590
than the other one.

1617
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,000
I loved the fact that you can just make
all these noises just on your computer

1618
00:39:59,001 --> 00:39:59,480
now.

1619
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,751
I mean,

1620
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,490
I know you might not be
able to do what you do,

1621
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,210
but Brian's made some crazy
shit just with garageband.

1622
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,631
Yeah,

1623
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:06,464
absolutely.

1624
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,390
This whole last album was done completely
in garage bands and they are huge.

1625
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,111
What is it?

1626
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:12,800
Justice,

1627
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,633
justice,

1628
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,201
justice.

1629
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:15,800
Really.

1630
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,190
I'm an old blow out of their old,

1631
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,010
well I listened to like Greg Allman.

1632
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,330
What?

1633
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,240
They're a little dirtier,

1634
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:21,020
a little grungy,

1635
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,450
sounding the my stuff and
listened to Leonard Skinner.

1636
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,410
Fucking,

1637
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,570
their shit is awesome and
it's so low fi low tech,

1638
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,960
no million dollar studio bullshit.

1639
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,030
You like bands like the black keys?

1640
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,780
I love him.

1641
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,351
I love,

1642
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,210
actually I worked with them.

1643
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,760
Fucking cats mailing.

1644
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,390
Is it freak?

1645
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:39,940
Sorry.

1646
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,701
I work with them.

1647
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:41,390
Where'd you work with them?

1648
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:41,570
Oh,

1649
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,610
we did the VGA or sorry,

1650
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,444
the Vmax.

1651
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,261
Oh wait,

1652
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:45,620
wow.

1653
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,453
Fuck did we do,

1654
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,770
oh my God.

1655
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,280
Really?

1656
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,001
You Sleeping?

1657
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,260
My managers fucking asleep.

1658
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,580
Earning 1%.

1659
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,230
Whoa.

1660
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,621
Hold on.

1661
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,460
24 real.

1662
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,550
Talk to me about that bullshit.

1663
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,120
Go shake Dina.

1664
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,470
Huh?

1665
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,620
Never supposed to play tomorrow.

1666
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,550
There's my one.

1667
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,680
I haven't even heard of
getting more than 15.

1668
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,810
It's okay.

1669
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,350
He's here and said he said he's tired
because he was working so fucking hard to

1670
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,203
ask grammys.

1671
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,610
Oh my goodness.

1672
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:14,730
Are you nominated for anything?

1673
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,743

Yeah.

1697
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,541
Yeah.

1698
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,260
And um,

1699
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,890
we kind of,

1700
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,330
I was kind of charged with the task
of being like the house music guy,

1701
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,290
like,

1702
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,621
you know,

1703
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:46,540
throughout the whole night.

1704
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,181
So like,

1705
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:47,330
Hey,

1706
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,081
and the commercial break,

1707
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:49,040
here's this guy in a mouse had,

1708
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:49,251
okay,

1709
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,490
here's a commercial vms you
did to virgin mobile fest.

1710
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,623
Vma,

1711
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,840
virgin music or fuck video music awards.

1712
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,570
It should be the MBA's music video awards.

1713
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,111
Right.

1714
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:00,381
Somebody,

1715
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,570
somebody was probably
the video music awards.

1716
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,440
I had to work with all these other artists
like Robin and I'm at Jason Derulo,

1717
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,080
the black keys and someone else.

1718
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,520
But um,

1719
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,121
anyway,

1720
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:15,110
the point was is I had to kind of take
their stuff and electronic eyes it and

1721
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,460
remix it in a way that,

1722
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:17,570
you know,

1723
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,630
they could either perform with
and play with and all that stuff.

1724
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,351
And I did,

1725
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:22,184
uh,

1726
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,150
I did that song,

1727
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:24,500
that really good song by the black keys.

1728
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,570
Got To get another one.

1729
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:27,111
An older one.

1730
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:27,290
No,

1731
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,891
it's an older one.

1732
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:28,140
It was,

1733
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,090
it was their big hit.

1734
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,050
Ah,

1735
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,500
Geez.

1736
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,333
Joe Loves,

1737
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,350
I love the book.

1738
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:32,871
You love him,

1739
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,704
but you can't love them.

1740
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,410
Go.

1741
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:34,671
What,

1742
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:35,300
what um,

1743
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,480
what song you can be thinking about.

1744
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,000
So many songs tighten up.

1745
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:38,510
Thank you.

1746
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,290
Thank you.

1747
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,531
Yes,

1748
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,360
it was definitely tighten
up and it was really cool.

1749
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,690
So I did this kind of
cool version of it and it,

1750
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,120
you know,

1751
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,540
and then play that out during
the commercial break and,

1752
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,230
and,

1753
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,440
and they were into it and they were like,

1754
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:48,711
dude,

1755
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:48,921
yeah,

1756
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,240
we should probably,

1757
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:50,551
you know,

1758
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:53,300
like make this an unofficial
remix or something like that.

1759
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:53,990
And I'm just like,

1760
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,411
Oh man,

1761
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:54,951
that'd be awesome.

1762
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:58,040
But I got to work on so
much shit that it just,

1763
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,930
we never got around to it.

1764
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,351
Oh,

1765
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:00,981
that's too bad.

1766
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:01,814
Yeah.

1767
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,830
People's tastes in music is so bizarre.

1768
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,920
I put on a,

1769
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,400
well,

1770
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,630
I asked Brian to put on little black
submarines last night while we were doing

1771
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,070
our ice house chronical show.

1772
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:11,521
And I'm like,

1773
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:14,100
this is one of my favorite songs
when I love this fucking song.

1774
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,100
And I expected a lot of people
and most people on Twitter,

1775
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,270
ironically,

1776
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,440
we're there,

1777
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,131
we're in agreement.

1778
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:20,281
Like,

1779
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:20,491
wow,

1780
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,450
what a great fucking song.

1781
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,770
But on my message board,

1782
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,930
my message board is
filled with so many hunts.

1783
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:27,840
He says,

1784
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,410
close down,

1785
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:29,243
couldn't farm

1786
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,853
fucking cunt.

1787
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,930
It's a cunt farm.

1788
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,000
These guys were shitting on this song.

1789
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:36,950
It's nothing.

1790
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,640
It makes me think of stairway to heaven.

1791
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,590
Shut your fucking dumb,

1792
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,640
whole dumb negative twat face fuck head.

1793
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,600
It's a great God damn song for you
to just get on negative like that.

1794
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:52,980
I guarantee your life is
a bag of shit about music.

1795
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:58,010
It's pretty subjective but it's not like
nothing is that song as brilliant man.

1796
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,770
It's brilliant and I'm just kidding.

1797
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:02,880
Obviously you're allowed to hate it.

1798
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,930
Obviously.

1799
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,300
I'm only fucking around people like Kim,

1800
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:05,580
man,

1801
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,050
we fucking dictate what I like.

1802
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,260
A lot of this passion is
just for entertainment.

1803
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:10,710
Okay.

1804
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,760
I don't really want you to,

1805
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,870
people get so serious.

1806
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,510
Like we were talking about Margaret
Thatcher the other day and I'm like women

1807
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,580
shouldn't be allowed to run anything.

1808
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,640
Half of that I'm joking around for fun,

1809
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:20,981
right?

1810
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:22,650
Like it's so many women
that got mad at me.

1811
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,910
Like really?

1812
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,180
I'm like,

1813
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,900
do you not know any men do not know what
happens when five guys get together and

1814
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:28,860
drink and smoke pot.

1815
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:31,110
They started talking shit and
when one guy starts talking,

1816
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,900
how awesome Margaret Thatcher
is the every other dude,

1817
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:34,950
the rooms of Margaret Thatcher,

1818
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:36,170
she could suck my deck.

1819
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,740
That's all you start thinking.

1820
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,640
That's how the guys react that like
what's the only reason why she was running

1821
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,710
shit is cause all those English guys just,

1822
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,310
you know,

1823
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,800
none of them could fucker.

1824
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:46,800
Well they'll let her,

1825
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,041
you know,

1826
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,180
we're making things up.

1827
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,890
We don't really believe
anything we're saying.

1828
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:50,910
We're just trying to be funny.

1829
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,060
I'm sure Margaret Thatcher
was awesome by the way.

1830
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:54,780
Meryl Streep,

1831
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,070
Wonderful Actress.

1832
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:57,360
I was only joking around,

1833
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,890
I said she sucked,

1834
00:44:59,010 --> 00:44:59,843
but she can't.

1835
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,390
I like damaged.

1836
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,770
No,

1837
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,090
it's arguing with people.

1838
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,960
Now this is my point.

1839
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:07,780
I have a point.

1840
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,360
It's arguing with people on the Internet.

1841
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:09,750
You know,

1842
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,620
it's like people's tastes.

1843
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:10,981
The Internet.

1844
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:12,480
Because when we started putting that,

1845
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,740
you're going to be on 99% of
the people were super site.

1846
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,820
What was the 1%?

1847
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:19,330
There's 1% cut face.

1848
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,700
Shithead,

1849
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,630
loser,

1850
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,493
negative.

1851
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,990
You got to get back to
that one fucking guy.

1852
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:28,530
Cause he's the guy that's the first in
line that starts the ball of negativity.

1853
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,720
So here's the thing is easy read.

1854
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,381
You've got to give it up.

1855
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:32,160
There's a science.

1856
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,150
Well yeah and no.

1857
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:33,421
Okay.

1858
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:33,960
But there's,

1859
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,490
there's a science behind all of this.

1860
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:36,770
Fucking trolling.

1861
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,620
There really is.

1862
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,600
So you go look at a youtube video and
if a top rated or most recent common is

1863
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:43,470
something negative,

1864
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,130
people tend to agree with that
whether they believe it or not.

1865
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,560
Yes.

1866
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,393
You know what I mean?

1867
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,360
Fuck this.

1868
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:48,561
Yeah.

1869
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:49,230
You don't want you right.

1870
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,041
Fuck this and yeah,

1871
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,180
those other two dudes are right.

1872
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:51,850
Fuck him.

1873
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,380
Right?

1874
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:52,621
Yeah,

1875
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:52,980
no,

1876
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,030
I enjoy that.

1877
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,760
I enjoy the one completely
out to left field,

1878
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:57,840
super negative.

1879
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,321
You know,

1880
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:02,730
in a world full of happiness and it's
well crafted as long as it's handmade.

1881
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,220
It's just some,

1882
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,411
yeah,

1883
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:06,630
we'll fucking very rarely,

1884
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,340
one of my favorite guys is a daft
punk and their film interstellar,

1885
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,980
I must watch at least once a month.

1886
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,360
Do you ever have any plans to like maybe
released like a full length movie using

1887
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:21,190
your music and maybe animation
using her logo or something?

1888
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,063
Well that's a,

1889
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,940
that's a project among projects,

1890
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,151
right?

1891
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:25,160
You did that.

1892
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,150
Then maybe Disney might
want to read again.

1893
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,053
Seriously.

1894
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,810
If you were making your own
animation with the mouse,

1895
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,870
I think that was actually up there in
that whole like a pot of names to do the

1896
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:36,690
tron thing.

1897
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,350
Oh really?

1898
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:37,591
Yeah.

1899
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:39,150
I thought I was music soundtrack,

1900
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:39,984
what to do.

1901
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,153
Right.

1902
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,340
But honestly if it was me and
I knew they were in there,

1903
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:45,330
I'd have to give it to them.

1904
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,550
I enjoyed that music

1905
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:46,830
man.

1906
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,060
A little bit of it was
geekness Dahlia for my,

1907
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:51,270
I enjoyed the first movie and I
was like looking forward to it,

1908
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:55,200
but it was also just just
for the sheer cinematic,

1909
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,571
this,

1910
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:55,680
the,

1911
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,370
the does the visuals of it
all the world they created.

1912
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,300
I give it to you.

1913
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:02,820
It doesn't have to be a perfect story.

1914
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,660
You're doing a lot,

1915
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,450
you know you're getting
a lot of shit done here.

1916
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,240
You creating this crazy artificial world
where people ride motorcycles and chop

1917
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,050
each other in half.

1918
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,883
Anyway,

1919
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,370
I'll let,

1920
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,680
I'll let you slide try.

1921
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:12,960
Yeah,

1922
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,250
you got to trial a little mouse.

1923
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,390
But I love it and it was kinda interesting
how they're not quite ready to do

1924
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:19,590
human faces.

1925
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,180
You know the William,

1926
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:21,781
what is his name?

1927
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:22,614
William hurt.

1928
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,730
William hurt's character.

1929
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,481
Pretty close,

1930
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,530
but it was a little creepy.

1931
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,080
I haven't watched orange
in a really better it.

1932
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:29,943
I don't want to ruin the

1933
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,150
DTV.

1934
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,400
Marginally better than I am legend.

1935
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:34,690
When the lion comes out.

1936
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,850
Remember when the lion
comes out and I am legend.

1937
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,430
What happened?

1938
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,410
It looks terrible.

1939
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,940
It it ruined the whole movie for me.

1940
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,440
This line looks so stupid.

1941
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:41,830
It was fun.

1942
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,380
It looks like a lion
from Dora the explorer.

1943
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,460
It was like did it to Dora.

1944
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,900
Dora the explorer lion
comes out of the bushes.

1945
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:50,800
It was ridiculous.

1946
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,581
It was terrible.

1947
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:52,414
Cgi.

1948
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,610
They can't do animals that are real yet.

1949
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,170
They can do dinosaurs.

1950
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,450
They can do alien,

1951
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,920
they can do all sorts of
shit that doesn't exist.

1952
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:00,903
That's true.

1953
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,010
Good with old man.

1954
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,930
They're not bad.

1955
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,150
They're not bad cause
there's a lot of wrinkles.

1956
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,583
Yeah.

1957
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,140
Oh yeah.

1958
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,470
It's not real.

1959
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,890
Pretty close to when they can't get that.

1960
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,731
They're pretty close.

1961
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:16,710
So I agree with you.

1962
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,553
The hardest one.

1963
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,520
Discussing the hot chick.

1964
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,550
You could deal with a real
rough texture with the old man.

1965
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,510
What they can't do though.

1966
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,010
They can't do animals yet.

1967
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,420
They can't do like a dog.

1968
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,070
So yeah,

1969
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,240
it's a first the face,

1970
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,074
it looks fake.

1971
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,620
Definitely the head of my
department for its real issue,

1972
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,520
it doesn't look good.

1973
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,593
I'm about to

1974
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,590
embark on a serious CG Durney that I
can't really give too much information

1975
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:38,831
about.

1976
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:43,831
But we were actually like been bidding
around with companies right now and dude,

1977
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,780
we're looking at like 500 grand a minute.

1978
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,120
Yeah,

1979
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,300
it's going to make 500 grand.

1980
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:49,800
I'm no,

1981
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,110
no,

1982
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,110
that's cost to do like
[inaudible] it's about,

1983
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:57,461
oh no,

1984
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:57,611
no,

1985
00:48:57,611 --> 00:49:00,980
but we're talking like a final
rendered all my posts and everything.

1986
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,751
It's insane.

1987
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:02,300
So first,

1988
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,540
so expensive for 90 minute movies.

1989
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,980
What is that $45 million?

1990
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,270
Well No,

1991
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,920
I mean if you want to inject
it into a scene to Cambodia,

1992
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,080
he just needed a car.

1993
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:16,600
[inaudible] if that's entirely CG,

1994
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,030
if it's entirely CG like final fantasy,

1995
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,310
the cheaper,

1996
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,370
but if you are doing camera
tracking with real world stuff,

1997
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,800
then that's when it gets expensive.

1998
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:28,870
$500,000 a minute.

1999
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:29,860
I'm a fucking minute.

2000
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,671
So real,

2001
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:34,780
it isn't really is $45
million for a 90 minute movie.

2002
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,870
Not if it's all CG and it's not like shit,

2003
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:43,730
like transformers is not going to
cost 500 movie like final fantasy.

2004
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,660
No,

2005
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,190
because it's all CG.

2006
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,560
It increase incorporates no real

2007
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,110
shit issue when you
incorporate real world,

2008
00:49:52,111 --> 00:49:52,560
right?

2009
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:52,921
Yes.

2010
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:57,510
Because you have to do camera tracking
and obviously shit makes sense.

2011
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,080
Yeah.

2012
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,470
Dan,

2013
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,000
he's very knowledgeable with all this.

2014
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,000
I had a two hour long
meeting about it today.

2015
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,350
It's $1 million a day.

2016
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:05,390
Fuck it jammy.

2017
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,290
They sometimes do it with music videos,

2018
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,370
so what they do is they'll

2019
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,780
that minute and they'll split it over
the whole video of like if it's seven

2020
00:50:15,781 --> 00:50:17,070
minute long video,

2021
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,640
it's not,

2022
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,500
it's not going to be six
minutes of this and then Oh,

2023
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,880
last minutes all with CGI.

2024
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,740
They cut it in the edit.

2025
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:23,574
It

2026
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,150
so hard to wrap your head around.

2027
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,010
That's when you just
need to date a artists.

2028
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
That's all you said.

2029
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,610
It just,

2030
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,713
you know

2031
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,570

know about fucking 30 artery single,

2032
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,970

2033
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,520
We can whip that shit up.

2034
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,680
Date every one week.

2035
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,680
You date a shadower,

2036
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:46,514
one week data.

2037
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,430
Fucking motion.

2038
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,343
Jesus,

2039
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,570
your life is going to
be a graveyard as his,

2040
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,590
can I tell him my dead mouse?

2041
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,101
Blow it up.

2042
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:53,401
Store.

2043
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:54,740
I want to blow what?

2044
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:55,683
This is my,

2045
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,753
this is my story.

2046
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,403
I don't know maybe.

2047
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,080
Wow.

2048
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,010
Cool story Bro.

2049
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,720
Shut down son.

2050
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,550
This is based on the merit
of your previous stories.

2051
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:07,384
He doesn't even know you.

2052
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,130
I'm going to blow your music up right now,

2053
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:10,890
so that's not what he needs at this point.

2054
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,040
His career.

2055
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,550
Are you going to redeem
herself from the previous day?

2056
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,203
This is what happened to him.

2057
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,733
He's here.

2058
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,180
We're doing a podcast shit,

2059
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,030
dead mouse story like might
as well tell the story.

2060
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,953
Okay,

2061
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,540
so about a year and a half ago,

2062
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,720
he does a big thing at the staple
center with a bunch of other Djs,

2063
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,400
like a big gaming convention.

2064
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,690
Eat three big things.

2065
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:37,081
Staple,

2066
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:37,311
set,

2067
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:37,940
huge.

2068
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,880
Danny Loner dude is producing my stuff.

2069
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,080
Exelon snails.

2070
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,100
He has tickets.

2071
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:43,940
He calls me up.

2072
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,691
You want to go?

2073
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:44,961
I go,

2074
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:45,410
cool.

2075
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,640
We go last minute.

2076
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,200
It shows huge.

2077
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:49,070
It's massive.

2078
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:49,611
It's amazing.

2079
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,410
I really didn't get to
hear too much music.

2080
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:54,020
I W W W really wasn't paying
attention at this point.

2081
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:54,441
I didn't hear,

2082
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:55,760
I didn't know any dead mouse stuff.

2083
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,594
I didn't know.

2084
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,471
And uh,

2085
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:58,700
we went backstage,

2086
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,541
you know,

2087
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:00,291
took some pictures.

2088
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,640
I met him briefly.

2089
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,000
I remember the tattoo now when I see him.

2090
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,990
So,

2091
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,650
um,

2092
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,120
six months goes by,

2093
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,661
I'm getting,

2094
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,100
I'm getting tattoo.

2095
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:10,920
Um,

2096
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,830
get an ink done and dude,

2097
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:13,661
who's tattooed on me,

2098
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:17,870
he's got Pandora dubstep going on and
I'm sitting there for like five hours

2099
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,910
listening to and I
don't like anything mad.

2100
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,250
It's very hard for me to
be excited about music,

2101
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:22,431
man.

2102
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,050
You gotta be fucking good.

2103
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,410
The whole day goes by
and one song crushes me.

2104
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,480
Bassnectar tea time stretch.

2105
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,441
I heard that shit.

2106
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:35,441
I was getting on my fork time
stretch by Bassnectar is amazing.

2107
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,000
It blew me away.

2108
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,410
So we had to stop tattoo and
how to write that shit down.

2109
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:40,790
I'm like,

2110
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,620
rarely do I get blown away like that.

2111
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,840
Most of that shit was
just like good production.

2112
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:45,350
But I'm like,

2113
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,090
where's the song I'm looking for this.

2114
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,993
I need to hear that.

2115
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,620
Throw that shit.

2116
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,150
Oh,

2117
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:49,983
it's amazing.

2118
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,450
It's an actor Bassnectar time stretch.

2119
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,620
One of the most amazing songs
and it's in the dead mouse.

2120
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:58,170
Eric.

2121
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,090
Uh,

2122
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,421
Eric,

2123
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:00,290
but let me finish my story.

2124
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,800
I like how this story,

2125
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:02,270
no,

2126
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,103
no,

2127
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,280
hold on.

2128
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,113
That's not your shit.

2129
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,803
Super talented.

2130
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,500
Okay.

2131
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,710
So the whole day there's
one song Bassnectar times.

2132
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,570
So then I get into my car and
my arms all wrapped up and I go,

2133
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,900
I got one awesome song
by just listening to,

2134
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:20,680
you know,

2135
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,680
listening to a Pandora dubstep station.

2136
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,420
So right there on way home as I'm take
about an hour and a half to get home with

2137
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:28,050
traffic,

2138
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:28,883
I put on dubs,

2139
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,270
I want to find another song.

2140
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,150
So I kept listening song
after song after song,

2141
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,250
an hour into it and then boom,

2142
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,870
ghosts and stuff come up,

2143
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,680
comes on.

2144
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:37,921
I'm like,

2145
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:38,760
Holy Shit.

2146
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:42,000
Not too close and stuff goes to the stuff.

2147
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,533
I heard that,

2148
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,270
I heard that shit and no serious.

2149
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,190
This is a real story.

2150
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:47,701
Bam.

2151
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:49,140
Bought it on iTunes right away.

2152
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,531
No Way.

2153
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:50,400
This is a real story.

2154
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,560
This is like a make believe story.

2155
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:52,771
Look,

2156
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,610
you're in a castle.

2157
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,210
Yeah.

2158
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:54,541
Yes,

2159
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:55,374
exactly.

2160
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,280
I don't know what that means,

2161
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,390
but that's the way it went down.

2162
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,110
I wasn't,

2163
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,540
I didn't like anything the whole day.

2164
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,810
The whole day of listening in Dubstep
Bassnectar time stretch and your ghosts

2165
00:54:05,811 --> 00:54:06,600
and stuff.

2166
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,740
That fucking floored me.

2167
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:08,730
I bought it on iTunes.

2168
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:11,460
I don't bike shit unless
it's fucking living here.

2169
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:11,941
Some volume,

2170
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:12,180
Brian.

2171
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,320
That's some real shit right there.

2172
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,450
He's looking at me like,

2173
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:17,284
do you want to do it?

2174
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,473
Pushed the fader Ravi.

2175
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,211
He's scared.

2176
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:21,040
It'd be like cooking in
front of Anthony Bordain.

2177
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,740
I'm not sure what mix this is.

2178
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,060
I don't know if this is the same,

2179
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:25,480
that loud.

2180
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,310
It's the original.

2181
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,143
This one.

2182
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,330
Well,

2183
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,163
no,

2184
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:32,863
it's the original.

2185
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,840
This is the original.

2186
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,061
Oh,

2187
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:35,894
this is cool.

2188
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,051
No,

2189
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:41,490
I don't get tired of this fucking one.

2190
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:42,241
What do you,

2191
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,074
uh,

2192
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,190
what do you,

2193
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,023
what do you get?

2194
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,063
Free Bird,

2195
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,240
man.

2196
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,721
For me,

2197
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:49,860
this is all unique.

2198
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,230
All right.

2199
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,270
I Apologize,

2200
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,110
but I'm enjoying it.

2201
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:52,650
Um,

2202
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,580
how are you creating this?

2203
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,361
What did you use?

2204
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:56,490
This one is the only one track

2205
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,650
I didn't do in the studio.

2206
00:54:57,651 --> 00:54:59,310
I didn't and a hotel room in uh,

2207
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,150
England.

2208
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,270
Oh yeah.

2209
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:02,104
It was really funny.

2210
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,550
And My name came up.

2211
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:04,440
Yeah.

2212
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:04,630
Yeah.

2213
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,420
Just chilling out and I got
some computers and stuff.

2214
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:08,890
And there's that baseline again.

2215
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,583
That's your fault.

2216
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,423
That's the government

2217
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,010
dangerous.

2218
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,310
I'm messing about.

2219
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,740
And I'm talking to a,

2220
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,051
he's,

2221
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,700
he's a big Dj over in England.

2222
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:19,460
Pete Tong,

2223
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,810
uh,

2224
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,870
he does the BBC radio one
show and all that stuff.

2225
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:23,540
And uh,

2226
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:23,870
we,

2227
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:26,450
we had some discussion about
the hotel that I was staying in.

2228
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,831
He's like,

2229
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:26,951
yeah,

2230
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:27,191
Bro,

2231
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,024
it's haunted.

2232
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,360
Uh,

2233
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,680
you know,

2234
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,170
in doors are opening and
shutting and my room and shit.

2235
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:32,540
And I got,

2236
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,010
so,

2237
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,281
you know,

2238
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:34,080
and I'm just kinda like,

2239
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,390
I named songs at like spur of the
moment kind of bullshit thing.

2240
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:37,551
I don't,

2241
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,370
I don't really put any
thought into the name,

2242
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:40,870
so I just called it ghost and shit.

2243
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,490
So I sent it off.

2244
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:42,851
Yeah.

2245
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:44,710
And then we send it off
to emi and they're like,

2246
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:44,891
oh,

2247
00:55:44,891 --> 00:55:45,920
we can't call it ghosting.

2248
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:47,770
Shit goes and stuff.

2249
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:49,840
Alright.

2250
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,250
Whatever.

2251
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,083
Most of the stuff.

2252
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,870
That's kind of cool because you know what?

2253
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:53,181
No,

2254
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:53,631
cause if you,

2255
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:54,890
even if you did that,

2256
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,590
you would have to put that goddamn
sticker on the front of the CD,

2257
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:58,880
that explicit lyrics,

2258
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,460
even though it's not a
lyric in the song title,

2259
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,810
and then that actually
detriment you from fucking

2260
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,933
millions.

2261
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,423
Yeah.

2262
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,190
I was

2263
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,170
trying to find na's life we chose,

2264
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,600
there's so much cussing in it.

2265
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,381
All my God,

2266
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:14,100
they said,

2267
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,940
he says the n word like
without the chorus it's huge,

2268
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,900
but on iTunes I keep
downloading the clean one.

2269
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,300
There's just,

2270
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,560
they just pull out the lyrics.

2271
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:22,990
I'm like,

2272
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,010
Bach really

2273
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,611
sucks.

2274
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:25,770
Without all that shit,

2275
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,370
there's nothing more disturbing.

2276
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:30,340
When you're in a club and you're looking
to have a good time and you realize a

2277
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,890
song that you're hearing is
a censored version of it.

2278
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,281
Oh,

2279
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:38,281
I remember a few of those that the track
didn't work that one or get you forget.

2280
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:40,264
You

2281
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,663
forget you.

2282
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,290
It's terrible.

2283
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,180
Good with the fuck you.

2284
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,023
I realize,

2285
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,490
I thought it was a great
song all the way through,

2286
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,730
but then when they change due date,

2287
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,580
this is real because I might have blocked
it out and they call the people and

2288
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,830
slugging to watch that a son of a bitch

2289
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,830
fellows or something like that.

2290
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,730
Over dub was the girl that Brad
Pitt used to be married to.

2291
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,460
She's an now the other one,

2292
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,403
Angelina Jolie,

2293
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,263
the first one.

2294
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,441
No,

2295
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,011
the first one,

2296
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,341
man,

2297
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:13,174
when it's

2298
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,070
boom.

2299
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,290
Naacos Gwenyth Paltrow,

2300
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:17,710
uh,

2301
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,820
isn't that show glee?

2302
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:19,151
Right.

2303
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,050
And she was singing,

2304
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:20,884
forget you.

2305
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:21,611
She was singing it.

2306
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:22,930
I'm pretty sure I heard it.

2307
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:26,350
I might've just fury of SOC.

2308
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:27,640
I might've just blacked out.

2309
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,740
It was just too much irony for me.

2310
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,770
I couldn't handle it.

2311
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:33,190
I did.

2312
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,550
I did.

2313
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,620
I wanted to be a part of my imagination,

2314
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,840
so I couldn't even talk
about it on stage fruit kit.

2315
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,370
You forget the song.

2316
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,300
She was singing it and I'm
pretty sure she was saying it.

2317
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:41,771
It was,

2318
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,370
it was death.

2319
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,203
It was death.

2320
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,710
But it made me so sad that that,

2321
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,480
that first song was so dope.

2322
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,340
We played that song on the podcast.

2323
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,620
Never as a song gone from being so fucking
bad ass to just some shit that's like

2324
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,090
Muzak elevator that you don't even
want to hear man hate that song.

2325
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Fuck you song was the shit when it
first came out of fucking ugly fat guy.

2326
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,770
Second Fuck you.

2327
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:06,941
Fuck you.

2328
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,481
And you're like,

2329
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,530
Yay.

2330
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,970
You wanted him to say it?

2331
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:10,321
Yeah.

2332
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,320
Say it dude.

2333
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:16,350
I wonder if you had to pull back on like
certain shows and do the forget you.

2334
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,160
Of course he does.

2335
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:18,551
Really?

2336
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:19,900
Probably all he does now.

2337
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,340
They probably made a deal with them.

2338
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,790
You know they probably bring him new
white women on a regular basis and all he

2339
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:28,470
had the next rage against the
machine on the Christmas special.

2340
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,220
I'd fucking BBC where they going to go?

2341
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:30,611
Okay,

2342
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,810
well you can't say fuck you.

2343
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,120
I won't do what you tell me baby.

2344
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,420
You I won't do what you tell me.

2345
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,360
You won't do what you do.

2346
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,600
They really say that.

2347
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,900
Did you just think of this right now?

2348
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:47,734
Cause that was awesome.

2349
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,241
It is awesome.

2350
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:49,811
Forget you.

2351
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:50,250
I won't.

2352
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,540
Do you remember when the
Beatles got on the Ed?

2353
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:52,771
So,

2354
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:53,381
or excuse me,

2355
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:54,520
the has got on the edge,

2356
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,030
couldn't get much higher risks.

2357
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,331
Gabe,

2358
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,400
you couldn't get much higher.

2359
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,660
Yeah,

2360
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,830
that was a big deal.

2361
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,910
They wanted them to change those lyrics
out and it said it couldn't get much.

2362
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:07,780
Forget you.

2363
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,071
And he did it.

2364
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:12,650
He like in,

2365
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,740
in the movie you got like real close
to the camera when he said it and they

2366
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,350
fucking violated them.

2367
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,890
Yesterday I was singing it on camera.

2368
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,010
I was singing the second

2369
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,040
verse two,

2370
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,630
uh,

2371
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,020
we,

2372
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,300
she swallowed it old Nwa.

2373
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,860
[inaudible]

2374
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,170
sing it.

2375
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,003
The lip.

2376
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:37,840
Sorry.

2377
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,010
You could easily be one or two.

2378
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,000
You could be a standing up,

2379
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:41,843
forget you.

2380
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,990
Nonstop tagging.

2381
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,430
So I was singing along to the
second verse and it was a lot,

2382
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:49,750
you know,

2383
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,990
there was some people around and I
would just sing and there was a Lotta,

2384
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,760
a Lotta n word in there and you were
singing it and there were black people in

2385
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:58,630
the car when the hall,

2386
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:58,931
no,

2387
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,190
but it did feel wrong.

2388
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,240
It fell uncomfortable.

2389
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,430
And I you singing that song?

2390
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:03,970
That sounded good.

2391
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,740
I love that song.

2392
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,340
You really,

2393
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,180
she swallowed it.

2394
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,350
That's one of the songs and
seriously is one of the greatest.

2395
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:16,990
It was like it was pretty
cool when I was 15 yeah,

2396
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:17,501
exactly.

2397
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:18,920
When I went in to hear people.

2398
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:20,591
Yeah.

2399
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:20,880
My,

2400
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,050
I remember listening to it the
first time I ever listened to that,

2401
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:23,291
sorry.

2402
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:25,840
I was on a treadmill in
revere Massachusetts.

2403
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:26,620
I was at the gym.

2404
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,300
That's funny that you remember exactly
what you doing and where that spot to

2405
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:33,640
absolutely remembered because
I had just recently got,

2406
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:38,640
was a dope ass Walkman cassette
player at the time it was,

2407
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,461
it was the shit.

2408
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,690
It was bright yellow.

2409
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,620
Okay.

2410
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,940
And I was doing my cardio on this fucking
treadmill and I'm on this treadmill

2411
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,630
and I remember listening to
Nwa while I'm chatting him.

2412
01:00:48,631 --> 01:00:49,210
Oh man,

2413
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:49,961
she's fucking guys.

2414
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:51,670
You're seeing some really crazy shit.

2415
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:52,670
You know

2416
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,370
all this is all about being
violent against white people.

2417
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:55,820
Like I'm like,

2418
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,740
what am I supposed to
be entertained by this?

2419
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,570
I was so confused,

2420
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:02,480
but I was like,

2421
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:02,871
what is this?

2422
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:03,391
Come on there.

2423
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:04,161
They're getting there.

2424
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,180
They're criminals.

2425
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:05,961
That's a good thing.

2426
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:07,790
All of a sudden I remembered like,

2427
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:07,971
Yo,

2428
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:09,020
what the fuck is going on?

2429
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:12,550
I remember I can't be this guy because
I'm only 20 I can't be this guy.

2430
01:01:12,551 --> 01:01:12,771
He's going,

2431
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:15,480
what the fuck is going on
with this country country?

2432
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,280
Not yet.

2433
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,210
It was to gain,

2434
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,300
but yet those were the thoughts that
were happening in my mind as I was

2435
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,260
listening to this CD,

2436
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,140
that one I listened to LM Fao,

2437
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:24,670
I do.

2438
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,180
You don't like that sexy song.

2439
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:27,701
I'll tell you what.

2440
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:31,990
I didn't like that sexy song until I saw
the video and I thought that's a fun.

2441
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,420
Do you remember me saying I was in Vegas
and I heard this stupid loop of hurting

2442
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:41,250
them like seven songs.

2443
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,160
He had a bit about that,

2444
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:47,170
a bit about how much I hated that
and then I found out it was an elm.

2445
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,860
Fao had that in like
one of their main songs.

2446
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:52,520
That was Afrojack that
started that whole thing.

2447
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,251
It was not them,

2448
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:53,941
right originally.

2449
01:01:53,941 --> 01:01:54,774
Right,

2450
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:55,420
right.

2451
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,253
Okay.

2452
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:56,880
Yeah,

2453
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,270
but that happened in
music that happens in,

2454
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,360
especially in new,

2455
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,270
see electronic music goes
through these phases.

2456
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:06,630
K The first like notable phase
was the Benny Benassi baseline.

2457
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,523
Okay.

2458
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,490
Bentley,

2459
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:12,210
there's big farty anyone
saw wave right now?

2460
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:12,841
What does that mean?

2461
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:13,440
Who's Benny?

2462
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,121
Benny Benassi.

2463
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:15,750
He's a lovely guy from Italy.

2464
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,040
Awesome.

2465
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,821
Dj Producer.

2466
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:18,541
He did the track,

2467
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:18,751
you know,

2468
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:19,584
I uh,

2469
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,483
satisfaction.

2470
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,870
Have you ever heard that dancy track?

2471
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:26,610
I can't get my satisfaction is
like a rolling stones cover.

2472
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,430
No,

2473
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,780
no,

2474
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:27,961
no,

2475
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:28,171
no.

2476
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:28,831
It wasn't a cover.

2477
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:32,280
It was a complete original and was
like this robotic voices anyway,

2478
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,540
breakout fucking track.

2479
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,100
But it had the signature sound.

2480
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:36,360
Now it's nothing new.

2481
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,220
It wasn't this amazing
breakout technology,

2482
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:43,110
but it's like this just big thick meaty
fuck off like a saw tooth wave that you

2483
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:43,411
hear.

2484
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:43,820
And,

2485
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,091
and,

2486
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:46,110
and he kind of like capitalized on that.

2487
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:47,400
And that was a thing,

2488
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:47,941
you know,

2489
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:48,601
for a while.

2490
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,910
So a lot of other producers
started fucking knocking it off.

2491
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,920
And then what happened was,

2492
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:53,340
you know,

2493
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,290
you had guys like Josh winks
who kind of pioneered the uh,

2494
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,860
the TB three Oh three.

2495
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:00,450
Now this is like some old,

2496
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:00,901
you know,

2497
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:05,190
Japanese baseline instrument that was
supposed to be used as a base simulator.

2498
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,880
And then buddy got the idea to
crank the resonance on it and then,

2499
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:09,240
uh,

2500
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,571
you know,

2501
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:10,970
use it as a sin.

2502
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,630
So it did this doot Doo Dee Dee Dee Dee,

2503
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,160
do you know,

2504
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:13,470
you know,

2505
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,550
they're like the fucking three or three.

2506
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,820
Then everyone started doing right.

2507
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:21,910
So we were like the electronic
music committee or committee group,

2508
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:23,250
you know,

2509
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,320
we're all susceptible
to these kinds of fads.

2510
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:25,821
That happens.

2511
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:29,280
So now that's some good music
history right there though right now.

2512
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,540
Dip Low does this thing.

2513
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:34,740
He comes out with taking like a piece
of vocal and taking just the little

2514
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:39,630
sustain little bit of it and go in that
era and then everyone starts fucking

2515
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:39,961
doing it.

2516
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:40,320
Yeah.

2517
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,650
So there's all of these little
fads that just keep happening.

2518
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,193
Music.

2519
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,370
Yeah.

2520
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,300
I like that.

2521
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,670
That's a constant.

2522
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,100
I can't fucking stand it.

2523
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,880
I hate it.

2524
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,840
I hate it when there are narratives
because then the tracks put your hands up.

2525
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,340
I'll fucking robbery.

2526
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,700
Tell me what the fucking
dude I've robbery.

2527
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:05,690
It's fun.

2528
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,860
I actually liked that shit.

2529
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:07,694
When they really

2530
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,590
love the song comes to
this massive crescendo,

2531
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:15,463
then

2532
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,880
a massive baseline happens.

2533
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:20,840
It's like,

2534
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,150
it's like a bad fucking
porn is what it is.

2535
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:24,650
I'm coming,

2536
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,390
I'm coming.

2537
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,840
Well no fucking shit.

2538
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,350
The door,

2539
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:27,921
I'm coming,

2540
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm coming all over you.

2541
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:29,900
I'm coming all over.

2542
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:31,160
You know we get it.

2543
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,620
Those random voices,

2544
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,860
he feels like he can't stand
watching porn with narratives.

2545
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:37,220
It's like,

2546
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,270
oh you're fucking me.

2547
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,101
Fucking you.

2548
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:40,934
I'm fucking you.

2549
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,670
And then it's like if
you ever seen spinal tap,

2550
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,370
have you seen spinal
tap movie rd puff game.

2551
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,110
That's right.

2552
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,300
That's the only thing that
comes to mind when I hear these.

2553
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,560
Like you know,

2554
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:54,050
obligatory Saifai samples in dance music.

2555
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:56,000
You know high already Popkin my records.

2556
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:59,600

fucking Pauline records already.

2557
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:02,960
Pumpkin polyamory records and then his
name comes up on the screen and says

2558
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:04,430

2559
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:05,264

2561
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:06,261
that is amazing.

2562
01:05:06,261 --> 01:05:07,640
I don't know if they
meant to do that or not,

2563
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:11,920
but it's just so fucking funny cause he
said it like about 15 times taught it

2564
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,530
and then the show his name like
in case you didn't fucking get it,

2565
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:16,623
that's fine.

2566
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,010
That's so they do it in

2567
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,940
porn and they do it in dance music
and they can could ruin porn.

2568
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,210
Oh,

2569
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,170
it totally can they,

2570
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:26,440
cause it's like [inaudible]
this guy and he's like,

2571
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:26,851
Yo,

2572
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:27,960
you're sucking my dick.

2573
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,570
No Shit.

2574
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:35,830
Do they have to fucking do this for
people that might not understand what's

2575
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,664
happening online?

2576
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,440
People,

2577
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,690
well,

2578
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:42,160
so I didn't think about people
masturbating to books on tape.

2579
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,591
Well,

2580
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:45,010
why wouldn't you want to
just a salary as the book?

2581
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,230
Do you know there's,

2582
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,230
there's websites where that narrate
a porn videos just for nine people.

2583
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,590
It's just like he's approaching,

2584
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:55,840
coming outside,

2585
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,341
pulling down his pants,

2586
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:58,350
his caucus philosophy.

2587
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,140
Uh,

2588
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,100
he's got a big helmet,

2589
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,920
verbal and it's seriously good.

2590
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:03,790
Or they're really descriptive.

2591
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,391
Like proletics.

2592
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:04,631
Yeah,

2593
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,100
it's weird because it's a

2594
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:09,963
here

2595
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:12,600
man.

2596
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,190
Come on,

2597
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,110
see if he could pull that up.

2598
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:14,944
That's brilliant,

2599
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:15,800
Dan.

2600
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,633
We need to hear that.

2601
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,850
I think people have different things.

2602
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:23,600
Some people like watching
other people fuck.

2603
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:24,850
And some people like watching porn,

2604
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:25,684
pretending it's them,

2605
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,681
you know,

2606
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:26,941
look,

2607
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,310
you're like,

2608
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:27,611
oh,

2609
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:28,211
that could be made.

2610
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,044
That could be made.

2611
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,333
You know,

2612
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,740
some people like it's like,

2613
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,690
like a being as a person,

2614
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,800
being the person,

2615
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:37,360
like actually just beating off,

2616
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:37,991
watching people.

2617
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:38,350
Fuck.

2618
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,360
It's like two totally
different mindsets for me.

2619
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,160
It's just looking at the naked girl.

2620
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,691
That's for me.

2621
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:44,380
But I mean,

2622
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,670
I don't know why I'm looking at that.

2623
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:46,504
I'm looking at the leg,

2624
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,290
I'm like,

2625
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,123
that looks good.

2626
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,780
I'm totally down with that.

2627
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:52,270
But I have to put myself in a
completely different mindset.

2628
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
If it's a black guy,

2629
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,700
it's a black guy,

2630
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:55,570
fucking a white girl.

2631
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:55,931
I have to go,

2632
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:56,171
okay,

2633
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:57,800
this is clearly not really mate.

2634
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:05,020
I can't even pretend this is some
weird poor when I had my blonde wig on,

2635
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,000
forgetting you so hard.

2636
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:08,650
I'm forgetting you so hard right now.

2637
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,580
Lion's mane wig for while

2638
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,710
we're watching people.

2639
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:19,450

2640
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:20,290
Fuck white girls.

2641
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:20,741

2666
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,800
Here's pillow.

2667
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:19,850
A psychological benefit.

2668
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,110
This is Joshua here at porn for the blind.

2669
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:24,680
Dot.

2670
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,490
Or homeless.

2671
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,300
Oh my God,

2672
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,300
you are am presented with a clip to
his voice showing a woman in a glass of

2673
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,080
white substances and

2674
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,420
fired.

2675
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,253
You're fired.

2676
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,970
Get scrolled down the page and
find myself another audition today.

2677
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,230
Wish me luck quick.

2678
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:46,203
Come on.

2679
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,050
No wait.

2680
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:48,621
All right.

2681
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:53,621
The video is starting with a woman who
is young and attractive and Tan laying

2682
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:57,500
back on a bed.

2683
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,363
And

2684
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,110
what just happened is this is fucked.

2685
01:09:05,111 --> 01:09:05,944
This is bullshit.

2686
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:06,813
This fitting.

2687
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:12,520
Nope.

2688
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:12,971
Hey We,

2689
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:13,660
let me explain.

2690
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,990
This is a community based website and
if you look at the screen right now,

2691
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:20,350
there's a whole bunch of them
that people put on there.

2692
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:21,850
So some of them definitely are fake,

2693
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:22,810
but some of them are.

2694
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:23,763
I've listened to it.

2695
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,310
Well that guy,

2696
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,660
that one guy was clearly
trying to be an asshole.

2697
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,653
Right.

2698
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,000
You can tell just by
the way he was talking,

2699
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:34,271
you know,

2700
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:34,480
like,

2701
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:34,961
you know what,

2702
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:37,380
it would have been just as funny
if he would've just kept the act,

2703
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,343
right?

2704
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:38,920
Yeah,

2705
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,540
exactly.

2706
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,520
If you want to do,

2707
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,860
if you're going to do a porn for the
blind and describe someone fucking man,

2708
01:09:43,861 --> 01:09:44,880
you better stop horny.

2709
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,190
There's people just hate blind,

2710
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:46,560
you know,

2711
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,311
you can't be like,

2712
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:49,230
well she's taking out his cock.

2713
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:49,771
You know,

2714
01:09:49,771 --> 01:09:51,120
it's not like a special thing.

2715
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,180
This guy's not excited.

2716
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,053
I got an offer from,

2717
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,170
would they lie also with
like kind of just like,

2718
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,043
you know,

2719
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,381
I mean,

2720
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:58,041
cause it's like phone,

2721
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:58,311
sex,

2722
01:09:58,311 --> 01:09:58,581
right?

2723
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,530
So you're on a phone with like some chick,

2724
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,460
you don't know what she looks like.

2725
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:03,740
Of course she was saying she's
all this and she's all that.

2726
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:03,951
So,

2727
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,630
but they kind of just fudge in sub shit.

2728
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,880
Our good friend of Maryland Martinez,

2729
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:08,881
we uh,

2730
01:10:08,881 --> 01:10:10,380
she passed away recently.

2731
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,460
We'd love her to death.

2732
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,420
She was awesome.

2733
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,440
Great comedian.

2734
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,930
Really funny lady that used to
hang around the comedy store.

2735
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,490
She was a phone sex operator and
she was probably five feet tall.

2736
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,130
Yeah.

2737
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:25,280
She's maybe like legitimately phone shoes.

2738
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:25,921
Yeah.

2739
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,330
And she was a big woman.

2740
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:28,920
She was really big.

2741
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:29,611
I knew her.

2742
01:10:29,611 --> 01:10:30,570
I just didn't know she was,

2743
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,370
she was really unhealthy and that she was,

2744
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,293
she was big.

2745
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,180
She,

2746
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,013
yeah,

2747
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,390
she was doing false sex.

2748
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,510
She would come and talk
about it at the comedy store.

2749
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:40,710
It was hilarious.

2750
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,660
He would have been a great TV show.

2751
01:10:42,661 --> 01:10:43,710
She was alive today.

2752
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,800
It would've been a great TV show cause
she was hilarious and she was great in

2753
01:10:46,801 --> 01:10:49,230
describing all these fucking
freaks that would call her up.

2754
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,591
Yeah.

2755
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:50,640
Like toes and my ass.

2756
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,421
Oh baby.

2757
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:54,180
I got my toe in your
ass right now and yeah,

2758
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:54,761

2759
01:10:54,761 --> 01:10:54,871
Yeah.

2760
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:58,200
I look like I'm like fucking
Tozier ass if she would go,

2761
01:10:58,201 --> 01:10:58,711
oh yeah,

2762
01:10:58,711 --> 01:10:59,790
these sick fucks.

2763
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:00,360
They just,

2764
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,650
they want to hear all kinds of shit.

2765
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:03,420
I gave it to an important recently,

2766
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,340
Lauren out there on somewhere.com,

2767
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:10,830
uh,

2768
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:11,101
with,

2769
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:11,400
uh,

2770
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,990
a guy at a mouse head on a chick.

2771
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,040
Oh,

2772
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,330
I shit you not.

2773
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:15,750
Oh,

2774
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,321
that's awesome.

2775
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:17,010
That's weird.

2776
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,660
And I get that asked all
the time and it was like,

2777
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:18,831
oh,

2778
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:19,010
would you,

2779
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,570
what would you do with check somewhere?

2780
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:22,800
I wouldn't,

2781
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,960
somewhere down the line prosthetics,

2782
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,130
somewhere down the line of process is
going to get so good that you're going to

2783
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,441
have to,

2784
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:31,560
you're gonna be able to watch
like JFK fucking Marilyn Monroe.

2785
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,930
I'm kind of scared about this shit.

2786
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,920
I really am not,

2787
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:35,131
not,

2788
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:35,601
not like,

2789
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:35,880
uh,

2790
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,360
in terms of fucking dude in a
fucking mouse hat or whatever.

2791
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,620
But I think about it,

2792
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,281
you know,

2793
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:43,620
where people are getting convicted on,

2794
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,040
you know,

2795
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:48,120
CCTV footage or doing shit like that with
today's like CG artists and shit like

2796
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:48,690
that.

2797
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:48,871
Oh,

2798
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,710
it's absolutely true.

2799
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,110
We could fuck a dude up.

2800
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,680
Do you remember rat wag the dog?

2801
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,570
Remember that Dustin Hoffman movie?

2802
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:55,320
I haven't seen that.

2803
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,490
It was a movie about a,

2804
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:57,091
they were the,

2805
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:58,440
they faked some,

2806
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:01,020
some military action and
it was a political movie.

2807
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,273
And it was a,

2808
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,661
you know,

2809
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:04,290
a lot of it was special effects they use.

2810
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,570
They brought in Hollywood
guys and I was thinking,

2811
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:06,841
you know,

2812
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:07,411
today,

2813
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:07,751
God,

2814
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:08,940
it would be so easy.

2815
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,341
It really,

2816
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:11,460
really is so easy to fake something.

2817
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,490
Be So easy.

2818
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,950
Isn't that fucking
scare the shit out here?

2819
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:15,390
A little bit terrifying.

2820
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,020
It's terrifying thinking that they
restrict dubbing my shit right now with me

2821
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:19,854
hours.

2822
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:20,933
What do you mean?

2823
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,233
Oh yeah,

2824
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,231
like fuck.

2825
01:12:24,231 --> 01:12:29,030
You know it's not hard to do a
recent law passed by Congress.

2826
01:12:29,031 --> 01:12:32,930
It's going to have hundreds of
thousands of drones in the sky.

2827
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,920
Did or the thought more than something
like more than 30 million people.

2828
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,570
Have you been fucking
put him in orbit cameras,

2829
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:47,420
cameras in the sky to watch over the seat,

2830
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,283
the city streets.

2831
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,211
The idea is,

2832
01:12:50,211 --> 01:12:51,044
hey man,

2833
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,520
if you're not doing anything bad,

2834
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,530
but what if you trying to
fuck in an alleyway somewhere?

2835
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,180
What if you're with your
girl and you just like,

2836
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,170
come on you dirty bitch.

2837
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,820
Someone's going to see,

2838
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,271
you're like,

2839
01:12:59,271 --> 01:12:59,980
shut up.

2840
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,400
I was going to say come on baby,

2841
01:13:01,401 --> 01:13:02,150
and I was going to say,

2842
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,451
okay,

2843
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:03,141
quick be quick,

2844
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:03,974
be quick.

2845
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,670
And now you're on.

2846
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:07,550
You're on the government's
fucking video because of that,

2847
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,260
because there's a little
spaceship in the sky.

2848
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,221
It's Erica there.

2849
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:11,120
This is the government.

2850
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:12,500
We've seen your,

2851
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,580
your boys bull shit.

2852
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:17,220
I think they have larger agendas you

2853
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,460
think,

2854
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,293
but

2855
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:22,041
you would think,

2856
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:26,270
but 28 high school kids got
arrested recently because
they hired cops to pretend

2857
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,830
to be undercover.

2858
01:13:27,831 --> 01:13:29,390
They pretend to be high school kids.

2859
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,920
It was like 21 fucking jump street,

2860
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,220
but just hanging around
or try and push it.

2861
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,040
Trying to buy weed.

2862
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,040
Oh that's [inaudible] 28 high school
kids arrested in Florida for weed because

2863
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,030
cops pretended to be high school.

2864
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:43,850
You would think that they
would use the resources wisely,

2865
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:46,580
but if they could get you
for sexual exposure outside,

2866
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:46,910
you know,

2867
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:47,750
especially by the way,

2868
01:13:47,751 --> 01:13:49,040
if you're anywhere near a school,

2869
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,440
if you were within a certain
amount of yards of a school,

2870
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:53,390
even that's all of a sudden
you're a sexual predator.

2871
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:54,021
You know?

2872
01:13:54,021 --> 01:13:56,930
Like if you take a leak outside
of a a children's school,

2873
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,473
you do

2874
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,310
crazy drifter.

2875
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,150
If you're an idiot,

2876
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:05,020
you don't know any better.

2877
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,410
You can't find a bathroom

2878
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,640
walk around the back of the bathroom.

2879
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:10,301
There's no bathroom.

2880
01:14:10,301 --> 01:14:11,350
Women will just piss on wall.

2881
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:11,590
All right,

2882
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,060
so last night for that.

2883
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,260
If they arrest you for that,

2884
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:16,190
you're a sexual Predator will.

2885
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,570
Yeah.

2886
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:18,281
A lot of places.

2887
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:23,281
If you're in a park that's got to
be showing up around the house,

2888
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:23,651
you know,

2889
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:24,880
like don't piss the nearest school.

2890
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:26,560
What's really crazy is when you get

2891
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,220
fucking branded really tome pies.

2892
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:32,720
Cool,

2893
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,370
dude,

2894
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:36,310
we should be rebels and tonight and
just go PA school just to do it.

2895
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,900
I'm not doing it do,

2896
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:39,370
especially after we talked
about on the Internet.

2897
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,650
The government is going to know
they're gonna have the droves out.

2898
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,810
By the time they're telling
you that there's drones,

2899
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:47,810
there's fucking dirty bin drones here
to be placed on this on a daily base.

2900
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:49,890
Damn it.

2901
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:50,431
What is it called?

2902
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:52,210
The time they talk about cloning,

2903
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,880
while we're going to try calling the
guy telling you is probably a clone.

2904
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,140
There've been clawing forever.

2905
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:59,320
There's no way they're going to tell you
the common person when they're ready to

2906
01:14:59,321 --> 01:14:59,951
clone people.

2907
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:00,220
They'll,

2908
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,530
they'll make all sorts of experiments
before we let people know.

2909
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,720
They probably already have.

2910
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,613
Absolutely.

2911
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:10,900
I mean if they thought that they could
make an army of psychotic fucking robot

2912
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:14,750
flesh people if they thought they could
clone you and take out all your morality

2913
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:18,463
was the

2914
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,653
first attempt,

2915
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,510
how much money would they make?

2916
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:26,830
If they just call it hot bitches and
they just fucking sell flood the market,

2917
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:27,664
we can't do that.

2918
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,503
The real money,

2919
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,130
then it'd be different.

2920
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:34,720
Didn't the ugly peer personally valued
money would really be and killing them

2921
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:38,530
off and getting a small
number of them like pearls.

2922
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,700
Would that be true if they,

2923
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,050
if they cloned all hot,

2924
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:41,761
like hot grow,

2925
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:45,040
so it was like hot girl was more
than ugly girl with the ugly girl.

2926
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:45,830
Be The hot girl.

2927
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,340
Actually she would because
she would rent that one.

2928
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,650
She'd be a lower collectible.

2929
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,800
[inaudible] got this limited
bucking edition one offs and smells.

2930
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,060
It's Swartz and Eggers nanny

2931
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,000
for line addition.

2932
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,140
They did it in Sweden.

2933
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:09,610
That's where the slug in the ditch
came from is I have an overdub of a him

2934
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:09,940
Chang,

2935
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,250
you son of a bitch and say you're slugging
a ditch and the whole thing was off

2936
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,610
and that was Arnold.

2937
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,160
What was I saying?

2938
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,580
I don't know.

2939
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,413
Cloning.

2940
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,280
We're running into each other a lot here.

2941
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:23,114
They don't have enough time.

2942
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,440
But when you,

2943
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:27,610
when you get marijuana and alcohol
together in one row and everybody saw that

2944
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:28,453
shit.

2945
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:29,600
Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice.

2946
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:30,580
Yeah,

2947
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:30,901
but that,

2948
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:31,820
that was an interjection.

2949
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:32,720
That wasn't in the discussion.

2950
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,140
I forgot.

2951
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,580
We were talking about cloning hot chicks.

2952
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:36,181
Yeah,

2953
01:16:36,181 --> 01:16:37,920
well I will say that Sweden,

2954
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:38,780
they did that.

2955
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,730
Why do you gen x?

2956
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,580
They actually let,

2957
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:44,990
they would for 30 40 50 years.

2958
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,130
This is where the Nazis got
all their shit in Sweden.

2959
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:50,640
That's why all the hot chicks come
from Sweden and good looking dudes too.

2960
01:16:50,641 --> 01:16:51,540
If you'd like that shit.

2961
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,190
They all come from Sweden,

2962
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:54,143
Swedish house.

2963
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,210
There's a lot of hot chicks
from all over the world,

2964
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:57,480
but I'm,

2965
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,141
I know what you're saying.

2966
01:16:58,141 --> 01:16:58,974
There's a large,

2967
01:16:59,700 --> 01:16:59,800
yeah,

2968
01:16:59,800 --> 01:16:59,970
this

2969
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:04,780
was Sweden was all about what's best for
the country and they thought that based

2970
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:06,400
on the symmetry of your face,

2971
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,810
whether you're or not,

2972
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,890
they should reproduce.

2973
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,250
So if you had a baby,

2974
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,470
they will look at the baby
and they would analyze it.

2975
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:15,590
Scientists make sure everything
is 300 and take it to the clinic.

2976
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:20,270
They would sterilize the baby
if she wasn't perfect symmetry.

2977
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:21,740
When did this happen?

2978
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,880
This is real shit.

2979
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:23,480
Eugenics.

2980
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,760
This is where the Nazis got
all their shit from Sweden,

2981
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:26,060
man,

2982
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,470
this look into it son.

2983
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:28,304
It's crazy.

2984
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,000
That's why all the good
looking people like you go to,

2985
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,750
how long are they engineer this for?

2986
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,620
It was something like it
was part of their country.

2987
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:41,621
They convince the entire nation that
the country was above you personally.

2988
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:43,850
So when you had a baby,

2989
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:47,690
the scientists analyze the
baby and if it was perfect,

2990
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,790
they would let it breed.

2991
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:52,040
Someone's writing some script as we speak.

2992
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,340
You,

2993
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,280
you've never heard of this.

2994
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,200
This is real.

2995
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:55,034
They really,

2996
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,230
this is good.

2997
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,153
I mean,

2998
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,510
I mean I got a lot of free time,

2999
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:00,890
but man in Sweden,

3000
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:02,000
there's a lot of good looking people.

3001
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:02,310
Man.

3002
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,460
I've been there like three times
and every five minutes here,

3003
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,290
five years or every five minutes.

3004
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,780
That was the timing that I thought
because everywhere I would look,

3005
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:12,050
I would,

3006
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,210
I was going to try and
explain it to my friends.

3007
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:14,481
I'm like,

3008
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,650
the only way you can explain it,

3009
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,360
I want to average every five
minutes to see a supermodel.

3010
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,030
You're like,

3011
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,470
it's you go to Mcdonald's at all.

3012
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,100
Amazing.

3013
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:27,510
Sweden's government said on Wednesday
that it had commissioned a study into why

3014
01:18:27,511 --> 01:18:32,310
eugenics was involved in the country in
the 19th and 20th centuries leading to

3015
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:35,700
tens of thousands being
sterilized by force.

3016
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:39,390
I told Jermaine sterilize being
a euphemistic term for just

3017
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,473
killing it,

3018
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,373
sterilized,

3019
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:42,813
sterilized.

3020
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,690
They have a clip your balls
man and the bolt on your

3021
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,133
ovaries.

3022
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,350
Think about why they did it
based on the shape of your face.

3023
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,820
They thought based on the symmetry of
your face that like you had good genes,

3024
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,600
you are ugly,

3025
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,740
you are not producing.

3026
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:03,970
That's the way it was

3027
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,741
incredible.

3028
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:05,161
Listen to this.

3029
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:09,000
A fundamental aim is to find out what
the society that had developed this

3030
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:11,130
eugenics mentality and established,

3031
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,590
accepted scientific research in the area,

3032
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:16,560
look like the Swedish
minister and above blah,

3033
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:16,700
blah,

3034
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:16,861
blah.

3035
01:19:16,861 --> 01:19:17,700
Said in a statement,

3036
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,580
and this is the social
philosophy of Eugenics,

3037
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:24,390
which advocates the improvement of
human hereditary traits through social

3038
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:28,980
intervention developed in Sweden and
elsewhere in Europe during the 18 hundreds

3039
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:32,850
before becoming the basis for widespread
racial policies in the 20th century.

3040
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,330
That's fucking incredible.

3041
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:37,710
So that's why most extreme form
is [inaudible] is so good looking,

3042
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:37,890
man.

3043
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:38,311
Well that's,

3044
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:38,730
you know,

3045
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,700
the were the worst thing anyone has
ever said was Hitler had a great idea,

3046
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:42,690
but it just took it too far.

3047
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,180
It's like the worst thing
that anybody ever said.

3048
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:44,460
And it's like,

3049
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:44,790
well,

3050
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:45,571
it's one of the things we,

3051
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:45,871
you go,

3052
01:19:45,871 --> 01:19:46,071
Whoa,

3053
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:46,301
Whoa,

3054
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:46,381
whoa.

3055
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,530
You can't fucking say it can't even,

3056
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,340
you can't accept any of his ideas.

3057
01:19:50,341 --> 01:19:51,270
It's Hitler.

3058
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,250
But this is what they're saying.

3059
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:57,240
They're saying like this idea that human
beings had to realize that people live

3060
01:19:57,241 --> 01:20:00,570
and people die and the right way to
move the species forward is to get the

3061
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:01,050
basketball.

3062
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:04,500
You have to remember at the time
when that was employed to the,

3063
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,490
the ignorance

3064
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,160
they'd be going around and there wasn't

3065
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,690
the communication available.

3066
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:09,961
Like,

3067
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:10,141
you know,

3068
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:13,170
the Internet and the politics were
obviously way up for fucking scoop.

3069
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,330
They don't understand is
the right and they're wrong.

3070
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,670
But at the same time they're there,

3071
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,450
right as a mathematical program.

3072
01:20:18,451 --> 01:20:20,040
They're wrong as a species.

3073
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,940
The species,

3074
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,460
the marriage should be to whatever the,

3075
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:25,350
the rest of the species fines,

3076
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:25,861
you know,

3077
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:28,020
a attractive fines would.

3078
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,580
They're drawn to whatever they like,

3079
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:30,180
whatever the,

3080
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,460
whether it's blonde hair and blue eyes,

3081
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,370
whatever the area is we're
doing or one of the very,

3082
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,610
very few species that even fucking
take that into consideration.

3083
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,210
Whereas,

3084
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:38,520
you know,

3085
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,190
other species in the
animal fucking kingdom,

3086
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,053
we just let it,

3087
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:41,940
let it go.

3088
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,151
Yeah,

3089
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:42,511
whatever.

3090
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:42,751
Fuck.

3091
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:43,231
Exactly.

3092
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:44,760
The idea that we want to engineer it,

3093
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:45,594
it's nonsense.

3094
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:45,931
It's,

3095
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:48,870
to me it's a massive
form of control freak is.

3096
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:49,320
Um,

3097
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,730
but it's based on science.

3098
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,810
They're trying to make like the
genetically the perfect species.

3099
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,300
But I say that's ridiculous
cause it's not about that.

3100
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:57,901
It's not,

3101
01:20:57,901 --> 01:20:59,880
it's not about like what looks the best,

3102
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:01,200
what's the most sexually attracted?

3103
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:01,530
What,

3104
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,363
what has the best,

3105
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,290
a lot of it is about the brain.

3106
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:08,850
A lot of it is about the mind and the
mind's reaction to all the experiences of

3107
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:12,210
life and how the mind
develops and the mind of a,

3108
01:21:12,211 --> 01:21:13,320
a Geek,

3109
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:13,921
you know,

3110
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:16,100
what are you going to engineer
all the geeks out engineer?

3111
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,160
Y'All fucking inherit the Earth Day.

3112
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,130
But they're there.

3113
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:20,910
They're on,

3114
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,560
they're on the computer level.

3115
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:22,820
They're,

3116
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,031
they're,

3117
01:21:23,031 --> 01:21:23,300
uh,

3118
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:23,540
uh,

3119
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,020
attacking in the mental form.

3120
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,710
The idea that you've got to eliminate
the most progressive aspect of society.

3121
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:33,860
The people that are the people that
are fluent in computer technology and

3122
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,940
creating infrastructure that this whole
fucking internet runs on the idea that

3123
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,200
you're going to eliminate them.

3124
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:43,080
It's this silly that's so short sighted.

3125
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,183
It's so stupid.

3126
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,110
Be Like idiocracy.

3127
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:46,410
Yeah.

3128
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:46,891
Well you've,

3129
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:47,110
I'm,

3130
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,020
you've engineered yourself into a corner.

3131
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:49,111
We,

3132
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:50,190
you think that you,

3133
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:50,850
because,

3134
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,620
because you're attracted to broad cheeks,

3135
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:53,760
like that's what everybody needs.

3136
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,733
That's right.

3137
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,370
If that was true of eugenics was true,

3138
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:58,650
maybe on a physical
sense is pure physical,

3139
01:21:58,651 --> 01:21:59,484
not emotional,

3140
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:03,070
intellectual for a worker it
would be good for sex work.

3141
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,170
Do I get a piss break?

3142
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,900
It would mean to go through that door.

3143
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:07,291
There's a,

3144
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:08,400
the last door on the left.

3145
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,151
Think about,

3146
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:11,190
I like that you're still
rocking the wallet chain.

3147
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:12,240
Iraq one as well.

3148
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:12,661
This one,

3149
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,530
today's leather,

3150
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:13,911
but a lot,

3151
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,300
oftentimes the worst steel.

3152
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,040
Nice man.

3153
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,370
It's my girlfriend shitting in their,

3154
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:18,204
just pee on her.

3155
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:20,843
Now we're talking,

3156
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,481
by the way,

3157
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,940
I got to talk about this because Eddie
and I were talking about this on the way

3158
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:24,774
over.

3159
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,100
Uh,

3160
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,580
there's an article on some Internet.

3161
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,450
What's wrong?

3162
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,283
Is she coming back then?

3163
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:29,841
She's not really,

3164
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:30,661
I think she's in the bathroom.

3165
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:31,370
You should really in there.

3166
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:31,860
I think so.

3167
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,131
Don't,

3168
01:22:32,131 --> 01:22:32,430
don't,

3169
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,263
don't wait.

3170
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:33,900
I'll wait.

3171
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,460
What a man holding a gentlemen.

3172
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:36,300
Hold it.

3173
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,840
We were talking about this as home
article about some porn star who made,

3174
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:43,250
apparently she made $1 million going to
the Middle East and having sex with like

3175
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,190
really rich guys,

3176
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:47,220
the wall royal guys and she,

3177
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:47,491
you know,

3178
01:22:47,491 --> 01:22:49,860
she talked about it and she
had like this online interview,

3179
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:52,710
which is talking about all the different
crazy shit they would rake her,

3180
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:54,960
do like have sex with German shepherds,

3181
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:56,160
drink a glass of calm.

3182
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,240
And one of them was,

3183
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,250
they showed up pretty all showed up.

3184
01:22:59,251 --> 01:23:01,080
This is so crazy cause
I just read this today.

3185
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:01,381
They,

3186
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:01,601
she,

3187
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:01,930
she said,

3188
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,320
she said they showed up and you know,

3189
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,770
they said it was supposed to be really,

3190
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,070
they didn't know what

3191
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,880
the fuck that meant.

3192
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,091
You know,

3193
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:07,421
she's like,

3194
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:08,141
I've seen it all.

3195
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:09,040
When they go on a,

3196
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:09,761
they're on a boat,

3197
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:10,630
they will show up on a yacht.

3198
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,360
There's all these dudes are
like 50 you know the dude's say,

3199
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:13,601
all right,

3200
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:14,321
take your clothes off.

3201
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:15,220
Start playing with yourself.

3202
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,121
So they all say,

3203
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:16,841
all right cool.

3204
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:20,680
And then guys come along and start pissing
on them and they want him to open up

3205
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:21,570
their mouth and went to,

3206
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,720
I want to piss their mouth.

3207
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:24,310
They started shitting on girls like,

3208
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,173
and the girls were,

3209
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,500
some of the girls screamed like,

3210
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,320
fuck this.

3211
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:27,701
Like are you,

3212
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:28,750
you're not going to get paid.

3213
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,340
You can go over there and
sit and wait until we,

3214
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:30,531
you know,

3215
01:23:30,531 --> 01:23:31,364
pulling the doc,

3216
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,560
this is what we do.

3217
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,581
And so that's what they do.

3218
01:23:33,581 --> 01:23:36,580
That's where their homework and they pay
these people a fuck load of money and

3219
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,100
just piss on him and shit on them.

3220
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:38,921
It's like,

3221
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:39,521
wow,

3222
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:40,990
you've got to consider the health risk.

3223
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:41,250
Yeah,

3224
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,550
that's gotta be expensive.

3225
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:42,791
Well,

3226
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,270
the urine is the Zeros,

3227
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,113
Neil risk,

3228
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,180
but a shit.

3229
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:47,080
There's a high risk

3230
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,320
you're in.

3231
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,560
You can drape people's person.

3232
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:51,160
That's really good.

3233
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:51,511
No,

3234
01:23:51,511 --> 01:23:51,800
she's like,

3235
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,620
you got to pay a bitch to shit on her.

3236
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,570
That's crazy.

3237
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:56,530
Thousand Dollars.

3238
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,550
That's just not going to happen.

3239
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:58,590
Crazy thing.

3240
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,850
What of the girls said,

3241
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,490
one of the girls who was in there said
that after you get shit on the third

3242
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:03,270
time,

3243
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:04,410
it's like no big deal.

3244
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:11,110
Like she remembers like when she became
numb third time I would think it would

3245
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,280
some trillionaire shit on her chest.

3246
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,060
You've got to pay a bitch at these.

3247
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,250
She's got to be thinking like,

3248
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:17,730
you know,

3249
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,500
1520 grand cash.

3250
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,590
This girl said was that in the
article with this girl said,

3251
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:23,880
was that after uh,

3252
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,220
whatever she's done over
there for how long she did it.

3253
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:31,170
She had $1 million in the bank and she
was retiring to the million dollars cash

3254
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:34,160
and she was done and she was like
28 years old or something like that.

3255
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:34,381
I'm like,

3256
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:34,950
wow.

3257
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,620
But she was like super honest about all
the different shit they forced her to

3258
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:37,831
do.

3259
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:38,280
And I was like,

3260
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,210
whoa.

3261
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:39,721
You know,

3262
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:40,411
she thought she had,

3263
01:24:40,411 --> 01:24:40,710
you know,

3264
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,730
doing porn and stuff.

3265
01:24:41,731 --> 01:24:44,340
She had like seen it all and she's like,

3266
01:24:44,341 --> 01:24:44,521
you know,

3267
01:24:44,521 --> 01:24:46,560
you can over there and
they're making you fuck dogs.

3268
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,473
Was that

3269
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:52,190
damn fucking dogs must be expensive.

3270
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:54,820
That's going to be the right spot.

3271
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:57,100
A dog run slow.

3272
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,470
I don't know how long this broad

3273
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,540
said she made a million mouses phone.

3274
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,010
If you hear that vibrating,

3275
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:04,363
come on.

3276
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,870
You had all the money in the world.

3277
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:09,231
Damn.

3278
01:25:09,231 --> 01:25:10,940
You might have to just go right big.

3279
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,230
Well you don't tell him about it.

3280
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,590
You can't tell him about it and tell
them about what about the gotta Fuck dogs

3281
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:16,424
until they get there.

3282
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:16,820
Well,

3283
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,653
you know what I was thinking

3284
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,050
they start off with cats,

3285
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:21,053
you know what I'm saying?

3286
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,580
You ease them into the door.

3287
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:24,860
You can't talk about
the dog and the email.

3288
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,650
The dog that quick,

3289
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:31,310
they got to see the money.

3290
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,930
You show them a pile of money,

3291
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,000
stacks of hundreds and
then then the dog comes.

3292
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:38,280
I think what happens is
they get bored heard.

3293
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,390
They get bored and what they
can get these girls to do.

3294
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:41,061
What the fuck did,

3295
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:42,290
I started ranting it up.

3296
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,390
We were talking about really
rich dudes in the Middle East.

3297
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:45,970
Oh,

3298
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:46,803
okay.

3299
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,683
There was a whole,

3300
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,720
there's a whole like thing of
him like a network of them,

3301
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:55,190
but some girl busted it all out because
she got caught with her laptop and then

3302
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:57,770
like the cat was out of the bag and it
turned out that a lot of these girls that

3303
01:25:57,771 --> 01:25:59,750
were going over there
to quote unquote model,

3304
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:03,050
we're actually going over there and
they were like really famous girls.

3305
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,093
You know like you can

3306
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,470
find them on in movies
and TV shows and stuff.

3307
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,750
I think they just have bad management,

3308
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,441
you know what I mean?

3309
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:10,430
Cause if you don't get those,

3310
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,530
like the kind of points defined right.

3311
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:12,861
You know,

3312
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:14,030
no matter what the fuck it is,

3313
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:14,271
you know,

3314
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:15,430
if you're being paid to over there,

3315
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,283
play music,

3316
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:16,881
you know,

3317
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:20,690
I mean I've heard of like prolific
Dj's going out to countries,

3318
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:21,201
you know what I mean?

3319
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:23,360
And then they go and do
the show as commission,

3320
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:24,140
you know what I mean?

3321
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:28,040
But literally in some of these more like
volatile countries and shit like that,

3322
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:28,250
you know,

3323
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,120
they would be like,

3324
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:29,511
dude,

3325
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:32,570
you're going to play this song
and you have to play the song.

3326
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:33,111
And if you don't,

3327
01:26:33,111 --> 01:26:36,140
basically we'll take you out back
and fucking fuck you up big time.

3328
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:36,830
Uh,

3329
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:37,400
what?

3330
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,233
Yeah,

3331
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,350
I've heard of things.

3332
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:40,100
Nudes.

3333
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:40,641
Oh yeah,

3334
01:26:40,641 --> 01:26:40,970
dude.

3335
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:43,070
Even I even have some
fucking horror stories.

3336
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,060
Yeah,

3337
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,860
but what countries are the issues?

3338
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,330
You can't talk about it with me.

3339
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:47,541
No,

3340
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,374
I just,

3341
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,770
no,

3342
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,530
I don't want to just give a heard of
anybody in the country that you can talk

3343
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,420
about a specific country.

3344
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:53,751
No,

3345
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,710
I just don't want to go there.

3346
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:55,850
But I'm just saying,

3347
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:58,520
let's just say at a dodgy country and,

3348
01:26:58,521 --> 01:26:58,970
um,

3349
01:26:58,970 --> 01:26:59,271
you know,

3350
01:26:59,271 --> 01:27:01,320
you're asked to perform
and all this stuff and uh,

3351
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,070
say you're known for something else too.

3352
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:04,350
And they,

3353
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:08,760
and that's not part of what you're Johnny
Walker and they want you to say dyno.

3354
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,101
Exactly.

3355
01:27:10,101 --> 01:27:10,521
You got to say,

3356
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:11,271
you have to do it.

3357
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:12,290
You have to fucking do it.

3358
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,861
You know what I mean?

3359
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:13,431
And they're like,

3360
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:13,731
dude,

3361
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:14,001
you know,

3362
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,230
and then it gets gnarly,

3363
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:15,441
you know,

3364
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:16,071
and you can say,

3365
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:16,341
look,

3366
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:16,641
dude,

3367
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:18,260
this isn't in the order,

3368
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:19,490
the work order kind of thing.

3369
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,001
You know what I mean?

3370
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:20,361
They're like,

3371
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:21,380
we don't give a fuck.

3372
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:21,830
They just,

3373
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,981
hey,

3374
01:27:21,981 --> 01:27:23,060
closed and stuff.

3375
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,840
Yeah,

3376
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:24,381
like that.

3377
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:24,980
You know what I mean?

3378
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,540
I know it's not that bad.

3379
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:27,470
I'd do it anyway,

3380
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:28,790
but you know it like,

3381
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,510
like say that,

3382
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,961
you know what I mean?

3383
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:33,530
If I don't play ghosts and stuff
in the fucking said fuck in place,

3384
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:33,741
you know,

3385
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:34,970
he gets really fucking gnarly.

3386
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,730
You're essentially out
there on your fucking own,

3387
01:27:37,731 --> 01:27:38,331
you know what I mean?

3388
01:27:38,331 --> 01:27:39,620
With you and whoever you're with,

3389
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:40,910
your tour manager and shit like that.

3390
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:44,240
So you don't exactly have a personal
army to fucking back your shit up if

3391
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:44,511
you're,

3392
01:27:44,511 --> 01:27:44,781
you know,

3393
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,980
being threatened to do something.

3394
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:47,450
So sometimes you just say,

3395
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:47,931
you know what,

3396
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:48,471
fuck it.

3397
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:48,830
Do it.

3398
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:49,130
You know,

3399
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,950
because when you start to
get in people's faces about,

3400
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:52,490
Yo dude,

3401
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:52,750
I'm,

3402
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,660
I'm done.

3403
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,110
And the people have like,

3404
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,553
or do they,

3405
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,370
I should say,

3406
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,540
do they try to have,

3407
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,740
when they book you for things?

3408
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,060
Well that's the funny thing.

3409
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,810
There are kind of like two
levels of the whole like,

3410
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:06,530
you know,

3411
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,840
at least with my experience
of being a performer,

3412
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,100
a one is like,

3413
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:11,360
you know the gay for pay,

3414
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:12,711
you know,

3415
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:13,191
you go,

3416
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:14,290
you know what you're getting into,

3417
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,111
you go and you do it,

3418
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:16,460
you just get out and that's it.

3419
01:28:16,461 --> 01:28:17,720
And then the other ones like,

3420
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,291
you know,

3421
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:21,410
you go there and then the rules change,

3422
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:21,951
you know what I mean?

3423
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:23,120
But there's not much like,

3424
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:23,451
you know,

3425
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:24,830
have a dictator.

3426
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:27,320
They are medic mediator
to come in and say,

3427
01:28:27,321 --> 01:28:27,591
you know,

3428
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:28,220
hey look,

3429
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,350
this isn't in this and you know,

3430
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,140
you have to like go above
and beyond and all this shit.

3431
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,370
So you're playing for these people.

3432
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:35,631
You know,

3433
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:36,441
first and foremost,

3434
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:37,430
when I go to play a show,

3435
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:39,110
I'm there for everyone that's there.

3436
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:39,620
You know what I mean?

3437
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,680
I'm not there for the fucking Dickhead
who may be paying me some insane figure

3438
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:43,401
to fucking be there.

3439
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:47,270
But the Dickhead who does pay you some
insane figure to fucking be there is

3440
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:47,690
like,

3441
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:48,523
you know,

3442
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,190
they're like,

3443
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,710
they take that big lump
or whatever and say,

3444
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:55,370
this is my justification for
making you my bitch tonight.

3445
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:56,091
And you know what I mean?

3446
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:58,750
And this is about me and my
company and how we're going to,

3447
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,220
so I've been the show low levels.

3448
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:01,720
Yeah,

3449
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:02,341
exactly.

3450
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:03,174
Or you know,

3451
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:04,710
I was low in high.

3452
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:05,550
Yeah.

3453
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:06,061
We're like,

3454
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:06,360
dude,

3455
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:06,811
well no,

3456
01:29:06,811 --> 01:29:08,490
we just totally paid you to do this.

3457
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:08,991
So we,

3458
01:29:08,991 --> 01:29:09,280
we,

3459
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:09,901
we own you.

3460
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:10,470
But you know,

3461
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,660
as long as you go into the attitudes,

3462
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:11,911
it's like,

3463
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:12,140
look,

3464
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,760
it's like I'm going to go ahead
and go do something extra anyway,

3465
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:16,080
but only because it's like,

3466
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:16,561
shit dude,

3467
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:17,850
I see like the whole first,

3468
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,321
you know,

3469
01:29:18,321 --> 01:29:22,440
in 20 rows of fucking smiley faces and
they're all having fun despite all this

3470
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,870
bullshit that's going on
between me and a promoter,

3471
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:25,530
you know?

3472
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,850
So the thing about,

3473
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:27,090
you know,

3474
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,800
like Djs and shit like that is that,

3475
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,101
you know,

3476
01:29:29,101 --> 01:29:30,060
when they're starting out,

3477
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:31,320
you're always working for someone.

3478
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:31,831
You know what I mean?

3479
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:32,220
Like,

3480
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,030
no matter what,

3481
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:34,020
you're going to a club,

3482
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,570
you're playing for the club owner
because he's the guy that's paying your

3483
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:37,404
fucking bill.

3484
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,130
Um,

3485
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:38,910
and you know,

3486
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,540
hopefully a point where you turn,

3487
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,990
it becomes your production and it's your
crew and it's your production company.

3488
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:46,501
Cause I mean,

3489
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:47,011
like I said,

3490
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:50,010
the signing a deal with live nation was
like the best thing I could have done

3491
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:51,490
for myself because you know,

3492
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:56,780
live nation is huge and I would help
out with do concerts through them.

3493
01:29:57,031 --> 01:29:57,690
They're awesome.

3494
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:58,080
Right?

3495
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:58,321
So,

3496
01:29:58,321 --> 01:29:58,900
but then it no,

3497
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,300
once your show,

3498
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:00,840
you know,

3499
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,260
not,

3500
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,040
not and so and so presents
Joe fucking retro is cool.

3501
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:06,000
The representatives are only,

3502
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,250
and then you can always walk into a show.

3503
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,810
I have a great fucking time emails from
random promoter dudes and I'm like,

3504
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,140
this is

3505
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:15,930
great.

3506
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,820
But it'd be good to be Uber Sketchy.

3507
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:18,830
Pain the ass.

3508
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:19,260
Yeah.

3509
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,140
Had those can't get paid.

3510
01:30:21,141 --> 01:30:22,740
Get to a point to where you can,

3511
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:25,410
you can really know who's cool and not,

3512
01:30:25,411 --> 01:30:25,770
you know,

3513
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:26,640
like I have like,

3514
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,060
you know,

3515
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,370
like a Dream Team of
promoters and you know,

3516
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:30,061
there are many of them,

3517
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:33,240
like maybe 20 or 30 of dudes that
high would even fucking hang with.

3518
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:34,060
You know what I mean?

3519
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,190
In playing for those guys,

3520
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:35,911
it's always fun.

3521
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:36,230
And Greg,

3522
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,650
I've got a bunch of those guys in Canada,

3523
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,810
you'll always get this one fucking dude.

3524
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,681
You know what I mean?

3525
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:42,300
Who just puts in this insane offer?

3526
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:42,961
And of course,

3527
01:30:42,961 --> 01:30:44,370
you know your agencies just like,

3528
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:44,600
yeah,

3529
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:44,970
Foa,

3530
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:45,661
Shit Dude,

3531
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,910
check out this fucking smash and
grab all she has to do with this.

3532
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:49,380
And then you show up and then it's like,

3533
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:49,531
dude,

3534
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:50,490
you're my bitch basically,

3535
01:30:50,491 --> 01:30:51,720
so you have to do this,

3536
01:30:51,721 --> 01:30:54,480
you have to fucking do that and here's
your time slot and I'll give a shit.

3537
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:55,740
You know?

3538
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:56,561
And then you're,

3539
01:30:56,561 --> 01:30:58,020
you're bummed out because of that,

3540
01:30:58,021 --> 01:30:58,501
obviously,

3541
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:01,380
but you're not bummed out because
there are fuck tons of fucking,

3542
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:01,591
you know,

3543
01:31:01,591 --> 01:31:03,500
kids that came to fucking
see you in the fall.

3544
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:06,520
And that's the only thing that really
kind of makes it all worthwhile.

3545
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,580
When you get into a situation like that,

3546
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:09,720
what is the big,

3547
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,200
uh,

3548
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,030
the big toss up over?

3549
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:13,290
Is it the set list?

3550
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:13,980
Is it,

3551
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:14,191
you know,

3552
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:14,720
like I,

3553
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,810
this is my type of music,

3554
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:18,600
this is what the kids want to
hear sometimes it used to be,

3555
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:19,261
you know what I mean?

3556
01:31:19,261 --> 01:31:19,830
Until like,

3557
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,071
you know,

3558
01:31:20,071 --> 01:31:20,401
I Kinda,

3559
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:24,390
I kinda made my own thing and that's
obviously what they're buying in the first

3560
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:24,600
place.

3561
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,190
So they're never going
to question you on that.

3562
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:26,541
But it's,

3563
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:27,480
it's usually,

3564
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,530
you know,

3565
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:32,910
just some kind of time
constraint or something,

3566
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:33,151
you know,

3567
01:31:33,151 --> 01:31:34,740
where they get other acts too,

3568
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:34,981
which,

3569
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:35,340
you know,

3570
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,173
and like I said,

3571
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:36,641
the,

3572
01:31:36,641 --> 01:31:38,150
the funnier it,

3573
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,530
the easier it gets is when you just say,

3574
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:41,040
you know what?

3575
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:41,460
Fuck it.

3576
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:41,760
Let it,

3577
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,110
let everyone do what they want.

3578
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:43,621
You know what I mean?

3579
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:48,150
If fucking DJ super awesome wants to
cut my set by 15 minutes and then,

3580
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:49,050
you know,

3581
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,550
early in your career,

3582
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:51,930
it's always a pissing contest.

3583
01:31:51,931 --> 01:31:52,381
And so it was like,

3584
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:52,591
no,

3585
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:52,771
no,

3586
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:53,341
I'm not doing it.

3587
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,061
If that's not having,

3588
01:31:54,061 --> 01:31:54,960
then I'm not going on.

3589
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:56,100
If they cut me this much,

3590
01:31:56,101 --> 01:31:56,940
I'm not going on.

3591
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:58,200
And then you see it a lot,

3592
01:31:58,710 --> 01:31:59,201
you know what mean?

3593
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:00,640
But then you get to a
point where I was like,

3594
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:01,060
all right,

3595
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,870
let them let them,

3596
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,111
you know,

3597
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:05,260
because you can always
explain this shit and,

3598
01:32:05,261 --> 01:32:05,521
and,

3599
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,900
and one of the beautiful
things I find with my,

3600
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,260
you know,

3601
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,830
horde of fucking fans is that I
can always just tell it how it is.

3602
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:12,580
You know what I mean?

3603
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:14,200
So then after you have the opportunity,

3604
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:15,340
now I always,

3605
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,791
you know,

3606
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:17,920
and I kind of always try to always did,

3607
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:18,521
you know what I mean?

3608
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:18,651
So,

3609
01:32:18,651 --> 01:32:19,630
and then if everyone says,

3610
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:20,230
well dude,

3611
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:20,650
you know,

3612
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:20,890
oh,

3613
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,810
why did you get cancelled at this?

3614
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:23,680
And then I can just say,

3615
01:32:23,681 --> 01:32:25,420
look like you can make a blog entry.

3616
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:25,841
Absolutely.

3617
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:26,351
Explaining yourself.

3618
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:29,030
You don't have to wait for a reporter
to kite and you don't kind of bull shit

3619
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:29,740
anyone.

3620
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:30,240
Yeah.

3621
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:30,911
You know what I mean?

3622
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:32,380
You could just tell her
right there and then it is,

3623
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:32,960
well listen,

3624
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,210
I really apologize,

3625
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:36,550
but it's because of this
is why we couldn't do this.

3626
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:37,480
You know,

3627
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,600
and then the more laid back you
are when it comes to that stuff.

3628
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:41,650
And this was really good advice,

3629
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:42,484
especially for like,

3630
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,330
I don't,

3631
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,390
I don't want to categorize them
but like see list guys that wanted,

3632
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:46,780
you know,

3633
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:50,050
that get put on these massive bills
with like tons of fucking dudes.

3634
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:50,651
You know,

3635
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:53,080
it's just not to be all like super,

3636
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,943
you know,

3637
01:32:55,310 --> 01:33:00,040
lit Tejas and weird and antsy and
just agro in general about you know,

3638
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:02,770
what time you're given because you know,

3639
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,240
the more relaxed you are about it,

3640
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:05,103
you know,

3641
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,400
just get the fucking job done.

3642
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:06,761
Dude.

3643
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:06,881
You're,

3644
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:07,270
you're,

3645
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:09,160
you're mirroring standup comedy.

3646
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:09,730
I mean it's,

3647
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:12,620
it must be the exact
same mentality in the,

3648
01:33:12,621 --> 01:33:16,240
the rising comedian as it is
in the rising electronic Dj.

3649
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:17,290
It's the same story,

3650
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:18,101
the same thing.

3651
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:22,210
You have to listen to people until
everybody's coming to see you and then you

3652
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:23,350
don't have to listen to anybody anymore.

3653
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,753
It's the same thing.

3654
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,800
And then it's just all out and then
it's you and them and not to them

3655
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,000
about third party doing shows
with a gang of other people about,

3656
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:31,181
you know,

3657
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:31,991
your toms your time.

3658
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:32,970
Don't worry about it all that.

3659
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,170
Don't be so locked up and in rigid.

3660
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,380
Let it go and then just go up
when you go up and do your shit.

3661
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:38,571
Yeah.

3662
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:42,350
And if you don't get up and if
something apt epically fucked up so bad,

3663
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,140
you can always just say explain it.

3664
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:44,440
Yeah.

3665
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:44,940
You explain.

3666
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:45,160
Look,

3667
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:49,300
it looked up so bad because total dickhead
brought all this shit and that's what

3668
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:49,840
it was.

3669
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,320
There's a lot of conflict
when acts like tour together.

3670
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,120
The only time I ever toured with anybody,

3671
01:33:55,121 --> 01:33:55,990
I toured with John,

3672
01:33:55,991 --> 01:33:56,231
half,

3673
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:58,560
Ron and Charlie Murphy and one time my,

3674
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:58,990
you know,

3675
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:02,950
we were all doing like different w what
it was was Charlie Murphy was headlining

3676
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:07,270
one night and then I would headline the
next night and no matter what happened,

3677
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:09,370
trolley Murphy never gave a fuck.

3678
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,050
There could be some crazy,

3679
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:15,600
the room could've gone on fire for
half an hour while to learn that.

3680
01:34:15,601 --> 01:34:16,421
That for him.

3681
01:34:16,421 --> 01:34:17,890
No Man for me.

3682
01:34:17,891 --> 01:34:18,250
Yeah,

3683
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:18,821
definitely.

3684
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:19,090
You know,

3685
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:20,810
it took me a while to learn how to relax.

3686
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:21,470
I still don't know it.

3687
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:22,990
I get it and then I lose it.

3688
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,360
It's like sand slipping.

3689
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:24,610
Do I?

3690
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,140
The fingers from a Dj Knick Fan.

3691
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,240
Chuli he just always said to me,

3692
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:31,330
he just would always say the only thing
ever added this guy's fucking mouth,

3693
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,010
which

3694
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:33,000
dude relax.

3695
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:33,571
Yeah,

3696
01:34:33,571 --> 01:34:34,320
he's right.

3697
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:34,561
Yeah,

3698
01:34:34,561 --> 01:34:35,550
he's totally fine.

3699
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:36,384
He's totally right.

3700
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:36,931
You know?

3701
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:37,260
Um,

3702
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,340
it just relax.

3703
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:39,300
If you've done the work,

3704
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:39,811
you know,

3705
01:34:39,811 --> 01:34:40,501
you say relax.

3706
01:34:40,501 --> 01:34:41,011
If you're ready,

3707
01:34:41,011 --> 01:34:41,491
relax.

3708
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:42,211
If you've done the work,

3709
01:34:42,211 --> 01:34:43,170
which you should be,

3710
01:34:43,171 --> 01:34:45,570
you're a fucking professional
and whenever you're doing.

3711
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,310
But yeah,

3712
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:46,451
I,

3713
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:47,251
I kid,

3714
01:34:47,251 --> 01:34:47,791
when I say that,

3715
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:50,250
I don't really have control of it because
I don't ever want to believe that I

3716
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,080
have control of it because
I don't want to sleep.

3717
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:55,680
I don't want to rest on it and let it
creep up on me and burn the house down.

3718
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,490
All right.

3719
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:56,980
You know,

3720
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:57,200
the,

3721
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,330
the human mind's a fairy
fucking tricky thing,

3722
01:34:59,331 --> 01:34:59,571
man.

3723
01:34:59,571 --> 01:35:01,220
It's gotta be kept on pointing,

3724
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,840
always on his tippy toes,

3725
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:03,501
you know?

3726
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,820
But I that,

3727
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:05,790
that feeling of a,

3728
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,930
it's a very frustrating feeling of having
somebody else trying to influence what

3729
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:09,980
the fuck you're trying to do.

3730
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:10,521
You know,

3731
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:10,941
when you're,

3732
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:11,121
uh,

3733
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:11,451
you're,

3734
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:11,720
you're,

3735
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,980
you're coming up as a,

3736
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,750
a digital artist,

3737
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,680
as a comedian,

3738
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:19,880
I think as anything people want to define
you and they have their own ideas and

3739
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:23,060
the same thing that made you not be
a good website designer and be like,

3740
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:23,320
bitch,

3741
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,200
if I want to do it and blue,

3742
01:35:24,201 --> 01:35:25,034
it's going to be blue.

3743
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:26,480
That's like your music,

3744
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:27,260
you know?

3745
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,060
And that's how you have
to be as a comedian too.

3746
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:30,860
I think they're very much the same.

3747
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:31,161
It's like,

3748
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:31,994
in order to,

3749
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,490
to really get your point across,

3750
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:34,770
you,

3751
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,010
you have to all have a solitary vision,

3752
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,143
you know?

3753
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,320
Do you have a crew,

3754
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:39,710
uh,

3755
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:40,340
as far as the,

3756
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:41,540
what we hear from you

3757
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:42,813
musically,

3758
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,831
musically,

3759
01:35:44,831 --> 01:35:47,320
I really liked to kind of
just run the show there,

3760
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:52,000
but I have a crew for the show
who helped me with the visuals,

3761
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:52,631
that technology,

3762
01:35:52,631 --> 01:35:53,650
the cube stuff,

3763
01:35:53,651 --> 01:35:54,700
all the led mouse,

3764
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,950
everything and come up with everything.

3765
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:58,930
And you record everything
and produced musically.

3766
01:35:58,931 --> 01:35:59,764
Yes.

3767
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:00,440
Wow.

3768
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,273
Yeah.

3769
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:01,541
Well,

3770
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:02,051
it's fun,

3771
01:36:02,051 --> 01:36:02,381
you know,

3772
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:02,651
like,

3773
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:05,170
and that's kind of what kind
of got it all started for me.

3774
01:36:05,171 --> 01:36:05,501
You know,

3775
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:05,651
I,

3776
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:07,390
I didn't come out of the gate as a,

3777
01:36:07,391 --> 01:36:07,691
you know,

3778
01:36:07,691 --> 01:36:11,470
the purveyor and awesome play button
pusher of other people's wars stuff,

3779
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:14,050
original music or sampled half and half.

3780
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,351
No,

3781
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:15,020
never sampled.

3782
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,853
That's everything.

3783
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:16,271
Yeah,

3784
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:17,620
I really like to do that.

3785
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,100
Um,

3786
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,150
and just keep it that way.

3787
01:36:19,151 --> 01:36:19,530
Just,

3788
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:20,080
you know,

3789
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,220
obviously for the whole like,

3790
01:36:21,221 --> 01:36:21,401
well,

3791
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:26,401
we don't have to pay out fucking serious
like sync fees or licensing or buying

3792
01:36:27,401 --> 01:36:28,234
the rights to,

3793
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:28,660
you know,

3794
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:31,990
you'd make a derivative work of
something that's already been done.

3795
01:36:31,991 --> 01:36:34,090
That's something I like
really like to avoid.

3796
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,560
So you've never sampled anything?

3797
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:36,300
No.

3798
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:36,880
Yeah,

3799
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,720
I have actually.

3800
01:36:37,721 --> 01:36:38,250
I'm,

3801
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,910
I have sampled a couple things,

3802
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:40,180
uh,

3803
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,130
but they were just like
a little boutique tracks.

3804
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:44,020
It never really went out and made it big.

3805
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:48,430
Are there any samples that you've heard
in your head that you wanted a sample

3806
01:36:48,431 --> 01:36:48,851
but you're like,

3807
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:49,121
fuck,

3808
01:36:49,121 --> 01:36:50,260
it's too much of a headache to,

3809
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:50,860
well,

3810
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,251
it's never,

3811
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:52,720
it's never a headache to do it.

3812
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,310
It's easier to ask for
forgiveness than it is permission.

3813
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:57,763
Really.

3814
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:58,623
What happened?

3815
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:00,660
Business work explained this to me.

3816
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:00,781
Well,

3817
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:03,930
what happens when like Mc Hammer
makes it song like can't touch this.

3818
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,150
Well Dan do as fucking directed.

3819
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:09,200
You can't touch it.

3820
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,760
That's like the ultimate
anti sample right there.

3821
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:15,070
He is at the mash ups.

3822
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,100
Do you enjoy mash up?

3823
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,480
Sold all the answer the question.

3824
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:17,871
Hold on.

3825
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:18,070
What?

3826
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,891
What does that mean?

3827
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:19,641
What happens there?

3828
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:20,474
Who gets the money?

3829
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,930
Who gets the money for MC Hammer remix?

3830
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,360
You can't touch this if I take,

3831
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,240
you can't touch this and
put this into dance track.

3832
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:26,590
No,

3833
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,380
that's not what I'm saying.

3834
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:27,940
What do you say touch.

3835
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:28,910
This is Rick James.

3836
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:30,590
It's she's super free.

3837
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,610
Well he couldn't touch it.

3838
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:32,600
Don't,

3839
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:32,781
no,

3840
01:37:32,781 --> 01:37:32,961
no,

3841
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:33,200
no.

3842
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:36,490
I'm saying that the track
that is that Rick's Jane.

3843
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,210
That's a Rick derivative work.

3844
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:38,901
Completely.

3845
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:39,201
Okay.

3846
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,430
So how has that worked?

3847
01:37:40,431 --> 01:37:41,750
As James gets money,

3848
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,060
there are some laws that would dictate,

3849
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:44,451
you know,

3850
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:49,400
that it's a cover as opposed to a
direct sampling of the recording.

3851
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,940
Now these laws are
still not even close to,

3852
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:53,271
you know,

3853
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:54,320
super defined.

3854
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:55,111
You know,

3855
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:56,280
so it's always the case.

3856
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,170
It's always a musicologist involved.

3857
01:37:58,171 --> 01:38:01,440
And especially with like
vanilla ice is ice ice baby,

3858
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,120
which was the other match.

3859
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:04,950
His,

3860
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:06,690
his whole defense to all that was,

3861
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:11,040
it's not Denon and then
[inaudible] he was like,

3862
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:11,251
no,

3863
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:12,900
it's Dannon and then,

3864
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,920
and then,

3865
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,500
and then,

3866
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,140
and then I'm like,

3867
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:17,850
wow.

3868
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:19,543
Yeah.

3869
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:20,161
You know,

3870
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:22,200
it said there are like certain
things you can get away with.

3871
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:25,260
It used to be like kind of like a
general apply rule where you could say,

3872
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:25,591
okay,

3873
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:26,424
well then fine.

3874
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:30,330
No more than three seconds
should be the rule.

3875
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:31,111
You know what I mean?

3876
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:31,460
And then,

3877
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:35,040
and then it's obviously changed because
people can recreate the exact same thing

3878
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:36,570
just as easily 10 say.

3879
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,010
It's like the constant,

3880
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,491
you know,

3881
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:38,971
like that,

3882
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:39,301
those,

3883
01:38:39,301 --> 01:38:39,601
that,

3884
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:40,800
those songs pissed me off.

3885
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:41,280
That's like,

3886
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,070
you're just making me think
of like some cool old song.

3887
01:38:44,071 --> 01:38:44,904
But I used to like,

3888
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,650
I would still just call it a remax.

3889
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:46,840
Yeah.

3890
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:47,341
You know what I mean?

3891
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:47,920
It's a remix,

3892
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,540
remake,

3893
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:49,141
remix,

3894
01:38:49,141 --> 01:38:49,801
cover,

3895
01:38:49,801 --> 01:38:50,431
all that stuff.

3896
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:55,350
I actually recently did a cover
of a Radiohead Song Codex off,

3897
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:55,510
uh,

3898
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,370
the king of limbs.

3899
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,180
Now,

3900
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:57,510
uh,

3901
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:59,130
the way that I did that is,

3902
01:38:59,131 --> 01:38:59,940
um,

3903
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:00,271
you know,

3904
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:00,511
I,

3905
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:02,130
I'm a huge Radiohead fan,

3906
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:07,430
so I kind of took it as myself as an
exercise to see if I could reproduce it as

3907
01:39:08,311 --> 01:39:09,091
close to as possible.

3908
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:12,600
Minus obviously is fucking amazing vocal
and I share it because I can't sing for

3909
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:13,434
a fuck.

3910
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,100
So,

3911
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:14,610
um,

3912
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:14,971
you know,

3913
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:18,060
I remade his track and
threw it up on soundcloud,

3914
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:18,720
you know,

3915
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,411
just kind of like,

3916
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:19,740
you know,

3917
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,060
with the huge disclaimer saying,

3918
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:21,301
dude,

3919
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:21,811
this is not,

3920
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:22,150
there's,

3921
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,220
this is not a remix.

3922
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:26,090
And I hate to say it,

3923
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:28,380
the whole thing as an artistic
exercise and you know,

3924
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:30,120
I don't plan on monitorizing off that.

3925
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,410
If I actually had planned on anything,

3926
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:32,130
it was just getting,

3927
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:32,400
you know,

3928
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,480
fucking Yo Thom Yorke,

3929
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:34,314
what app?

3930
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:35,610
You know what I mean?

3931
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:35,781
He,

3932
01:39:35,781 --> 01:39:36,120
you know,

3933
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:39,690
so I do a lot of things like that and
I've done it with boards of Canada who are

3934
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:43,590
this like Scottish group that
I like absolutely love and um,

3935
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,011
you know,

3936
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:44,241
and,

3937
01:39:44,241 --> 01:39:44,520
and,

3938
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,670
but as long as I have like,

3939
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:47,971
Hey,

3940
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:48,241
yeah,

3941
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:50,190
this is going to be on my next album,

3942
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,001
check it out at,

3943
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:51,151
no,

3944
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:51,270
no,

3945
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,391
no,

3946
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:51,751
no in,

3947
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:52,051
you know,

3948
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:54,270
in kind of sort of sell
people on the vibe that Oh,

3949
01:39:54,271 --> 01:39:55,560
this is my big thing.

3950
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:59,430
This is original because you know how
many vanilla ice fans fucking I'll be at

3951
01:39:59,431 --> 01:40:02,490
16 to 20 years old and even knew
who their fucking Eurythmics wa,

3952
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,833
you know what I mean?

3953
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:07,510
So that could have been
David Bowie and Mick Jagger,

3954
01:40:07,511 --> 01:40:07,970
wasn't it?

3955
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:10,120
Or under pressure pressure queen,

3956
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:10,391
Queen,

3957
01:40:10,391 --> 01:40:11,020
Queen.

3958
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:11,201
Fuck.

3959
01:40:11,201 --> 01:40:11,351
Yeah,

3960
01:40:11,351 --> 01:40:11,661
that's right.

3961
01:40:11,661 --> 01:40:12,060
That's right.

3962
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:15,220
Your rhythmic and I'm thinking
about sweet dreams and it was queen.

3963
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,230
Yeah.

3964
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:16,450
Yeah.

3965
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:16,960
It's a mate.

3966
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,580
Who the fuck gets the
money for that though?

3967
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:19,733
Wow.

3968
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:22,450
They go to court over
that quarter with it.

3969
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,480
They probably got
permission for the member.

3970
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:25,300
The verve.

3971
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,130
You remember that song is
a bittersweet symphony.

3972
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,950
I apparently they lost all their
money to the rolling stones,

3973
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:32,410
took the music without asking.

3974
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,710
It's very acceptable to sample
music and then just wrap over it.

3975
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:42,070
But no one really is sampled
music and song over it.

3976
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:44,440
We're sampling shit.

3977
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:45,580
Is that what they did?

3978
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,261
They sampled it.

3979
01:40:47,261 --> 01:40:49,150
They just took the rolling stones music.

3980
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,180
It was amazing.

3981
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,013
Either way.

3982
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:51,631

3986
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,050

3987
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:02,201

01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:13,750
You're just going to get that.

3999
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:20,170

4000

He was a fucking grip on it.

4012
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,081
Oh,

4013

4016
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:01,751

4017
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:02,584

4019
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,770
Canadians love Canadians.

4020
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,633
Fuck

4021
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:08,070

God bless him.

4024
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:11,490
You know,

4025
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:13,660
he's not successful and
he's not like wide known,

4026
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:17,050
but he really wants to get into film
and television and gripping and all that

4027
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:17,884
stuff.

4028
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,690
And I didn't even know
he fucking did that.

4029
01:42:19,691 --> 01:42:20,620
And now that you said that,

4030
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:20,920

4033
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,200
Russell Peters is one of the
greatest humans has ever lived.

4034
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,153
I love this guy.

4035
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,630

4036
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,680
Let's keep this half a beer.

4037
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:34,180
My brother drank beer but fuck it.

4038
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:35,103
Come on.

4039
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:37,990
There's any Merona is left.

4040
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,010
Here's one running on.

4041
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:40,571
That's mine.

4042
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:41,800
I don't want my spit bro.

4043
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:42,170

4044
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:42,791
we'll get some more.

4045
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:43,624
We'll get some more for you.

4046
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:43,990
All right.

4047
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:48,300
Give me a list of the bands that
influenced Russell Peters in the

4048
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,263
beginning.

4049
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:53,740
Just real quick.

4050
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:53,980
Yes.

4051
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:54,813
Frozen

4052
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:58,740
there.

4053
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:03,200
My homeboys got a hard head when
he heard you were going to be here.

4054
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:03,690
Oh No.

4055
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:04,523
Hey

4056
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,540
that's breezy.

4057
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,750
Only two black dudes can walk in and
be called Blade and breezy and nobody

4058
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:16,690
freaks out blazing breezy and nobody,

4059
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:17,733
nobody goes.

4060
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,970
Do we lose the uh,

4061
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:19,600
the video?

4062
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,930
I had an epic bike guy
freak out at my house.

4063
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:24,460
I'm doing renovations right now.

4064
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:27,940
So an epic black guy and
it was fucking hilarious.

4065
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:28,470
It was.

4066
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:31,780
He's cause I have about
16 construction workers.

4067
01:43:31,781 --> 01:43:35,070
I'll just kind of in and out of
the house like for the last uh,

4068
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,420
six months cause we were
doing a big renovation.

4069
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:37,840
Right.

4070
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,310
So I don't know any of them.

4071
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:39,580
Right.

4072
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,241
And all this stuff.

4073
01:43:40,241 --> 01:43:41,860
And I'm only home for like two days,

4074
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:42,430
right.

4075
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:45,400
So they start at 9:00 AM but
no one told me this shit.

4076
01:43:45,401 --> 01:43:45,970
Right.

4077
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:50,650
So the biggest fucking black dude
just kind of walks in and uh,

4078
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,280
I don't know what to fucking,

4079
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,930
cause I wasn't expecting anyone,

4080
01:43:53,931 --> 01:43:57,050
but he was like one of the people working
on the studio and stuff like that.

4081
01:43:57,051 --> 01:43:58,550
And I just kind of stopped.

4082
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,451
He didn't knock,

4083
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:01,310
you just kind of busted in like he would,

4084
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,420
cause I wasn't there,

4085
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:07,100
so he was supposed to do that and I
just like kind of froze for a bit,

4086
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:07,581
cause like,

4087
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:07,851
dude,

4088
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:10,220
this dude is just walking
into my fucking house.

4089
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,240
And so I turned around,

4090
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:12,050
I'm like,

4091
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:12,441
dude,

4092
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:13,274
can I help you?

4093
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:15,110
And he's like,

4094
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:15,943
what?

4095
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,530
Yeah,

4096
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:17,810
I'm supposed to be working on your place.

4097
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:18,591
And then it clicked,

4098
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:18,801
right?

4099
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:19,370
And then I was like,

4100
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,203
oh my God.

4101
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:20,421
Oh,

4102
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:20,661
okay.

4103
01:44:20,661 --> 01:44:20,830
Yeah,

4104
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:21,350
yeah.

4105
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:22,280
And then all of a sudden,

4106
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:24,260
all the other fucking
dudes caught on to me,

4107
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,333
you know,

4108
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:26,330
calling this guy,

4109
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:26,601
you know,

4110
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:27,890
as he's walking into my fucking house.

4111
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:28,220
And he went,

4112
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:28,761
Oh yeah,

4113
01:44:28,761 --> 01:44:31,250
the big black dude fucking
walks into your fucking blaze.

4114
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:34,050
You freaking out or you thought he
was gonna rob you and then and then

4115
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:34,850
no,

4116
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:35,990
just turned on your Canadian.

4117
01:44:35,991 --> 01:44:36,081
I,

4118
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:36,311

4119
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:37,150
I just fucking,

4120
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:38,263

4121
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:41,710
you're talking to different black dude.

4122
01:44:41,711 --> 01:44:44,710
You're talking black
Canadians in different guys.

4123
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:48,940
Black Canadians are
the nicest people ever.

4124
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:51,571
David Lowe.

4125
01:44:51,571 --> 01:44:52,420
Razo Nice.

4126
01:44:52,421 --> 01:44:52,811
Fucked up.

4127
01:44:52,811 --> 01:44:53,021
I mean,

4128
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:53,854
could you imagine?

4129
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,390
I was sitting in my boxers on the fucking
computer and are you ready to rock?

4130
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,550
We'll be thinking.

4131
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:01,601
I'm like,

4132
01:45:01,601 --> 01:45:01,871
dude,

4133
01:45:01,871 --> 01:45:02,704
can I help you?

4134
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,860
He was

4135
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:07,840
thinking this next mix beat.

4136
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:08,661
Yeah,

4137
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:08,991
that's a,

4138
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:11,230
that's a fucking freaky moment
when anybody's in your house.

4139
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,130
We're not prepared.

4140
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:13,590
Especially a big Buckeye.

4141
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,820
Was this in Canada or here in Toronto?

4142
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:17,850
Toronto or even say cafe area.

4143
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,470
No,

4144
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,821
Toronto.

4145
01:45:18,821 --> 01:45:19,654
I live in Toronto.

4146
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:20,080
That's all right.

4147
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,790
Don't get crazy slower
times on the trials.

4148
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:22,361
You'll watch out.

4149
01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:22,931
I live in Toronto.

4150
01:45:22,931 --> 01:45:23,320
Throw it.

4151
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:23,981
Slow it down.

4152
01:45:23,981 --> 01:45:24,880
They're angry.

4153
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:25,763
Red.

4154
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,700
Toronto's a bad ass city man.

4155
01:45:27,701 --> 01:45:28,870
I fucking love Toronto.

4156
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:30,520
Toronto loves Joe Rogan.

4157
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,760
I did a comedy club dinner.

4158
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:32,290
Bravo.

4159
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:33,820
I did a comedy club there in uh,

4160
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:34,550
it was a,

4161
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,790
a pot shop and uh,

4162
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:39,730
people were allowed to smoke
weed in Toronto was going on.

4163
01:45:39,731 --> 01:45:40,540
Yeah.

4164
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:41,500
I don't want to say the name.

4165
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:42,790
I don't even say where it is.

4166
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,040
You go there,

4167
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,960
you go there it's like a bong shop.

4168
01:45:46,961 --> 01:45:50,260
They take in this back room and
there's not a fan and the place,

4169
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,760
there's no air.

4170
01:45:51,761 --> 01:45:52,361
There's no air.

4171
01:45:52,361 --> 01:45:54,340
The whole place gray man.

4172
01:45:54,341 --> 01:45:58,300
It's like you're flying through the
clouds was called ridiculous cafe contact

4173
01:45:58,301 --> 01:45:58,581
high.

4174
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:02,400
It was the most ridiculous
thing I've ever been a part of.

4175
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,433
We know

4176
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,290
it's called Henry comes
with a Goddamn posy.

4177
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:07,590
Yeah.

4178
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,560
I'm not fucking around the roll deep pit.

4179
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,081
That's a,

4180
01:46:10,081 --> 01:46:10,620
that,

4181
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,850
that's Dylan Garcia and you know,

4182
01:46:11,851 --> 01:46:12,280
hey Suze,

4183
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,113
don't you?

4184
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:13,521
Hey,

4185
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:14,430
my name is Trey hoe.

4186
01:46:14,431 --> 01:46:15,264
He worries,

4187
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:17,980
they're both comments from left,

4188
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:18,540
uh,

4189
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:19,470
from the comedy store.

4190
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,413
Nice.

4191
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:23,620
Russell Peters does not travel by himself.

4192
01:46:23,621 --> 01:46:24,700
Do you have a tour bus or something?

4193
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,060
She,

4194
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,510
they came in to cars full

4195
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,400
hanging out or we live here.

4196
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,450
He's Indian man.

4197
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,230
You don't know hard.

4198
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:36,130
Okay.

4199
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:38,080
Cardi was saying that we were
going to hook up one day.

4200
01:46:38,110 --> 01:46:40,690
You have a green card and you
still buy houses in America.

4201
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,280
You're a savage has been in a fuck.

4202
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:43,510
If I didn't know for sure,

4203
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,870
if I had to buy a house for fuck sakes.

4204
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:46,890
Oh please.

4205
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,443
How long?

4206
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:55,471
How long have you been?

4207
01:46:55,471 --> 01:46:56,180
Uh,

4208
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:56,460
uh,

4209
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,780
she gets the house Wednesday.

4210
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:58,720
Wednesday.

4211
01:46:58,720 --> 01:46:59,553
Wow.

4212
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:02,400
You knew it was coming.

4213
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:04,650
We had a conversation a year ago.

4214
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:06,810
Russ just see this was
the parent for impact.

4215
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:08,520
He's putting helmets on his shit.

4216
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,440
I had my head between my legs,

4217
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:11,310
elbow pads.

4218
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:12,144
He knew it was coming.

4219
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:12,900
He knows.

4220
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,130
He knew the rocks were there.

4221
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,000
I knew that my seat
was a flotation device.

4222
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,850
Boat was hitting the rock sons.

4223
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,680
There's no doubt about it.

4224
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:20,011
Hey,

4225
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:20,671
it is what it is.

4226
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:21,920
But it all worked out great.

4227
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:22,440
It works.

4228
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,251
You're Russell Peters.

4229
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:23,850
You went,

4230
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:26,340
we're actually cooler now than
we were when we were together.

4231
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:26,881
That's beautiful.

4232
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:28,860
She'd probably love you now
that you should respect you,

4233
01:47:28,861 --> 01:47:30,030
that you got away from her bullshit.

4234
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,250
She girls,

4235
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:33,240
girls need that.

4236
01:47:33,241 --> 01:47:35,670
And then when they're in a situation
where you cannot ever leave,

4237
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:36,660
like we have a child together,

4238
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,690
there's girls that abused
guys because they're,

4239
01:47:38,691 --> 01:47:41,370
they're constantly in
this psychological drama,

4240
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,130
this see saw battle of
putting guys on the defensive.

4241
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,590
So the guy proves that he's a man.

4242
01:47:46,591 --> 01:47:49,890
Like I dated a girl that I always
wanted to fight and I was like,

4243
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,210
I can't do this anymore.

4244
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:55,010
She left and then she started dating
some other dude and did the same goddamn

4245
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,390
thing and then I had a
call center and then you,

4246
01:47:57,391 --> 01:47:57,670
right,

4247
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:58,201
exactly.

4248
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:58,621
But I mean,

4249
01:47:58,621 --> 01:47:59,161
as a person,

4250
01:47:59,161 --> 01:48:00,330
I liked her as a person.

4251
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:00,810
I was like,

4252
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:01,770
what do you think's going on?

4253
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:02,071
She's like,

4254
01:48:02,071 --> 01:48:02,970
I can't help it.

4255
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,740
I have to push a guy.

4256
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,341
She goes,

4257
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:05,671
it's like,

4258
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:06,271
it's in me.

4259
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:06,961
I don't know what it is.

4260
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:09,780
I want to push them into a corner and I
want to get him to tell me to shut the

4261
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:10,440
fuck up.

4262
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,350
I want to know the heel.

4263
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,780
He's willing to walk away from me,

4264
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:14,070
otherwise I can't respect him.

4265
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:14,551
It's true.

4266
01:48:14,551 --> 01:48:16,050
You can't walk away when you have a kid.

4267
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:17,640
When you get one of those
crazy bitches pregnant,

4268
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:18,630
that's what happens.

4269
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:22,290
Or they're stuck in a
goddamn circuit loop.

4270
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:26,250
It turns out mine was only crazy because
of the hormones from being pregnant and

4271
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:26,970
postpartum.

4272
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:27,091
Oh,

4273
01:48:27,091 --> 01:48:30,300
let's put by that time I had already
fucking checked out so it was too late.

4274
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:33,840
You know the ironic part,

4275
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:35,770
she's a big dead mouse fan and that's

4276
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,430
sad if you know that man.

4277
01:48:41,431 --> 01:48:43,050
And why don't you guys
try to get back together?

4278
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:43,884
You're not,

4279
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:45,210
um,

4280
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:45,511
again,

4281
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:46,680
her tickets I like,

4282
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,350
are you guys friends still?

4283
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:49,831
We're cool.

4284
01:48:49,831 --> 01:48:50,460
We're cool.

4285
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,293
But you love,

4286
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,960
you really loved her
when you first met her,

4287
01:48:52,961 --> 01:48:53,410
right?

4288
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:54,243
I was a rebound,

4289
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:55,170
but it was um,

4290
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:56,250
oh snap.

4291
01:48:56,270 --> 01:49:00,600
She fills the airways truths.

4292
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:00,901
Hey,

4293
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:01,111
wait,

4294
01:49:01,111 --> 01:49:02,040
why aren't we,

4295
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,550
why aren't you at the Junos is here
because they got shit or hosting it this

4296
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:05,580
year.

4297
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:08,460
I know how dope is there this year.

4298
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:10,081
What are you going to do?

4299
01:49:10,081 --> 01:49:10,940
What are you guys don't know?

4300
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:13,021
What does it,

4301
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:13,560
Juno.

4302
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,270
Juno's is a Canadian grammy.

4303
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:15,511
Okay.

4304
01:49:15,511 --> 01:49:16,350
No one knows that.

4305
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:16,830
You know,

4306
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,663
the ironic thing is

4307
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:19,770
running.

4308
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,200
He's a Jew and I have a Juno's

4309
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:25,320
and only Jewish.

4310
01:49:25,321 --> 01:49:26,130
When I'm in Hawaii.

4311
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:27,060
Don't expect gold.

4312
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:28,890
It's late and I'm drinking beer,

4313
01:49:28,891 --> 01:49:29,671
which I don't drink.

4314
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:30,391
What you drink?

4315
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:30,700
What do you do?

4316
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,321
What would you like?

4317
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:33,060
Can we get them alcohol in some form?

4318
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:34,010
It's only one amp.

4319
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:34,251
Hey,

4320
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:35,300
you're next to show.

4321
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:36,511
Oh,

4322
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:37,344
we got some stuff.

4323
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:39,000
You don't want this crown royal.

4324
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:39,570
Trust me man.

4325
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:40,090
Oh hell.

4326
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:42,390
Just so fucking melt your tires breezy.

4327
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:44,040
Can you hit the bar for me out there?

4328
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:44,611
Is that,

4329
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:45,510
how old is that crown?

4330
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,673
It's pretty new.

4331
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:48,730
I'm telling you.

4332
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,650
Hey Joe,

4333
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:51,380
you have the other stuff.

4334
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:53,060
The other shit that a Rhonda Rousey.

4335
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:54,023
The Glendale's.

4336
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,560
What is an Armenian?

4337
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,150
Well,

4338
01:49:58,150 --> 01:49:58,983
yeah man.

4339
01:49:59,310 --> 01:49:59,800
Armenians,

4340
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:00,131
Bro.

4341
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:00,964
I love Armenia.

4342
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,230
Or Mommy is my people who's,

4343
01:50:04,231 --> 01:50:05,510
we're both Harry motherfuckers,

4344
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,890
so we have to respect our meal.

4345
01:50:07,110 --> 01:50:10,780
We're very similar in genome Italian,

4346
01:50:10,781 --> 01:50:11,614
Indian army.

4347
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:16,770
We are genetically predisposed to
follicle not being follicly challenged.

4348
01:50:16,921 --> 01:50:17,160
They,

4349
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:17,300
uh,

4350
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:20,350
they hooked me up with
some fucking Badass Cognac.

4351
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:20,720
Dan,

4352
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,820
this Exoskeleton,

4353
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:22,330
the act,

4354
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:23,590
it's really good,

4355
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:23,921
man.

4356
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:24,790
It's fucking neck.

4357
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:28,670
Ronda Rousey came over and the
armos sent this over with us.

4358
01:50:28,671 --> 01:50:28,931
She said,

4359
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:32,050
the Armenians love me and they love
when I talk good about Armenians.

4360
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:36,610
So I'll talk about good about our means
to the day I die when a grown man buys

4361
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:38,110
me a bottle of cool Vasia,

4362
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:38,830
he'd got me.

4363
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:40,650
You will choke a Turk out for an

4364
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:43,630
Xo.

4365
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:44,381
It's the good shit.

4366
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:44,771
It's the good,

4367
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,191
what is it?

4368
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:46,024
What kind of an alcoholic?

4369
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:47,440
It's Martell Cognac.

4370
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:47,831
It's the,

4371
01:50:47,831 --> 01:50:48,740
so that's of that.

4372
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,420
That's the good stuff.

4373
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,410
It's pretty fucking good.

4374
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,480
You could tell by how
fancy the bottom of this,

4375
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:52,871
Brian,

4376
01:50:52,871 --> 01:50:55,100
until I saw God damn pot crumb.

4377
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:57,400
You did that Santa,

4378
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,790
I've watched the hair.

4379
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,340
You.

4380
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:00,070
How dare you.

4381
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:00,251
Oh,

4382
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:00,581
it's this.

4383
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:01,414
It's this stack.

4384
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:02,730
It was the wrong staff

4385
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:04,941
through some shit.

4386
01:51:04,941 --> 01:51:07,850
And My gleans down stacks clean.

4387
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:08,350
Asked.

4388
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:10,420
You asked Wieden and
that thousand apologies.

4389
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:13,390
So do you like mashups?

4390
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:14,640
Like do you enjoy living,

4391
01:51:14,641 --> 01:51:15,670
keep on Mashups,

4392
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:16,180
or do you,

4393
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:18,160
do you enjoy what people like do like it?

4394
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:19,840
When people that don't do it do it.

4395
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:20,320
Oh,

4396
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,070
okay.

4397
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:22,690
What does that make people
that shouldn't do it?

4398
01:51:22,691 --> 01:51:23,080
Do.

4399
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,220
I hate that I do enjoy the party
band girl talk or any of that.

4400
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:30,820
Hold on to say this guy,

4401
01:51:30,821 --> 01:51:31,271
by the way,

4402
01:51:31,271 --> 01:51:31,800
he,

4403
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,130
you should've been here earlier because
he completely mirrors your sentiments on

4404
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:36,911
the whole Dj.

4405
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:38,530
Like what is the definition of Dj?

4406
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:40,090
He's an electronic artist.

4407
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:43,150
Russell's a discs.

4408
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,083
God knows it.

4409
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,250
Do you know that?

4410
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:45,461
We'll do.

4411
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:48,430
I know what I've been deejaying
since 85 have you really?

4412
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,280
The Wolfman Jack Days.

4413
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,740
I was on the radio back in the day,

4414
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,700
me and mastermind,

4415
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:55,590
we were had the hip hop shit.

4416
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,170
No Shit on,

4417
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:58,800
no,

4418
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,030
no.

4419
01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:00,640
Wait eight.

4420
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:05,930
We had the hip hop show and I was the
DJ and the William Wayne Williams.

4421
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,473
He was horrible.

4422
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:09,160
It's a horrible human.

4423
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,301
I'm good.

4424
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:10,601
I'm good.

4425
01:52:10,601 --> 01:52:11,434
Thanks.

4426
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,723
I've done it.

4427
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,371
Yeah,

4428
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:16,204
go for it.

4429
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:17,620
He's going to get me a drink

4430
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:20,440
cognac.

4431
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:20,510
Oh,

4432
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:20,860
Yay.

4433
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:21,070
Hi.

4434
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:21,310
No,

4435
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:22,300
you want some cognac?

4436
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,193
Cheers guys.

4437
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:23,980
Long.

4438
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:24,813
Yeah.

4439
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:29,130
Fuck.

4440
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,970
That's wow.

4441
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,290
Whew.

4442
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,041
You know what?

4443
01:52:33,041 --> 01:52:38,041
I love the occasional Jimi Hendrix smash
up the Jay z Jimi Hendrix Mashup of

4444
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:40,300
girl problems and Voodoo child.

4445
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,920
That is the shit.

4446
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:44,080
My favorite matchup was the gray album.

4447
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,300
Oh,

4448
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,133
danger mouse

4449
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,090
all time favorite.

4450
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:48,030
Masha was great too.

4451
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:48,590
I agree.

4452
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:48,810
You know,

4453
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:49,240
that was,

4454
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,390
mashups can be done in,

4455
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:52,520
in such an artistic way
that it's fucking cool.

4456
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:55,100
But what about the bed
Stuy meets blue eyes?

4457
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:55,470
No,

4458
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:56,460
it depends on how it's done,

4459
01:52:56,461 --> 01:52:57,230
but it's not bad.

4460
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,000
That was my bad.

4461
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,640
Yeah.

4462
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:02,280
Anything with Biggie I love
anything would be are such a big,

4463
01:53:02,281 --> 01:53:03,060
big fancy.

4464
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:04,010
But when I was growing up,

4465
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:05,000
they weren't called mashups.

4466
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:06,140
They were just called mixes.

4467
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:06,920
Right.

4468
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:07,850
It was like growing up.

4469
01:53:07,851 --> 01:53:08,121
You would,

4470
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:11,780
you would take whatever fucking acapella
record they had because it was hard to

4471
01:53:11,781 --> 01:53:12,950
get acapellas back then.

4472
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:14,420
So if a record had an Acapella,

4473
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:17,900
you would fuck with it with however many
beats you could find that would match

4474
01:53:17,901 --> 01:53:18,734
that acapella.

4475
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,090
Like I would play sweetheart by rainy
Davis and I would find as many fucking

4476
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:25,820
beats that would go with that
with sweetheart back in the day.

4477
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,850
Then you would try and change
them as much as fast as you could.

4478
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:32,780
And that was the challenge because
you'd have to dig the record out and you

4479
01:53:32,781 --> 01:53:34,490
didn't have the fucking
bpms in front of you.

4480
01:53:34,491 --> 01:53:35,630
There was no sink button.

4481
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,790
It's too susceptible to
train wrecking though.

4482
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:39,530
That's the problem with mash ups.

4483
01:53:39,531 --> 01:53:40,161
You know what I mean?

4484
01:53:40,161 --> 01:53:42,800
You could totally just mash
something up and it sounds like shit.

4485
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:45,410
There's very few people
have a perception of music.

4486
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,273
The way he does it.

4487
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,330
It's almost creepy.

4488
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:49,220
Like you have like a
smell that I don't have.

4489
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,690
I am a creepy music.

4490
01:53:50,691 --> 01:53:52,220
We played some music and he pulled,

4491
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:52,431
he goes,

4492
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:52,551
oh,

4493
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:53,960
that's the salt and pepper in there.

4494
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:54,621
The salt and pepper.

4495
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:55,190
There's one,

4496
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:55,551
and we were like,

4497
01:53:55,551 --> 01:53:57,050
what the fuck are you talking about?

4498
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:00,350
Like a hundred times and break it down.

4499
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:00,830
It's like,

4500
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:02,390
stop this spot right here.

4501
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,260
And we're like,

4502
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:03,831
oh yeah.

4503
01:54:03,831 --> 01:54:04,670
Wow.

4504
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:05,750
What the fuck?

4505
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:07,370
How did you even pick that out man?

4506
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:09,110
Like if you sample the snare
and probably able to go,

4507
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:10,100
I know where that snares wrong.

4508
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:10,760
Yeah,

4509
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:11,031
he'll,

4510
01:54:11,031 --> 01:54:12,440
he'll write the song.

4511
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,030
It's really bizarre,

4512
01:54:14,031 --> 01:54:14,361
man.

4513
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:14,590
It's,

4514
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:15,423
it's,

4515
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:17,090
it's still prevailing and music today,

4516
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:17,811
even with the,

4517
01:54:17,811 --> 01:54:20,150
even the latest and greatest
like electronic music,

4518
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:23,750
cause you hear this one little sample
or snare or something like that and it's

4519
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,070
off another dude shit.

4520
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,293
You know what I mean?

4521
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,990
That's like kind of when I stopped
fucking listening to music,

4522
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:30,380
you know,

4523
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,240
because I find that I'm analyzing.

4524
01:54:32,241 --> 01:54:33,560
It's like where did he get that?

4525
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:37,730
Where did he just enjoy his homeboy wasn't
in the back fucking hitting the snare

4526
01:54:37,731 --> 01:54:38,241
on the mic,

4527
01:54:38,241 --> 01:54:38,430
you know,

4528
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:39,350
and they're all,

4529
01:54:39,351 --> 01:54:40,160
it's just,

4530
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:41,780
just incestual ripping.

4531
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:42,643
You know what I mean?

4532
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:45,440
You could rip anything
as long as it's good.

4533
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,273
Right.

4534
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:50,810
To put together the melodies that are
magical and resonate with the planet.

4535
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:51,950
That's the talent,

4536
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:52,770
right.

4537
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:54,620
Rip it off whether you sample it,

4538
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:59,850
can you put together this unique little
piece of art it's going to resonate with

4539
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:00,321
the world.

4540
01:55:00,321 --> 01:55:02,080
Doesn't work that way with comedy.

4541
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:02,923
It doesn't rustle.

4542
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:07,940
P Not a couple of colleagues who do the
collage for showed we got their best

4543
01:55:09,651 --> 01:55:10,100
stuff.

4544
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:13,010
I business has a different
code painting my wife,

4545
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,410
you gotta you got to come
up with your own riffs.

4546
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,693
Yeah,

4547
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,930
it's pretty awful.

4548
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,250
And it's,

4549
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:19,340
it's not getting any better.

4550
01:55:19,341 --> 01:55:20,120
We're out there.

4551
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,320
It's,

4552
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,041
well it isn't,

4553
01:55:21,041 --> 01:55:21,420
it isn't.

4554
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,253
Fuck that I'm saying is,

4555
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,290
do you ever write a great joke?

4556
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:25,970
And then you think there's
no way nobody did that.

4557
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,650
I fucking Dick Jokes.

4558
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:28,850
And I'm like so happy with it.

4559
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,530
And then as soon as I get happy with it,

4560
01:55:30,531 --> 01:55:30,980
a go,

4561
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:32,450
I'm sure some fucking guy said,

4562
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:33,591
well,

4563
01:55:33,591 --> 01:55:33,891
you know,

4564
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:34,340
I had a,

4565
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:37,460
I had a bit that it was on one of my cds
and I didn't find out until like four

4566
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:39,410
years later that Ellen did generous.

4567
01:55:39,411 --> 01:55:39,891
Had a bit,

4568
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:40,400
just like,

4569
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,630
I did that in a special,

4570
01:55:41,631 --> 01:55:44,250
I did in 97 I did a joke

4571
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,910
about throwing a fucking chocolate bar
into a swimming pool or into a toilet or

4572
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,113
just mashing it up.

4573
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:52,050
I can't remember the fuck.

4574
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:52,770
It was horrible.

4575
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:53,130
And then,

4576
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:54,120
and then how he Mendell was like,

4577
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:54,301
you know,

4578
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:54,870
I did that right.

4579
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:55,470
I'm like,

4580
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,700
son of a bitch.

4581
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:00,060
And it was worse because how we did
it and how are we on our friends?

4582
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:00,930
Andy's Canadian.

4583
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:01,764
So it was like,

4584
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,130
it looks like I stole
from my own fucking Pete.

4585
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:05,910
The only thing you don't have
to worry about with how he is,

4586
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:07,720
he's not going to kick your
ass cause you won't touch you.

4587
01:56:07,721 --> 01:56:07,811
Yeah,

4588
01:56:07,811 --> 01:56:08,400
it's true.

4589
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,660
He's terrified of touching p.

4590
01:56:09,661 --> 01:56:10,081
It's true.

4591
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:11,010
It's so you can be like,

4592
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:11,870
what bitch?

4593
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:12,933
Yeah,

4594
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:14,430
I shake my head.

4595
01:56:14,431 --> 01:56:15,270
Start Sneezing.

4596
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,600
He'll just run away from you man.

4597
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:19,411
You never have to worry about it.

4598
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:20,280
I'm kicking your ass.

4599
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:23,510
Won't even shake your
hand on the show yet.

4600
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,560
What did pay him in how we met that up.

4601
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:26,783
Oh,

4602
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:28,480
it's like watching a Dj right now.

4603
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:29,314
How dare you.

4604
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:30,541
I think that's cool.

4605
01:56:30,541 --> 01:56:31,374
Keep telling him.

4606
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,131
How dare you.

4607
01:56:32,131 --> 01:56:32,581
What do you tell him?

4608
01:56:32,581 --> 01:56:35,140
I tell we'd love anonymous
14 we'd love everyone.

4609
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:40,190
[inaudible] dot com [inaudible] the
shit so they don't take my website down.

4610
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,110
English historian.

4611
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,860
I paid a lot for that.com I need
to seek it and take it down.

4612
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:48,750
Hey digital mafia rules.

4613
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,450
Well it's mostly like young hacker kids,

4614
01:56:51,451 --> 01:56:51,721
right?

4615
01:56:51,721 --> 01:56:52,770
I mean what is anonymous?

4616
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:56,280
Anybody cannot miss this
about like fucking 12 dudes.

4617
01:56:56,281 --> 01:56:56,881
Exactly,

4618
01:56:56,881 --> 01:56:57,714
exactly.

4619
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:02,243
And I'm like,

4620
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:03,523
Shit,

4621
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:08,220
we just got down serious
fucking government website.

4622
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:08,491
I'm like,

4623
01:57:08,491 --> 01:57:09,410
did they really do that?

4624
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:09,561
Yeah,

4625
01:57:09,561 --> 01:57:10,240
they can do that.

4626
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:11,073
Absolutely.

4627
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:11,820
Well,

4628
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:12,690
this is how it works,

4629
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:13,524
man.

4630
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:14,191
This is a real,

4631
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:15,240
in real simple terms,

4632
01:57:15,241 --> 01:57:19,340
every website is servers and every
server can only take so many hits to the

4633
01:57:19,341 --> 01:57:19,500
site.

4634
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:19,951
Just say that.

4635
01:57:19,951 --> 01:57:21,270
I'm excited that Bravo's here.

4636
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:22,143
It's in the house.

4637
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:23,940
I know Joe.

4638
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:24,781
You know what sucks though,

4639
01:57:24,781 --> 01:57:25,980
is that I,

4640
01:57:25,981 --> 01:57:26,251
yeah,

4641
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:27,430
but not like your level.

4642
01:57:27,431 --> 01:57:27,670
I mean,

4643
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:30,510
and I recently got hacked
by x buys a as a guy,

4644
01:57:30,511 --> 01:57:31,240
I'm like,

4645
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:32,310
you'd be the on the Bra.

4646
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,740
My account on Xbox got hacked.

4647
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:40,600
And what sucks is that that a lot of
people are getting hacked on next box and

4648
01:57:40,601 --> 01:57:43,780
instead of like Sony playstation
who announced it to everybody like,

4649
01:57:43,781 --> 01:57:43,931
Hey,

4650
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:45,610
we got hacked in blah blah blah,

4651
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:46,510
x boxes.

4652
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:49,540
Like covering the shit up
and like if be go on Twitter,

4653
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:50,021
like I said,

4654
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:51,610
I got hacked in like all
these people are like,

4655
01:57:51,611 --> 01:57:52,061
so did I,

4656
01:57:52,061 --> 01:57:52,451
so did I,

4657
01:57:52,451 --> 01:57:53,290
so did I so dry.

4658
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,270
And then you go to Khatak
who enjoy steak in,

4659
01:57:55,271 --> 01:57:55,601
they're like,

4660
01:57:55,601 --> 01:57:55,901
yeah,

4661
01:57:55,901 --> 01:57:58,870
that's what they're
doing is like in Poland,

4662
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:04,050
people are hacking x boxes and then
their fucking adding all these charges.

4663
01:58:04,571 --> 01:58:04,961
Like they're,

4664
01:58:04,961 --> 01:58:09,460
they're getting all these gamer points
and then like using ea has for Fifi

4665
01:58:09,461 --> 01:58:10,294
soccer,

4666
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:13,960
they have like these things that they
can exchange a points for like these game

4667
01:58:13,961 --> 01:58:14,291
cards,

4668
01:58:14,291 --> 01:58:16,060
like baseball cards or whatever.

4669
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,860
But like there's this
whole thing going on.

4670
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:19,450
And the crazy thing is,

4671
01:58:19,451 --> 01:58:20,650
is that I told Xbox,

4672
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:21,070
I'm like,

4673
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:21,311
Hey,

4674
01:58:21,311 --> 01:58:23,500
I got hacked and they're making this huge,

4675
01:58:23,501 --> 01:58:23,830
like,

4676
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,150
like I can't go online right now.

4677
01:58:25,151 --> 01:58:28,090
I can't do anything right
now and can't go online.

4678
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,170
No Xbox,

4679
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,070
Xbox and,

4680
01:58:30,071 --> 01:58:30,904
but listen to this,

4681
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,020
I told them three days ago I got
hacked and they're still getting,

4682
01:58:34,021 --> 01:58:35,250
I'm still getting charges on my,

4683
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:36,220
my checking account.

4684
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:36,760
Uh,

4685
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,110
people are still charging,

4686
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:38,591
charging,

4687
01:58:38,591 --> 01:58:39,101
charging,

4688
01:58:39,101 --> 01:58:39,700
charging.

4689
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,580
And I told x box,

4690
01:58:40,581 --> 01:58:41,260
I'm like,

4691
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,093
stop,

4692
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,700
take my pay pal,

4693
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:44,401
take my bees.

4694
01:58:44,401 --> 01:58:48,070
So take everything off my
account and they won't do it.

4695
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:48,520
Why?

4696
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,710
Because they want to research who,

4697
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:52,000
where the money's coming from.

4698
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:53,380
So they're using my money.

4699
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:54,221
They're using,

4700
01:58:54,221 --> 01:58:56,920
my research is going to reimburse you.

4701
01:58:57,260 --> 01:58:58,390
I'm sure they will,

4702
01:58:58,391 --> 01:59:01,660
but they're not going to reimburse all
the bills that are bouncing right now.

4703
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,411
Fuck you.

4704
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:03,244
X Box.

4705
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,513
Oh,

4706
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,630
ran out of breath

4707
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:10,893
playing your life.

4708
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:15,140
You're really playing on the odds that
one out of the 10 fucking Anon don't work

4709
01:59:15,141 --> 01:59:15,590
for fun.

4710
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:16,370
I know,

4711
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:17,030
I know.

4712
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,751
That's risky.

4713
01:59:17,751 --> 01:59:18,930
I wouldn't double down on their,

4714
01:59:18,931 --> 01:59:19,310
hey,

4715
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:19,881
you're right.

4716
01:59:19,881 --> 01:59:20,151
I know.

4717
01:59:20,151 --> 01:59:20,840
Exactly.

4718
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:23,010
There's an inside job going on in Xbox.

4719
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:23,910
I think so.

4720
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:25,050
Do you think some of the incidents,

4721
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:26,403
Jackie,

4722
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:29,490
speaking of my ex's bucks,

4723
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,353
she's moving.

4724
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:32,130
Oh,

4725
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,260
here's Russell Peters,

4726
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,370
standup comedian.

4727
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,980
Here's the beautiful thing about drunk.

4728
01:59:37,981 --> 01:59:39,040
What do you bond for?

4729
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:39,780
I love it.

4730
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:40,800
I wouldn't want nothing else.

4731
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:41,501
Beautiful thing.

4732
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:42,120
You're perfect.

4733
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:42,780
Don't change.

4734
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:46,020
The beautiful thing about anonymous
is that everything's anonymous.

4735
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:47,190
It just like fight club.

4736
01:59:47,191 --> 01:59:48,090
There's the people weren't,

4737
01:59:48,091 --> 01:59:48,450
man,

4738
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:49,600
this kid's going to get arrested,

4739
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,890
but we supposed to not to
fucking talk about regionally.

4740
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,460
Occasionally people were
going to get arrested.

4741
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:56,520
The beauty of anonymous is what it
represents is the future of government.

4742
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,770
That's what it represents is that
the government is going to be,

4743
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:01,250
it's going to be what,

4744
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:03,570
10 [inaudible] who really knows security

4745
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:06,810
politics,

4746
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:08,610
not what I'm saying now
listen to what I'm saying.

4747
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:11,340
It represents the will of the
people when they're doing something,

4748
02:00:11,341 --> 02:00:12,030
when they're takedown,

4749
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:15,360
they're taking down a government
website because of the,

4750
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:17,250
the National Defense Authorization Act.

4751
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,590
What they're doing is they're essentially
making a stand for the people.

4752
02:00:19,591 --> 02:00:19,981
They're saying,

4753
02:00:19,981 --> 02:00:22,530
listen to the internet does not like this.

4754
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:26,070
And everyone usually gets behind it and
then you see it's bills like Sopa get

4755
02:00:26,071 --> 02:00:27,400
taken down and you go,

4756
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:27,850
whoa.

4757
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:30,420
You know the Internet has to
say the Internet has to say,

4758
02:00:30,510 --> 02:00:33,060
and there's people that are extreme
miss on the internet and that's what

4759
02:00:33,061 --> 02:00:33,840
anonymous is.

4760
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,480
Did the craziest soldiers at the front
of the line that are willing to do nutty

4761
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:39,250
shit like tapped by the
CIA website and they not?

4762
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:40,200
They don't necessarily.

4763
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:40,560
I don't.

4764
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:41,221
It doesn't have to be.

4765
02:00:41,221 --> 02:00:41,791
It could be three.

4766
02:00:41,791 --> 02:00:46,440
It doesn't matter what they represent
as anonymous individuals are the will of

4767
02:00:46,441 --> 02:00:47,640
the entire group on the,

4768
02:00:47,641 --> 02:00:48,390
on the Internet.

4769
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:50,340
They don't do shit that people hate.

4770
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,630
They don't do anonymous,

4771
02:00:51,631 --> 02:00:53,850
has never doing shit that
people are really mad at.

4772
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,280
Now have you ever noticed
they get creepy and they put,

4773
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:57,660
you know they call themselves anonymous?

4774
02:00:57,661 --> 02:00:57,850
No,

4775
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:59,520
people's personal information online.

4776
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,170
That's some Douche bags.

4777
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:05,160
But the reality of the ethics behind
the group is that they're trying to take

4778
02:01:05,161 --> 02:01:06,300
down corruption.

4779
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,640
They're trying to step in and stop shit.

4780
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:12,630
They trying to do pickup where wikileaks
got tripped up because there was a

4781
02:01:12,631 --> 02:01:13,464
public figure.

4782
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:13,891
Right.

4783
02:01:13,891 --> 02:01:16,050
But at what point do you think that,

4784
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:16,480
you know,

4785
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:21,150
they'll kind of curb that as not
to become the dictators themselves.

4786
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:21,911
Who is they?

4787
02:01:21,911 --> 02:01:22,571
That's the issue.

4788
02:01:22,571 --> 02:01:23,660
The issue is who is day?

4789
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:25,240
Lauren is fine.

4790
02:01:25,241 --> 02:01:28,660
As long as there's no true organization
and it really does represent the people,

4791
02:01:28,661 --> 02:01:29,494
then it'll be,

4792
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:31,480
the internet would be truly democratic.

4793
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:35,140
It's like you're saying
they may become evil.

4794
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:37,000
Right now they're doing
everything for the px.

4795
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:37,370
Right,

4796
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:37,640
right,

4797
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,270
right.

4798
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:38,960
Then all of a sudden,

4799
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,231
okay,

4800
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:39,711
so fine,

4801
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:39,951
so,

4802
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:40,190
so

4803
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:40,460
let's,

4804
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:43,100
let's take a non right and
let's put them in power.

4805
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:43,820
No,

4806
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:44,840
well no one's saying that.

4807
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:45,770
The idea is

4808
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,640
the idea is we've got to get
to a certain point in time,

4809
02:01:49,641 --> 02:01:51,350
we realized it was a global government.

4810
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,270
I think we should have anonymous is power.

4811
02:01:53,271 --> 02:01:54,950
We should have the Internet be power.

4812
02:01:54,951 --> 02:01:56,630
We should have voting online.

4813
02:01:56,631 --> 02:01:58,150
We should have everything the Internet is.

4814
02:01:58,190 --> 02:01:59,023
I know.

4815
02:01:59,070 --> 02:01:59,331
Yeah.

4816
02:01:59,331 --> 02:02:00,164
Okay,

4817
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,910
so it only takes four fucking
dudes to go and change it.

4818
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:04,941
I get that.

4819
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:05,930
I get through,

4820
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:07,640
but who are those three or four dudes?

4821
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:11,300
We got to eliminate the fact that there
can ever be three or four dudes that

4822
02:02:11,301 --> 02:02:12,710
have access to any we have to kill.

4823
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:13,730
The [inaudible] have to do,

4824
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:17,630
they can never be three or four
dudes that have access to anything.

4825
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:19,220
It has to be all transparent.

4826
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,570
Once it becomes transparent,

4827
02:02:20,571 --> 02:02:21,440
then he can't steal,

4828
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:22,400
then he can't lie.

4829
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:23,240
Then it'd be really simple.

4830
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,010
Internet 2.0 you know what it is,

4831
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:25,370
man.

4832
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:28,790
We're all moving into a certain
direction with is going to be no secrets.

4833
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,550
I think really clear shall inherit.

4834
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:34,940
The information is going to take
over and all your ideas about,

4835
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:35,151
you know,

4836
02:02:35,151 --> 02:02:37,160
wanting to be wanting to have privacy.

4837
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,360
All that bullshit is going to go.

4838
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:39,194
Bye Bye son.

4839
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:40,100
Cause he was going to be no.

4840
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,540
Who's who's watching the,

4841
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:44,270
there's going to be no one watching him
and everyone's going to have access to

4842
02:02:44,271 --> 02:02:44,690
it.

4843
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:47,330
Ultimately it will be complete
and total transparency.

4844
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:47,950
Cheers Buddy.

4845
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:48,291
You know,

4846
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:49,370
and I don't know if that's good,

4847
02:02:49,371 --> 02:02:50,204
but it's coming.

4848
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,411
Fuck that.

4849
02:02:55,411 --> 02:02:56,220
Fuck that.

4850
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:57,053
Are you kidding?

4851
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,100
I can't take that kind of response.

4852
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:02,850
D measy dead dead.

4853
02:03:02,851 --> 02:03:03,684
Mizell fizzle.

4854
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:05,420
D music.

4855
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,253
Now

4856
02:03:07,890 --> 02:03:10,490
that's a new one that he's
got a new pet name for her.

4857
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,320
If you get drunk enough
to get me a phone number,

4858
02:03:13,321 --> 02:03:14,430
that's what's going to be on his phone.

4859
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:17,841
No,

4860
02:03:17,841 --> 02:03:17,990
no,

4861
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:18,560
no.

4862
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,830
We had a shot of crown,

4863
02:03:19,831 --> 02:03:20,940
a shot of our minion.

4864
02:03:20,941 --> 02:03:23,550
Special 99 and then a cognac.

4865
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:24,811
I'm sorry.

4866
02:03:24,811 --> 02:03:25,644
What'd you say?

4867
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,490
I don't think my mic first

4868
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:30,953
cut you out.

4869
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:31,830
Sorry.

4870
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:33,230
Did Red Band?

4871
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:35,121
No,

4872
02:03:35,121 --> 02:03:35,954
I didn't.

4873
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:37,390
Is that what it is?

4874
02:03:37,391 --> 02:03:38,720
You Read Ben Red.

4875
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:42,270
I think red band just
started a brown band.

4876
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:43,910
Oh,

4877
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,790
Brown band.

4878
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:45,653
You get it.

4879
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:48,733
He farting

4880
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:51,800
conspiracy theorist at all.

4881
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:56,090
Fucking totally owe me
a conspiracy theorist.

4882
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,243
Oh,

4883
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,040
not really.

4884
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:58,371
No,

4885
02:03:58,371 --> 02:03:59,204
not really.

4886
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:00,530
You are.

4887
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:01,850
I'll buy into this and that,

4888
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:02,660
but no,

4889
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:03,470
not all of it.

4890
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,330
Not all of it,

4891
02:04:04,331 --> 02:04:05,500
but a lot of it.

4892
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,250
None of it.

4893
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:09,620
I question a lot of things like what?

4894
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:10,970
Namely the moon landing.

4895
02:04:10,971 --> 02:04:12,960
I don't fucking trust one single bit.

4896
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:14,370
Yeah.

4897
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:15,253
Not One bit.

4898
02:04:15,340 --> 02:04:16,940
Trust that moon landing because,

4899
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,590
because I met,

4900
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:19,200
I told,

4901
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:20,660
I think I said this once
before and one of the,

4902
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:21,481
one of the buckets,

4903
02:04:21,481 --> 02:04:21,801
you wait,

4904
02:04:21,801 --> 02:04:22,011
wait,

4905
02:04:22,011 --> 02:04:22,161
wait,

4906
02:04:22,161 --> 02:04:22,400
wait.

4907
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,620
Well,

4908
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:22,751
no,

4909
02:04:22,751 --> 02:04:22,821
no,

4910
02:04:22,821 --> 02:04:22,941
no,

4911
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:23,061
no.

4912
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:23,391
Hold on.

4913
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:24,350
Did you see,

4914
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,170
hold on us emotionally
upset and Neil Armstrong,

4915
02:04:27,171 --> 02:04:27,650
God,

4916
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:28,310
stop right there.

4917
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,461
Yeah,

4918
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,520
but if you going to work enough,

4919
02:04:30,610 --> 02:04:33,140
Joe is going to work is if you're
saying we were talking about something,

4920
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:33,974
it's like,

4921
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:34,580
no,

4922
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:36,050
he's not a Dj and he got upset.

4923
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:36,261
I'd be like,

4924
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:36,711
motherfucker,

4925
02:04:36,711 --> 02:04:37,560
you're not DJ.

4926
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,720
You're put in a mix tape and you got aids.

4927
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:40,610
I mean,

4928
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:41,780
oh,

4929
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:43,680
he hit him with the aides

4930
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:45,730
that,

4931
02:04:45,730 --> 02:04:47,900
hey listen,

4932
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,191
here's the thing.

4933
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:50,390
Whenever someone says something,

4934
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,310
it's crazy.

4935
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:52,490
Make lemonade.

4936
02:04:52,491 --> 02:04:56,030
If someone says something as crazy
as the moon landing didn't happen,

4937
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,790
you got to let them talk
without interrupting with
some fucking emotional shit

4938
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:00,150
about neurons here.

4939
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:01,053
Gotta let him talk.

4940
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:06,030
I have reasons for this now because I
wanted to believe that we went to the moon

4941
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:09,480
because I'm a big nerd for space shit.

4942
02:05:09,481 --> 02:05:11,910
And like watch all the
Hubble footage and the,

4943
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:13,840
and all the shit they send out.

4944
02:05:14,050 --> 02:05:17,400
And it excites me to think that
there's other shit out there.

4945
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:19,980
And when you look at the space race,

4946
02:05:19,981 --> 02:05:20,814
first of all,

4947
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:25,350
it was against Russia at that time and
they were trying to beat somebody to

4948
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,160
somewhere,

4949
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:26,993
right,

4950
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:27,570
right.

4951
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:28,403
It was a random,

4952
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:28,801
right.

4953
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:29,970
It was exactly a race.

4954
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,590
And then I met this two Indian kids
after one of my shows in Houston.

4955
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:35,400
Uh,

4956
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,150
they were,

4957
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:36,540
uh,

4958
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,230
they were basically rocket scientists.

4959
02:05:38,231 --> 02:05:39,990
They were studying astrophysicist,

4960
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:42,590
even the people who study,

4961
02:05:42,591 --> 02:05:43,370
they were shredding them.

4962
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:44,203
They were cutting those two

4963
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:44,501
people.

4964
02:05:44,501 --> 02:05:45,010
They were,

4965
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,790
they were astrophysicist
is what they were.

4966
02:05:46,791 --> 02:05:47,210
And,

4967
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:47,801
and I was,

4968
02:05:47,801 --> 02:05:49,540
and I had a watch on that I had bought,

4969
02:05:49,541 --> 02:05:51,240
because I'm a fucking donkey I,

4970
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:51,851
and not this one,

4971
02:05:51,851 --> 02:05:53,050
but I had a watch on that.

4972
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:53,861
Allegedly,

4973
02:05:53,861 --> 02:05:55,960
the face of the watch
was made of moon rock.

4974
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:56,721
Yeah.

4975
02:05:56,721 --> 02:06:00,010
And it was a limited piece and all kinds
of horse float and must be if it's only

4976
02:06:00,011 --> 02:06:00,880
fucking from the moon,

4977
02:06:00,881 --> 02:06:01,110
right?

4978
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:03,580
Well until your crumb one basically.

4979
02:06:03,581 --> 02:06:05,140
And then they smudged it and whatever.

4980
02:06:05,410 --> 02:06:05,741
Anyway,

4981
02:06:05,741 --> 02:06:06,221
so I was like,

4982
02:06:06,221 --> 02:06:06,581
Hey,

4983
02:06:06,581 --> 02:06:06,791
uh,

4984
02:06:06,791 --> 02:06:08,950
so have we been to the moon
in this chick was like,

4985
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:11,140
no reason to lie to me whatsoever.

4986
02:06:11,650 --> 02:06:12,250
And she was like,

4987
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:12,761
they said,

4988
02:06:12,761 --> 02:06:13,300
we have.

4989
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:13,781
And I'm like,

4990
02:06:13,781 --> 02:06:14,614
what does that mean?

4991
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,491
And she goes,

4992
02:06:15,491 --> 02:06:15,911
they said,

4993
02:06:15,911 --> 02:06:16,301
we have.

4994
02:06:16,301 --> 02:06:16,601
And I go,

4995
02:06:16,601 --> 02:06:16,720
wait,

4996
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:17,500
I don't know what that means.

4997
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,041
They said,

4998
02:06:18,041 --> 02:06:18,874
we have accents.

4999
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:19,331
I go,

5000
02:06:19,331 --> 02:06:21,070
is it possible that
we've been to the moon?

5001
02:06:21,071 --> 02:06:21,291
She goes,

5002
02:06:21,291 --> 02:06:22,800
it's not possible that
we've been to the manic.

5003
02:06:22,810 --> 02:06:23,800
What do you mean it's not possible?

5004
02:06:23,801 --> 02:06:24,634
She goes,

5005
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:26,890
it's impossible to go to the moon.

5006
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:29,590
That because we can't get
past the radiation belt,

5007
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:30,101
the radiate,

5008
02:06:30,101 --> 02:06:34,720
we can't build a suit that will protect
humans from that radiation without their

5009
02:06:34,721 --> 02:06:36,760
skin falling off the
radiation on the moon?

5010
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,121
No,

5011
02:06:37,121 --> 02:06:39,130
the van Allen Radiation Belt between,

5012
02:06:39,131 --> 02:06:39,761
between,

5013
02:06:39,761 --> 02:06:40,930
between the moon and that.

5014
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,310
I'm no radiation,

5015
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:43,930
no radiation to expert.

5016
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:48,220
But I've heard it argued that you never
pass through the belt and in fact the

5017
02:06:48,221 --> 02:06:51,530
belt is like a donut and there's a hole
in the center and if you pass through

5018
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:52,373
you can do that.

5019
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:53,260
My issue with it,

5020
02:06:53,290 --> 02:06:53,561
the,

5021
02:06:53,561 --> 02:06:56,530
my number one issue is that
they never did anything to test.

5022
02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:59,800
They never even sent a chicken in this
space and see if it comes back alive.

5023
02:06:59,950 --> 02:07:00,271
No,

5024
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:00,601
no,

5025
02:07:00,601 --> 02:07:00,791
no.

5026
02:07:00,791 --> 02:07:02,950
Monkeys went into space
and then land the Russian.

5027
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:03,760
They,

5028
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,571
no one knew.

5029
02:07:04,571 --> 02:07:07,750
Like there was like extreme radiation
out there and in fact there's a thing

5030
02:07:07,751 --> 02:07:11,590
called the operation starfish prime where
they actually detonated a nuclear bomb

5031
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:15,340
in the magnetosphere because they were
trying to punch a hole through it and it

5032
02:07:15,341 --> 02:07:18,460
made it like they made
it way more radioactive.

5033
02:07:18,461 --> 02:07:19,171
Like they made the,

5034
02:07:19,171 --> 02:07:20,830
the van Allen radiation belts,

5035
02:07:20,831 --> 02:07:21,760
like more charts.

5036
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:22,780
It doesn't mean they still,

5037
02:07:22,781 --> 02:07:23,321
if there was a,

5038
02:07:23,321 --> 02:07:24,460
if it is a donut shape,

5039
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:26,410
apparently you can like fly through it,

5040
02:07:26,411 --> 02:07:30,190
but I would've liked to have seen someone
do it and you know all like a monkey

5041
02:07:30,191 --> 02:07:32,150
or something that said it.

5042
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:34,720
There's slingshot around
the fucking wound,

5043
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:35,621
there's all that.

5044
02:07:35,621 --> 02:07:36,081
And then the Gr,

5045
02:07:36,081 --> 02:07:37,180
I had my iPhone in my hand,

5046
02:07:37,181 --> 02:07:37,810
she goes,

5047
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:41,470
your iPhone has more technology and then
the entire room and NASA did back then.

5048
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,071
That's true.

5049
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,160
But that doesn't mean that they
couldn't make ample calculations.

5050
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:47,080
Even though even though your iPhone,

5051
02:07:47,210 --> 02:07:48,220
your iPhone is doing,

5052
02:07:48,221 --> 02:07:51,340
is interacting with a
graphic user interfaces,

5053
02:07:51,341 --> 02:07:53,710
there's a lot of processing going around.

5054
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:54,191
There's,

5055
02:07:54,191 --> 02:07:54,461
you know,

5056
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:55,121
there's signals,

5057
02:07:55,121 --> 02:07:55,811
it's picking up,

5058
02:07:55,811 --> 02:07:57,250
there's a lot of shit going on with that.

5059
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:58,750
They didn't have to do all that.

5060
02:07:58,780 --> 02:07:58,901
They,

5061
02:07:58,901 --> 02:08:00,100
all they had was numbers,

5062
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:00,401
right?

5063
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:02,820
Well there was the number so
they can physically calculated.

5064
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:04,023
However,

5065
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:08,650
all the equipment they had during the
space launch was the equivalent of that of

5066
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:09,330
like,

5067
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:13,240
like one 16th of an iPhone
in the whole facility.

5068
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:14,051
Not even that.

5069
02:08:14,051 --> 02:08:14,860
It wasn't even that.

5070
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:15,491
By the way,

5071
02:08:15,491 --> 02:08:16,061
it doesn't matter.

5072
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:19,360
They still could have done it because
they did do it without people for sure.

5073
02:08:19,361 --> 02:08:19,531
No,

5074
02:08:19,531 --> 02:08:19,780
no.

5075
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,710
So you know what I'm saying?

5076
02:08:20,711 --> 02:08:23,020
The calculations are not
that different space.

5077
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:24,070
You just can't send huge,

5078
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:24,580
well that's,

5079
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:25,170
that's the

5080
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:27,560
question is there's really been
no evidence they would ever,

5081
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:30,920
they were able to take biological
life into space and return it.

5082
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,830
There's been no evidence of that and
there has been evidence that they really

5083
02:08:33,831 --> 02:08:37,550
absolutely cannot predict solar flares
and all kinds of crazy shit that happens.

5084
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:38,960
Storms flare up.

5085
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:39,271
Yeah.

5086
02:08:39,271 --> 02:08:41,220
They may spark then predict.

5087
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:43,830
A lot of people believe that
people did land on the moon,

5088
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:44,760
but that the,

5089
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:48,180
they faked a lot of the footage and one
of the reasons for that is they did fake

5090
02:08:48,181 --> 02:08:49,500
a lot of footage at NASA.

5091
02:08:49,650 --> 02:08:52,650
Like there was some footage from Gemini
missions where they were practice

5092
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:54,030
clearly the same images,

5093
02:08:54,031 --> 02:08:56,820
exact same images in practice pictures,

5094
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:57,121
you know,

5095
02:08:57,121 --> 02:09:00,270
where they're like wearing suits and
hung by wires and then they black those

5096
02:09:00,271 --> 02:09:01,051
pictures out.

5097
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:02,670
The publicity people did and said,

5098
02:09:02,671 --> 02:09:04,020
and these people don't know any better,

5099
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:04,270
you know,

5100
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:06,750
was a a time of really extreme ignorance.

5101
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:07,111
You know,

5102
02:09:07,111 --> 02:09:08,820
people didn't have access to information.

5103
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:12,260
And so there's photos
of 'em Collins and uh,

5104
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:15,480
Michael Collins and he's a on this
and one of the Gemini missions.

5105
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:16,500
He's on this fucking a,

5106
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:19,920
it looks like he's in deep
space with the exact same photo,

5107
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:21,660
is him out of practice,

5108
02:09:21,661 --> 02:09:23,900
run hanging by wires and it's just date.

5109
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:25,740
Someone got overzealous and they said,

5110
02:09:25,741 --> 02:09:25,921
look,

5111
02:09:25,921 --> 02:09:26,970
here's a perfect picture.

5112
02:09:26,971 --> 02:09:27,601
Why ruin it?

5113
02:09:27,601 --> 02:09:28,650
Let's just put it in space.

5114
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,611
Tell people was there,

5115
02:09:29,611 --> 02:09:31,290
it's not like the guy didn't go to space.

5116
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,370
He absolutely did.

5117
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:32,671
Just,

5118
02:09:32,671 --> 02:09:35,220
they might not have been able to take
such good fucking pictures up there,

5119
02:09:35,370 --> 02:09:35,671
you know?

5120
02:09:35,671 --> 02:09:37,800
And so they faked a lot of shit.

5121
02:09:37,801 --> 02:09:42,510
And so that makes the whole thing fuzzy
because you look at it and you go psalms

5122
02:09:42,511 --> 02:09:43,141
wrong man,

5123
02:09:43,141 --> 02:09:43,741
something's wrong.

5124
02:09:43,741 --> 02:09:44,700
What the fuck is wrong?

5125
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:45,840
There's some shit here that's wrong.

5126
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:49,680
The reason why is I think a bunch of
the shit we're looking at probably was

5127
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:50,910
taking place in a studio.

5128
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:53,090
A lot of the photographs
are probably horseshit.

5129
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,360
It doesn't mean they didn't go.

5130
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:59,500
I don't mean to leave like derail
and debunk the whole fucking thing,

5131
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:02,910
but do you did with it?

5132
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:06,820
They did or whether they
didn't really matter.

5133
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:07,620
It does.

5134
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,453
It's fast.

5135
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:10,520
It absolutely Madison has.

5136
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:11,010
I want to

5137
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,740
find out if it's possible to pull
off a hoax of that magnitude.

5138
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:14,221
You know,

5139
02:10:14,221 --> 02:10:17,040
if you look about what the United States
had been capable of doing as far as

5140
02:10:17,041 --> 02:10:19,810
like getting us into wars
under false pretenses,

5141
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:20,761
corruption,

5142
02:10:20,761 --> 02:10:21,510
all the bullshit,

5143
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:24,120
you wonder how far it
is possible to take it.

5144
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:27,070
We know it's possible to
create war gag doubly.

5145
02:10:27,090 --> 02:10:27,331
That's,

5146
02:10:27,331 --> 02:10:28,230
we got brains.

5147
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,200
Arguably that's way crazier than
putting someone on the moon.

5148
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:32,423
Arguably,

5149
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,240
uh,

5150
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,160
letting people,

5151
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:35,060
you know,

5152
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:39,500
figuring out how to trick a gigantic
chunk of people to go into another part of

5153
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:42,350
the world and kill people
for you seems to be,

5154
02:10:42,351 --> 02:10:43,520
if you're going to fake that,

5155
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:45,000
you're going to fake an
operation to get into that.

5156
02:10:45,001 --> 02:10:46,400
You're going to bullshit
your way into that.

5157
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:48,140
That seems like the moon landing.

5158
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:48,441
It's like,

5159
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:49,310
it's like nothing.

5160
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,560
It's nothing in comparison.

5161
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:50,700
Yeah,

5162
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:51,170
cause you can't,

5163
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:51,831
you can't prove,

5164
02:10:51,831 --> 02:10:54,350
I didn't even see this shit
coming when I came here today.

5165
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:54,920
See,

5166
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:55,371
honestly,

5167
02:10:55,371 --> 02:10:57,080
moon landing shit wasn't real,

5168
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,860
was it not?

5169
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:00,200
I was not in the back of my mind.

5170
02:11:00,730 --> 02:11:01,563
It wasn't in mine,

5171
02:11:01,710 --> 02:11:03,470
but I forgot the Russells of Mungai.

5172
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:03,711
Look,

5173
02:11:03,711 --> 02:11:03,871
I,

5174
02:11:03,871 --> 02:11:04,131
I've,

5175
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:06,350
I've argued with people and
I absolutely don't know.

5176
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,980
I don't know.

5177
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:07,311
I don't,

5178
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:12,311
I don't believe you are totally down
for you or the moon hoax crusade or no,

5179
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:15,131
no,

5180
02:11:15,131 --> 02:11:15,261
no,

5181
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:15,370
no,

5182
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:15,571
no,

5183
02:11:15,571 --> 02:11:15,751
no,

5184
02:11:15,751 --> 02:11:15,861
no,

5185
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:15,990
no,

5186
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,250
no.

5187
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:16,581
Listen,

5188
02:11:16,581 --> 02:11:16,851
listen,

5189
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:17,400
man.

5190
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:18,260
Here's my issue.

5191
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:20,210
My issue is how can I even argue it?

5192
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,400
How is it possible that
I even have points?

5193
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:25,060
How is it possible that anybody
had ever heard of the moons?

5194
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,890
You see breezy right there,

5195
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:28,250
fucking all this shit.

5196
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,720
I hope someone did go to the moon.

5197
02:11:29,721 --> 02:11:30,560
I hope someone did.

5198
02:11:30,561 --> 02:11:31,370
I really do.

5199
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:32,750
I don't know if they didn't,

5200
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:36,410
but I do know that it's weird that it's
the only time in human history where

5201
02:11:36,411 --> 02:11:38,660
people have been more than 400
feet above the earth's surface.

5202
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:40,460
No other space shuttle mission,

5203
02:11:40,461 --> 02:11:41,870
no other space station mission.

5204
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:43,400
Nothing goes any higher than that.

5205
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:44,060
That's it.

5206
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:49,060
But they went 260,000 miles out and then
return to earth man when they did in

5207
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:53,550
1969 to 1972 I know if I had a boss,

5208
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:54,800
a bit of a head fuck,

5209
02:11:54,801 --> 02:11:55,700
can't do it now.

5210
02:11:55,701 --> 02:11:56,090
We haven't,

5211
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:56,923
haven't had flux.

5212
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:59,930
It's a bit of a head fuck now when
they talk about going to the moon,

5213
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,340
George W.

5214
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:01,350
Bush,

5215
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:03,290
why do that lady,

5216
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:04,133
why don't,

5217
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:08,450
why don't we just released like a two
k 13 edition of going to the moon and

5218
02:12:08,451 --> 02:12:08,630
back?

5219
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:08,950
Well,

5220
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:10,540
you know you do a of the day,

5221
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:11,061
first of all,

5222
02:12:11,061 --> 02:12:11,660
he can't.

5223
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:12,291
They say the,

5224
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:14,450
our technology is much more improved now,

5225
02:12:14,451 --> 02:12:17,180
so they would have to read easier,

5226
02:12:17,181 --> 02:12:21,350
can't you would say so they can't use
the Saturn five rockets though because

5227
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:22,460
that's like an old model.

5228
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:25,280
They don't want to just recreate what
worked in the 60s they want to apply

5229
02:12:25,281 --> 02:12:29,780
modern technology and a printer and then
now might've monitoring too fucked up.

5230
02:12:29,781 --> 02:12:31,820
Playing devil's advocate
to the extreme here,

5231
02:12:31,821 --> 02:12:32,670
I never pretended I,

5232
02:12:32,671 --> 02:12:34,060
I don't know what the fuck happened.

5233
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:35,323
Wouldn't mind

5234
02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:38,840
fucking artists to perform on the moon.

5235
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:42,080
It would be pretty dope if we could
actually go to the moon if it was safe.

5236
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:42,681
You know,

5237
02:12:42,681 --> 02:12:43,514
I don't know

5238
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:50,210
if you've seen the photos that they had
that they had a lunar rover orbiter to

5239
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,053
took photos,

5240
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:51,831
whatever the fuck it was.

5241
02:12:51,831 --> 02:12:53,720
The Mars orbiter.

5242
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:56,810
Now they took photos of the moon and they
showed like the little spots where the

5243
02:12:56,811 --> 02:13:01,811
astronauts were walking like fair
footprints fucking way in 50 eggs.

5244
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:04,940
It looks fake as fuck.

5245
02:13:04,941 --> 02:13:06,560
Like what the footprints
are you still there,

5246
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:07,823
Shannon?

5247
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:11,810
Romain agnostic to do to the whole.

5248
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,650
I do too.

5249
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:13,910
I would think it would
be hilarious though,

5250
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:14,450
is if,

5251
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,520
even if we actually did go to the moon,

5252
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:20,210
if some overzealous
NASA fucking freak said,

5253
02:13:20,211 --> 02:13:20,541
listen,

5254
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:22,330
these hoaxers who got
to fucking show them,

5255
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:24,950
I'm going to show a nonpartisan.

5256
02:13:24,990 --> 02:13:25,823
Yeah.

5257
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:26,561
Third parties.

5258
02:13:26,561 --> 02:13:27,590
It's gotta be a third party.

5259
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:31,560
Can't be a third party because he won't
let anybody go anywhere near the sites.

5260
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:32,150
There's,

5261
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:35,760
they've declared a ban on
flyovers of all the moons sites.

5262
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:38,250
This is true because they
don't want to disturb the area.

5263
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:39,210
This is absolutely true.

5264
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:40,000
Obama's pastor,

5265
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,400
so the optics Sadat allowed
the other countries like India,

5266
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:47,190
go see a picture of
that epic landing spot.

5267
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:47,761
Can't go there.

5268
02:13:47,761 --> 02:13:49,260
You can't fly over and take a picture

5269
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:54,600
that seems suspect a little bit.

5270
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:55,500
It does a little bit.

5271
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:55,921
You know,

5272
02:13:55,921 --> 02:13:56,290
I look,

5273
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:57,510
I've argued with it.

5274
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,403
I don't,

5275
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,400
I've argued with it.

5276
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:03,840
I've argued with this Guy Phil plait from
bad astronomy.com and he's a great guy

5277
02:14:03,841 --> 02:14:06,480
and I really wished I didn't have
to argue with them cause I love,

5278
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:09,120
I love so much of the
Shitty says like I love his,

5279
02:14:09,121 --> 02:14:09,954
his speeches.

5280
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:11,670
He did a Ted talk on asteroids.

5281
02:14:11,671 --> 02:14:13,180
It was fucking awesome what did meet you?

5282
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:15,090
But it was his problem with me.

5283
02:14:15,091 --> 02:14:15,470
It's,

5284
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:16,950
they're so proud about it,

5285
02:14:16,951 --> 02:14:17,100
man.

5286
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:18,190
I didn't talk to him about it.

5287
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:21,420
Is that,

5288
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:22,660
how funny is that?

5289
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:28,020
What are the greatest theoretical
physicists in the world guys?

5290
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:28,381
An idiot.

5291
02:14:28,381 --> 02:14:29,214
That's awesome.

5292
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:30,330
That was awesome.

5293
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,230
You know?

5294
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:31,740
Um,

5295
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:34,290
I think it's a major fucking guy.

5296
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,940
Just a silly to me right now.

5297
02:14:35,941 --> 02:14:36,241
He's like,

5298
02:14:36,241 --> 02:14:36,511
dude,

5299
02:14:36,511 --> 02:14:38,430
you remember we got the
Grammy's smile at night.

5300
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:39,121
I'm like,

5301
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:39,361
dude,

5302
02:14:39,361 --> 02:14:39,871
I got it.

5303
02:14:39,871 --> 02:14:40,680
We good?

5304
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:43,390
Is he in the guy on the
couch texted to fuck.

5305
02:14:43,490 --> 02:14:45,270
He's going to text you
while it shows going on.

5306
02:14:45,271 --> 02:14:48,420
You can actually like come over here
and fucking tapped me on the shoulder.

5307
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:49,120
How dare here,

5308
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:50,100
but I'm going to text him back.

5309
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:50,910
I'm asleep.

5310
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,480
I'm good.

5311
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,860
Wait to go captain corporate.

5312
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:54,090
Thanks Dean.

5313
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:56,340
Isn't it funny you have
like some babysitter?

5314
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:57,210
I do.

5315
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,320
I hear a grown man.

5316
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:00,480
Well I can.

5317
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,313
That's ridiculous.

5318
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,440
You're skinny enough to not have to
worry about looking puffy in the morning.

5319
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:07,620
Why are you worried about this
tow that guy to go to sleep?

5320
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:09,303
It was ridiculous.

5321
02:15:09,730 --> 02:15:11,610
That two hot chicks beside him.

5322
02:15:11,611 --> 02:15:12,140
Why does your,

5323
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:13,710
does your manager normally do this?

5324
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,090
D come here,

5325
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:16,290
come here dean.

5326
02:15:16,291 --> 02:15:17,610
This is ridiculous behavior.

5327
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:21,310
No Dean come here right now because
that was my manager I blocked.

5328
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:24,210
You know how to call a cab the fuck bro.

5329
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:25,200
He doesn't want to come over.

5330
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:25,421
What are,

5331
02:15:25,421 --> 02:15:26,430
you know Joe and sue,

5332
02:15:26,431 --> 02:15:27,270
that Guy Breezy.

5333
02:15:27,271 --> 02:15:29,190
He's really smart with this fucking space.

5334
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:30,024
Shit.

5335
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:30,400
Dean,

5336
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,233
come here.

5337
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:33,153
Come here.

5338
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:35,130
Fuck Dean.

5339
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:35,963
Dean come.

5340
02:15:36,150 --> 02:15:40,350
Unless you want me to like drastically
renegotiate my management contract.

5341
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:43,600
I really think it's in your best
interest that you come here.

5342
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,680
Come here dean to dean.

5343
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:47,653
Dean.

5344
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:51,040
Better yet have on you

5345
02:15:51,190 --> 02:15:52,180
diamond rings.

5346
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:53,920
That's this guy right here.

5347
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:55,533
Come on.

5348
02:15:55,690 --> 02:15:56,523
Come on.

5349
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:57,993
Oh,

5350
02:15:58,270 --> 02:15:59,440
he can talk from there.

5351
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:00,840
Dean has an English accent.

5352
02:16:00,841 --> 02:16:02,130
Did you find him in Liverpool?

5353
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:02,371
No,

5354
02:16:02,371 --> 02:16:03,780
actually I found them in Kent,

5355
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:05,260
which don't call him a cat.

5356
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:08,820
It can avoid saying you fucking can't.

5357
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,101
There's,

5358
02:16:09,101 --> 02:16:11,040
they'll call it an accident
in the world in English.

5359
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:12,030
In my opinion,

5360
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:12,893
those Guy Richie,

5361
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:14,780
I really walk and love those.

5362
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:16,080
Do you know why they get the getaway?

5363
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:17,353
That's why.

5364
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:18,420
Do you have that camera?

5365
02:16:18,421 --> 02:16:19,254
Can I

5366
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,640
guide where she made a movie a year?

5367
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:24,520
It would be very happy

5368
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:27,660
cow shit over there on the right.

5369
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:28,050
Yeah,

5370
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:28,341
I did.

5371
02:16:28,341 --> 02:16:29,020
Somebody come here,

5372
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:29,920
I'll do a night vision.

5373
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,431
No,

5374
02:16:30,431 --> 02:16:30,611
no.

5375
02:16:30,611 --> 02:16:31,190
Just painting.

5376
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:32,410
It was one of the odd dude.

5377
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:33,310
He doesn't want it to be on.

5378
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:34,220
Let's just say shit.

5379
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:36,060
Why you are so into I have anything.

5380
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:38,610
No more alcohol for dads was,

5381
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:40,400
see there he is right there.

5382
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:42,650
Right there.

5383
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,483
Right there.

5384
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:45,910
You're like a van Halen on Dean Howard.

5385
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:51,450
Dean says Dean Dean this let this be a
lesson to not be texting me and telling

5386
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:52,150
them what to do.

5387
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:54,070
He says he doesn't like that shit shade.

5388
02:16:54,530 --> 02:16:59,530
We gotta be Outta here at nine in the
morning so don't get too wasted or are you

5389
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:02,090

5390
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:05,840

nine in the morning cause I got to go do

5391
02:17:05,841 --> 02:17:08,270
another run through with the foo fighters.

5392
02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:09,241
Yeah,

5393
02:17:09,241 --> 02:17:09,631
but dude,

5394
02:17:09,631 --> 02:17:11,170
it's only one 40 what's though?

5395
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,821
I got it.

5396
02:17:11,821 --> 02:17:12,654
I got it.

5397
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:14,331
When did you get got it?

5398
02:17:14,331 --> 02:17:15,440
I've been doing this for a while.

5399
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:17,310
I know how to hit a space bar.

5400
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:18,120
Yeah,

5401
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:18,953
I really do.

5402
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:23,010
Fucking today shit up fucking guy.

5403
02:17:23,011 --> 02:17:23,521
He knows,

5404
02:17:23,521 --> 02:17:24,330
you know.

5405
02:17:24,330 --> 02:17:24,860
Yeah,

5406
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:25,500
no,

5407
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,150
it's really cool.

5408
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,281
We're,

5409
02:17:26,281 --> 02:17:27,930
we're doing this like really crazy

5410
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:29,660
cool shit with the foo fighters,

5411
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:30,800
which is amazing.

5412
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:31,520
Um,

5413
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:33,290
because they basically gave me like a,

5414
02:17:33,291 --> 02:17:34,071
like a,

5415
02:17:34,071 --> 02:17:34,311
you know,

5416
02:17:34,311 --> 02:17:35,144
when you go to a hotel,

5417
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:37,190
you got like a shit fucking after night,

5418
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:39,020
like service menu.

5419
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:39,710
Yes.

5420
02:17:39,710 --> 02:17:44,180
Margarito or tuna melt
or something bullshit.

5421
02:17:44,210 --> 02:17:44,721
You know what I mean?

5422
02:17:44,721 --> 02:17:46,160
That's kind of what they offered me,

5423
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:47,060
you know.

5424
02:17:47,060 --> 02:17:47,840
And uh,

5425
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:50,180
at the end of the day there
was something I really wanted,

5426
02:17:50,181 --> 02:17:50,540
you know,

5427
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:50,991
and they said,

5428
02:17:50,991 --> 02:17:51,824
well,

5429
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:55,340
in order to perform on the Grammy's you
have to perform as someone who's also

5430
02:17:55,341 --> 02:17:56,600
nominated and all that stuff.

5431
02:17:56,601 --> 02:17:57,380
And uh,

5432
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:58,430
the foo fighters were,

5433
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:01,820
and I had recently done a
remix for the foo fighters.

5434
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:02,630
Ah,

5435
02:18:02,630 --> 02:18:03,110
shit,

5436
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:04,010
this is my saving grace.

5437
02:18:04,011 --> 02:18:08,810
I don't have to like get like pigeonholed
with this like Edm segregation from

5438
02:18:08,811 --> 02:18:09,471
the Grammy's,

5439
02:18:09,471 --> 02:18:13,670
cause it almost like it's
still early according to,

5440
02:18:13,671 --> 02:18:14,270
you know,

5441
02:18:14,270 --> 02:18:16,650
pop culture and United States
and all that surrounds us.

5442
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,210
The A's.

5443
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:17,570
Yeah.

5444
02:18:17,570 --> 02:18:21,950
So it's gonna always going to be that
like sideshow thing and a tent outside of

5445
02:18:21,951 --> 02:18:23,150
the big main show,

5446
02:18:23,151 --> 02:18:23,810
you know?

5447
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:24,261
And they were like,

5448
02:18:24,261 --> 02:18:24,441
well,

5449
02:18:24,441 --> 02:18:27,410
who you want to perform with
and here's your list of options,

5450
02:18:27,411 --> 02:18:27,711
you know,

5451
02:18:27,711 --> 02:18:29,840
so it's like the late
night room service menu,

5452
02:18:29,841 --> 02:18:30,674
you know,

5453
02:18:31,730 --> 02:18:32,563
I don't know what I want,

5454
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:34,971
you know,

5455
02:18:34,971 --> 02:18:38,930
but I had done a collaboration
with the fuse foods in the past.

5456
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:41,690
Is that what you call the foo fighters?

5457
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:48,660
You look really deep inside that
you can call them the foods.

5458
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,120
You're really in there when you really,

5459
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:54,973
yeah,

5460
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,661
he really is.

5461
02:18:56,661 --> 02:18:57,560
Who's baby?

5462
02:18:57,561 --> 02:18:58,394
Let me call you.

5463
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:59,720
Can I call you guys foods?

5464
02:18:59,721 --> 02:19:00,400
You were right.

5465
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:01,970
They were traumatic tonight.

5466
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:03,591
Yeah,

5467
02:19:03,591 --> 02:19:04,424
he's definitely tough.

5468
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:06,040
That whole,

5469
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:06,680
the whole day

5470
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:07,461
thing was cool,

5471
02:19:07,461 --> 02:19:07,791
you know?

5472
02:19:07,791 --> 02:19:10,880
And we had done this really
big long European run where,

5473
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:11,271
you know,

5474
02:19:11,271 --> 02:19:15,410
basically rock group is playing across
the stage from where I was playing at the

5475
02:19:15,411 --> 02:19:16,244
same time.

5476
02:19:16,430 --> 02:19:17,780
So of course Dave's always like,

5477
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:19,130
oh fuck you know,

5478
02:19:19,131 --> 02:19:22,130
computers and all this and there's
real rock and roll and then you know,

5479
02:19:22,131 --> 02:19:22,611
and they play.

5480
02:19:22,611 --> 02:19:24,650
And then I'd be playing it at
the same time and all this stuff.

5481
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,653
And

5482
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,010
like you were competing pretty

5483
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,240
much pretty much for like,

5484
02:19:29,241 --> 02:19:31,250
and how big is this place
where you're playing in?

5485
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:31,611
Oh,

5486
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:34,640
Puco pop or about 160,000 strong.

5487
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:35,180
Okay.

5488
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:37,130
So there's competing signals.

5489
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:38,330
So there's like your,

5490
02:19:38,331 --> 02:19:40,260
your sound is coming from one side,

5491
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:42,160
his age and his friend the other.

5492
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:42,491
Yeah,

5493
02:19:42,491 --> 02:19:42,930
you bunny.

5494
02:19:42,930 --> 02:19:46,520
It was absolutely amazing and it was
such a terror because it was like,

5495
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:47,271
you know,

5496
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:51,770
because the Edm thing and the whole
movement you want cross you and Edm,

5497
02:19:51,771 --> 02:19:55,220
electronic dance music and I guess
what the kids like to call these days.

5498
02:19:55,890 --> 02:19:57,380
You used to call it euro trash bag,

5499
02:19:57,710 --> 02:19:58,121
right?

5500
02:19:58,121 --> 02:19:59,120
Well now we still do.

5501
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:00,080
Yeah.

5502
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:01,190
How did it evolve in Europe?

5503
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:02,030
What happened then?

5504
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:02,181
Well,

5505
02:20:02,181 --> 02:20:02,800
it started right?

5506
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,300
House music started in Chicago.

5507
02:20:04,301 --> 02:20:05,740
Well they say technically Detroit,

5508
02:20:05,741 --> 02:20:06,574
Detroit,

5509
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:07,781
Detroit.

5510
02:20:07,781 --> 02:20:10,540
Then it moved to Chicago
and Kraftwerk got good.

5511
02:20:10,541 --> 02:20:10,901
And then,

5512
02:20:10,901 --> 02:20:12,100
oh Kraftwerk yet true.

5513
02:20:12,101 --> 02:20:12,550
Troy,

5514
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:15,320
Kraftwerk was kind of like
the groundwork for like the,

5515
02:20:15,370 --> 02:20:18,490
for like a planet rock
and all the hip hop shit.

5516
02:20:18,491 --> 02:20:19,324
And then,

5517
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:23,710
and then house music started in like
[inaudible] 82 83 with Steve Silk Hurley.

5518
02:20:23,711 --> 02:20:24,544
Would you agree with that,

5519
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:25,360
Jack?

5520
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:26,193
Your body at all?

5521
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:29,400
Pete is dropping

5522
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:36,370
a little bit and then in around 1989 90
is when Europe got ahold of it and then

5523
02:20:38,371 --> 02:20:42,510
that's when it started to really take
a shit is because the white Europeans

5524
02:20:42,511 --> 02:20:42,960
would like,

5525
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:45,430
this is too fucking smooth and
mellow and then they would add the,

5526
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:46,500
we are a wow.

5527
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:47,823
Wow,

5528
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:48,350
wow,

5529
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:48,720
wow.

5530
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,980
That's when acid house and fucking hip
house and all this shit started and

5531
02:20:52,981 --> 02:20:53,581
that's when I was like,

5532
02:20:53,581 --> 02:20:56,780
what are you doing to this fucking
great house music and then it would like

5533
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,470
been around.

5534
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:58,303
Wow.

5535
02:20:58,440 --> 02:20:59,273
Wow.

5536
02:20:59,280 --> 02:20:59,601
Wow.

5537
02:20:59,601 --> 02:21:00,520
I won't be around.

5538
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,673
Wow.

5539
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:03,100
Where's my sampler when I met?

5540
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:03,770
Oh,

5541
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,603
why?

5542
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:05,850
I have a nice hot heaters,

5543
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:11,330
so much more about music and
macular hole to disco 2.0 brilliant.

5544
02:21:11,641 --> 02:21:12,091
It was,

5545
02:21:12,091 --> 02:21:12,510
yeah,

5546
02:21:12,510 --> 02:21:13,040
it was.

5547
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:13,861
It was electronic.

5548
02:21:13,861 --> 02:21:14,510
Disco is whatever.

5549
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:15,540
What I'll tell you what man,

5550
02:21:15,541 --> 02:21:18,180
every now and then someone will play this
Saturday night fever soundtrack and I

5551
02:21:18,181 --> 02:21:18,390
go,

5552
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:23,390
God damn is some good fucking jams in
that song on that track or that CD and not

5553
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:24,811
a woman.

5554
02:21:24,811 --> 02:21:25,200
It's true.

5555
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:26,700
Just some tremendous songs.

5556
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:30,150
If you could just put yourself back in
the mindset of the people that were lit

5557
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:30,750
alive.

5558
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:32,520
She was the day it was the shit sign.

5559
02:21:32,521 --> 02:21:34,410
The fucking beat done some harmonies.

5560
02:21:34,411 --> 02:21:35,100
It's ever hit.

5561
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:36,090
All of that shit.

5562
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:39,650
They were singing like France
nerd Fulan who was the,

5563
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:43,440
who can tell by the way
that I use my walker door.

5564
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:46,490

5565
02:21:49,350 --> 02:21:50,183
Yeah.

5566
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:55,080
I in the call center was amazing.

5567
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:56,120

5569
02:21:56,910 --> 02:22:01,240
I can't have you if I can't have you in
second grade or grade two as we know it.

5570
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:05,570
That stuff was the second
grade I audition was,

5571
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:10,610
might not hold up in my talent show with
like if I can ask you Yvonne Element

5572
02:22:11,910 --> 02:22:13,560
interesting fact about Yvonne Element,

5573
02:22:13,561 --> 02:22:14,940
the first Filipino singer.

5574
02:22:15,060 --> 02:22:15,830
Really?

5575
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:16,340
Wow.

5576
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:18,980
Why was singing that in bodies,

5577
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:20,010
that song though to body.

5578
02:22:20,011 --> 02:22:21,160
She also sang Wang,

5579
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:21,770

5580
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:22,190

5582
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:24,200
Oh Wow.

5583
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:25,620
Who Do you think you are?

5584
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,873
No.

5585
02:22:27,630 --> 02:22:28,440
What was that song,

5586
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:29,273
uh,

5587
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:30,330
in,

5588
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:31,163
uh,

5589
02:22:31,210 --> 02:22:32,043
sorry.

5590
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:34,710
I was the fuck was it called a

5591
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:36,530
damn.

5592
02:22:36,530 --> 02:22:37,271
I was in the metal.

5593
02:22:37,271 --> 02:22:38,920
I wasn't in the end of that disco shit,

5594
02:22:38,921 --> 02:22:39,754
man.

5595
02:22:40,210 --> 02:22:41,070
I've always loved,

5596
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:44,500
I've always loved all kinds of music.

5597
02:22:45,070 --> 02:22:45,910
I love disco.

5598
02:22:45,911 --> 02:22:46,744
I was a kid,

5599
02:22:47,620 --> 02:22:52,620
I was a huge kiss kiss in 82 on the last
two with makeup and the F and ps three.

5600
02:22:53,170 --> 02:22:56,050
And the reason I turned that in
the first tour without makeup,

5601
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:57,973
it was the same.

5602
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:00,520
It was the same tank.

5603
02:23:00,521 --> 02:23:03,930
Remember I talk kiss this year
for the first time last year.

5604
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,650
The Gardens?

5605
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:07,800
Yeah,

5606
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:08,633
it was the same tank.

5607
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:13,420
Did they blow shit up with the
raking one speaker blew out.

5608
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:18,590
I saw them when I was kid and I met ace
freely without his makeup when I was

5609
02:23:18,591 --> 02:23:19,460
like eight years old,

5610
02:23:19,461 --> 02:23:20,440
a gun in his skin was

5611
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:27,290
full makeup like in the whole thing and
everything raise crazy pock marks on his

5612
02:23:27,291 --> 02:23:28,124
face.

5613
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:29,533
French fries.

5614
02:23:29,570 --> 02:23:30,021
I was like,

5615
02:23:30,021 --> 02:23:30,831
when I was a kid,

5616
02:23:30,831 --> 02:23:33,350
my uncle worked for
Howard marks advertising,

5617
02:23:33,351 --> 02:23:35,620
which was the company that
used to make the album covers.

5618
02:23:35,630 --> 02:23:36,300
Fosters,

5619
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:36,531
no,

5620
02:23:36,531 --> 02:23:38,250
it wasn't a Manhattan and uh,

5621
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:38,721
yeah,

5622
02:23:38,721 --> 02:23:39,800
my uncle and his friend.

5623
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:40,741
Yeah,

5624
02:23:40,741 --> 02:23:42,890
my uncle and his friend Dennis Dude.

5625
02:23:42,891 --> 02:23:43,724

5626
02:23:44,260 --> 02:23:45,980
So my uncle used to make,

5627
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:46,833

5628
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,050
they used to make these album covers.

5629
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:50,741
You'll let us,

5630
02:23:50,741 --> 02:23:51,270
Eddie,

5631
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:52,103
uh,

5632
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,310
Peter Criss and uh,

5633
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:54,941
Gene Simmons,

5634
02:23:54,941 --> 02:23:56,560
all his guys would stop by and I was a,

5635
02:23:56,561 --> 02:23:59,050
I was there with him one
day at world my friend.

5636
02:23:59,830 --> 02:24:00,131
All right.

5637
02:24:00,131 --> 02:24:00,964
Forget having a cover.

5638
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:02,753
Right.

5639
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:06,453
I'm listening to,

5640
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:07,990
I think that's amazing.

5641
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:10,150
There's no more stories to be told.

5642
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:11,050
I think that's awesome.

5643
02:24:11,051 --> 02:24:14,200
I think that's a unique
story that no one knows.

5644
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,750
We missed it.

5645
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:15,970
Yeah.

5646
02:24:15,970 --> 02:24:16,451
You missed it.

5647
02:24:16,451 --> 02:24:17,560
And then you were talking over me.

5648
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:18,260
You know,

5649
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:21,820
gene gene was at the Improv a couple of
weeks ago with Shannon and I happened to

5650
02:24:21,821 --> 02:24:25,960
be on that night and gene did a gene did
a quote from my book that was released

5651
02:24:25,961 --> 02:24:26,530
in Canada.

5652
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:27,011
Oh really?

5653
02:24:27,011 --> 02:24:27,450
Wow.

5654
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:29,410
And he didn't even fucking know he did it.

5655
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:31,061
No,

5656
02:24:31,061 --> 02:24:31,241
no.

5657
02:24:31,241 --> 02:24:32,740
Like for the back of the book it was like,

5658
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:33,430
Oh,

5659
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:34,490
Russell is a,

5660
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:35,770
is a very handsome man.

5661
02:24:35,771 --> 02:24:35,950
Aye.

5662
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:36,390
Aye.

5663
02:24:36,390 --> 02:24:37,150
Aye.

5664
02:24:37,150 --> 02:24:39,870
I imagine he would be very popular
in Israel is what the quote was.

5665
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,920
I wonder about that sometimes.

5666
02:24:42,921 --> 02:24:44,750
What am I going to do when
I get in fucking jail?

5667
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:46,513
Jail.

5668
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:49,250
I have no plans on being in jail.

5669
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:50,480
Dead mouse and drink

5670
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:54,320
red band.

5671
02:24:54,730 --> 02:24:57,160
Ben Over here brought up an
interesting fucking point.

5672
02:24:57,161 --> 02:24:57,911
As a matter of fact,

5673
02:24:57,911 --> 02:24:58,744
he said,

5674
02:24:58,750 --> 02:24:59,111
he said,

5675
02:24:59,111 --> 02:24:59,381
dude,

5676
02:24:59,381 --> 02:25:01,330
have you ever seen any prison tattoos?

5677
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,321
And I'm like,

5678
02:25:02,321 --> 02:25:03,070
whoa.

5679
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:03,521
No,

5680
02:25:03,521 --> 02:25:04,061
not really.

5681
02:25:04,061 --> 02:25:08,110
Like you know the fucking
bag that Henning there.

5682
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:11,320
I thought and I thought for
a minute we'll wait a minute.

5683
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:15,730
What if I do some like dodgy thing that
does actually end me up in fucking jail?

5684
02:25:15,970 --> 02:25:18,820
Am I going to be like someone's
bitch or am I going to be,

5685
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:19,720
oh dude,

5686
02:25:19,721 --> 02:25:20,554
that's that mouse.

5687
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:23,640
You better hope it's
metro west a little bit.

5688
02:25:23,641 --> 02:25:24,474
Yeah,

5689
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:25,290
right.

5690
02:25:25,290 --> 02:25:26,123
Yeah.

5691
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,860
Well let me know like I guess
the Safeway we'd be going,

5692
02:25:29,861 --> 02:25:32,680
it's just don't do anything that
would warrant you being in jail.

5693
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,750
Pay Your taxes and don't fuck people.

5694
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:35,693
Right?

5695
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:36,281
Yeah.

5696
02:25:36,281 --> 02:25:36,581
Okay,

5697
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:36,850
cool.

5698
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:39,380
I can do more with Eddie and joke.

5699
02:25:39,381 --> 02:25:40,750
No more rape for you.

5700
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:41,420
Yeah,

5701
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:42,400
I might be a bitch.

5702
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,650
I think I wouldn't be like
in general if I were to

5703
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:52,000
come across the fucking place right now.

5704
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,960
It's a lot of talking over and buy some.

5705
02:25:55,640 --> 02:25:56,730
It's a lie talking room.

5706
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:57,400
Sorry.

5707
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:59,200
There's a lot of drunk
going on in this room.

5708
02:25:59,710 --> 02:25:59,891
No,

5709
02:25:59,891 --> 02:26:00,340
there's no,

5710
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:00,581
no,

5711
02:26:00,581 --> 02:26:00,761
no,

5712
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:00,911
no.

5713
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:03,940
There's a lot of talking over
everybody cause everybody's drunk.

5714
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:05,820
No,

5715
02:26:05,820 --> 02:26:06,910
it's a fucking mediator.

5716
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:08,030
I'm sorry.

5717
02:26:08,030 --> 02:26:08,580
Continued.

5718
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:08,770
No,

5719
02:26:08,770 --> 02:26:10,870
I'm just saying it is true drastically.

5720
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:11,860
Now.

5721
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:13,690
How often do you do podcasts?

5722
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:14,973
Podcasts?

5723
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,000
This is my first one.

5724
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:19,510
I'm birds and it's just
like when you went,

5725
02:26:19,511 --> 02:26:21,490
when I know we're all
having a conversation.

5726
02:26:22,530 --> 02:26:25,840
If we were all hanging out
and smoking weed and drinking,

5727
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:27,160
we'd have a conversation.

5728
02:26:27,161 --> 02:26:31,370
It would be a lot like this cluster fuck
between four guys less the smoking will

5729
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:32,860
we have for you,

5730
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:33,581
for you,

5731
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:35,240
for ways for Eddie and I,

5732
02:26:35,241 --> 02:26:36,130
it would be twice as much.

5733
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:38,830
We'd so we'd bounce you out anyway.

5734
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:41,410
We would be able to hear each other talk.

5735
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:41,651
Right.

5736
02:26:41,651 --> 02:26:41,831
You know,

5737
02:26:41,831 --> 02:26:43,240
that's what you got to do with a podcast.

5738
02:26:43,241 --> 02:26:45,550
You've got to be cognizant and other
people were talking at the same time.

5739
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:46,160
What,

5740
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,080
Hey Joel,

5741
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:50,670
have you ever had an eight?

5742
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:54,150
What was your favorite show
that you've ever done that,

5743
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,140
but we broke it so you'd
have like a concert fix it.

5744
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:59,320
Do you have a concert that is like,

5745
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,160
do you have a content?

5746
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:02,930
Like you're your most memorable?

5747
02:27:02,931 --> 02:27:04,910
Do you have like something
that you always think of?

5748
02:27:04,911 --> 02:27:08,240
Like that was the best
time I ever had at a show.

5749
02:27:08,270 --> 02:27:10,740
Like that was the one show that,

5750
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:11,021
that,

5751
02:27:11,021 --> 02:27:13,220
that blew all the others out of the water.

5752
02:27:13,230 --> 02:27:13,840
Shit.

5753
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:14,421
That dude.

5754
02:27:14,421 --> 02:27:14,651
Yeah.

5755
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:14,961
Yeah.

5756
02:27:14,961 --> 02:27:16,940
I mean I don't,

5757
02:27:16,941 --> 02:27:18,710
because he knew I could
say anything right now.

5758
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:21,800
It would only pertain to that group
and then that would be gospel.

5759
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:22,430
Right.

5760
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:23,263
And that's fucked up.

5761
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:25,770
But you do have one in your
head and you just don't want it.

5762
02:27:26,410 --> 02:27:26,681
No,

5763
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:26,791
I'm,

5764
02:27:26,791 --> 02:27:26,931
I'm,

5765
02:27:26,931 --> 02:27:28,030
I'm thinking right now.

5766
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:28,560
Well,

5767
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:28,990
you know what?

5768
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:30,250
Anytime in red rocks,

5769
02:27:30,251 --> 02:27:31,580
whenever I put play at restaurants,

5770
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:32,441
amazing place ever,

5771
02:27:32,441 --> 02:27:32,950
right?

5772
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:33,850
Absolutely is.

5773
02:27:33,851 --> 02:27:34,151
Yeah,

5774
02:27:34,151 --> 02:27:34,391
yeah,

5775
02:27:34,391 --> 02:27:34,661
yeah.

5776
02:27:34,661 --> 02:27:35,494
Red Rocks.

5777
02:27:35,690 --> 02:27:37,150
Did you notice outside of Denver?

5778
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:39,850
It's carved into a side of a mountain.

5779
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:41,410
It's like an amphitheater and it,

5780
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,771
dude,

5781
02:27:41,771 --> 02:27:44,110
you're playing between
two fucking mountain.

5782
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,310
It's so dope.

5783
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:45,701
Crazy.

5784
02:27:45,701 --> 02:27:45,971
And the,

5785
02:27:45,971 --> 02:27:47,380
when you look at the audience

5786
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:50,240
says that because the each like,

5787
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:51,990
I don't know why you say it like,

5788
02:27:52,010 --> 02:27:55,220
like a rung or a stand of
where the audience stands.

5789
02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:56,870
It's like four feet.

5790
02:27:57,230 --> 02:27:57,821
So you're,

5791
02:27:57,821 --> 02:27:59,960
you're not looking at
like this kind of like,

5792
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:04,430
you know this vanishing point of
people you're looking at this wall,

5793
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:05,421
right?

5794
02:28:05,421 --> 02:28:07,460
You know of fucking just crazy dude.

5795
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:08,710
They do comedy there.

5796
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,460
They do comedy and they have movies there.

5797
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,033
Red Rocks.

5798
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:12,770
No Shit.

5799
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:16,450
Red Rocks is amazing and there's a high
possibility you might see a mountain

5800
02:28:16,460 --> 02:28:18,420
lion can't you might,

5801
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,383
you might say,

5802
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:19,990
you know,

5803
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:21,800
you can't wander off to pis in the woods,

5804
02:28:21,801 --> 02:28:22,100
bro.

5805
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:22,421
You like,

5806
02:28:22,421 --> 02:28:23,254
Hey Jack,

5807
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:24,890
it's a possibility.

5808
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:26,180
It's not a good possibility,

5809
02:28:26,181 --> 02:28:27,080
but it's out there.

5810
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:32,100
What percentage of people at your
shows a rough estimate are on ecstasy?

5811
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:34,200
Rough estimate.

5812
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:34,570
Yes.

5813
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:35,830
90 90%

5814
02:28:35,890 --> 02:28:36,020
right?

5815
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:36,853
I won't honestly,

5816
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:40,420
the really couch behind
you before you answer this,

5817
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:42,100
you're manager sweating right now.

5818
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,650
Make the corporate anything stupid.

5819
02:28:45,690 --> 02:28:46,200
Shaw.

5820
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:46,511
No.

5821
02:28:46,511 --> 02:28:46,960
Really?

5822
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,440
Cds might make a comeback.

5823
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:49,720
I take 30%

5824
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:52,840
Joe.

5825
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:53,470
You know why?

5826
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:54,303
You know why

5827
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:59,530
50 of them are on Molly because they
know better because like the Internet,

5828
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,150
Molly,

5829
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:02,770
how did that name come about anyway?

5830
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:04,380
Because it's a tell us,

5831
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:05,223
you know,

5832
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:07,090
I don't know how Demali come about.

5833
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:10,750
I know I've only been recently hearing
about this in the last two years.

5834
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:15,960
It's ecstasy cause usually ecstasies
like cut with other bullshit I have to do

5835
02:29:16,331 --> 02:29:18,320
with Molly cause it's true in,

5836
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:19,100
what's it called?

5837
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:19,680
MDM.

5838
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:22,560
A MTMA Lawley methylene and dioxin.

5839
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:24,570
Methylamphetamine nicknamed MD

5840
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:29,240
made in a laboratory site like,

5841
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,230
like ecstasy.

5842
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:33,510
Hard to be like some
scientific chemical bullshit.

5843
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:36,090
I only stop that until a month ago.

5844
02:29:36,091 --> 02:29:40,650
I saw a documentary on ecstasy
and Mtma the pure form.

5845
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:41,910
It's just like coke.

5846
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:43,620
We're coke all comes from the south,

5847
02:29:43,621 --> 02:29:44,454
South America.

5848
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:47,790
All ecstasy comes from these rare,

5849
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:48,480
uh,

5850
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:51,180
the roots of these rare trees in Cambodia

5851
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,300
comes from Cambodia

5852
02:29:58,460 --> 02:29:59,880
to take you seriously.

5853
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,880
I supposed to take you seriously
when you come to a fucking concert to

5854
02:30:02,881 --> 02:30:05,490
appreciate music and craft
and art and all that stuff.

5855
02:30:05,491 --> 02:30:07,680
If you're like on these
mind altering substances,

5856
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:09,233
come on man.

5857
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:10,130
That's what it sounds like.

5858
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:12,170
You're supposed to be
taking them seriously.

5859
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:16,910
But it is kind of fascinating that if you
ever see current current TV they have,

5860
02:30:16,911 --> 02:30:17,690
or vanguard,

5861
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:18,523
that's the name of the show.

5862
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,251
There's a,

5863
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:20,570
I think that's untrue TV or one of the,

5864
02:30:20,571 --> 02:30:24,080
one of those TV networks were
secure cable network and they uh,

5865
02:30:24,081 --> 02:30:24,381
they,

5866
02:30:24,381 --> 02:30:25,880
they spend a lot of time and the,

5867
02:30:25,881 --> 02:30:28,310
there's the in the woods
where these people are like,

5868
02:30:28,311 --> 02:30:31,520
there's like a lot of like serious crime
going on because people are cutting

5869
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:32,360
down these trees.

5870
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:38,690
They find these accuracy labs out in the
woods and they go in with guns and it's

5871
02:30:38,691 --> 02:30:39,051
crazy.

5872
02:30:39,051 --> 02:30:40,130
The military comes in.

5873
02:30:40,131 --> 02:30:40,851
It's really nuts,

5874
02:30:40,851 --> 02:30:41,684
man.

5875
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:43,610
It's just like Columbia.

5876
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:45,353
I didn't know.

5877
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:46,341
I didn't know either.

5878
02:30:46,341 --> 02:30:46,941
I thought it was a,

5879
02:30:46,941 --> 02:30:48,320
I thought it was the same
thing that you thought.

5880
02:30:48,321 --> 02:30:49,690
I thought it was some
shit mate in the lab.

5881
02:30:49,770 --> 02:30:53,870
So is this like something
generally accepted that
should go in hand in hand with

5882
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:55,280
like electronic music then?

5883
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,070
No.

5884
02:30:56,070 --> 02:30:56,311
No.

5885
02:30:56,311 --> 02:30:57,121
Y'All listen man,

5886
02:30:57,121 --> 02:30:58,410
I think you're taking it really personal.

5887
02:30:58,411 --> 02:30:59,250
I don't think it has to,

5888
02:30:59,690 --> 02:31:01,410
we're just tripping out on what it is.

5889
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:02,910
We're just tripping out on what it is

5890
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:08,720
that you're right in the same
frequency of trans to them.

5891
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:10,910
It's crazy and therefore you their mouse.

5892
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:15,660
That's very crazy way hold the music
that he makes his act and I'm a fucking

5893
02:31:15,661 --> 02:31:17,370
cynic and a big ass critic.

5894
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:18,121
No Shit.

5895
02:31:18,121 --> 02:31:18,600
But,

5896
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:20,070
but his music is

5897
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:25,070
actually not on that level of e because
it's actually mellow smooth house to me

5898
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:27,310
like him and cascade.

5899
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,960
I may not appreciate them as Djs per se,

5900
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:32,220
but as artists I go,

5901
02:31:32,221 --> 02:31:32,611
fuck yeah,

5902
02:31:32,611 --> 02:31:33,350
that shit is dope.

5903
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:33,990
Well,

5904
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,481
you know,

5905
02:31:34,481 --> 02:31:34,940
you know,

5906
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:35,661
having said that,

5907
02:31:35,661 --> 02:31:36,890
I'm going to fucking crusader.

5908
02:31:36,891 --> 02:31:37,221
I'm not,

5909
02:31:37,221 --> 02:31:38,054
I'm not tailoring.

5910
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:38,451
No,

5911
02:31:38,451 --> 02:31:38,871
but I mean,

5912
02:31:38,871 --> 02:31:41,960
but I'm saying like the shit you'd make
is not like shit that people need to be

5913
02:31:41,961 --> 02:31:42,680
high for.

5914
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:43,101
No,

5915
02:31:43,101 --> 02:31:48,101
not at [inaudible] level with all
of your hard drive in my life.

5916
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:51,230
You never done heart drug ever.

5917
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:52,093
I've never,

5918
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:53,960
never done mushrooms.

5919
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:54,500
No.

5920
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:56,570
Have you done dude?

5921
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:57,201
Name it off.

5922
02:31:57,201 --> 02:31:58,900
I can tell you salvia acid,

5923
02:31:59,150 --> 02:31:59,540
nothing.

5924
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,081
A bit of pot.

5925
02:32:00,081 --> 02:32:00,914
When I was fucking kid.

5926
02:32:02,170 --> 02:32:02,801
I'm same way.

5927
02:32:02,801 --> 02:32:04,130
I've tried weed and didn't like,

5928
02:32:04,131 --> 02:32:04,911
and that was it for me.

5929
02:32:04,911 --> 02:32:07,370
That was all I needed to
see your smoke me right.

5930
02:32:07,371 --> 02:32:09,050
Fucking now I guarantee you,

5931
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:13,100
which would be in the fucking bathroom
shaking and every time that fucking door

5932
02:32:13,101 --> 02:32:13,610
opens easy,

5933
02:32:13,610 --> 02:32:15,380
they're going to be a cop or my mom.

5934
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:16,470
Wow.

5935
02:32:16,470 --> 02:32:20,070
Or your mom as a cop or my
mom's dress up fucking God.

5936
02:32:20,130 --> 02:32:20,963
Exactly.

5937
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:24,690
That's cool.

5938
02:32:24,690 --> 02:32:25,523
That's kind of cool.

5939
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:27,291
It's Kinda cool.

5940
02:32:27,291 --> 02:32:32,240
But I also almost want to get it like a
sex change and just so I could spoon you

5941
02:32:32,241 --> 02:32:33,410
and do mushrooms with you,

5942
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:34,443
you know what I mean?

5943
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:38,320
Comfort you and like take
you through the desert

5944
02:32:46,890 --> 02:32:47,441
desert.

5945
02:32:47,441 --> 02:32:48,310
That's hilarious.

5946
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:48,941
No,

5947
02:32:48,941 --> 02:32:50,110
you know what I mean though?

5948
02:32:50,111 --> 02:32:52,000
Like I want to comfort him

5949
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:54,041
planet.

5950
02:32:54,041 --> 02:32:54,431
Besides,

5951
02:32:54,431 --> 02:32:55,870
you would have explained it that way.

5952
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:58,630
I don't have a sex change
and I want to spoon,

5953
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,340
you know,

5954
02:33:00,341 --> 02:33:01,720
I just want to like hold them.

5955
02:33:01,721 --> 02:33:03,760
I just want to like
nurse him into mushrooms.

5956
02:33:03,810 --> 02:33:05,050
Attitude needs a nurse.

5957
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:08,153
He needs,

5958
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:09,393
he needs muscles,

5959
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:10,313
he needs,

5960
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:11,393
he needs marijuana.

5961
02:33:11,450 --> 02:33:12,460
He needs something.

5962
02:33:13,150 --> 02:33:14,650
I bet you if he does that though,

5963
02:33:14,651 --> 02:33:15,820
the Grammy's with blow up.

5964
02:33:15,821 --> 02:33:19,780
They would fucking bleed on the couch
at spot when they're in the bed that you

5965
02:33:19,781 --> 02:33:21,420
don't think would be be easier to talk to?

5966
02:33:22,630 --> 02:33:23,463
No,

5967
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:23,670
no.

5968
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:24,240
I think,

5969
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:27,830
I think what he does is the most amazing
shit ever in the whole entire road.

5970
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,530
And I can't even believe he doesn't
fuck wait about more than heart surgery.

5971
02:33:31,950 --> 02:33:32,461
I really,

5972
02:33:32,461 --> 02:33:35,000
I really appreciate musicians I have.

5973
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:37,360
No matter if you is is I presume,

5974
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:39,900
I mean and like I've listened
to him a million times.

5975
02:33:39,901 --> 02:33:41,760
The first time I met Veronica can Ricci,

5976
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:43,500
the first time I met Veronica reach you,

5977
02:33:43,501 --> 02:33:48,390
I made this whole video because we
went to a a org orchard or an orchid.

5978
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:48,811
Uh,

5979
02:33:48,811 --> 02:33:51,420
what would that orange
and orange grove orchard.

5980
02:33:51,421 --> 02:33:55,500
We went to an orange grove and I made
a video and I picked out a dead mouse

5981
02:33:55,501 --> 02:33:55,930
song,

5982
02:33:55,930 --> 02:34:00,330
a dead mouse of song to put
as the soundtrack because
I think that is an amazing

5983
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:03,000
song and I met somebody
amazing and I put this song,

5984
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:04,050
no,

5985
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:04,181
no,

5986
02:34:04,181 --> 02:34:04,540
fuck you.

5987
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:06,380
But in a special moment
in your life right now.

5988
02:34:06,381 --> 02:34:06,450
No,

5989
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:06,581
no,

5990
02:34:06,581 --> 02:34:07,000
no.

5991
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,130
I feel like I'm here.

5992
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:08,900
All right.

5993
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:09,610
This case.

5994
02:34:09,610 --> 02:34:10,980
It sounds as good as it sounds.

5995
02:34:10,981 --> 02:34:11,680
That's what I liked.

5996
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,660
Gandalf's how's the opposite?

5997
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:13,400
Did

5998
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:16,580
the music music to me is so insane to me.

5999
02:34:16,581 --> 02:34:17,110
It's is,

6000
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:17,480
hold on.

6001
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:20,740
His music's one of the most
important things in life.

6002
02:34:20,741 --> 02:34:22,810
It's what I'm saying and
I think it's amazing.

6003
02:34:22,811 --> 02:34:27,220
Meaning somebody that I listened to and
I fucking have had like emotions with,

6004
02:34:27,221 --> 02:34:28,690
I fucking had trips with.

6005
02:34:28,691 --> 02:34:32,890
I've had a fucking really cool evenings
with listening to somebody I don't even

6006
02:34:32,891 --> 02:34:36,360
know and I get to meet the
person that designed that

6007
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,131
suck his dick.

6008
02:34:39,131 --> 02:34:40,720
Come on to me.

6009
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:41,540
Yeah,

6010
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:42,373
I have a brother habit.

6011
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:44,973
All right.

6012
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,890
You've done the beam to flush on a pice.

6013
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:54,220
Preemptive 40 aim to flush [inaudible]
you've got it and you're like,

6014
02:34:54,231 --> 02:34:54,980
I got this.

6015
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:59,480
And then you like time it so that
you hit the fucking flusher as it is.

6016
02:34:59,610 --> 02:34:59,950
Right?

6017
02:34:59,950 --> 02:35:04,950
This is done this a little not quite
there yet and it goes viral or it's just

6018
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:08,010
flush it again.

6019
02:35:08,010 --> 02:35:08,671
You want to flush it.

6020
02:35:08,671 --> 02:35:08,901
You're like,

6021
02:35:08,901 --> 02:35:09,141
no,

6022
02:35:09,141 --> 02:35:09,690
wait bro.

6023
02:35:09,690 --> 02:35:11,810
You know you're probably
going to go 30 seconds.

6024
02:35:11,811 --> 02:35:14,360
We know it's a weird obsession.

6025
02:35:14,361 --> 02:35:16,190
The one that like piss into clean water.

6026
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:21,860
I hate this shit and I believed him and
then I flushed and I got to piss again

6027
02:35:21,861 --> 02:35:22,694
right after.

6028
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:23,630
What does that,

6029
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:26,010
that's where it's my Dick
not coordinating with my ass.

6030
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:27,110
Low Communication.

6031
02:35:27,111 --> 02:35:29,310
Then there was also a good
thing on the side note.

6032
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,790
So Peter's dropping bombs bitches.

6033
02:35:31,791 --> 02:35:33,390
You thought this show was getting bored.

6034
02:35:34,110 --> 02:35:37,820
The conflict with steer us off the
tracks and into the woods we bought.

6035
02:35:37,821 --> 02:35:40,160
Determine that you need some
sort of psychedelics young man.

6036
02:35:40,610 --> 02:35:41,720
You're a very nice guy,

6037
02:35:41,721 --> 02:35:43,490
but you definitely need something.

6038
02:35:43,491 --> 02:35:43,881
Weed,

6039
02:35:43,881 --> 02:35:44,181
pot,

6040
02:35:44,181 --> 02:35:44,750
something.

6041
02:35:44,750 --> 02:35:45,950
Somebody needs to sit you down.

6042
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:47,270
He,

6043
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:49,730
I don't think he needs anything
because I'm a clean right.

6044
02:35:49,731 --> 02:35:50,090
I don't know.

6045
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:50,960
Just calm me down.

6046
02:35:50,961 --> 02:35:51,950
So I'm an alcoholic guy.

6047
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:53,270
That'd be a little perspective.

6048
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:54,930
I think he's doing
everything right right now.

6049
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:55,843
Don't

6050
02:35:57,440 --> 02:36:02,210
wait till he's fucking 70 or 80 and
then do my showrooms 70 or 80 and to do

6051
02:36:02,211 --> 02:36:02,930
mushrooms.

6052
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,400
I Dunno.

6053
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:04,340
I'll wait until

6054
02:36:06,590 --> 02:36:08,480
you're not in accordance to law right now.

6055
02:36:08,510 --> 02:36:09,920
If I were to do some crazy shit.

6056
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:10,190
Right.

6057
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:12,910
I'm easily susceptible
just getting into porn.

6058
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:14,120
Oh right.

6059
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:14,960
Cause you're Canadian,

6060
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:16,063
the Canadian thing.

6061
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:19,140
Ah,

6062
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:20,533
that's so true.

6063
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,670
Ah,

6064
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:21,940
even

6065
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,600
nervous about the OT because it's true.

6066
02:36:24,670 --> 02:36:25,570
I was baffled.

6067
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:26,320
I was like,

6068
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:27,250
this doesn't make no,

6069
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:28,390
I don't think that's what it is,

6070
02:36:28,391 --> 02:36:28,721
man.

6071
02:36:28,721 --> 02:36:32,350
I think we just hasn't had that many
positive experiences and he's a very

6072
02:36:32,351 --> 02:36:36,910
positive person and he's ambitious and
he's obviously to go from where you

6073
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:41,650
started doing that kind of music and
then four years later you're filling the

6074
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:41,750
Roger Center.

6075
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:43,360
You have to be ambitious.

6076
02:36:43,361 --> 02:36:44,230
There's no way around

6077
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,610
back and in terms of
fucking doing shit then fine

6078
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:53,290
fucking smoking weed and
all that shit right now.

6079
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:54,400
Are you kidding me dude?

6080
02:36:54,401 --> 02:36:56,680
Like I'm just so preoccupied
with fucking this,

6081
02:36:56,681 --> 02:36:57,550
that and the other thing.

6082
02:36:57,580 --> 02:36:57,941
I know,

6083
02:36:57,941 --> 02:36:58,601
I understand that.

6084
02:36:58,601 --> 02:36:59,434
But you're drinking.

6085
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:00,790
That's what doesn't make any sense.

6086
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:02,080
You're altering your state.

6087
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:02,321
You're,

6088
02:37:02,321 --> 02:37:02,801
you're altering.

6089
02:37:02,801 --> 02:37:03,910
Your state is different.

6090
02:37:03,911 --> 02:37:05,290
It's a different alteration.

6091
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:05,501
Yeah.

6092
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:06,334
It's the Shitty,

6093
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:11,230
shitty or what I'm comfortable
with the one that benefits you,

6094
02:37:11,231 --> 02:37:13,200
at least it's the one that gives you the,

6095
02:37:13,201 --> 02:37:13,661
the balls,

6096
02:37:13,661 --> 02:37:14,440
blackouts.

6097
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:15,470
It gives you the most to her.

6098
02:37:15,810 --> 02:37:18,380
It allows you to like
relax your standards.

6099
02:37:18,390 --> 02:37:21,580
It allows you to come here
and get some work on that.

6100
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:23,820
Let you ego flight shortly.

6101
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,171
It's true.

6102
02:37:24,171 --> 02:37:24,711
It's definitely,

6103
02:37:24,711 --> 02:37:26,320
you know the is absolutely true though.

6104
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:27,290
We didn't work for me.

6105
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:28,790
I prefer alcohol

6106
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:31,070
drinking off.

6107
02:37:31,070 --> 02:37:32,150
I'm going to call you both.

6108
02:37:32,151 --> 02:37:32,721
I believe you,

6109
02:37:32,721 --> 02:37:34,090
but who did you get high with it?

6110
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:35,540
It wasn't even who I got high with.

6111
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:36,280
Its high.

6112
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:36,590
How much?

6113
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:39,440
I just tried it every time I tried it.

6114
02:37:39,441 --> 02:37:41,450
I did not like the like
the way I feel paranoid,

6115
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:42,421
not even parent.

6116
02:37:42,421 --> 02:37:44,940
I got bored and I've got
add so it didn't fuck.

6117
02:37:44,941 --> 02:37:46,760
There's absolutely two
different kinds of weed though.

6118
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:48,110
Do you know that most of the people,

6119
02:37:48,111 --> 02:37:48,891
what most people get,

6120
02:37:48,891 --> 02:37:51,920
it's called Endeca and what indicators
is couch weed makes you really sleepy and

6121
02:37:51,921 --> 02:37:52,370
tired.

6122
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:55,100
There's another thing called
Sativa South American.

6123
02:37:55,101 --> 02:37:57,020
We'd like South Pacific,

6124
02:37:57,021 --> 02:37:57,920
so that's like,

6125
02:37:57,950 --> 02:38:01,760
it's from the a parts of the
world and it's way different.

6126
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:04,820
No,

6127
02:38:04,820 --> 02:38:05,060
no.

6128
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:07,730
I think he's thinking that
the Salvia divinorum Oh yeah,

6129
02:38:07,970 --> 02:38:08,840
this is sativa,

6130
02:38:08,841 --> 02:38:09,590
sativa,

6131
02:38:09,590 --> 02:38:10,071
Sativa,

6132
02:38:10,071 --> 02:38:10,880
road.

6133
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:11,710
Marijuana.

6134
02:38:11,710 --> 02:38:12,110
Yes.

6135
02:38:12,110 --> 02:38:12,943
It's a different,

6136
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:13,860
it's,

6137
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,541
it's a,

6138
02:38:14,541 --> 02:38:16,160
it's a much more heady,

6139
02:38:16,161 --> 02:38:17,630
much more Carl Sagan.

6140
02:38:17,631 --> 02:38:21,260
Much more staring at fucking
documentaries sativa.

6141
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:21,890
Right.

6142
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:22,760
Much more like,

6143
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,350
you know what I'm saying
is that I do that.

6144
02:38:25,430 --> 02:38:26,570
Most people don't know that.

6145
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:27,681
I know you do.

6146
02:38:27,681 --> 02:38:28,514
I know you do,

6147
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:30,860
but there is totally to
totally different effects.

6148
02:38:30,861 --> 02:38:31,581
Eddie likes it all.

6149
02:38:31,581 --> 02:38:32,260
He doesn't give a fuck.

6150
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:33,093
I think it's all good

6151
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:35,571
right away.

6152
02:38:35,571 --> 02:38:36,580
I started to Moria anyway.

6153
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:38,530
I agree with that as well.

6154
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:40,670
Especially once you're a seasoned smoker.

6155
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:41,181
No,

6156
02:38:41,181 --> 02:38:41,421
no,

6157
02:38:41,421 --> 02:38:41,631
no,

6158
02:38:41,631 --> 02:38:41,811
no.

6159
02:38:41,811 --> 02:38:42,770
It's not the same shit.

6160
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,011
No,

6161
02:38:43,011 --> 02:38:46,670
it's definitely not start
smoking till I don't think it is,

6162
02:38:46,671 --> 02:38:46,881
man.

6163
02:38:46,881 --> 02:38:48,230
I don't think it has the same effect.

6164
02:38:48,970 --> 02:38:50,270
It's anything that has the same effect.

6165
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:55,190
I used to really think that sativa like
controlled your appetite and Endeca.

6166
02:38:55,191 --> 02:38:56,780
You got the munchies and all that shit.

6167
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:59,060
I think it's whatever you think it is.

6168
02:38:59,170 --> 02:38:59,640
That's right.

6169
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:00,450
Whoa.

6170
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:03,750
I kind of see that because I've
been doing a lot of hybrids lately.

6171
02:39:03,751 --> 02:39:05,140
You guys are what's known as stoners?

6172
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:05,700
No,

6173
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:05,840
no,

6174
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:06,080
no.

6175
02:39:06,080 --> 02:39:09,510
I've been doing a lot of hybrids lately
and then this one time I soon got hybrid

6176
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:10,411
and then I was like,

6177
02:39:10,411 --> 02:39:11,310
this is the best week.

6178
02:39:11,311 --> 02:39:12,690
That perfect blend of both.

6179
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:13,380
And then I'm like,

6180
02:39:13,380 --> 02:39:13,830
oh wait,

6181
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:15,210
this is [inaudible] on the bottle.

6182
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:16,680
This whole time I've been doing Endeca.

6183
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:17,251
So it's like,

6184
02:39:17,251 --> 02:39:17,791
I'm almost like,

6185
02:39:17,791 --> 02:39:18,031
all right,

6186
02:39:18,031 --> 02:39:19,860
is this like fucking Alpha brain and Mike,

6187
02:39:19,890 --> 02:39:20,281
like what?

6188
02:39:20,281 --> 02:39:20,491
You know,

6189
02:39:20,491 --> 02:39:21,380
like what am I doing?

6190
02:39:21,590 --> 02:39:22,420
Is it a placebo?

6191
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:22,740
Yeah.

6192
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,480
Yeah.

6193
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:24,090
Hmm.

6194
02:39:24,090 --> 02:39:24,923
Yeah.

6195
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:25,940
I think you're all crazy.

6196
02:39:26,430 --> 02:39:27,680
You were smoking airborne.

6197
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:28,643
Maybe.

6198
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:31,070
Maybe this motherfucker's
lost too much weight.

6199
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:32,900
Only done good for me.

6200
02:39:32,901 --> 02:39:33,510
So

6201
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:35,010
first time I had fucking smoke pot.

6202
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,930
Was it upstage a,

6203
02:39:36,931 --> 02:39:39,690
a radio show that was
actually being syndicated?

6204
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:40,740
A one oh nine

6205
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:42,840
or one energy energy.

6206
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:44,980
Is that a Toronto station?

6207
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:45,291
Yeah,

6208
02:39:45,291 --> 02:39:47,240
it is a total was Burlington.

6209
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:49,450
Do you remember the uh,

6210
02:39:49,451 --> 02:39:50,420
the daily planet

6211
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,113
from Niagara Falls?

6212
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:52,331
Oh,

6213
02:39:52,331 --> 02:39:54,150
it was that kind of fear
from Saint Catharines.

6214
02:39:54,151 --> 02:39:56,230
So you're going to have an Agora
pause here from Niagara Falls.

6215
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:56,740
Yeah.

6216
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,370
Slow down.

6217
02:39:57,370 --> 02:39:57,980
Slow down.

6218
02:39:57,980 --> 02:39:59,110
What else do you like waterfalls?

6219
02:39:59,130 --> 02:40:00,570
Are you guys like gang members?

6220
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:01,271
So we had this,

6221
02:40:01,271 --> 02:40:03,520
we had this radio show
and there was a guy there,

6222
02:40:03,550 --> 02:40:03,940
DJ,

6223
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,780
just nice.

6224
02:40:04,781 --> 02:40:06,340
And he would come in and we would do,

6225
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:07,001
yeah,

6226
02:40:07,001 --> 02:40:08,020
just nice.

6227
02:40:08,440 --> 02:40:08,661
Like,

6228
02:40:08,661 --> 02:40:09,160
hey dude,

6229
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:09,430
dude,

6230
02:40:09,430 --> 02:40:10,580
this dude's would show up.

6231
02:40:10,581 --> 02:40:14,190
But like these like amp
bag full of fucking weed

6232
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:14,730
back,

6233
02:40:14,730 --> 02:40:15,640
they said an ANP back.

6234
02:40:15,820 --> 02:40:16,220
You know what?

6235
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:19,180
It made me happier if you'd
said a food city bag you guys,

6236
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,510
it's crazy.

6237
02:40:21,511 --> 02:40:22,081
I swear to God.

6238
02:40:22,081 --> 02:40:23,850
I was about 1819 years old.

6239
02:40:23,851 --> 02:40:24,990
How old do you know like holy,

6240
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:26,310
I'm 31 easy,

6241
02:40:26,311 --> 02:40:31,311
slow down midlines kids 31 so they
would smoke a joint and the first time I

6242
02:40:32,731 --> 02:40:35,010
actually smoked a proper fucking blunt.

6243
02:40:35,070 --> 02:40:35,881
I Shit you not.

6244
02:40:35,881 --> 02:40:38,940
It was did this like rap song
and I don't know what it was,

6245
02:40:38,941 --> 02:40:43,420
but I know the lyric because I was so
stoned and I kept hearing the same lyric

6246
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:44,700
lyric over and over and over again.

6247
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,511
It was like,

6248
02:40:45,511 --> 02:40:47,010
I don't want to something man.

6249
02:40:47,011 --> 02:40:47,850
I don't want to chill.

6250
02:40:47,851 --> 02:40:50,080
I just want to see my
head up on a $100 bill.

6251
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:53,750
I don't want to l I just
want to chill my hand.

6252
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:58,800
The $100 bill it dude
that and owed me bulldogs.

6253
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,850
Well bloods or a different
experience because you know,

6254
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:06,990
ironically a friend of mine also from
Boston at Oji blunts or different

6255
02:41:06,991 --> 02:41:09,210
experience because you have probably
have that on my phone right now.

6256
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:09,811
But no,

6257
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:11,030
honestly when I was up in,

6258
02:41:11,090 --> 02:41:11,231
uh,

6259
02:41:11,231 --> 02:41:14,120
up on top of this computer
store and you know,

6260
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:15,990
recording this fucking show dude,

6261
02:41:15,991 --> 02:41:20,991
I was like passed out fucking staring at
the ceiling and hearing the same lyric

6262
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:22,730
over and over again and every day

6263
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:23,623
Tom the door.

6264
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:27,081
Yeah,

6265
02:41:27,081 --> 02:41:27,914
that's the one.

6266
02:41:28,970 --> 02:41:31,040
It was just playing over and
over and over in the head.

6267
02:41:31,270 --> 02:41:34,040
And every time that the security
thing went off at the door,

6268
02:41:34,041 --> 02:41:35,450
that opened up and like I said,

6269
02:41:35,451 --> 02:41:38,660
it was either a cop or my mom
or my mom dressed up as a cop.

6270
02:41:38,690 --> 02:41:40,120
You need a sample that a new,

6271
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:41,200
it was fuck,

6272
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:41,601
come on.

6273
02:41:41,601 --> 02:41:42,230
It's perfect.

6274
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:43,430
That's when I decided,

6275
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:44,293
you know what,

6276
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:45,560
not for everyone.

6277
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:47,053
That sounds like a,

6278
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:47,731
like a senior,

6279
02:41:47,731 --> 02:41:50,640
a Stanley Kubrick movie or
you need to grab that shit.

6280
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:54,600
Mom dressed up like a jazzy Jeff juggling
it before the fucking chorus comes in.

6281
02:41:54,650 --> 02:41:55,483
Hold on a sec.

6282
02:41:56,650 --> 02:41:57,483
Shit.

6283
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:58,653
Monahan

6284
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:03,600
wanted shit out Monahan.

6285
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:04,913
Can we do this?

6286
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:06,713
One of the hill?

6287
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:07,740
Ain't no,

6288
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:10,880
they're running harder to jazzy
Jeff is juggling and back and forth.

6289
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:13,130
That's a very specific accent.

6290
02:42:13,131 --> 02:42:14,180
I would say that the Philadelphia,

6291
02:42:14,210 --> 02:42:14,361
yeah,

6292
02:42:14,361 --> 02:42:15,350
I think it played out.

6293
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:15,951
Is that legal?

6294
02:42:15,951 --> 02:42:17,150
Is that a Philadelphia accent?

6295
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:17,271
Oh,

6296
02:42:17,271 --> 02:42:18,104
it's Boston.

6297
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:18,990
Is it really?

6298
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:19,800
That's interesting.

6299
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:20,310
Boston,

6300
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:21,020
Philadelphia,

6301
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:21,600
Andrew saw,

6302
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:21,910
oh,

6303
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:23,190
we were fade outs.

6304
02:42:23,310 --> 02:42:23,641
Joe,

6305
02:42:23,641 --> 02:42:25,000
you're from fucking Boston.

6306
02:42:25,050 --> 02:42:25,711
Don't like that.

6307
02:42:25,711 --> 02:42:25,951
Yeah,

6308
02:42:25,951 --> 02:42:26,341
it doesn't,

6309
02:42:26,341 --> 02:42:27,870
it sounded like Philadelphia to me.

6310
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:30,960
But Boston black is very
different than Boston white.

6311
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:32,670
There's this does it different accents.

6312
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:37,530
Like there's a lot of the pack your car
that didn't get inherited by the Boston

6313
02:42:37,531 --> 02:42:38,460
black community.

6314
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:40,980
Like that's like they were
Teresa Neal was a black guy.

6315
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:41,820
Marijuana,

6316
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,800
brilliant comedian from Boston.

6317
02:42:43,801 --> 02:42:45,600
He didn't have the Boston accent,

6318
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,463
you know,

6319
02:42:47,150 --> 02:42:47,850
Westin.

6320
02:42:47,850 --> 02:42:49,630
I put Teresa would use
what you used to say,

6321
02:42:49,631 --> 02:42:52,230
the fucking dumbest
shit to each other one.

6322
02:42:52,330 --> 02:42:53,163
I remember we were in,

6323
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:57,850
in Scotland in 2000 and he had this
girlfriend at the time who was from

6324
02:42:57,851 --> 02:42:59,420
Liverpool and uh,

6325
02:42:59,470 --> 02:42:59,741
she,

6326
02:42:59,741 --> 02:43:03,100
we were walking and everything was
fucking uphill in Scotland in Edinburgh.

6327
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:03,761
And,

6328
02:43:03,761 --> 02:43:03,940
uh,

6329
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:05,560
she was complaining
about walking and goes,

6330
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:06,101
bitch,

6331
02:43:06,101 --> 02:43:09,310
don't act like you're too fucking
high post to be walking up and down.

6332
02:43:09,550 --> 02:43:12,220
And I just thought it was the funniest
shit because she said that and adding

6333
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:12,700
color.

6334
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:14,060
He called her high posts,

6335
02:43:14,730 --> 02:43:15,970
remember all yeah.

6336
02:43:15,971 --> 02:43:16,804
And I was like,

6337
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:21,550
I can't remember the cabaret fucking
Voltaire or what we were at the Edinburgh

6338
02:43:21,551 --> 02:43:22,510
comedy festival.

6339
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:23,230
Oh Shit.

6340
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:24,063
And I just remember thinking,

6341
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:25,660
I kept saying by the castle,

6342
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,611
it was by the cast.

6343
02:43:26,611 --> 02:43:28,020
So we were on North Castle Street.

6344
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:28,550
Okay,

6345
02:43:28,550 --> 02:43:28,770
okay.

6346
02:43:28,770 --> 02:43:29,320
Okay.

6347
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:30,340
And I would just,

6348
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:32,590
I would just even years
later I would say to him,

6349
02:43:32,591 --> 02:43:32,771
I go,

6350
02:43:32,771 --> 02:43:34,510
hey you acting all fucking high hypo.

6351
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:40,270
Cause there was a song called high
post at that time to post high.

6352
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,261
When was this?

6353
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:42,094
He had the two.

6354
02:43:42,570 --> 02:43:43,210
All right.

6355
02:43:43,210 --> 02:43:45,550
Teresa band raising shit.

6356
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:50,390
I'm banned from a place on fucking
castle or the cabaret Voltaire.

6357
02:43:50,391 --> 02:43:51,400
I was what did you do to them?

6358
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:52,270
Well I didn't do anything.

6359
02:43:52,271 --> 02:43:55,570
I was testing the integrity of a
bottle outside of the nightclub,

6360
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,810
basically kicking it against a care of
seeing how much it would take to smash.

6361
02:43:59,050 --> 02:44:01,710
And so it's funny cause that was odd,

6362
02:44:01,810 --> 02:44:02,643
segregate

6363
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:05,710
the official and whatever.

6364
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:10,510
But I was playing at the club that night
and then we stopped or whatever and now

6365
02:44:10,511 --> 02:44:13,540
I'm out of town and having a cigarette
and I'm like kind of edge and a bottle on

6366
02:44:13,541 --> 02:44:14,141
the fucking thing.

6367
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:15,640
Cause everyone was like smashing bottles.

6368
02:44:15,641 --> 02:44:16,474
It's fucking Edinburgh.

6369
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:19,270
So I'm going crazy fucking whatever.

6370
02:44:20,210 --> 02:44:21,360
And I start like,

6371
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:24,700
like Kinda like back kicking this
fucking bottle on their thing and all the

6372
02:44:24,701 --> 02:44:27,520
security guys are watching me waiting
for the fucking thing to break.

6373
02:44:27,521 --> 02:44:31,180
Cause they knew as soon as it breaks it
had grounds to fucking kicked me out and

6374
02:44:31,510 --> 02:44:34,060
he had a weapon or something.

6375
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,730
So then they had evidence
that you're a Douche bag.

6376
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:37,893
Yeah.

6377
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:41,620
So I finally broke it and then
they all came out and they say,

6378
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:42,454
okay listen,

6379
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:43,870
here's your shit,

6380
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:45,310
here's your whatever.

6381
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:46,480
Like you're not welcome here.

6382
02:44:46,481 --> 02:44:46,870
I mean we're,

6383
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:47,740
we're abandoning you.

6384
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:51,760
But it was really funny because it was
like totally secret Amanda moment where

6385
02:44:51,761 --> 02:44:52,211
they were like,

6386
02:44:52,211 --> 02:44:53,310
we're banishing you,

6387
02:44:53,710 --> 02:44:54,850
you are banished,

6388
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:58,630
you're banished and you're like
totally banished from this nightclub.

6389
02:44:58,631 --> 02:44:58,961
And I'm like,

6390
02:44:58,961 --> 02:44:59,794
okay,

6391
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:00,221
all right,

6392
02:45:00,221 --> 02:45:00,700
that's cool.

6393
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:00,920
Yeah,

6394
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:01,151
it,

6395
02:45:01,151 --> 02:45:01,780
it's fine.

6396
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:02,320
Whatever.

6397
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:03,660
Just give me my jacket and I'll go.

6398
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:08,650
And it was funny because I really
didn't put up a fight at all.

6399
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:09,513
I was just like,

6400
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:10,000
Whoa,

6401
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:10,721
hold on a second man.

6402
02:45:10,721 --> 02:45:11,650
If you were running a club,

6403
02:45:11,651 --> 02:45:13,210
would you want some guy
breaking bottles out?

6404
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:13,780
Well,

6405
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:14,613
yeah,

6406
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:16,020
exactly.

6407
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:17,200
That's why I played along and I'm like,

6408
02:45:17,201 --> 02:45:17,471
okay,

6409
02:45:17,471 --> 02:45:17,980
you know what?

6410
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:22,000
I know what I did was
stupid and Douchey and I,

6411
02:45:22,001 --> 02:45:22,630
you know,

6412
02:45:22,630 --> 02:45:26,470
I accept the banishment and
I'll take it and I'll go.

6413
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:27,491
And they were like,

6414
02:45:27,491 --> 02:45:28,180
okay,

6415
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:29,350
just so you know your band.

6416
02:45:29,470 --> 02:45:29,890
I'm like,

6417
02:45:29,890 --> 02:45:30,710
okay,

6418
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:31,600
give me my jacket.

6419
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:32,531
And the incident,

6420
02:45:32,531 --> 02:45:35,350
they gave him up my jacket
and they started to like
kind of walk me out of that

6421
02:45:35,351 --> 02:45:37,090
little front row pros and they would like,

6422
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:38,200
just so you know your Ben.

6423
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:38,590
I'm like,

6424
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:38,860
yeah,

6425
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:39,693
I get it.

6426
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:40,810
I'm bad,

6427
02:45:40,810 --> 02:45:41,351
I'm bad.

6428
02:45:41,351 --> 02:45:43,060
I'm never allowed to or ever again.

6429
02:45:43,061 --> 02:45:43,301
Right.

6430
02:45:43,301 --> 02:45:44,590
Is that what you mean by banish?

6431
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:45,821
And they were like,

6432
02:45:45,821 --> 02:45:46,330
yes,

6433
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,163
here's your tracking.

6434
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:49,180
You don't get out of here bag.

6435
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:52,420
What we're trying to tell
you is that you are never,

6436
02:45:52,430 --> 02:45:52,701
ever,

6437
02:45:52,701 --> 02:45:53,001
ever,

6438
02:45:53,001 --> 02:45:54,160
ever allowed here again.

6439
02:45:54,161 --> 02:45:54,550
And I'm like,

6440
02:45:54,550 --> 02:45:55,383
okay,

6441
02:45:56,170 --> 02:45:56,381
yeah.

6442
02:45:56,381 --> 02:45:56,861
And they're like,

6443
02:45:56,861 --> 02:45:57,694
no.

6444
02:45:57,820 --> 02:45:58,091
I'm like,

6445
02:45:58,091 --> 02:46:00,120
when never allowed to getting dude.

6446
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:01,080
He just went on.

6447
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,130
When clubs think that they're way more,

6448
02:46:03,390 --> 02:46:04,570
it was crazy dude.

6449
02:46:04,571 --> 02:46:04,931
And I'm like,

6450
02:46:04,931 --> 02:46:05,201
okay,

6451
02:46:05,201 --> 02:46:05,830
listen,

6452
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:08,890
if I can get kicked out of a club and
fucking that a burrow and never go back

6453
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:09,440
again,

6454
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:11,390
and my aunt's going to
regret this later in life,

6455
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:12,410
probably not.

6456
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:14,320
So I just accepted it.

6457
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:14,721
Never know.

6458
02:46:14,721 --> 02:46:17,330
Dawn really didn't like
that might be the spot.

6459
02:46:17,430 --> 02:46:18,880
I'm sure I know you one day.

6460
02:46:19,380 --> 02:46:19,940
Fraud going.

6461
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:20,751
Come on man.

6462
02:46:20,751 --> 02:46:22,220
I'm sorry.

6463
02:46:22,221 --> 02:46:22,581
Listen,

6464
02:46:22,581 --> 02:46:24,360
I know what he's done is wrong.

6465
02:46:24,361 --> 02:46:25,870
I mean up all your bottles today,

6466
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:27,400
they pull up the list of,

6467
02:46:27,410 --> 02:46:28,490
but it was really funny.

6468
02:46:28,491 --> 02:46:28,811
So,

6469
02:46:28,811 --> 02:46:33,811
so like I'm banished from this club and
I'm outside on the sidewalk like across

6470
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:34,700
the street,

6471
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:37,370
like almost at the completely
different fucking venue.

6472
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:41,990
And they kept having people come out
of the place that I was banished from.

6473
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:42,861
[inaudible] were saying,

6474
02:46:42,861 --> 02:46:43,670
dude,

6475
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:44,660
your band.

6476
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:45,753
And I'm like,

6477
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:47,023
okay,

6478
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:47,893
I get it.

6479
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:48,913
That's all right.

6480
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:49,371
Okay.

6481
02:46:49,371 --> 02:46:49,870
Yeah,

6482
02:46:49,870 --> 02:46:50,210
yeah.

6483
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:50,381
No,

6484
02:46:50,381 --> 02:46:50,541
no,

6485
02:46:50,541 --> 02:46:50,931
wait a minute.

6486
02:46:50,931 --> 02:46:51,231
Hold on.

6487
02:46:51,231 --> 02:46:51,891
They banned you,

6488
02:46:51,891 --> 02:46:53,390
so you went across the
street and the Hubbard.

6489
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:53,990
Yeah,

6490
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:54,211
yeah,

6491
02:46:54,211 --> 02:46:54,471
yeah,

6492
02:46:54,471 --> 02:46:54,681
yeah,

6493
02:46:54,681 --> 02:46:55,840
because I'm like waiting.

6494
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:59,960
They're essentially trying to get
you to get the fuck out of there.

6495
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,320
Like,

6496
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:01,940
like out of their whole country.

6497
02:47:02,150 --> 02:47:02,361
Well,

6498
02:47:02,361 --> 02:47:04,130
they wanted you to get out of their view.

6499
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:05,210
They tried to kick,

6500
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:09,670
he kicked you out of Bactrim and then
you went across the street and just to

6501
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:10,360
stare them.

6502
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:11,570
Was that essentially what happened?

6503
02:47:11,770 --> 02:47:14,030
Is Stereo room stared
at them staring at Oh,

6504
02:47:14,070 --> 02:47:14,251
no,

6505
02:47:14,251 --> 02:47:14,421
no,

6506
02:47:14,421 --> 02:47:14,550
no,

6507
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:14,701
no,

6508
02:47:14,701 --> 02:47:14,851
no,

6509
02:47:14,851 --> 02:47:14,981
no,

6510
02:47:14,981 --> 02:47:15,111
no,

6511
02:47:15,111 --> 02:47:15,291
no.

6512
02:47:15,291 --> 02:47:16,340
I was on my way out.

6513
02:47:16,341 --> 02:47:18,260
Like we were ready to get on one of those.

6514
02:47:18,261 --> 02:47:20,060
What did the call break Shaw's
where they got the Bible.

6515
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:20,630
Oh,

6516
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:22,820
so you're just waiting to pick you up.

6517
02:47:22,850 --> 02:47:23,061
Yeah,

6518
02:47:23,061 --> 02:47:24,050
I'm just waiting for,

6519
02:47:24,051 --> 02:47:24,321
you know,

6520
02:47:24,321 --> 02:47:25,154
management.

6521
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:28,970
It's so funny because
they just made a really,

6522
02:47:28,971 --> 02:47:33,620
really huge effort to have everyone
come out and saw your band,

6523
02:47:33,650 --> 02:47:34,483
your band.

6524
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:35,720
I guess for them it's like,

6525
02:47:35,730 --> 02:47:36,500
hey,

6526
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,490
as a local scene,

6527
02:47:37,491 --> 02:47:39,110
it's like a fucking devastating hit,

6528
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,740
you know,

6529
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:40,700
if you're a local band,

6530
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:41,390
oh yeah.

6531
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:42,350
That would suck.

6532
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,273
That'd be devastating.

6533
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:46,290
It was a one shot on how often he got.

6534
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:48,560
I mean there's always like shit bees.

6535
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:50,600
Does that ever happen to
the Toronto comedy scene?

6536
02:47:50,601 --> 02:47:52,010
Guys get banned from fuck yeah,

6537
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,320
I was banned from Niagara Square.

6538
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:58,310
Start Holding [inaudible] Russell
Peters speak for a second please.

6539
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:59,700
In Toronto.

6540
02:47:59,701 --> 02:48:00,351
In Canada,

6541
02:48:00,351 --> 02:48:03,230
especially if you work for Yucky
x are not allowed to perform it.

6542
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:04,153
Any other,

6543
02:48:04,450 --> 02:48:06,110
no shit that happens.

6544
02:48:06,111 --> 02:48:06,520
There's,

6545
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:07,353
there's so,

6546
02:48:08,210 --> 02:48:10,040
it's funny cause the
young comics like that.

6547
02:48:10,041 --> 02:48:12,290
I know still in Toronto
we'll call me like,

6548
02:48:12,291 --> 02:48:12,950
Yo,

6549
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:14,240
I'm thinking about leaving Yuk Yuk.

6550
02:48:14,241 --> 02:48:14,511
She's like,

6551
02:48:14,511 --> 02:48:15,231
I'm going to call them.

6552
02:48:15,231 --> 02:48:15,471
I'm like,

6553
02:48:15,471 --> 02:48:16,910
don't fuck if you're
going to leave a bitch,

6554
02:48:17,090 --> 02:48:19,910
don't fucking tell her you leaving and
just fucking bounce and let the hook her

6555
02:48:19,911 --> 02:48:20,930
figure it out on her own.

6556
02:48:20,931 --> 02:48:21,351
Wow.

6557
02:48:21,351 --> 02:48:26,351
Russell Peters with some chrome pimp
hand type shit back knuckled knocking

6558
02:48:27,171 --> 02:48:29,880
pitches for a loop and

6559
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:35,120
world as the bitch
[inaudible] you're okay.

6560
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:37,010
You're out of if you're out of Yucky x,

6561
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:39,290
you're working for the
outside as they call it.

6562
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:42,590
The banished young says good rooms.

6563
02:48:42,591 --> 02:48:46,290
They have a bunch of don't have the
great rooms and then here's the problem.

6564
02:48:46,750 --> 02:48:48,110
The one in Vancouver was amazing,

6565
02:48:48,111 --> 02:48:49,090
but they don't have right.

6566
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:51,270
That's gone now.

6567
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:51,580
Right?

6568
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:52,130
Well they,

6569
02:48:52,130 --> 02:48:52,820
they mix.

6570
02:48:52,820 --> 02:48:53,490
Here's the thing,

6571
02:48:53,490 --> 02:48:55,100
they were always good to me,

6572
02:48:55,240 --> 02:48:55,520
but,

6573
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:58,160
but that's because they
never really fell for,

6574
02:48:58,161 --> 02:49:00,380
I'm your whole fucking mentality.

6575
02:49:00,381 --> 02:49:01,214
You know what I mean?

6576
02:49:01,290 --> 02:49:02,270
I would leave,

6577
02:49:02,271 --> 02:49:03,380
let a motherfucker know,

6578
02:49:03,381 --> 02:49:03,741
you know,

6579
02:49:03,741 --> 02:49:08,010
to gain from 95 from
[inaudible] 95 I started going

6580
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,150
to show up with a cane,

6581
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:11,790
got a real lamp.

6582
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:12,751
Let them know,

6583
02:49:12,751 --> 02:49:13,060
son,

6584
02:49:13,060 --> 02:49:13,830
let him know.

6585
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:14,850
Tell him why you met Joe.

6586
02:49:14,851 --> 02:49:18,960
Tell Him Barnabas Collins head
on at a big silver dragon.

6587
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:26,430
I started playing outside of Yuck kicks
in in 95 like in England and I realized

6588
02:49:26,431 --> 02:49:29,460
that the rest of the world was there
that I didn't need to fucking focus on

6589
02:49:29,461 --> 02:49:30,390
Canada like that.

6590
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:34,320
Didn't you like really get famous
very quickly because of the Internet?

6591
02:49:34,350 --> 02:49:35,340
Because of video clips?

6592
02:49:35,370 --> 02:49:35,491
Well,

6593
02:49:35,491 --> 02:49:36,150
not really quick.

6594
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:36,530
I mean,

6595
02:49:36,530 --> 02:49:39,120
I don't want to say like I was
15 years in when I got home.

6596
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:41,490
I started in 89 oh,

6597
02:49:41,491 --> 02:49:45,480
I didn't know that in Canada was around
since 89 it was like eight he was

6598
02:49:45,481 --> 02:49:46,830
probably eight years now.

6599
02:49:47,050 --> 02:49:48,870
It was a was eight when I started.

6600
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:50,610
That's amazing.

6601
02:49:50,610 --> 02:49:51,330
Did you did,

6602
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:56,040
but you became famous as far as I
am my world because the Internet,

6603
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,450
that is absolutely correct.

6604
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:59,430
A bunch of people sending
me clips were like,

6605
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,870
have you heard this Russell Peters guy?

6606
02:50:00,871 --> 02:50:01,704
And then boom,

6607
02:50:01,770 --> 02:50:02,730
like youtube clips,

6608
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:06,810
like you are one of the first guys that
I know that really blew up because of

6609
02:50:06,811 --> 02:50:07,201
youtube.

6610
02:50:07,201 --> 02:50:12,201
That was in oh four late oh four when
youtube just started and then by the time

6611
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:14,580
the end of oh five came,

6612
02:50:14,581 --> 02:50:19,581
I literally went from making $40,000 a
year to [inaudible] the end of o three a

6613
02:50:22,230 --> 02:50:24,670
to the end of o for making half a million.

6614
02:50:25,610 --> 02:50:25,770
No,

6615
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:25,831
no,

6616
02:50:25,831 --> 02:50:25,921
no,

6617
02:50:25,921 --> 02:50:27,520
but I'm saying like like
that's what it went for.

6618
02:50:27,521 --> 02:50:31,920
$40 to know they're going to ask 30,000
to half a million in like in a year like

6619
02:50:31,921 --> 02:50:32,190
that.

6620
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:32,271
Well,

6621
02:50:32,271 --> 02:50:33,480
let's stop your progress right now.

6622
02:50:33,481 --> 02:50:35,670
Not Catch up to today because
people are going to get sad.

6623
02:50:35,740 --> 02:50:36,000
No,

6624
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:36,833
no.

6625
02:50:37,270 --> 02:50:40,380
Now I'm broke and that's why I'm here.

6626
02:50:40,381 --> 02:50:41,610
How are being sad like that?

6627
02:50:41,611 --> 02:50:42,960
I mean sad about their own lives.

6628
02:50:42,990 --> 02:50:45,000
When was the last time you
were at the Olive Garden?

6629
02:50:45,700 --> 02:50:46,000
Fucking,

6630
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:46,833
let me tell you something.

6631
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:48,620
I fucking love the olive garden.

6632
02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:52,360
Fuck you mother.

6633
02:50:52,810 --> 02:50:53,271
Last time.

6634
02:50:53,271 --> 02:50:53,661
Seriously,

6635
02:50:53,661 --> 02:50:56,320
one of the last time Russell
Peters is that November leave.

6636
02:50:56,380 --> 02:50:58,010
You snuck that in November.

6637
02:50:58,011 --> 02:51:00,890
I was at the Holiday Times Square.

6638
02:51:00,980 --> 02:51:01,311
Oh,

6639
02:51:01,311 --> 02:51:02,144
that's the good one.

6640
02:51:02,950 --> 02:51:06,050
That was the nation's capitol.

6641
02:51:06,051 --> 02:51:06,910
That's the hotspot.

6642
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:07,371
Olive Garden.

6643
02:51:07,371 --> 02:51:10,970
There's lines to get into this all
together was I was me Dj spin bad.

6644
02:51:10,971 --> 02:51:12,140
His wife and his two kids.

6645
02:51:12,141 --> 02:51:13,400
Did you get in like did you like,

6646
02:51:13,401 --> 02:51:14,810
I'm rocking it enough like that.

6647
02:51:14,811 --> 02:51:15,621
Don't shut that shit.

6648
02:51:15,621 --> 02:51:16,980
Don't work at the olive garden fool.

6649
02:51:17,770 --> 02:51:21,690
She got [inaudible] little thing you
put in your pocket that gives along the

6650
02:51:21,720 --> 02:51:22,480
lines,

6651
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:23,241
the CD,

6652
02:51:23,241 --> 02:51:26,010
disk sized fucking vibrator
that they give you.

6653
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:29,590
You know it's the worst
and it lights the light.

6654
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:31,011
You know it's the worst.

6655
02:51:31,011 --> 02:51:31,791
This is the worst thing.

6656
02:51:31,791 --> 02:51:33,920
Si true story that that that thing,

6657
02:51:33,921 --> 02:51:37,080
if you go out of bounds at
the Burbank Olive Garden,

6658
02:51:37,130 --> 02:51:38,930
always an hour and a
half to two hour wait.

6659
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:42,950
So if you go out of bounds it starts
playing this really embarrassing song and

6660
02:51:42,951 --> 02:51:44,090
it won't stop.

6661
02:51:44,180 --> 02:51:46,450
So like I would always go do
your thing you're talking about,

6662
02:51:47,810 --> 02:51:51,110
I would go to target and next thing you
know he'd start playing nursery rhymes

6663
02:51:51,111 --> 02:51:52,550
but really loud and it's like,

6664
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:58,130
it's like an ice cream truck in your
pocket looking at you and it's like,

6665
02:51:58,131 --> 02:51:58,964
it's like you're,

6666
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:00,170
yeah,

6667
02:52:00,170 --> 02:52:01,670
I swear to God and it's like a way to say,

6668
02:52:01,671 --> 02:52:01,881
hey,

6669
02:52:01,881 --> 02:52:03,020
you're stealing something.

6670
02:52:03,021 --> 02:52:04,760
You're stealing the
olive garden's property.

6671
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:06,400
We're going to annoy everybody

6672
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:09,130
around you by this really
high pitched nursery.

6673
02:52:09,131 --> 02:52:10,690
Ryan give you,

6674
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:15,220
I guess as long as it's 10
that it's torturing you.

6675
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:17,640
Whereas if it was like an
alarm that went off like right,

6676
02:52:17,650 --> 02:52:18,970
he'd probably sue them for that shit.

6677
02:52:18,971 --> 02:52:19,300
Right?

6678
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:19,451
Like,

6679
02:52:19,451 --> 02:52:23,310
how do I get this to shut off so they
can't like put like some audio that's like

6680
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:27,270
stolen property now they played a nice
happy song like hey you should have

6681
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:27,850
hands.

6682
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:29,070
They should have like an old tango.

6683
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:30,260
Hey what are you doing with them?

6684
02:52:30,261 --> 02:52:31,094
My pay,

6685
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:33,650
I went to the supermarket

6686
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:36,700
bag,

6687
02:52:36,890 --> 02:52:40,730
I went to the supermarket the other
day and as I'm leaving the supermarket,

6688
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:43,340
the the wheels on my cart lock up.

6689
02:52:43,550 --> 02:52:44,383
Oh yeah.

6690
02:52:45,170 --> 02:52:49,610
They had a certain distance where you
could travel away from the store before

6691
02:52:49,611 --> 02:52:50,444
the car locked up.

6692
02:52:50,510 --> 02:52:52,930
But this was so fucking stupid
cause it was right in front of this.

6693
02:52:53,390 --> 02:52:54,620
I do that with my house

6694
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:55,950
mouse ears that we sell at.

6695
02:52:55,951 --> 02:52:59,700
The show is actually owned by these
little like kind of headband mouse ears.

6696
02:52:59,701 --> 02:53:04,701
And if you actually walk out 50 feet
of the venue then you're shocked.

6697
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:08,281
Are you serious?

6698
02:53:08,281 --> 02:53:08,551
Yeah.

6699
02:53:08,551 --> 02:53:10,580
50 volts fucking socks too.

6700
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:10,820
They,

6701
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:11,653
the battery,

6702
02:53:12,210 --> 02:53:15,840
the battery has like a like you have it
so it set up so the battery doesn't it?

6703
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:16,980
Wait a minute.

6704
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:17,520
Talk.

6705
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:18,450
Talk us through that again.

6706
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:18,931
What do you,

6707
02:53:18,931 --> 02:53:19,764
what are you talking about?

6708
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:24,780
The battle that we sell in our
shows and people get shocked.

6709
02:53:24,810 --> 02:53:25,050
Yeah,

6710
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:25,711
absolutely.

6711
02:53:25,711 --> 02:53:27,060
We sell them.

6712
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,860
I don't understand $5.

6713
02:53:28,930 --> 02:53:31,440
It's like when you get
good to like star wars,

6714
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:35,010
you know they buy like three d
glasses or something like that.

6715
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:37,200
They have to return the mouse ears.

6716
02:53:37,230 --> 02:53:37,470
No,

6717
02:53:37,470 --> 02:53:37,621
no,

6718
02:53:37,621 --> 02:53:37,771
no.

6719
02:53:37,771 --> 02:53:38,581
Well you can't.

6720
02:53:38,581 --> 02:53:40,500
Cause if you get past the fucking barrier,

6721
02:53:40,530 --> 02:53:42,930
you're fuck just shocked and
you're getting a little jolt.

6722
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,230
So that one I'm confused.

6723
02:53:44,730 --> 02:53:45,860
What are they supposed to do?

6724
02:53:45,861 --> 02:53:46,870
And they support them back.

6725
02:53:46,900 --> 02:53:48,340
They're supposed to give them back to you.

6726
02:53:48,430 --> 02:53:48,641
Okay.

6727
02:53:48,641 --> 02:53:49,340
You haven't explained.

6728
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:49,680
No,

6729
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:49,920
no,

6730
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,270
no.

6731
02:53:50,270 --> 02:53:51,220
I'm totally taking it.

6732
02:53:51,221 --> 02:53:52,180
Totally joking.

6733
02:53:52,700 --> 02:53:53,533
Sorry.

6734
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:59,160
But I can't believe you took it that
far and I believed I tried to help.

6735
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:01,763
Terrible dark.

6736
02:54:01,780 --> 02:54:02,080
I Dunno,

6737
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:02,741
we were comics.

6738
02:54:02,741 --> 02:54:04,060
We analyze it like okay,

6739
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:04,640
that's could be right.

6740
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:06,370
That actually is kind of bad ass though.

6741
02:54:06,371 --> 02:54:09,760
If you get that kind of all of garden
technology and incorporating your show

6742
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:10,221
any,

6743
02:54:10,221 --> 02:54:12,730
you're leaving a venue
with like a product that,

6744
02:54:12,750 --> 02:54:13,390
you know,

6745
02:54:13,390 --> 02:54:14,820
someone who's been selling it your show.

6746
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:15,903
Anyway,

6747
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:20,810
I was at the supermarket and
my fucking wheels locked down.

6748
02:54:20,830 --> 02:54:21,700
I've had that happen,

6749
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:22,990
so I had like,

6750
02:54:22,991 --> 02:54:23,920
I had two choices.

6751
02:54:23,921 --> 02:54:26,920
Either I'm going to call
someone and tell them,

6752
02:54:26,921 --> 02:54:27,251
hey,

6753
02:54:27,251 --> 02:54:31,450
this cart locked up or I cave man
this bitch and just dragged it.

6754
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:33,670
I did so I dragged it
through the parking lot,

6755
02:54:33,671 --> 02:54:34,630
drag the shit I got to,

6756
02:54:34,631 --> 02:54:35,920
I did an angry man.

6757
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:38,860
I that happened to me in
Canada and urban home out,

6758
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:43,880
what does it at home outfitters and I
had a shit load of shit in there fucking

6759
02:54:43,921 --> 02:54:46,860
cart and I had parked far
enough where I couldn't get,

6760
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:49,860
I pushed the cart in the goes
still the car won't go there,

6761
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:51,030
more the fuck do I have a car?

6762
02:54:51,060 --> 02:54:53,890
And it really pisses me off because we
weren't as Mexicans in Canada can help.

6763
02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:55,100
Two things I never do.

6764
02:54:55,170 --> 02:54:56,760
Hey Hammer,

6765
02:54:58,950 --> 02:54:59,870
Ian's going to come out.

6766
02:54:59,900 --> 02:55:00,651
Two things I never do.

6767
02:55:00,651 --> 02:55:02,000
I never purposely litter.

6768
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:03,073
I never let her,

6769
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:04,130
I always bring back cards

6770
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:05,300
just it's not that fucking hard.

6771
02:55:05,630 --> 02:55:10,070
You didn't know about these fucking
carts and then this is all brand new.

6772
02:55:10,071 --> 02:55:11,900
This is like discovery
channel shift from me.

6773
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:16,170
There's carts and say you can't fuck
you go further than a certain distance.

6774
02:55:16,210 --> 02:55:17,210
Never shot up.

6775
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:18,890
The carts will lock.

6776
02:55:18,920 --> 02:55:21,440
They literally look
stupid that you can't you.

6777
02:55:21,441 --> 02:55:22,490
So you have to drag them.

6778
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:26,310
So essentially they're on like this
rubber pads and she does just grabbing it.

6779
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:28,273
Is that so wrong?

6780
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:29,810
I mean if I own a supermarket

6781
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:35,210
amount of fucking cards and people were
just going to be taking those fucking

6782
02:55:35,211 --> 02:55:35,670
things,

6783
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:37,830
make them go out to the
street just to the street.

6784
02:55:37,831 --> 02:55:38,480
They rang.

6785
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,500
You got them out there.

6786
02:55:39,790 --> 02:55:40,210
It's,

6787
02:55:40,210 --> 02:55:41,430
it's like a cell phone.

6788
02:55:41,431 --> 02:55:44,340
I'm sure it's like one of those
dog things to those dog electrical.

6789
02:55:44,341 --> 02:55:44,530
Yeah,

6790
02:55:44,530 --> 02:55:47,550
but then you get to look at
the value of the fucking cart.

6791
02:55:47,551 --> 02:55:49,330
The cart probably costs about

6792
02:55:51,450 --> 02:55:56,430
$7 I would say 30 I thought if the value
of having your customers not have to

6793
02:55:56,431 --> 02:55:57,960
fucking drag their food,

6794
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,500
they don't offer you assistance,

6795
02:56:02,250 --> 02:56:03,270
they don't offer you somebody.

6796
02:56:03,271 --> 02:56:03,600
Okay,

6797
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,171
sort of the cart.

6798
02:56:04,171 --> 02:56:04,741
We'll stop here.

6799
02:56:04,741 --> 02:56:05,280
We will have,

6800
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:06,830
oh pull the card stops here,

6801
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:09,680
plenty with the bags or
continue onto your car.

6802
02:56:11,390 --> 02:56:16,010
Mexicans in a good robot
deal this hubo baths before,

6803
02:56:16,011 --> 02:56:17,540
but don't steal my new band.

6804
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:20,300
The best thing about the
olive garden and Burbank,

6805
02:56:21,230 --> 02:56:21,441
Hey,

6806
02:56:21,441 --> 02:56:21,860
listen,

6807
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:26,860
is this true robots before Mexican
kids taking the Mexican jobs,

6808
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:30,710
right when the Mexican starts taking
over manufacturing and the worst part is

6809
02:56:30,711 --> 02:56:32,420
the robots are programmed by Indians,

6810
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:33,140
Mexicans,

6811
02:56:33,140 --> 02:56:33,973
terminator,

6812
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:37,730
and the worst part is the rest
of America can differentiate.

6813
02:56:37,790 --> 02:56:38,870
You slogging it,

6814
02:56:38,871 --> 02:56:39,640
bitch.

6815
02:56:39,640 --> 02:56:41,890
There's a tour going on
and no one knows about it.

6816
02:56:41,891 --> 02:56:42,610
Like these mics,

6817
02:56:42,610 --> 02:56:44,060
these new Mexicans are hairy

6818
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:46,881
in there.

6819
02:56:46,881 --> 02:56:51,881
Ray fucking lazy tans more to start
dressing up as a new Mexicans and they're

6820
02:56:52,131 --> 02:56:52,964
really out of movies.

6821
02:56:53,450 --> 02:56:56,060
These new Mexican 2.0 is are really lazy.

6822
02:56:56,810 --> 02:56:57,411
He's a new,

6823
02:56:57,411 --> 02:56:58,700
a Indian fight league,

6824
02:56:58,850 --> 02:56:59,810
some big India.

6825
02:57:01,010 --> 02:57:01,530
I,

6826
02:57:01,530 --> 02:57:02,330
I'm aware of it.

6827
02:57:02,330 --> 02:57:03,640
I know one of the guys get involved.

6828
02:57:03,670 --> 02:57:05,710
They're going to do an
ultimate fighter as well.

6829
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:06,581
Hey man,

6830
02:57:06,581 --> 02:57:07,000
we can't,

6831
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:08,980
we can't all have
conversations at the same time.

6832
02:57:08,981 --> 02:57:11,020
This is really exciting and invite league.

6833
02:57:11,021 --> 02:57:11,800
Actually,

6834
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:12,580
it's going to be crazy.

6835
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:14,070
I know one of the guys involved.

6836
02:57:14,071 --> 02:57:15,130
What is it?

6837
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:16,031
There's a,

6838
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:19,650
there's a new MMA series starting
in India and they're having,

6839
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:21,580
it's like almost like a
round Robin type of thing.

6840
02:57:21,581 --> 02:57:22,414
Right.

6841
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:23,170
I don't know what it is.

6842
02:57:23,170 --> 02:57:23,890
I don't know how they're going to,

6843
02:57:23,890 --> 02:57:25,320
it's a new company I'm not worried about.

6844
02:57:25,350 --> 02:57:27,700
They got this new thing called a fuck.

6845
02:57:27,701 --> 02:57:29,920
It's called like the world
fight league or something.

6846
02:57:30,340 --> 02:57:32,920
Wfl they always come up
with crazy names for these.

6847
02:57:32,921 --> 02:57:33,071
No,

6848
02:57:33,071 --> 02:57:33,904
but it's like,

6849
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:34,561
nope.

6850
02:57:34,561 --> 02:57:35,394
It's

6851
02:57:36,850 --> 02:57:39,130
like boxing like oh for boxing.

6852
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:39,611
Yeah.

6853
02:57:39,611 --> 02:57:43,330
It's like a box and you're like Patina
in India it's called Super Fight League

6854
02:57:43,890 --> 02:57:44,121
did.

6855
02:57:44,121 --> 02:57:45,040
But this is MMA.

6856
02:57:45,190 --> 02:57:45,461
Yeah,

6857
02:57:45,461 --> 02:57:45,791
but no,

6858
02:57:45,791 --> 02:57:46,180
but there's,

6859
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:50,560
there's the MMA one but there's also a
super fight league where they have boxing

6860
02:57:50,561 --> 02:57:55,561
one where they have a teams from
different countries that fight and then I,

6861
02:57:56,021 --> 02:57:56,680
exactly,

6862
02:57:56,680 --> 02:57:57,131
I agree.

6863
02:57:57,131 --> 02:57:57,551
I agree.

6864
02:57:57,551 --> 02:57:59,830
It's not going to work if it doesn't
make any fucking sense because you can't

6865
02:57:59,831 --> 02:58:01,980
have a solo sport font as a team.

6866
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,020
It doesn't make any fucking drive

6867
02:58:04,610 --> 02:58:05,431
everywhere around,

6868
02:58:05,431 --> 02:58:05,731
you know,

6869
02:58:05,731 --> 02:58:07,470
you can have a new box did it for a while.

6870
02:58:07,471 --> 02:58:09,950
They had a thing called
the IFL and it lasts.

6871
02:58:09,951 --> 02:58:11,160
Depends on the white league or something.

6872
02:58:11,250 --> 02:58:11,581
No.

6873
02:58:11,581 --> 02:58:12,560
International fights,

6874
02:58:12,561 --> 02:58:13,394
right?

6875
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:13,981
Exotic.

6876
02:58:13,981 --> 02:58:16,470
Slightly exotic to the dye.

6877
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:18,290
I Gene Sadik

6878
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:22,230
so big in Asia,

6879
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:25,200
like the Big Asian thing is one FC.

6880
02:58:25,201 --> 02:58:28,770
It's like dream from
Japan in Southeast Asia.

6881
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:29,970
It's giant.

6882
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:32,460
I love FC pride.

6883
02:58:32,461 --> 02:58:33,300
Those are my favorites.

6884
02:58:33,301 --> 02:58:34,740
At first ride was awesome,

6885
02:58:34,741 --> 02:58:35,730
but I fucking lame man.

6886
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,690
I will always wanted to go see really
cheetahs didn't fucking smoke it well

6887
02:58:39,691 --> 02:58:40,290
before.

6888
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:41,280
Before it went away,

6889
02:58:41,281 --> 02:58:41,701
man.

6890
02:58:41,701 --> 02:58:42,501
We knew Turi.

6891
02:58:42,501 --> 02:58:43,830
Remember when Tory word for them?

6892
02:58:43,831 --> 02:58:44,581
We had a chance,

6893
02:58:44,581 --> 02:58:44,791
man,

6894
02:58:44,791 --> 02:58:46,410
we were going to go to
one of those live prides,

6895
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:52,040
coordinating it all basically in most
countries by organized crime fight the

6896
02:58:54,271 --> 02:58:55,104
fight leads.

6897
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:55,471
Hey,

6898
02:58:55,471 --> 02:58:56,610
he just said two minutes.

6899
02:58:56,610 --> 02:58:58,050
We've got to look at it in this pitch.

6900
02:58:58,110 --> 02:58:58,461
Well,

6901
02:58:58,461 --> 02:58:59,550
we can come back again,

6902
02:58:59,551 --> 02:59:01,020
but we've got to stop this one recording.

6903
02:59:01,021 --> 02:59:02,250
Otherwise it's going to be corrupt,

6904
02:59:02,480 --> 02:59:02,911
but he gets,

6905
02:59:02,911 --> 02:59:04,140
it ain't anything over three hours.

6906
02:59:04,141 --> 02:59:06,480
You put it on iTunes and it
just shits all over itself.

6907
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:09,780
We'll just stop writing
like blaze in the corner.

6908
02:59:09,781 --> 02:59:11,040
They're just fucking sound asleep.

6909
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:11,761
But yeah,

6910
02:59:11,761 --> 02:59:11,991
it's,

6911
02:59:11,991 --> 02:59:12,511
it's pretty late.

6912
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:12,811
Anyway.

6913
02:59:12,811 --> 02:59:13,141
Listen,

6914
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:14,580
this has been a fantastic podcast.

6915
02:59:14,581 --> 02:59:15,500
We've got drunk together.

6916
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:16,800
We learned a lot about each other,

6917
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,693
right?

6918
02:59:18,300 --> 02:59:19,060
Eddie Bravo.

6919
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:20,310
Any last thing you need to say?

6920
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:20,860
Bravo.

6921
02:59:20,860 --> 02:59:21,690
We get out of here.

6922
02:59:21,690 --> 02:59:22,710
Can you give me a drum beat?

6923
02:59:23,350 --> 02:59:24,183
Okay,

6924
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:25,081
give me a beat.

6925
02:59:25,081 --> 02:59:25,281
Tape,

6926
02:59:25,281 --> 02:59:25,621
boots.

6927
02:59:25,621 --> 02:59:26,041
Cats,

6928
02:59:26,041 --> 02:59:26,431
boots,

6929
02:59:26,431 --> 02:59:26,770
cat.

6930
02:59:26,770 --> 02:59:28,140
Ladies and gentlemen,

6931
02:59:28,141 --> 02:59:30,570
I just ask you to just not
judge us as human beings.

6932
02:59:30,571 --> 02:59:31,540
Bodies show.

6933
02:59:32,220 --> 02:59:33,110
Don't judge us,

6934
02:59:33,710 --> 02:59:34,350
but don't.

6935
02:59:34,350 --> 02:59:39,350
Don't judge us as personalities or
people with the inability to form one

6936
02:59:39,630 --> 02:59:41,130
coherent group of humans,

6937
02:59:41,670 --> 02:59:43,090
not communicating on top of each other.

6938
02:59:43,090 --> 02:59:45,180
It just relate and we're tired.

6939
02:59:45,181 --> 02:59:46,860
And we had a stress.

6940
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:47,490
How?

6941
02:59:47,490 --> 02:59:47,790
How,

6942
02:59:47,790 --> 02:59:49,440
how much this podcast meant to me.

6943
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:50,760

6944
02:59:50,761 --> 02:59:51,370
California.

6945
02:59:51,370 --> 02:59:52,260
I did fucked up.

6946
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:52,981
I was drunk,

6947
02:59:52,981 --> 02:59:54,990
so I had blazed drive my car from Irvine,

6948
02:59:54,991 --> 02:59:56,910
California to here.

6949
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:59,520
And then we're going to go
back to Irvine from here.

6950
02:59:59,720 --> 02:59:59,890
Well,

6951
02:59:59,890 --> 03:00:00,723

I wanted to see Zimmerman,

6953
03:00:02,970 --> 03:00:04,830

motherfuckers on the planet.

6954
03:00:04,890 --> 03:00:06,750

little brother red band.

6959

6960
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:12,121
Russell.

6961
03:00:12,121 --> 03:00:12,931
You're an awesome dude,

6962
03:00:12,931 --> 03:00:13,440
man.

6963
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:15,360
I the first time we
ever hung out in Vegas,

6964
03:00:15,361 --> 03:00:15,981
I'm like this,

6965
03:00:15,981 --> 03:00:16,890

6966
03:00:16,891 --> 03:00:17,724
I love him.

6967
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:19,740
We had a good time and the
very first time I hung out,

6968
03:00:19,741 --> 03:00:20,421
went up to the mix.

6969
03:00:20,421 --> 03:00:21,840
How do we couple cocktails and laughs.

6970
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:25,890
We had some beverage headed off fabulously
or they say fan and I did not want to

6971
03:00:25,900 --> 03:00:26,790
a freeload off you.

6972
03:00:26,791 --> 03:00:28,320
So I split the bottles with you.

6973
03:00:28,410 --> 03:00:28,591

6974
03:00:28,591 --> 03:00:29,221

6975
03:00:29,221 --> 03:00:29,371

6976
03:00:29,371 --> 03:00:29,671
It's true.

6977
03:00:29,671 --> 03:00:30,421
We had a great time.

6978
03:00:30,421 --> 03:00:31,254
We had fun.

6979
03:00:31,650 --> 03:00:33,120
What's coming up?

6980
03:00:33,121 --> 03:00:33,810

Nobody knows what saying.

7011

question before we go.

We're almost out of time.
