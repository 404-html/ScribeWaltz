Hello Freak bitches.
You don't think of that as being a

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,100
stress like they think of stress as
being bills.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,810
They think of stress as being traffic,
no stresses,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,660
every,
all those things are stress,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,340
relationships,
friendships,

6
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,520
work conflict.
When you're at work all day and you hate

7
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,170
your job,
that stress,

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,580
that is stress that grinds on you.
That feeling like when you get out of

9
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,390
work at the end of the day and you have
that weight lifted off your shoulders,

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,840
that means you're in a bad job.
You gotta figure out a way where you

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,000
don't have that.
If it's possible,

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,830
if it's possible,
find that way.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,220
That was me 10 years ago.
I was a municipal tax assessor in,

14
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,520
stayed in New Jersey.
Amazing.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,200
It was the just saying all those things
together make me want to fucking jump

16
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:49,830
off a roof on Friday.
I would literally get depressed on

17
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,660
Friday because I knew Monday was coming.

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,980
Yeah,
I know that feeling.

19
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,870
It was fuck.
It was God damn hell,

20
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,300
but I was making a shitload of money.
My mom was so proud of me.

21
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,170
I had the four o one k and the six weeks
off vacation I was living the American

22
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,940
dream.
I fucking hated myself.

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,580
I sat around,
I remember this was the turning point

24
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,260
for me.
I sat around a boardroom table and I was

25
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,230
a lot younger than my closest peer and
I'm looking at all these older dudes and

26
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,990
we're all sitting there and suits and
like all were so fucking important,

27
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,140
you know,
being those dickheads and they're all

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,730
overweight,
they're all,

29
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,120
they all have red faces and they're all
talking about how they're going to

30
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,911
fucking,
you know,

31
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:23,880
sneak off to the bar before they go home
because they don't want to deal with the

32
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,610
fucking family and the kids and all the
fucking bullshit.

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,440
Like I get it the fuck out of here.
I have to get the fuck Outta here,

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,040
where I'm going to fucking die like
this.

35
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,280
I got to change my life.
And that's what we did.

36
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,200
And I kind of threw that away.
Resigned from the position,

37
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,110
took the job as the strength coach at
team quest up in the Portland,

38
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,330
Oregon,
moved across the country for fucking

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,140
minimum wage to clean toilets and left
that job behind.

40
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,680
And I fucking loved it.
I loved scrubbing disgusting,

41
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,640
Shitty Gym Mats at five o'clock in the
morning and not sitting in a beautiful

42
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,990
corner office,
you know,

43
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,930
for x amount of dollars per year.
Because I was,

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,050
I was doing what I loved and I gave
myself the opportunity and a chance to

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
do something with my life and get leery
of distress.

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,790
I think that's why I'm kind of veering
off it.

47
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,400
That's what it was talking.
I was so stressed out and I was riding

48
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,650
my bike and fuck,
I remember it was freezing cold,

49
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,200
fucking raining.
And I'm riding my fucking stupid bike

50
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,510
cause we only have one vehicle.
You and my wife had to go fucking work.

51
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,390
I'm riding my fucking bike six miles to
the gym and I fucking loved it.

52
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,800
It was such a pure,
crisp,

53
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,380
cold morning and it was just so alive in
life,

54
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,190
you know?
And it was,

55
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,860
everything was brand new again.
And I was in my mid twenties at that

56
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:26,820
point,
mid later twenties.

57
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,470
At that point.
It's fucking cool shit man.

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,810
But he gave me the best advice ever,
uh,

59
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,260
that ever got in comedy.
And I,

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,100
I talked about this in my act a little
bit,

61
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,400
like I tell the story,
but we were hanging out after we did a

62
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,580
show one night in Cleveland at the,
at this big amphitheater.

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,850
And after the show I'm talking to these
two girls and they're like,

64
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,080
you're so funny of that.
And I'm like,

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,090
once you come back to the hook towel,
yeah,

66
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,670
come hang up.
Dave might stop by.

67
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,900
You know,
I was trying to say that.

68
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,670
Yeah,
I was trying to pick up these chicks.

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,690
He actually wasn't gonna stop by the
imagine if you were in the middle of

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,590
boner and she heard Dave's voice and
she's like,

71
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,160
get off me.

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,993
Yeah,
exactly.

73
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,220
Imagine me.
His cock blocking anybody standing in

74
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,080
the living room.
I'm Rick James Bitch.

75
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,990
Oh my God.
Is it him?

76
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,420
I need a meet him.
He's not going anywhere.

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,150
I'll come in 30 seconds.
He was awesome.

78
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,690
No rape.
He was an awesome wing man cause he was,

79
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,720
he was,
he's married and he was like a great

80
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,010
dude about it.
He was just like,

81
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,110
you know,
he would sit there and like talk to you,

82
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,600
you know,
with the chicks and then like he'd peel

83
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,250
off and then you'd be there with the
checks.

84
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,500
Man,
it was fucking beautiful.

85
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,250
And the chicks would go,
you must be special.

86
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,770
Oh Dude.
Well they also just saw you open for

87
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,480
dude,
it was so,

88
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,040
oh look at you.
You're glow.

89
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,930
There's really,
it was nice.

90
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,330
It was nice.
It was really nice.

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,290
So I was talking to these two girls
after one of the shows in Cleveland and

92
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,940
uh,
and I'm like,

93
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,950
come back to the hotel and they're,
they're being wishy washy.

94
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,581
And I'm like,
all right,

95
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,590
whatever.
And they take my number and I go

96
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,520
backstage and I'm bitching to Dave and
the,

97
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,170
the tour bus driver about these checks.
And I'm like,

98
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,090
you know,
they fucking just being on wishy washy

99
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,160
and I don't know this and I don't know,
it's just annoying.

100
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,680
Just fucking hanging out.
If you're going to hang out and the bus

101
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,580
driver goes,
Joe,

102
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,110
I'm to tell you what you need to do,
man.

103
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,080
You need to walk up to that girl,
look her dead in the eye and say,

104
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,980
do you want to suck my Dick or not?
Right.

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
And I was like,
terrible advice.

106
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,530
I was like,
okay,

107
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,840
okay.
And uh,

108
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,840
and I was considering it for a second
and then Chappelle goes,

109
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,000
don't do that shit man.
Don't do it.

110
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,050
You're going to fuck around.
Joe.

111
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,610
You're going to get famous one of these
days.

112
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,000
10 years from now,
that bitch will be on hard going,

113
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,700
Joe Derosa told me to suck his dick and
Cleveland once.

114
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,570
That's how I grew up.
I mean,

115
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,770
I would go out a lot of times during
school and I'd just go up,

116
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,210
sleep on the mountain,
come back,

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,560
do chores,
milk cows,

118
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,590
go to school,
you know,

119
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,530
go to football practice,
go home,

120
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,190
do chores,
go up on the mountain,

121
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,470
sleep on the mountain,
come back home.

122
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,820
I mean,
that was kind of how,

123
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,220
how my brothers and I grew up and
it's just,

124
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,020
I mean I just have a yearning for the
wild.

125
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,600
I mean there some of the coolest
experiences that I've had in life have

126
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:10,080
been when I'm by myself and go and do
something totally random that,

127
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,510
that,
that nobody else would really even think

128
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:12,901
about.
I say,

129
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,250
shit,
I shouldn't say nobody,

130
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:15,090
but it's like,
you know,

131
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,940
in college I'd drive home two hours to
my folks' house,

132
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,620
then I drive another hour up to the
canyon.

133
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,960
By the time I get to the trail head,
it's 11 o'clock at night,

134
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,200
hike in for three or four hours,
find some more sleep,

135
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,550
get up on top of the mountain.
And I'm sitting there as,

136
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,540
as the sun's coming up and three
wolverines come up,

137
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,820
you know,
and circle the lake and it's like back

138
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:33,571
then,
you know,

139
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:36,120
in the,
in the 90s there weren't wolverines in

140
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:37,680
Idaho.
There weren't supposed to be anyway.

141
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:41,940
I mean I was one of the very first or
very few to actually see wild wolverines

142
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,620
in Idaho.
And it's like,

143
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,950
had I not been there by myself,
experienced in that,

144
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:47,850
in that canyon,
you know,

145
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:51,570
if there's other people or other things,
those wolverines might not have been as

146
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:52,291
comfortable,
you know,

147
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,770
but because I was there by myself and
I'm the only one there looking down over

148
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:56,790
it,
I had that.

149
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,020
And there's,
there's a lot of opportunities like that

150
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,990
that
when you have someone else there,

151
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,910
you're focused on the group,
you know what you're focused on,

152
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,440
your conversations,
your buddies,

153
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,670
your friends and everything.

154
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,950
You're not,
you're not really tuned in to what's

155
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,630
around you.
You're not tuned in to your

156
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,910
surroundings.
And so there's certain things that I

157
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,160
think you miss out on when you've got
other people there.

158
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,260
And it's not that I don't enjoy that
sometimes,

159
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,680
but I feel like when I'm there,
like there's a connection,

160
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,160
you know,
there's a connection to the land,

161
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,500
there's a connection to the environment,
and,

162
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,071
uh,
you know,

163
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,730
you could bring all of into if,
if you're,

164
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,890
if you're a Hippie,
you know,

165
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,710
tree hugger,
Voodoo type person,

166
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,320
you can bring in the nature and the gods
and all that kind of stuff into the

167
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,540
whole element.
But that really and truly is what is

168
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,150
what it is,
is you're out there with no one but

169
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,910
yourself and God and his creation.
I mean,

170
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,320
that's it.
It's all surrounding you.

171
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,890
Yeah.
And being like that deep in nature where

172
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,630
you're actually a part of it because
you're not,

173
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,210
you're not talking to anyone.
So there's no,

174
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,180
there's no conversations going on in
your conversations there just with

175
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,220
myself.
But you know what I'm saying?

176
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,650
It's like you don't,
there's nothing,

177
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,260
no anchor that brings you back to
civilization.

178
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,230
You just seeing wild shit.
You're just seeing wildlife.

179
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:09,770
You're seeing animals that would exist
that way regardless of whether or not

180
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,390
you were there or not.
Yeah.
