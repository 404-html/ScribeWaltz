1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,931
To to,
to,

2
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:02,430
to do.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,510
Boom.
Mike Baker.

4
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,210
Ladies and gentlemen.
Boom.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,620
How are you sir?
I'm doing well.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,483
Hey.
You know,

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,950
it seems like the year is going well so 
far.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,100
Not much to report.
Is that sarcasm?

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,070
You guys allowed to use that guy?
No,

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,420
I know we're supposed to have that 
removed when we joined.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,980
Um,
but uh,

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,491
yeah.
No,

13
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,390
it's going good.
Going good.

14
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,420
Thank you families.
Great kids are doing very well.

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,313
Business is going very well.
I know everybody was most concerned 

16
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,920
about my family and my kids.
Absolutely.

17
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,200
That's how people start off pocket.
Well we just want to hear.

18
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,910
You're having a good time up there in 
God's country.

19
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,330
Ah,
yeah.

20
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,730
Idaho,
Idaho.

21
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,573
Beautiful place.
We're just talking about how awesome it 

22
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:41,130
is up there and we're getting a lot of 
snow.

23
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,590
I mean you got to get on a ton of snow 
up in the north,

24
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,424
particularly here in California,
but we're getting just hammered five 

25
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,690
feet up in big bear.

26
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,510
Bear apparently just got covered in 
snow,

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
which is awesome.
We had like 330 inches of snow up where 

28
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,630
we've got a place up in about two hours 
outside of Boise,

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,523
up in the mountains where we go skiing 
and fishing and I'm not at the same 

30
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,070
time.
That'd be a hell of a sport.

31
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,050
Someone's probably done that.
We know.

32
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,884
I know.
I do know the guys are cross country 

33
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:12,090
skiing into hunting spots now.
Yeah.

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,930
That's a thing that guys are doing.
There's actually these foldable skis and

35
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:19,080
you strapped these things on and they 
can stuff in your pack when you're done.

36
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,880
And apparently it's way better than snow
shoes.

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,200
So when guys are trying to traverse,
like really unpack like fresh snow,

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,320
no path fix stuff.
They're doing cross country skiing.

39
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,154
And I mean,
that's tough.

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,460
That's tough work.
But it,

41
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,390
it's,
it's not as tough as snow shoes.

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
Snow shoeing is,
it is a grind for any distance.

43
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,180
Right?
But,

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,931
uh,
but yeah,

45
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,764
you know what you do see,
I mean we were skiing fresh tracks off 

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,880
off the,
uh,

47
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,863
the side back backside of one of the 
mountains that we ski is two weeks ago 

48
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,780
and the snow was falling.
There was no wind,

49
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,000
it was just beautiful.
There was nobody we didn't.

50
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,863
I think we saw,
I think we saw two other skiers the 

51
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,864
whole time that we were out and it's 
just stopped constantly and just stare 

52
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,350
and look around and you think how 
beautiful it says,

53
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,243
and then I do what everybody does.
I take out my phone to it cause I'm 

54
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,351
going to capture the moment on my phone 
camera and somehow get the grand of this

55
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,720
scene on my iphone and I always do the 
same thing.

56
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,840
I go,
I go back to the sit in the cabinet.

57
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,480
I look at.
I go,

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,890
oh,
that's a stupid photo.

59
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,180
Looks like white.
Yeah,

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
that you.
That's it.

61
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,153
That's the picture you took.
That's one of them is pretty goddamn 

62
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,270
beautiful.
Still pretty beautiful.

63
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,130
I have some buddies that live up in 
Ketchum.

64
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,460
They run a firstlight.
My friend Ryan Callahan.

65
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,280
Shout out to Ryan Callahan.
He runs a firstlight.

66
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,143
It's a hunting clothing company and 
they're up and catch them and he's 

67
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,740
always just raving about it.
Yeah,

68
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,574
I catch them straight.
That's where Sun Valley is and it gets 

69
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,290
more crowded up there.
You know,

70
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,490
but it's uh,
it's kind of like a high end,

71
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,970
a great town.
It is a fancy fancy pants.

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,710
Yeah.
I mean if you look at Idaho,

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,100
there's two.
There's two blue spots in Idaho.

74
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,380
One is boise.
They're very democrat,

75
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,110
you know,
heavy city and the other is a catch him,

76
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,020
uh,
in that,

77
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,480
in that particular county because of Sun
Valley being there.

78
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,030
And so we get a lot of,
a lot of wealthy folks,

79
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,980
but it's a beautiful town.
It's a great community.

80
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,823
It's a year round community,
but there's some other towns is a place 

81
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,770
up there in Idaho called McCall,
which,

82
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,231
uh,
again,

83
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:13,064
it's a couple hours outside of Boise,
up in the mountains and it's a real 

84
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,731
town,
right?

85
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,230
I mean,
there's nothing fancy about it,

86
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,990
but it's a great place.
Sits right on this beautiful lake,

87
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,480
pay at like and uh,
you know,

88
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,343
fishing is fantastic.
And then the skiing is great during the 

89
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,460
winter.
It's,

90
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,293
you know,
I sound like I'm on the Chamber of 

91
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,150
Commerce.
Well listen man,

92
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,253
we were saying right before people from 
Idaho don't like to talk about how 

93
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,550
beautiful Idaho is because they're 
trying to keep people out.

94
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,140
I know,
I know I shouldn't do that.

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,113
I have some friends that have a house on
quarter lane and they sent me pictures 

96
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,240
and you just go,
Holy Shit.

97
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,850
You get to look at that like they're on 
this lake.

98
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,960
It's about 100 feet deep and you could 
see the ground like it's glass.

99
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,973
You see the bottom of that lake.
You could see the logs that are down 

100
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,100
there,
the sticks.

101
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,330
I'm like,
that is crazy.

102
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,240
It's crystal clear wildlife up there.
It's fantastic.

103
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,051
It's just,
yeah,

104
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,030
it is in this place.
Places like that all around the state,

105
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,391
you know,
and,

106
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,790
and the Nice thing about Idaho is,
I mean,

107
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,330
again,
everybody says,

108
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,800
oh,
what if we turn it into the pbs,

109
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,634
Idaho,
our,

110
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,580
it's a,
it gives you a different look everywhere

111
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,600
you go.
Eastern Idaho,

112
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,381
west,
you know,

113
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,910
up north,
it's.

114
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,250
Yeah.
So there's a lot going for it.

115
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,600
And the hunting's great.
The fishing's fantastic.

116
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,434
Fly fishing is amazing.
Whitewater Whitewater is gonna be 

117
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,420
insane.
This year because of the snow,

118
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,260
it's good.
It's a great place to be.

119
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,370
The climbing is good and a giant chunk 
of that is public land.

120
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,204
Folks.
That's your land and this is something 

121
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:32,250
that I put on my instagram yesterday and
the day before as well because there's a

122
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,300
bill that got introduced that's being 
proposed to sell off public lands.

123
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,900
And uh,
there's this one representative.

124
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,650
What's that fellow's name?
They got Jason [inaudible] from Utah.

125
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,860
He introduces bill.
How dare you,

126
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,550
Jason,
to try to sell it.

127
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,371
Look,
as a young fellow,

128
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,710
he doesn't fucking know what he's doing.
Look,

129
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,553
he looks like he's in his thirties.
Just people don't realize how lucky we 

130
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,930
have it to have so much of this country.
Public land like that where you can.

131
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,860
And it's not just hunting folks when you
know,

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,650
people say,
oh,

133
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,010
we're both living.
No,

134
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,750
listen to me.
You could hike this.

135
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,250
You could fish,
you can camp.

136
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,320
You could just go lie down and stare at 
the stars.

137
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,153
It's your land.
This is all ours and it's unprecedented 

138
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,654
in this world.
There's no other country that has 

139
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,770
anything remotely like our public land 
system.

140
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,920
We can't let them give it away.
You can't let them sell it.

141
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,360
And if anybody wants to like,
you know,

142
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,420
uh,
you know,

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,273
give a kick in the ass to hunting.
I don't understand that either because 

144
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,734
you know,
what a lot of the land is maintained by 

145
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,050
hunting,
you know,

146
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,561
and,
and,

147
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,394
and you know,
both in the fees and also just the 

148
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,350
hunting itself is doing a great service.
You know,

149
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,820
so I,
I don't,

150
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,654
I don't quite get that.
I mean I understand it and I suppose on 

151
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,040
an emotive level because how could you 
kill that thing?

152
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,140
I think because he's tasty because I 
like to eat,

153
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,020
you know,
it's,

154
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,911
I,
I get it.

155
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,180
It's a kind way to go to the R,
m,

156
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,390
e,
f page.

157
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,700
You want to see money for conservation,
for hunting.

158
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,310
You want to see some staggering numbers.
The twitter page,

159
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,640
a Rocky Mountain Elk Federation r,
m,

160
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,220
e,
and they post

161
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
these charts that show the billions and 
billions of dollars that go towards 

162
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,290
conservation every year.
All because of people who fish and hunt.

163
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,570
It's,
it's the numbers are staggering.

164
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,950
You go to Cabela's and you know,
I always wondered about this.

165
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,793
You go to buy something at a Cabela's or
bass pro or wherever you got in your 

166
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,260
local area and you know routinely 
they're saying,

167
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,910
well,
how would you like to donate a dollar to

168
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,953
conservation fund?
Would you like to donate a dollar to a 

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,340
course?
You would,

170
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,740
because that's a percentage of your sale
goes directly to it anyway.

171
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,200
If you're hunting equipment,
a certain percentage,

172
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,450
I forget what the number is,
but it's a good healthy percentage.

173
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,610
It turns out to be millions and millions
of dollars every year.

174
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,840
There we go.
Just Minnesota,

175
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,480
look at this.
More people hunt or fish in Minnesota,

176
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,314
one point six,
$5 million than doubled the combined 

177
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,760
populations of Minneapolis,
St Paul,

178
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,780
Rochester and Duluth,
and three point one,

179
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,020
$7 billion is the amount spent by 1 
million,

180
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:51,854
649,000
hunters and anglers in a single year in 

181
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,010
Minnesota.

182
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,843
That's an incredibly large part of the 
economy folks and a giant chunk of that 

183
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,164
goes to preserving wildlife habitat to 
preserving wetlands to make ensure that 

184
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,774
animal populations are kept healthy,
to make sure that Predator populations 

185
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,240
are kept in balance and that ranchers 
aren't,

186
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,074
you know,
impeded upon by mountain lions and 

187
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,690
wolves and shit like that.
That's a,

188
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,250
it's an incredible number.
Yeah.

189
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,450
That's great.
Just for Minnesota,

190
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,313
right?
Yeah.

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,230
Jasmine,
you know,

192
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,910
and then you think of the other states 
all combining together.

193
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,803
You know,
it's the reason why we have more white 

194
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,280
tail deer in America today than when 
Columbus landed.

195
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,260
That's a fact.
Support.

196
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,123
We'll get this Michigan $576 million in 
state and local tax revenue enough to 

197
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,520
support the average salaries of nearly 
11,000

198
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,370
police and sheriff's officers.
It's incredible.

199
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,810
I didn't know we could still mentioned 
in Columbus.

200
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,650
I didn't know that was allowed.

201
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,530
What's allowed.
We can talk about them.

202
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,330
It's Kinda,
it's kinda crazy.

203
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,730
Columbus Day when you find out what a 
savage.

204
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:53,450
He was like a terrible person.
Columbus was Columbus Day.

205
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,180
What do we have any Stevia,
Jay?

206
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,280
This tastes like shit together.
I'm not.

207
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,640
I'm not a fan of this the way it is with
the butter.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,770
I liked that.
Emulsified mct oil,

209
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,604
but I don't like it blended into.
It's just that I'm expecting the other 

210
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,540
kinds of coffee and it comes out like 
this.

211
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,383
I'm like,
what is this?

212
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,620
It's all.
It's all.

213
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,880
It's not the best at what do I know?
I'm going back to the old way.

214
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,690
You know what I'm saying?
We think it's okay.

215
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,080
That's pretty good.
Just a little different.

216
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,914
Tastes sweeter.
Something we need less of it or 

217
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,360
something.
I don't know.

218
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,350
Maybe I'm just a bitch.
How much do you drink a day?

219
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,840
Let's have coffee.
I don't even count it.

220
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,630
I just keep going.
I really don't.

221
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm used to.
I used to worry about it.

222
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:31,561
He said,
man,

223
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,394
maybe I should back up off the coffee,
but coffee is an excellent source of 

224
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:37,490
antioxidants.
It if you're not,

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,833
you're not dehydrated.
If you're drinking plenty of water on 

226
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,170
top of that.
I always drink water with it and I don't

227
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,004
see any negative effects when I go get 
my health stuff done and get blood work 

228
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,160
done so I don't fucking back off at at 
all.

229
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,043
Yeah,
but sometimes I do get a little too 

230
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:51,644
jazzed up.
There's this company that we have a 

231
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,410
sponsor,
just my friend's company.

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,220
Caveman coffee.

233
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

234
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,820
And they make these nitros.
They're these little tiny things there.

235
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,654
Nitrogenated coffee that's 270 
milligrams of caffeine and one little 

236
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,250
can.
Holy Shit.

237
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,420
Get Mr Baker and Baker nitro.
We should show them all these things.

238
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,060
I've got a busy day tomorrow in the 
morning.

239
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,400
First thing and these little fuckers.
I take these four,

240
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,234
I lift weights and I want to throw 
things through the fucking walls and I 

241
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,280
do say so.
Good.

242
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
It's so good.
That little tiny thing is 270 milligrams

243
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,820
of caffeine and it's nitrogenated,
which that's fine.

244
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,030
That's good.
Well,

245
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,680
you know I'm going to start.
I'm seriously.

246
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,230
I gotta I gotTa.
I got an early call in the morning.

247
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,750
I got an early start.
A lot of activity going on.

248
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:34,770
I'm just going to pop this in the 
morning.

249
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,590
We'll give you a few of them.
See what you can do.

250
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,970
I'll give them to the team.
Yeah,

251
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,893
good.
That'll be good.

252
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,990
Have you liked the taste of actual 
coffee?

253
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:43,824
It's really good coffee.
It's like there's a whole story behind 

254
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,320
the company,
but it's this one farm in Columbia.

255
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,610
Single source,
single family.

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,500
It is Columbia.
Right?

257
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,930
Even things that I know for a fact.
I'll say them and I'll go.

258
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,500
Are you sure?
Like right away I question myself.

259
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,530
I think I've got.
I've got to erase some of my data.

260
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,120
I've done that.
I've paired it down.

261
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm,
I'm streamlining now thinking of the bar

262
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,580
again,
maybe just a little kick boxing,

263
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,110
sparring.
Just to trim down some of my memories.

264
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,350
Few too many in there.
I might have to take a couple of jabs.

265
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,790
It says my boys,
two of my boys,

266
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,601
actually all three of them.
That,

267
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,530
what am I saying?
All three of them.

268
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,490
Uh,
my,

269
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,000
my,
uh,

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,740
my kids,
a scooter and sluggo and mugsy or nine,

271
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,630
five hilarious names and they're 
hilarious.

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Former CIA operatives,
kids.

273
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,340
But like the three stooges and so they 
uh,

274
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,410
but they in,
they're in taekwondo now.

275
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,250
We looked around,
we checked out a few places and we found

276
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,110
this one that we really like.

277
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,940
And then also to be fair,
part of it is just timing.

278
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:45,381
They,
they,

279
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:46,060
they're,
they're,

280
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,893
they're structuring their classwork or 
their timing works well with other 

281
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,000
things kids are doing,
but they're in there.

282
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,410
How old are they?
They're nine,

283
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,244
seven and five.
That's a good age to start taekwondo 

284
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:58,550
because then you'll learn the dexterity 
and the flexibility and stuff like that.

285
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:00,210
And if they really get serious about 
martial arts,

286
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,980
you can transition them to something 
like Jujitsu or kickboxing or something.

287
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,973
But I think,
I think the middle one will stick with 

288
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,720
it.
He has is supremely focused.

289
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,554
The only one is does very well,
but he's got a variety of other 

290
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,351
interests.
Right?

291
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,480
And right now he sees focused on,
on other sports,

292
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,590
Lacrosse and basketball.
But that,

293
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,310
that middle one,
um,

294
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,403
he,
you could just kind of watch them and 

295
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:20,701
see,
you know,

296
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,590
it's like everything else,
right?

297
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,990
Your kids spark on different things and 
he seems to have really sparked on this.

298
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,180
The one,
the five year old,

299
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:27,871
you know,
he does great,

300
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,070
but he's got a sparked on candy bars and
things like that.

301
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,943
Yeah.
That's one of the fascinating things 

302
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:34,644
about having kids is to realize there's 
only so much that you do to shape their 

303
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:38,514
personality.
They come out of the box unique in a 

304
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:41,664
weird way.
Like I have two daughters that are 

305
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,064
young.
I was six and an eight and they are so 

306
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,890
different.
I mean,

307
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,370
so different.
Six year old thinks farts are hilarious.

308
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,650
She's so funny.
But she'll say,

309
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,573
can I tell you something?
Can I tell you so she just on you and 

310
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,300
then she'll fall to the ground laughing.
She's got to meet my five-year-old.

311
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,370
Those still get along like a house on 
fire.

312
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:05,800
Everybody gets mad at her and just can't
do that.

313
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,610
You just can't be farting.
And I'm laughing.

314
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:08,590
They're like,
don't laugh at her.

315
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm like,
that is hilarious.

316
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,980
Just farted on you.
What's the goal?

317
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,340
Is more of a girly girl.
Yeah.

318
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,000
Much more of a girly girl.
Six year olds is savage.

319
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,640
He's like a little gorilla.
She's really hilarious.

320
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,500
She's very,
very funny.

321
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,940
Yeah.
Well my three disbanded.

322
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,270
They spend all their time just like 
every other kid,

323
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,350
right?
But boys in particular,

324
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,880
they spend all their time beating the 
shit out of each other.

325
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,193
And so we thought,
you know what we've been looking for 

326
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,250
awhile to find the right place for them 
to channel that physical side of things.

327
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,980
And uh,
and now it's good because now they focus

328
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,820
on,
you know,

329
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,650
if they're gonna,
if they're gonna hurt each other,

330
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,484
they're going to hurt them each other in
the proper way as get some spartan and 

331
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,453
get some sports.

332
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,140
One of the good things about Jujitsu,
you know,

333
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,060
we had talked about getting your kids in
Jujitsu.

334
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,520
The good thing about Jujitsu is you can 
go full blast.

335
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,440
The thing about kicking each other in 
the head is,

336
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,274
boy,
you could really only do that a couple 

337
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,650
of times and then,
uh,

338
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,600
yeah,
that's right.

339
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,630
You just not the same person anymore.
That's the reality.

340
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,613
My kids are allowed to kick me and punch
me full blast as long as they tell me 

341
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,184
they're going to do it.
So I like let them throw full power leg 

342
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,784
kicks because I'm trying to teach them 
how to like really sink the Shin into 

343
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,730
the meat,
you know.

344
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:12,130
So like my daughter will throw a left 
hook to the body,

345
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,710
right leg kick combination.
She's going to do it right now.

346
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,131
I go,
okay,

347
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,830
go ahead.
It's like boom,

348
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,340
like it's getting harder,
man.

349
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,940
As you get eight and 10 around like 12.
I'm going to have to tell them to stop.

350
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:22,601
Okay.
That's enough.

351
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,540
Now that is going to have to pat up,
put a chest pat on.

352
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,800
But that's a difference between boys and
girls.

353
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,693
Girls,
you can say you're gonna have to tell 

354
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:28,451
them,
hey,

355
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,620
you can do this,
but you have to tell me.

356
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,300
My guys are like Keto from,
you know,

357
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,380
I walk in the house and they're like 
lurking somewhere.

358
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,840
And then the whole goal is to try to 
punch me in the junk.

359
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,070
And they think that's hilarious.
With the,

360
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:41,904
the,
the uh,

361
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,500
the middle one again in the middle one,
he a sluggo he caught me one time when I

362
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,334
came in the door,
the front door of the house and I was 

363
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,094
carrying a bag.
I just gotten off a plane carrying it 

364
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,014
back and before I could even put the bag
down and sale and the kids were kind of 

365
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,000
coming down the stairs,
you know,

366
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,630
I thought it was like a Norman Rockwell 
thing,

367
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,464
you know,
they're going to come hug their dad and 

368
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,610
adore me a little bit,
you know,

369
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,010
Daddy's home and sluggo comes around the
corner and nowhere and says dad and just

370
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,870
punches me square in the nuts and it was
so hard that I literally,

371
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,680
because you know,
what happens?

372
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,513
I mean,
you know,

373
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,853
you just dropped it.
I dropped and he and the other to stand 

374
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,410
there and laugh in my face.
And I thought,

375
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,244
what the end.
My wife is coming around the corner and 

376
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:22,871
she looks.
She goes,

377
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:23,710
what the hell happened?
I said,

378
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,150
I couldn't,
you know.

379
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,450
How old was he at that time?
He was six.

380
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,323
That's what happens.
So raise a little six year old and the 

381
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:32,350
mountains,
a bunch of wolves and you start punching

382
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,500
you in the Dick as soon as they see you.
That's a larry.

383
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,010
It's Idaho hope rating all do it.
But Jan is out there.

384
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,050
So.
So,

385
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
so,
um,

386
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,810
what's your take on this?
Trump versus the intelligence community?

387
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,673
Jazz.
That seems to be going on right now 

388
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,890
because I couldn't to get you in here to

389
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,083
get an insider's perspective on this 
because I've never seen anything like 

390
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,984
it.
I mean I've never seen anything like 

391
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,250
what he was talking shit about flu shots
today.

392
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,370
He's like flu shots and the biggest scam
ever.

393
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,920
Like,
are you sure you've done research?

394
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,500
Are you a doctor?
Wow.

395
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,240
Well yeah,
I know that whole and he's.

396
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,840
And he's kind of a point that not 
appointed,

397
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:12,674
but he's brought somebody in as an 
advisor on that who is against 

398
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,880
vaccinations when that term is and know 
that the Intel thing.

399
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,080
There's so many ways you can take this.
It was a.

400
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,010
basically it was a self inflicted wound.
It was unnecessary.

401
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,400
There was no reason for him in the early
stage of this,

402
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,810
when that narrative started to build 
about,

403
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,580
oh,
there's this rift building between trump

404
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,100
and the intel community.
It was because of his tweets,

405
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,963
right,
and it was because of him questioning 

406
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,213
the,
the intelligence about Russian meddling 

407
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,693
in our election system,
and now to talk about that just for a 

408
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,450
second,
of course,

409
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,303
the Russians were meddling.
The Russians have been meddling in US 

410
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:55,094
politics and campaigning over here in a 
way since they've been around as have 

411
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,860
the Chinese,
as have the Chinese.

412
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,723
You could go back to when people should.
This was a fascinating period of time 

413
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,343
and in history back to like 1941 go back
to when the Russians were still in an 

414
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:14,291
alliance and a pact with the Nazis,
and so from the Russian perspective,

415
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,800
their goal,
their,

416
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,860
their point was to keep the US out of 
the war and so what did they do?

417
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,733
There's an isolation is wing in the 
States and Roosevelt was under a lot of 

418
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,020
pressure.
Roosevelt was was becoming very close to

419
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,850
Churchill.
He understood that threat.

420
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,743
He was one of the few people that did at
the time he understood how important it 

421
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,860
was going to be for America to get into 
this battle.

422
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,533
The UK was about ready to fall and so 
the British were actually running their 

423
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,644
intelligence operations out of New York.
They had a place over in Rockville 

424
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,503
Rockefeller Center and because they were
worried they were the island was going 

425
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:50,380
to be run over by the Nazis,
so you have this going on.

426
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,180
The dynamic with the Russians was that 
they were still in this packed,

427
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,470
you know,
with the Nazi.

428
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,304
Stalin didn't see this coming and he 
didn't see that on the Nazis were 

429
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,020
running a very large propaganda 
campaign,

430
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,020
a diversion effort to ensure that the 
Russians wouldn't know that they will go

431
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:03,854
about to invade.
So the Russian spent a great deal of 

432
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:06,704
time and money and resource here in the 
US influencing us public opinion about 

433
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,410
staying out of the war.
There's no reason to be in a boy.

434
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,080
Why would you want to get into another 
war in Europe?

435
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,490
And they bought journalists and placed a
newspaper articles.

436
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,324
They paid off journalists.
They were setting up associations that 

437
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,900
were supposedly independent,
but we're run by the Soviets.

438
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,353
They were influencing unions,
dumping money into unions and bing 

439
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:35,190
basically to get them to steer their 
membership to isolation as you know,

440
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,900
a agenda.
So to say that,

441
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,140
oh,
I don't know if the Russians were men.

442
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,130
Like of course they'd been doing it.
That's the way.

443
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,070
And then all the way through the Cold 
War,

444
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,581
you know,
that's,

445
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,230
this is what they do,
so you know,

446
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,293
but it,
it the narrative because it always has 

447
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,034
to be simplified.
I think as far as the media is 

448
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,794
concerned,
the narrative was that they influenced 

449
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,320
the election will.
No,

450
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,280
they were meddling but they weren't 
hacking into election systems.

451
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:02,850
They weren't hacking into voting booths 
and changing these things.

452
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,493
So.

453
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,690
So we say meddling.
What they were doing is essentially they

454
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:07,524
were getting information that was 
private that was being distributed 

455
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:14,160
between the Democratic convention.
They were definitely involved in,

456
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,183
in the DNC hacking for instance.
They were definitely involved in how 

457
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:18,810
were they involved with they involve.
Were they,

458
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:23,811
did they directly did the hacking to the
Democrats or were they privy to.

459
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,970
The information because someone sold it 
to them or got it to them,

460
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,390
as with most of these things that 
usually those cutouts,

461
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,911
right?
So there's,

462
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:32,370
there's,
there's a plot,

463
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,920
plausible deniability.
And so,

464
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,560
um,
but the Russians have been very.

465
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,310
Oh,
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,550
No worries.
The Russians have been very.

467
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,200
We

468
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,120
adapt over the years at creating a 
mayhem,

469
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:49,510
creating chaos around democratic 
institutions.

470
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,700
Their whole goal is to chip away at 
public trust in,

471
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,690
in a democracy and not just here in the 
US,

472
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:56,471
but everywhere.
I mean,

473
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:57,304
you know,
and obviously that played out in proxy 

474
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:01,150
wars out in Africa.
And so again,

475
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:01,984
I guess what I'm trying to say is it 
should have shocked no one that the 

476
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:06,400
Russians would be engaged in this sort 
of thing.

477
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,950
But,
um,

478
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,480
trump,
again,

479
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:14,050
a self inflicted wound.
He hadn't gotten the full briefings yet.

480
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,740
He hadn't seen the intelligence about 
this.

481
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,923
Uh,
and prior to that then he sending out a 

482
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,620
handful of tweets saying,
I don't know,

483
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,440
I question.
It didn't make any sense.

484
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,693
You have all the opportunity in the 
world to question the intelligence and 

485
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:29,280
the time to do that.
You know,

486
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,123
you're sitting there,
you're getting the briefings from the 

487
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:32,890
heads of the agencies,
which happened,

488
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,950
and then if you,
if you notice after that briefing,

489
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,173
his,
his tone changed completely and he came 

490
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,160
out and you know,
okay,

491
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,380
well the Russians were involved,
right?

492
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,920
Um,
and it didn't make it.

493
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,690
Now he had to walk that back.
So then he goes out to the agency and in

494
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,381
any,
as a meeting,

495
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,214
which I think was a great thing,
I was really happy to see that he did 

496
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,094
that.
And so soon in the administration he 

497
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:55,864
goes out to,
to our headquarters out out there in 

498
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,760
Virginia.
Um,

499
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,930
and you know,
he got sidetracked,

500
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:05,800
but that's his personality.
He starts talking about the inauguration

501
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,320
numbers.
You start talking about the media,

502
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,640
you know,
the unfair media.

503
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,780
Well,
you know what,

504
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,180
you could just go out there.
Thank you.

505
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,023
People say you're looking forward to 
working with them to protect national 

506
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,020
security interests,
shake some hands and leave,

507
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,430
but it's not in his nature.
Right?

508
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,950
So he's going to get sidetracked and 
it's got to talk about other things.

509
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,410
And then that becomes the story,
you know,

510
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,030
not,
not other things that he's doing,

511
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,970
he's talking about,
uh,

512
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,810
spending more resources on,
on,

513
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,480
on human intelligence,
right?

514
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,493
Because,
and that's something that gets talked 

515
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:37,120
about and is done in cycles.
So after nine slash 11,

516
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:37,931
what happened?
Well,

517
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,510
suddenly George Tenet,
the director at the time was instructed,

518
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,180
you got to get more officers,
you've got to get more Kadra.

519
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,043
We gotta recruit people.
We can't just rely on signals in 

520
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,320
intercepts and,
you know,

521
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:50,380
technology.
So that happens over a period of time.

522
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,970
He's talking about revamping the Dni or 
maybe you know,

523
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,840
taking it apart.
Well,

524
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,700
that's been talked about for many years.
You know,

525
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,700
the Dni was put together after nine 
slash 11.

526
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,130
And you know,
it's a big layer of bureaucracy,

527
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,550
frankly.
So some of the things he's told,

528
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,790
what does that stand for?
Dni,

529
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,770
director of national intelligence.
Okay.

530
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,663
So,
uh,

531
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,460
James Clapper was the previous guy going
in there.

532
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm a run of that and it's going to be 
interesting because the Dni was no,

533
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,210
from Mike Flynn,
who is now the national security guy.

534
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,800
Um,
he had a rocky relationship with,

535
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,693
with the Dni and it feels like they 
basically pushed him out of his last 

536
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,104
position in the Intel community.
So it'll be interesting to see how he 

537
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,730
deals with this issue of,
do we restructure.

538
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,740
But I guess my point being is that,
you know,

539
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,410
and I don't,
I don't really have a dog in the hunt,

540
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,240
you know,
was trump my preferred candidate?

541
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,871
Well,
no,

542
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,660
but now he's the president and we from 
my point of view,

543
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,330
now you want it to work now you do 
everything possible.

544
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,720
But just like with anybody else,
you look for the good and you say that's

545
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,200
great and if something,
you know,

546
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,590
you don't agree with whether you can say
that too.

547
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,420
We got that right in this country,
you know,

548
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:56,320
we don't have to agree with every single
thing that any president does.

549
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,490
We can disagree with the policies,
but we don't have to slag people off.

550
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,530
And if I veer off and say,
well,

551
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,513
I don't think a president trump should 
have veered off and talked about 

552
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,294
inauguration numbers in the media,
what he was standing there in our lobby 

553
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,070
in front of the stars on the wall,
you know,

554
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:13,090
I get,
I get a,

555
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:15,340
you know,
a couple of hundred tweets,

556
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,180
you know,
say,

557
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,290
you know,
you're a fucking idiot.

558
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,730
How could you say that?
Well,

559
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,610
I say it because,
you know,

560
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,131
what,
what,

561
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,700
how,
how,

562
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,620
how is that somehow insulting.
I,

563
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,454
you know,
I'm going to like some of the things 

564
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,380
that he does.
I'm not going to like some of the things

565
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,170
he does.
That's the way it works,

566
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:29,950
right?
You find it.

567
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,620
But I don't know.
I'm very down a rabbit hole right now,

568
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,810
but I think it's because I get,
I'm getting pissed off because,

569
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,243
you know,
we've seem to have gotten away from the 

570
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,130
idea that,
you know,

571
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,640
nobody's perfect.

572
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
Right?
And everybody that's a,

573
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:43,000
that's a dyed in the wool trump 
supporter right now,

574
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,890
uh,
who for the past eight years,

575
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,280
hated the fact that Obama supporters 
were adoring of him and said,

576
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:50,320
everything he does is brilliant.
Now they're,

577
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,030
you know,
some of those folks doing the same thing

578
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:55,390
with the new president and,
you know,

579
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,280
like I said,
I,

580
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,660
I'll be honest with you,
I'm happy she didn't win.

581
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm ecstatic that Hillary Clinton didn't
win frankly.

582
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,823
Um,
but that doesn't mean that I've got to 

583
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,050
now stand up and say everything Donald 
Trump does is great.

584
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,980
I wouldn't do that with any troubling 
for you about her.

585
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,980
Well,
let's see.

586
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,320
Where do we begin?
Um,

587
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,860
I felt like,
you know,

588
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,270
and again,
I'm obviously,

589
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,130
I'm trying to pick my words carefully 
here,

590
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,310
um,
because I'm trying to be diplomatic.

591
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,980
I think she,
I didn't,

592
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,550
I didn't like what I perceived as,
as a,

593
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,340
uh,
a lack of,

594
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,010
of,
uh,

595
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,843
of character.

596
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,970
I didn't like what I perceived as not 
again,

597
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,260
and here's the problem.
I didn't like either of the candidates.

598
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:47,450
Neither candidate was my choice.
Now the candidate was,

599
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,980
I didn't really have a choice.
Now the candidate was my,

600
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,120
I'd have a dog in the hunt,
but if I looked at her,

601
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,630
I just felt like there was,
there wasn't anything there.

602
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,030
And I felt like we had the past eight 
years,

603
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:02,480
I felt like with the previous president 
again,

604
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,314
I liked some of the things he did.
I didn't like some of the stuff that he 

605
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:05,834
did,
but I was always concerned that he 

606
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:11,900
didn't have a principles that he stood 
on that he said,

607
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,740
you know what,
this is,

608
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
this is where I draw the line and this 
is what,

609
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,730
these are my principles,
this is what I believe in.

610
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,193
Um,
and I felt like she was similar in that 

611
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:20,840
way.

612
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,673
And I think we've just had enough of 
sort of that bend in the wind and do 

613
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:25,484
whatever we're going to do.
This country's lost a lot of leverage 

614
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,970
overseas.
And if,

615
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,170
and I know people say,
well,

616
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,820
that's good.
We shouldn't be the police person around

617
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,980
the world.
You know what the fucking truth is?

618
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:34,814
Somebody has got to be.
And if we're not at the top of the food 

619
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,850
chain,
that's fine.

620
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,610
We can step off because we want to build
more roads here and we want to spend our

621
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,630
money here.
And I get that.

622
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:43,490
And that's important.
But if we're not,

623
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,620
if somebody is not at the top of the 
food chain,

624
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,080
somebody else will try or it'll be 
chaos.

625
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,390
And what's a vacuum?
And it's not a community of nations that

626
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:54,290
gathers together and acts in a global 
community spirit.

627
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,190
You know,
our,

628
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,073
our,
our interests don't align very often 

629
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,340
with other countries.

630
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,820
We have certain allies where it does,
um,

631
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,950
but no,
that's not how it works.

632
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:06,440
It's chaos out there and it's pretty 
nasty at times.

633
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:07,274
And so I'm a big believer in yes,
we shouldn't be out there policing 

634
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,890
everything,
but we're going to need to and we should

635
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,023
want to be at the top of the heap.
Well definitely doesn't seem as any 

636
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:16,904
benevolent superpower that's looking out
for the world's best interests outside 

637
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:19,951
of us know.
And,

638
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,231
uh,
and,

639
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,370
and,
and people raise their eyes,

640
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,880
you know,
when you say something like that.

641
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,450
And I agree with that percent.
People roll their eyes and they go,

642
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:27,830
I bullshit.
You know,

643
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,970
it's out there and then what?
Right.

644
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:30,804
We're,
who are they?

645
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,520
Right,
right.

646
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,210
And I know.
Yeah.

647
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,043
And I get those feelings.
I understand where those people are 

648
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,180
coming from.
I get this idea of anti-globalization,

649
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,930
I'd get this idea,
you know,

650
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,380
the,
they're,

651
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,090
they're anti the whole idea of the 
military industrial complex,

652
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,770
controlling all the resources of the 
world.

653
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,480
I get it.
I totally understand,

654
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,460
but know this,
there are some bad countries out there,

655
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,260
not,
not bad people,

656
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,303
but countries that are run by dictators,
countries that are run by extremely 

657
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,464
ruthless people and a lot of them have 
access to some significant military 

658
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:05,780
power.

659
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,530
Yeah.
And you're absolutely right.

660
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,020
I mean,
a course.

661
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,270
We make mistakes.
Obviously we make mistakes,

662
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,490
but I,
you know,

663
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,750
I spent almost all my life overseas and 
you know,

664
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,910
I spent a long time peeking behind the 
curtain and we see,

665
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,590
we try to self correct.
We may take a wrong turn,

666
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,850
we may do something that,
you know,

667
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:24,860
okay,
fine that the site doesn't work it out,

668
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,993
but we,
we tend to try to do the things for the 

669
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:32,390
right reason regardless of which 
administration it is,

670
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,283
you know.
Um,

671
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,400
and just as,
as a,

672
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,000
as a,
as a,

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,090
as a principle guiding principle,
I,

674
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,850
and maybe people hear that and they 
think you don't want a fucking idiot.

675
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,810
You know,
that's not how it works,

676
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,310
but that's how it works.
Um,

677
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,144
to um,
that's everybody has to speak according 

678
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:45,934
to their own experience.
My experience is that most of my 

679
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,843
childhood and adult life overseas and 
I've seen a lot of weird shit and I've 

680
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:58,710
been to a lot of difficult places and 
America stands.

681
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,270
Um,
again,

682
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,920
a few allies.
The Brits,

683
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,230
I'm partial.
I'm a dual citizen,

684
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,040
but the Brits are right there with us.
Uh,

685
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,570
Canadians who doesn't let the Canadians,
um,

686
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,400
New Zealand,
Australia,

687
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,263
you know,
there's a small community there that 

688
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,590
tries to be principal,
tries to do the right thing,

689
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,993
uh,
everybody else out there as acting 

690
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,243
purely on their own best interest and 
our interest and there's almost never 

691
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:28,521
align whether it's Russia or in parts of
Europe or wherever it may be,

692
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:30,370
Latin America.
Um,

693
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,283
so yeah,
somebody got somebody to be at the top 

694
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:35,460
of the food chain and I just prefer to 
be us.

695
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,620
Yeah.
The,

696
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,370
I mean,
there's massive criticisms.

697
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,980
The United States and a lot of them are 
valid.

698
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,843
It makes a lot of sense,
but there's human beings are just 

699
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,860
flawed.
This is,

700
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:49,250
this is the most recent country,
this is the newest country,

701
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:53,060
and this is the only country that exists
like this,

702
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:55,910
this experiment in self government that 
exists today.

703
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:58,790
There's nothing like it out there and 
the more you look into it,

704
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,624
you have a much more intense and deep 
understanding of it than I ever will 

705
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,303
because of your experience in life and 
all the different places that you've 

706
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,490
been in,
all the things that you've seen,

707
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,360
but there's no way.
If you look at the rest of the world,

708
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,194
there's nothing.
There's nothing remotely similar to 

709
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:15,950
what's going on over here.
This is a crazy place.

710
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,023
It's a crazy place as far as innovation,
crazy places as far as creativity and 

711
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:23,510
art and film and comedy and music and 
just.

712
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,980
There's so much bubbling in this one 
part of the world and,

713
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,391
and,
and,

714
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,570
and liberties and freedoms and exactly 
what to do.

715
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:30,520
I made it great.
You know,

716
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,690
like the protest on inauguration day.
Great.

717
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:33,524
Go Out and protest that.
Don't fucking go blow up a limo to no 

718
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,230
fucking chairs through starbucks and 
shit like that.

719
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:40,820
They did a lot of stupid shit and 
that's,

720
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:41,750
you know,
that's a small,

721
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,613
you know,
a small group and that's fine and it's 

722
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:46,170
going to happen I suppose,
but you know,

723
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,083
when they,
when they're out there talking about 

724
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:50,240
oppression and being oppressed in 
America,

725
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,580
my thought is always the same.
I always think,

726
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:53,480
you know,
what we should do,

727
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,520
we should reenact a,
the standard

728
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,603
Tori service.
Everybody should have to serve two 

729
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:58,994
years,
whether it's in the military or some 

730
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,513
international component where you go 
overseas and you spent a little bit of 

731
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:07,420
time in some shit hole and you see,
see

732
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,253
how bad it is and how bad it can be,
but all these people that walk around 

733
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:12,310
here and talk but,
and I get it,

734
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:14,900
you know,
we could do better with better course.

735
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,440
We can do better in that sense,
in that sense,

736
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,560
but we need perspective.
Right.

737
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,981
That's it.
That's,

738
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,480
I guess what I'm saying,
a balanced perspective.

739
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,373
How did it happen?
Because this was what was confusing to 

740
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,490
me.
How did the FBI in and now originally,

741
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,880
eventually the FBI came around to the 
CIA's conclusions,

742
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:31,714
but for a long time the FBI was 
disagreeing with the CIA about whether 

743
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:37,420
or not the Russians had anything to do 
with hacking the DNC.

744
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,950
Yeah,
the big.

745
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,020
I think the big disagreement was really 
over

746
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,320
right.
I mean it was a big part.

747
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,183
It was an evidence based thing that they
didn't see any evidence that the 

748
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:47,914
Russians were involved,
which eventually became clear and now 

749
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,400
there was a arrest.
There was an arrest,

750
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,500
an unprecedented arrest a couple of days
ago,

751
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,220
right?
Yeah.

752
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,053
Well I think.
But you also talked about two different 

753
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:57,184
groups,
so the bureau is the FBI as a law 

754
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:01,210
enforcement,
so when they look at something,

755
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,980
they're looking at it from a law 
enforcement perspective.

756
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,980
They're looking at gathering sufficient 
evidence to prove a case.

757
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,860
Basically that's how they look at the 
agencies and Intel operation and so they

758
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,790
are get Gavin pieces of information 
that,

759
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,540
you know,
it's not an evidentiary chain thing,

760
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,300
so let's just get the preponderance of 
Intel.

761
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,700
Let's see where it leads as some of it's
going to be conflicting,

762
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:20,440
some of it's not well,
well sourced,

763
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,510
but let's all see what it tells us,
you know,

764
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,160
and so part of it is how they approach a
reaching a conclusion,

765
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,383
but you know,
they were both going to get to the same 

766
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:34,540
place because he eventually there they 
sit down and they compare notes.

767
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,733
Uh,
but part of it was the difference of 

768
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:40,390
opinion over the motivation and 
motivation is the toughest thing.

769
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,280
One of the toughest things approved in,
in,

770
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,140
uh,
in this business and intelligence,

771
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,491
you know,
that you can say,

772
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,301
okay,
they did this,

773
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:47,134
but you know,
unless you've got a sore sitting in the 

774
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,264
tent,
who was there and part of the 

775
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:51,670
conversation when somebody said,
well,

776
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,930
you know,
this is why,

777
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:53,764
or this is how we're going to do this 
and this is a reason to it without that 

778
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,960
sort of sourcing or,
you know,

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,010
intercepts,
um,

780
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,880
it's,
it's tough to prove motivation.

781
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,730
So it took a while to kind of get around
to that notion.

782
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,200
And it's still,
to be honest,

783
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,620
you know,
it's still a little bit up in the air,

784
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:09,110
we're probably never going to get,
unless again,

785
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,560
we get our hands on a really quality 
good source,

786
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,660
uh,
that may still be a little bit up in the

787
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:14,494
air,
but the bottom line is the restaurant 

788
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:15,714
you have,
the Russians were engaged in doing what 

789
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,520
they always do,
covert action,

790
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:20,830
propaganda campaigns,
whatever it may be.

791
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,010
There's the 30,000
foot view was always the same.

792
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,120
They want it,
they want to.

793
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,010
So a sense of,
of,

794
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,330
uh,
of mistrust.

795
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,164
They want to create some chaos.
They want to kind of chip away at the 

796
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:32,284
belief that democracy is a great thing.
And they did look how much time was 

797
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,514
spent talking about the integrity of the
election system and whether we actually 

798
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,140
had a legitimate president or not.
That's a win.

799
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,450
So you've got a couple of colonels in 
the FSB,

800
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,343
which was the old kgb,
who undoubtedly have been promoted as a 

801
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,004
result of that operation.
And who got someone got arrested from 

802
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,420
the FSB,
who was that guy?

803
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,363
Yeah.
Interested.

804
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,760
I don't have those details in front of 
me.

805
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:59,761
I just did some token guy that pistol 
potent exactly when the fucking hall for

806
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,290
Awhile.
He just said the wrong thing,

807
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,020
you know,
but that's unprecedented.

808
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,853
Right.
Then they never have politically arrest 

809
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:09,220
there guys like um,
well they,

810
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,670
they have for certain things,
for corruption issues.

811
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,740
If they get sideways,
you know,

812
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:16,810
from a internal arguments,
you know,

813
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:17,644
then you'll,
you'll,

814
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,390
yeah.
It usually doesn't make the news because

815
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:22,570
nobody really gives a shit outside of 
Russia and they do now because of this,

816
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,760
because of.
Because people want to talk about it.

817
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,920
And what bothered me about this,
sorry to interrupt you,

818
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:27,754
but what bothered me about this was the 
narrative because the narrative was 

819
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,024
Russia hacked the elections.
That's what everybody kept saying and 

820
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:33,634
that's what all these Democrats,
these left wing people were saying to 

821
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:39,130
try to pump up this idea that trump was 
not a legitimate president.

822
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,100
Russia hacked

823
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,480
the election.
Russia hacked the election,

824
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,480
will know someone,
maybe Russia,

825
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,463
whoever it was,
put that information out that the DNC 

826
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,783
had sent through private emails,
but the information was what they sent 

827
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,270
new.
I mean,

828
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,280
it wasn't,
they didn't hack anything.

829
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,370
They didn't get into any election 
machines.

830
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,323
They didn't,
they didn't get into the voting 

831
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:00,854
machines.
They didn't do anything other than 

832
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,300
release information that was supposed to
be private.

833
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,000
That indicated a bunch of really shady 
shit.

834
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,840
Yeah,
exactly.

835
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,733
I mean,
all those,

836
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,220
all those Bernie Sanders,
how pissed off once you'd be if,

837
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,530
if you're a Bernie sanders supporter and
you're burning himself fucked over.

838
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,340
He got.
Yeah.

839
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,390
Well,
he seemed to have made peace.

840
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,224
I guess he's,
he's a politician that even though he 

841
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:20,400
says he's not,
I mean it,

842
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,560
it's just a weirdly principled one.
Yeah,

843
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,450
exactly.
I mean,

844
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,770
I know Bernie would have been a better 
candidate.

845
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,723
I think Bernie would have won a Joe 
Biden would have been a better 

846
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,600
candidate.
You know,

847
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,713
you always liked the person sitting on 
the bench and then they get in the race 

848
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:34,850
and they're not,
you know,

849
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,830
that's true too.
Right?

850
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,000
They might have dug up some shit about 
both of those guys,

851
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:38,834
but Bernie was an interesting guy and 
not a whole lot of people that are in 

852
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,810
his position for as long as he is that 
have the kind of principles he has.

853
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,740
When he was able to say,
you know,

854
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,090
why don't you release the transcripts of
all these different speeches you gave to

855
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:52,970
all these banks that you got paid a 
quarter million dollars and he goes,

856
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:56,240
I will happily release mine because I 
don't have any because I wouldn't take a

857
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,074
penny from those people.
I was on a whole lot of people can say 

858
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,850
stuff like that in a big debate and you 
know,

859
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:04,520
they rallied,
they got together and they,

860
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,300
they decided to rig the primaries and 
they've rigged it.

861
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,790
They really did.
That was what the Russians exposed,

862
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,370
but it Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
who was a real piece of work,

863
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,190
you know.
Incredible.

864
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,960
Yeah.
So,

865
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,840
so I think there's,
and you're right now,

866
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:19,160
I guess what obviously what people on 
that on,

867
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,700
on the,
on the far left side are saying is well,

868
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,310
but without that,
if they hadn't released that information

869
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,770
then it would have been a different 
ballgame.

870
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,653
And you know,
because we wouldn't know how fucking 

871
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,164
corrupt she was.
You wouldn't know the Debbie Wasserman 

872
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,073
Schultz had done what she'd done and 
Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't have 

873
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,084
gotten fired from the DNC and then 
immediately got hired by Hillary's 

874
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,150
campaign.
Yeah,

875
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,930
I mean they picked her up in a couple of
minutes while she obviously they want to

876
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,310
keep her happy.
You know,

877
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,473
when somebody's walking out of that 
organization with a chip on their 

878
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,144
shoulder talking.
So especially after what she did for 

879
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:50,240
you.

880
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,210
I mean they rigged the primaries.
They really did.

881
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,210
And people should be upset about that 
way more than anything else.

882
00:34:56,211 --> 00:35:00,400
This idea that Russia did something when
you expose something that you should,

883
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,720
that we should have known.
We should've known about it because it's

884
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:03,770
a crime.
You know,

885
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,810
that kind of corruptions essentially.
Collusion.

886
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,670
It's a crime.
It's a conspiracy.

887
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,920
It's a real conspiracy to,
they're,

888
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:10,754
they're,
they're interrupting a democratic 

889
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,540
process and that's what they're doing.
Right,

890
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,553
right.
Well that was far more so than an 

891
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,130
outside force doing what you expect them
to do anyway,

892
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,240
frankly.
But the Russians did.

893
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,190
They always do.
Yeah.

894
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,093
So I think it would've been a great.
How interesting would those 

895
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,550
conversations,
so in,

896
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,250
uh,
in,

897
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,083
in the Kremlin or at FSB headquarters 
where they're talking about this and 

898
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,910
they're thinking about and they're 
planning it.

899
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,080
Someone had to write a note,
right?

900
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,360
Someone had to sit and say,
you know,

901
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,203
I got an idea for an operation and they 
had it because they're a bureaucracy 

902
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,194
like everything else.
And so they would have had to sit and 

903
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:52,360
figure this out and then it would have 
made its way to Putin because,

904
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,223
you know,
this obviously the concern over the 

905
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:59,061
blowback and the publicity of it all.
So Putin clearly knew what was going on,

906
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,860
but again,
that's just the way it works.

907
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,470
Stalin new back in the day knew exactly 
what they were doing,

908
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,304
trying to influence public opinion here 
back during the early world war one or 

909
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,830
two.
So yeah,

910
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:10,664
I,
there's no surprise the Chinese do the 

911
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:13,050
same thing every,
you know,

912
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,060
every nation that's got the resources.
I mean hell,

913
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:16,050
we.
Of course we do it too.

914
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,681
People always say,
well,

915
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:17,220
but wait,
do it.

916
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,701
Well,
yeah,

917
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:18,750
of course we do it,
you know,

918
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,550
I'm not saying we don't all do it.

919
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,383
It's half of the weird competition 
that's going on and you better hope we 

920
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:24,900
do it.
And in a sense,

921
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:25,800
I always say the,
when people say,

922
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,900
when I talk about,
you know,

923
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,570
a cyber hacking or whatever.
Yeah.

924
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,651
People always go,
yeah,

925
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:34,110
well you don't have any right to talk to
the US does it as well.

926
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,280
I think.
Well yeah,

927
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,443
that's actually a good thing given how 
aggressive and how nasty the world is 

928
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:44,120
out there and how we're constantly being
hit and attacked out in cyberspace.

929
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,240
I mean,
yeah,

930
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,750
we better hope we're good at it.
And you know,

931
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,713
if people knew how often,
how consistently and constantly our 

932
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,653
commercial and a public sector 
infrastructure is probed and tested and 

933
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:01,320
attacked on a daily basis.
People wouldn't sleep at night.

934
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,170
All the have is watch a showtime series 
homeland.

935
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,830
It's super accurate.
That's it.

936
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,430
How you ever watch that show.

937
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,353
I don't watch a lot of those shows.
I'm not a good person to watch shows 

938
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,144
like that with my wife.
That's my wife tells me that all the 

939
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,040
time.
Yeah.

940
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,350
It's got to be like be watching those.
A karate movies.

941
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,101
Yeah,
exactly.

942
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,270
Exactly.
Chronic yet of course.

943
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:20,200
So yeah,
that was legit as fuck.

944
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,220
But like there's some,
like the movie warrior.

945
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,143
I got mad at that movie and I'm like,
you can't fight two days in a row like 

946
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:26,580
that.
They don't.

947
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,260
Although they did do that in Japan 
recently.

948
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,320
Crazy assholes.
Japan at a tournament,

949
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,350
I think they fought three days in a row.
Jesus,

950
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,330
it's appendix to the next level.
They don't give a fuck in Japan.

951
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,320
They just go crazy.
They put together this woman,

952
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,050
Gabby Garcia,
she's six foot three,

953
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,580
maybe more.
She might be.

954
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,833
She's at least six to Jesus solid to 40 
and they put her in the ring with a 50 

955
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:54,060
year old woman who had bad knees and she
beat the shit out of.

956
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Is that you dinging?
Sorry about that man.

957
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,923
Look at that.
Okay.

958
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,220
Put that thing,
but they put her in with this,

959
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:03,054
uh,
this woman who is literally 50 years 

960
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:05,604
old,
she's about five feet tall and Gary 

961
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,480
Garcia ran over her like a train.
It was,

962
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,370
it was horrible to watch.
They don't care.

963
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,880
Japan will have crazy fights.
They have freak show fights.

964
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:14,551
Yeah.
Yeah.

965
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:14,971
Well,
I mean,

966
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:16,620
look at all the shows that have come out
of there to be there.

967
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,773
All the,
all the weird shit that ends up on our 

968
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:23,661
tvs usually comes from Japan.
So one of the big arguments was that the

969
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:24,984
Russians definitely wanted trump to win 
because if they didn't then they would 

970
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:30,480
have hacked the RNC and they would have 
released their emails too.

971
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,793
But that's a hard argument to make 
because you don't know that they said 

972
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,100
anything inappropriate.
You don't know

973
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,750
that there was any collusion.
Well,

974
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:42,751
and there was also a attempts to hack 
the RNC and the RNC as would one company

975
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,164
to the next.
Not every company is running the same 

976
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,590
security protocols on the 
infrastructure.

977
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,800
So the RNC had different security 
protocols on their infrastructure and,

978
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,750
you know,
but they were,

979
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,200
they were,
are they not hacked,

980
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,470
but they were tested and the tech,
um,

981
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,700
and you know,
that idea that they wanted,

982
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,770
they wanted trump to win.
Frankly,

983
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,993
if,
if Putin sat there and thought to 

984
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:05,981
himself,
well,

985
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,580
what I want is what's in my,
in Russia's best interest,

986
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,740
well then I'm going to go with a known 
quantity.

987
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,740
I'm going to go with Hillary Clinton 
because I know what I got there.

988
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,053
And it's not tough.
But trump was like pro Putin and he's 

989
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,620
basically saying,
Putin's a smart guy.

990
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,600
Putin's a great guy.
We can do deals together.

991
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,920
We can have.
But he's too smart.

992
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,873
He does.
He's not going to take that on face 

993
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,494
value.
I mean he's,

994
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,363
he knows he's reading all the same shit 
and watching all the same shit that 

995
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,710
everybody else's,
which is that trump is in the past.

996
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,544
It's kind of been all president.
Trump has been all over the place and 

997
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:39,020
talked in different directions.
And so it's not as if potent would here.

998
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,671
They say,
oh,

999
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:40,600
he likes me.
And he said,

1000
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,563
no,
he's not like that.

1001
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,030
He's like,
I bet wicker be fresh.

1002
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:43,864
And so it just,
it just a what's best for my best 

1003
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:47,980
interests.
It's,

1004
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,173
you know,
I'm going to go that route business as 

1005
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,460
usual,
business as usual,

1006
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,294
and I know I'm not going to get any 
pushback for the shit that I do because 

1007
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,010
she is just going to continue the same 
things that have been happening.

1008
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,320
They're going to continue to withdraw 
off the world stage.

1009
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,650
And this idea that Somehow Hillary 
Clinton was a warmonger,

1010
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,380
what the hell that,
where did that come from?

1011
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,700
You know,
so I,

1012
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,650
I don't,
I'm not necessarily buying the idea that

1013
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,980
trump or that a Putin one president 
trump to win.

1014
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,063
That's an interesting perspective.
I would've thought that he wanted them 

1015
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,643
to win,
just to throw democracy into the 

1016
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,004
shitter.
Just to fucking throw a big monkey 

1017
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,224
wrench into the gears.
He probably felt that a trump victory 

1018
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:23,880
would do that.
Yeah.

1019
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:24,310
Yeah.
Right.

1020
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,440
And you're right,
there's a possibility there.

1021
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,580
But,
you know,

1022
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,880
Putin is a,
he's an interesting cat and I just,

1023
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,360
I just have a feeling though that,
you know,

1024
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,270
again,
they make these,

1025
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,960
these,
uh,

1026
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,793
these decisions based on what's in their
own best interests and I think they 

1027
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,290
would look at the track record of Obama.

1028
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,140
They would look at her track record,
they would look at an unknown quantity,

1029
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:44,891
you know,
and again,

1030
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:47,680
they're not going to buy what he just 
says on the surface.

1031
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,541
It's just not gonna,
you know,

1032
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,374
it's not that there wouldn't be as 
simple as that and they would look and 

1033
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:52,774
think,
yeah,

1034
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,550
let's go with what we know,
you know,

1035
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,010
because we know we can steamroll that,
you know,

1036
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,970
and this over here,
we don't know now what was.

1037
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:03,400
So what was the point of them meddling 
and doing what they did.

1038
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:03,881
Well,
again,

1039
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:04,714
it goes back to the same thing.
They're just trying to create 

1040
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,340
instability chaos in a,
in a,

1041
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,553
uh,
some sort of sense of mistrust of a 

1042
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,760
democratic institution.
Now,

1043
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:17,761
how much of a factor do you think it is 
that Hillary was not ever prosecuted for

1044
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,960
deleting all those emails after 
subpoena?

1045
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,640
Because it seems like that in any other 
case,

1046
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,580
if you do something like that top secret
clearance,

1047
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,513
you're found to have violated it.
He deleted those emails and people are 

1048
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:34,070
tired

1049
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,070
of hearing about this from the left 
though can still bringing that up again,

1050
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,323
but I got to think that in light of what
you said about them trying to hack into 

1051
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,444
the RNC,
but no evidence of they actually gotten 

1052
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:43,354
in,
but they did get into the DNC and you 

1053
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:46,400
think about all the different security 
errors that they've made.

1054
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,850
Especially with her having that private 
email server and all that shit with homo

1055
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:51,684
was using the same goddamn computer and 
printer that Anthony we're sending as 

1056
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,590
Dick pics out on.
I mean,

1057
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,390
Holy Shit,
it's chaos.

1058
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,670
Couldn't have written that as a,
as a Sitcom on house of cards,

1059
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,200
you would have gone love.
They're going over the top.

1060
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,010
That's not believable.
They're jumping the shark.

1061
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:07,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1062
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,823
As opposed to when the secret service 
agents slept with the president and his 

1063
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,354
wife,
you know,

1064
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,550
there was that.
What was that?

1065
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,361
That was.
I gave it.

1066
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,790
That's when I gave up on the series.
Does Not that far yet.

1067
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,550
Oh,
son of a bitch.

1068
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:20,384
Dammit.
He was son of a bitch and already won 

1069
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,600
that.
Can we rewind that goddamn spoilers,

1070
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,190
blah,
blah,

1071
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,733
blah.
Now I'm going to go home and get myself 

1072
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:30,080
in the head.
Yeah.

1073
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,320
I try to forget that I,
you know what,

1074
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,780
I just made that shit up.
It didn't actually appreciate it.

1075
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,570
Seasoned.
Who's got it now?

1076
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,730
Who's Kinda.
I'm just waiting.

1077
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,660
It would have just sitting there waiting
for fucking three service.

1078
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,710
Sleeping with a resident wouldn't 
happen.

1079
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,990
That'd be crazy.
Wow.

1080
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,540
Yeah.
That's what he's already done.

1081
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,360
Some gay shit.
Yeah.

1082
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,600
It's a weird.
It's a weird show.

1083
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:52,670
But that was the point where I said,
okay,

1084
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,470
I gotta find myself another program to 
watch.

1085
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,480
Um,
so.

1086
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,261
But yeah,
it's,

1087
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,094
it's,
um,

1088
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,640
that's what,
that's what you were like,

1089
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,030
this is unrealistic now.

1090
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,931
Yeah.
That's nice that,

1091
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:04,820
that's that bullshit.
That's where I draw the line.

1092
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,190
I'm sorry about that.
Somewhere at all,

1093
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,024
the presidents that we've had somewhere,
a secret service agent has slipped it 

1094
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:14,180
into the missus.
I guarantee you,

1095
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,040
I guarantee you somewhere along the line
somebody fucked the president's wife.

1096
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,730
I think it was taft.
I think it was the tafts.

1097
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,970
Administratively.
They would have done it.

1098
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,320
Look,
those are savages.

1099
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:29,030
Back then people were barely human.
Those were cave men with clothes on.

1100
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,030
Yeah.
So back shit.

1101
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:32,903
Did you see that one?
A female secret service agent who said 

1102
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:35,234
she was a.
She wouldn't take a bullet for the 

1103
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:37,730
president.
Whoa.

1104
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,080
Yeah.
Well that's your job.

1105
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:39,861
Hooker.
Well,

1106
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:42,350
that's exactly right.
And a fire yet.

1107
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,520
Not yet,
but I,

1108
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,091
you know,
they,

1109
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:44,781
they,
uh,

1110
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:45,614
I suspect that she will be disciplined 
because if you're saying she went on 

1111
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:50,174
facebook,
she put it on our facebook profile and 

1112
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,980
was a good move.

1113
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,940
Yeah.
And she supported,

1114
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,320
openly supported Hillary Clinton.
Put that on facebook and said that she,

1115
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,710
she would not take a bullet for,
for president trump.

1116
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:01,461
And you think,
well,

1117
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:02,960
you know,
you are in the secret service.

1118
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,890
That's your job.
Okay,

1119
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,720
here it goes.
Outrage at women,

1120
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:07,610
secret service agent and Clinton 
supporter,

1121
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,480
who said she would not,
capital letters risk her life to protect

1122
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,314
president trump.
Secret Service Agent Carrie O'grady 

1123
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,990
wrote last October that she would rather
go to jail.

1124
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,030
Then take a bullet for Donald Trump.
Well,

1125
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,980
she definitely get a better job.
Okay.

1126
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:23,241
She.
Oh,

1127
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,130
great.
He removed the post days later.

1128
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,993
Said she wrote it after being overcome 
with emotion following trump's grabbed 

1129
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:32,400
them by the pussy video.
Sounds like a music video.

1130
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,110
It's like a two live crew music video.
She insists that she would be willing to

1131
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,400
do anything to protect the president,
but o'grady has also made numerous other

1132
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:42,990
post criticizing Donald Trump.

1133
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,220
Well,
okay.

1134
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,470
What's the.
I'm not quite sure I understand the.

1135
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,101
The,
the,

1136
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,934
the conflict there.
She said she would rather go to jail to 

1137
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:52,470
take a bullet for the Donald Trump 
president trump,

1138
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:53,304
and then she insisted she would be 
willing to do anything to protect the 

1139
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:55,081
president.
Well,

1140
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:55,914
now she does.
She removed it and wants to keep her 

1141
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,154
job.
Secret services that are looking into 

1142
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:04,590
the post after a complaint.
That is a dangerous position to take.

1143
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:05,424
If you are a secret service agent.
We're not talking about someone who's a 

1144
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,533
WHO's a just regular civilian.
You're talking about someone who's Dad 

1145
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,800
your whole job and you have.
You got to be mean or she's in Denver.

1146
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:19,561
She's,
Geez,

1147
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,430
I didn't realize that she's been with 
them for quite a while.

1148
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,490
Like she knows better.
It's time for.

1149
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,380
I would say,
you know what,

1150
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,520
that's dishonoring the service,
the secret service and you know what?

1151
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,890
Maybe A.
I'm sure they'll,

1152
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,890
they'll icer put her in some admin 
position,

1153
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,020
but you have to in that position,
right?

1154
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:35,350
If you're a secret service agent,
you,

1155
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:39,420
you can't say anything critical like 
that publicly about the president.

1156
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:40,643
Absolutely not.
Diminishes the entire position that you 

1157
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:43,680
can.
Once you retire,

1158
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,514
you could say whatever the fuck you want
without violating any sort of laws that 

1159
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:49,231
you've,
you know,

1160
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:51,150
any sort of agreement that you've 
signed.

1161
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,310
But once you're in there,
that is the job.

1162
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:53,960
Yeah.
It's like,

1163
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,210
it's like if you were in the agency and 
you're overseas and you were campaigning

1164
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:00,300
on behalf of one of the candidates,
it doesn't make any sense.

1165
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,490
So I,
I'm,

1166
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,423
I'm impressed with her understanding of 
social media by posting something like 

1167
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:05,634
that on facebook that she was overcome 
with emotion though coming to motions 

1168
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,083
for the outer period will get crazy.
Maybe she had a xanax and a glass of 

1169
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:12,900
wine.

1170
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,733
She was like,
fuck that orange asshole and just grab 

1171
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:17,100
them by the pushy.
How dare you.

1172
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,920
Yeah.
What a weird time though that,

1173
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:22,580
that guy actually said that and still 
got to let they.

1174
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,143
I mean,
that's how much people didn't want 

1175
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,710
Hillary Clinton to be an office.
I know.

1176
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,390
And that's the thing.
And Oh,

1177
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,980
by the way,
did you see that,

1178
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,770
uh,
that little clip that was making its way

1179
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:35,604
around at the inauguration,
on the inauguration stand of Bill 

1180
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,130
Clinton checking you out and Allodynia 
it,

1181
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,170
getting caught.
That was Ivanka.

1182
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,800
Ivanka,
his daughter.

1183
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,050
So hard.
Oh my God.

1184
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,310
Yeah.
God,

1185
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,160
Jesus Christ.
Those jeans look was fantastic.

1186
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:52,280
The look was pure Bill Clinton.
He.

1187
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,041
Well,
he was like,

1188
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,240
fuck it.
It's over.

1189
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,420
I don't have to hold it back anymore.
Look at it.

1190
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,580
Oh,
good Lord.

1191
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,750
Yeah,
he's shaking.

1192
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,470
His liquid is a lot.
She turns around and looks at them.

1193
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,740
Look at that.
Oh my goodness.

1194
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,330
And then it looks,
it gives her a quick look.

1195
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,343
Yeah.
Well,

1196
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,560
it turned.
Once he looks at her,

1197
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,110
he's like,
listen bitch,

1198
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,860
you know who I am.
You know,

1199
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,960
you live with a wolf that you know you 
live with a big old gray wolf.

1200
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,160
She's.
Hi everyone.

1201
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:27,470
I'm Ivanka trump.
I wanted to.

1202
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,730
I wish you had a fucking accent.
What's going on there?

1203
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,080
Oh,
it's her giving them massage.

1204
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,750
Oh,
this is like a porn film that they did a

1205
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,700
fake porn about Ivanka trump.
They that.

1206
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,990
That quiz is beautiful.
The best part of the inauguration day.

1207
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,400
It's over.
It's over.

1208
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,430
I can beat me again.
I'm tired of it all.

1209
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:49,090
That would be the only reason I wanted 
or I would have wanted a Hillary Clinton

1210
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:49,924
when the only bright spot I guess I 
should say instead of the only bright 

1211
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:55,060
spot to her wedding would have been that
he would have been back in the house.

1212
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,350
Yeah.
Fascinating.

1213
00:47:56,351 --> 00:48:00,880
As a first man on a rampage,
he'd probably be on a rampage.

1214
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,920
Watches.
Watches mouth.

1215
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,260
Yeah.
Love his mouth.

1216
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,600
A little bites.
His lower lip.

1217
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,990
He said Ivanka?
No,

1218
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:12,991
he doesn't.
Does he know Ivanka?

1219
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,300
Oh yeah.
Look at her.

1220
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:18,240
Look at it.
This is amazing.

1221
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,800
Look at her.
Looking at him is fucking amazing.

1222
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:23,590
This.
Look what he looks like.

1223
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,250
Adult care.
He shut her down.

1224
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,260
One more time.
One more time with the look.

1225
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,590
Let me say this again.
Watch this for residential job.

1226
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,180
Here we go.
Here we go.

1227
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,920
Oh yeah.
It's a mean.

1228
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,180
Look.
I bet he gets angry when he was scary.

1229
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,490
Yeah.
That was at a highlight.

1230
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,383
A highlight of the day.
Whether or not you believe he's killed 

1231
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:45,724
people.
He's definitely been responsible for 

1232
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:48,730
people dying as president.
That's 100 percent.

1233
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,170
I mean,
he's made those decisions.

1234
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:51,004
People have died.
That's in that fucking bed brain of his 

1235
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,753
and when he looks over at her,
he's looking at her with those that 

1236
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:01,381
don't make me kill you with the wolf.

1237
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,063
The old grey wolf man.
He would have been awesome and office 

1238
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:06,700
again.
Oh,

1239
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,120
just roaming the hallways.
You know,

1240
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,410
you need his girls and keep your fucking
mouth shut.

1241
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,410
Do we have those?
Those uh,

1242
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm going to need a car.
I got to go into town.

1243
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,320
Animal animal.
That guy must've been.

1244
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,390
Wow.
What's crazy about him as the stories of

1245
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,224
him just pulling his dick out.
Like that's something that people do 

1246
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,040
like in college when they're drunk.
Yeah.

1247
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,093
You know,
you don't do it when you're the 

1248
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,650
president or former presidents.
Usually you don't.

1249
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,670
I mean,
again,

1250
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,920
who knows what Andrew Jackson got up to,
but I think,

1251
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,680
I think bill took it to a new level.
Yeah.

1252
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,900
I would imagine.
I would imagine there was no think about

1253
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,290
Jay.
Jay was,

1254
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,153
was jfk may have been because who knows,
because he had the benefit of the press 

1255
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:50,460
hiding his,
his activity.

1256
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,490
They all knew about it and that was a 
different time and he was only in office

1257
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,540
for how many years?
Three,

1258
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,840
three years.
I guess her 63 got killed,

1259
00:49:58,841 --> 00:49:59,300
right?
Yeah,

1260
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,133
yeah,
yeah.

1261
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,420
Two and a half years.
Yeah.

1262
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:03,880
Oh,
he would have had us,

1263
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,350
what he could have done.
We didn't have back pain.

1264
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,200
He was all fucked up and all sorts of 
different.

1265
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,810
He had some significant health issues,
right?

1266
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:12,440
Yeah.
He was on all sorts of meds and and,

1267
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,563
but you know,
he's still managed to find himself 

1268
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,940
around now and back then they would heal
you with like which doctors,

1269
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,120
what kind of fucking medicine do they 
have in 1963,

1270
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:24,190
they met us sales.
You should take some of these pills,

1271
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:24,880
Mr.
President,

1272
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,713
well,
they would put them on speed to then 

1273
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,670
they have in mind [inaudible] try to 
jazz them up,

1274
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,900
but back then I was,
you know,

1275
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,790
it's normally get your doctor,
write you a prescription to hear you.

1276
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,280
This will,
this will make you feel better.

1277
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:39,281
This throwing Mama's little helper.
Her mother's little helper momma went up

1278
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:42,710
from the south.
Yeah,

1279
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,170
it's the position is such a crazy 
position.

1280
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,063
I mean it's really,
there's no one that's really qualified 

1281
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:49,550
to do it and every time someone gets in 
it's like,

1282
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:50,384
okay,
let's see what kind of flaws and your 

1283
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:54,050
character going to be revealed by this.
And in that case,

1284
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,884
when you look at it that way,
at least from the point of view of 

1285
00:50:57,411 --> 00:51:01,400
representing a stately sort of like,
you know,

1286
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,160
like an intelligent,
articulate leader.

1287
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,520
Obama did a great job in that regard.
No measured.

1288
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,740
That's why the people on the left lobe 
and because he,

1289
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,950
he,
he was the,

1290
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,230
you know,
the projection of the intellect.

1291
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:14,080
He was uh,
you know,

1292
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,380
and fine,
and he was,

1293
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:16,214
he was at,
he was in a sort of one of those folks 

1294
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,340
you look at and go,
that's our president,

1295
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,920
you know,
put again,

1296
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,120
you could say he did certain things.

1297
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,953
Well,
and I would say from a foreign policy 

1298
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,820
perspective it was not good,
but I,

1299
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,773
you know,
you got to be able to say that was good 

1300
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,710
and there's bad,
you know.

1301
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,633
And,
and that's what I'm worried about with 

1302
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,780
the new president is that I'd like to 
think that all those borders aren't just

1303
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:39,710
going to say yeah,
everything he does,

1304
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,970
it's good that you still got it,
but they always do that.

1305
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,220
Everybody starts on the left.
What am I talking?

1306
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:45,054
I mean here,
what's going on right now with the 

1307
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:49,430
Dakota access pipeline where everyone's 
blaming trump for this.

1308
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,413
They forget this all started while Obama
was in office all over this where they 

1309
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:56,600
were putting easements on people's 
private land.

1310
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:59,240
When they were arresting these ranchers 
for protesting against it,

1311
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,540
trying to keep these guys from drilling 
into their fucking private land.

1312
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,730
That was all during the Obama 
administration.

1313
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,810
All of it.
I know,

1314
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,810
but he gets walking out the door.
I am going to cancel that.

1315
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,663
He stopped it and knowing that trump was
going to kickstarter right back up and 

1316
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:13,314
he would take the blame.
It's all crazy with the Chelsea manning 

1317
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,920
commutation and all.
How about Chelsea manning right after he

1318
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,343
says that he's a.
A weak leader says Obama's weekly to 

1319
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,630
pitch.
I just let you out of jail.

1320
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,870
Be in jail forever.
You can be in jail for ever.

1321
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:33,050
You could die in jail or in May.
You get to go to a ballgame.

1322
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,310
Look at that.
Look at that.

1323
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:35,890
I mean,
I don't think he's gonna want to go,

1324
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,730
so she right the Bradley.
It's Chelsea.

1325
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,340
She who was formerly known as Brad.
Yeah.

1326
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,211
Brad.
Well,

1327
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:46,780
they're not gonna pay for her medication
anymore.

1328
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,220
Now that she's really not.
That's a drawback.

1329
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:51,410
I guess she will figure it out.

1330
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,320
I think just do a podcast.
The Chelsea Manning,

1331
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:56,780
our Chelsea manning experience.
That's it.

1332
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,643
Good?
Yeah.

1333
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,010
The death squad network.
Why not?

1334
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,200
Why not make some money?
He or she has got to figure out a way to

1335
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,063
exactly earn a living.
So she'll be on Fox News on the view 

1336
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,503
box.
Foxtail is going to bring her in as a 

1337
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,030
contributor.
I can run on red.

1338
00:53:15,031 --> 00:53:17,600
I said,
what the hell?

1339
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,463
Come on on side kick show.
Some kind of psychological damage is 

1340
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:26,820
being in solitary confinement naked for 
like three years.

1341
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,200
How,
how bad is that?

1342
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:29,034
Fuck you up?
Because she was in solitary confinement 

1343
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,570
for a long time and they wouldn't even 
give her any clothes.

1344
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,790
Well,
I mean I am her,

1345
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,490
her,
him and her.

1346
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,530
I think originally formerly known as 
Brad,

1347
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,990
I think probably had some clothes,
probably had some,

1348
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,240
you know,
so non suicide watch close.

1349
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,840
I think that was the whole deal is that 
they kept her naked ladies are saying it

1350
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:52,080
was tantamount to torture.
I'm not buying.

1351
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,250
It sounds good though,
right mate?

1352
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,021
Yeah.
It sounds good.

1353
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:55,854
But I,
I,

1354
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,060
yeah,
it's good.

1355
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,290
Episode of homeland.
I'm thinking.

1356
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,780
Yeah,
I'm thinking it may not quite that way.

1357
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,853
Kept her naked just for a goof.
Mind a picture if you can find a 

1358
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:07,470
picture.
It not yet.

1359
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,720
Let's wait until we're done with all the
nips and Tucks,

1360
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,381
but you're right.
I mean.

1361
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:10,921
Okay.
You know what?

1362
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:12,900
You just got your sentence commuted.
Yeah.

1363
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,210
Shut your fucking mouth.
Say thank you.

1364
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:15,960
Yeah,
exactly.

1365
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,100
Thank you.
Thank you.

1366
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,160
So saying that he's a weak leader,
although there may be some mental issues

1367
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:23,880
here.
I'm just saying maybe that he or she was

1368
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:28,800
not up to snuff or feeling a leveled 
out.

1369
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,620
Who knows?
It's one of those things and that parent

1370
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,473
coast,
most graphic passage of the letter 

1371
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,830
manage description of how he was placed 
on suicide watch for three days from the

1372
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:38,820
18th of January.

1373
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,820
I was stripped of all clothing with the 
exception of my underwear.

1374
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,833
My prescription eyeglasses were taken 
away from me and I was forced to sit in 

1375
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,630
a central blindness.
Oh,

1376
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,830
I love your prescription.
I.

1377
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,770
It's like if someone took my contacts 
away from me,

1378
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:52,500
you know what?
I'd be happy when you're in darkness.

1379
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,820
You don't need your glasses,
dude.

1380
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,190
Yeah.
He's not in darkness either.

1381
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,570
He said it was in total blindness.
Well,

1382
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,520
essentially blind from not having a 
prescription glasses.

1383
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,400
Blind.
Yes,

1384
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,580
underwear.
It was three days,

1385
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:05,580
but you see how this happens.
Now suddenly he spends three years naked

1386
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,660
and in the dark.
You know the truth is,

1387
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,790
again,
I'm not saying this from a right wing,

1388
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,330
from the left,
we,

1389
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:13,163
I don't give a fuck,
but the truth tends to always be 

1390
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,160
somewhere in some defined middle,
the parameter of shift on the middle,

1391
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,203
but it also describes the experience of 
being stripped naked at night and made 

1392
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:27,000
to stand for parade in the nude parade.

1393
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,193
Is there a parade for race horses?
A condition that continues to this day 

1394
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,863
in quotes,
the guard told me to stand at parade 

1395
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:37,530
rest.
I don't know what that means.

1396
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:41,040
Parade rest for about three minutes with
my hands behind my back and my leg.

1397
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,660
Space,
shoulder width apart.

1398
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,810
I stood at parade rest for about three 
minutes.

1399
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,560
The brig supervisor and the other guards
walk past my cell,

1400
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,060
looked at me,
paused for a moment,

1401
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:51,894
and then continue to the next cell.
I was incredibly embarrassed at having 

1402
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,540
all these people stare at me naked.
I'm embarrassed.

1403
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,340
Oh my God.
Embarrassed is torture.

1404
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,443
I shouldn't be.
You don't understand that because you 

1405
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:04,890
can look at me naked.
I'll just tell you right now.

1406
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,530
You want to stare at me and they could 
meet without any clothes on if you don't

1407
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,640
beat me up.
Okay.

1408
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:11,580
If you're not getting me or torturing me
and you're staring at me naked.

1409
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,480
Yeah,
that's my Dick.

1410
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:13,580
What do you want?
Sorry.

1411
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,280
There's my butthole.
You want to look?

1412
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,240
What the fuck?
Kind of Weirdo or you don't.

1413
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,450
You have one too,
don't you?

1414
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,170
You want me to look at yours?
I don't want to look at yours.

1415
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:23,480
How about that?
I'm less weird than you.

1416
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,960
You know all that talk and would go very
well in the military brigade.

1417
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,130
I think you'd probably beat me to death.
Yeah.

1418
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,470
But um,
but yeah,

1419
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,363
again,
you know,

1420
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:34,280
it's okay.
So you know her,

1421
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,380
her sentences commuted and we can,
we can now move on.

1422
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,090
She starts her podcasts and then the 
question is yeah,

1423
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,720
there was a lot of people that thought 
he was going to.

1424
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,580
Pardon?
Beau Bergdahl,

1425
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,900
Sergeant Bergdahl,
fellow who walked into the Taliban camp,

1426
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,450
turned himself in,
walked off his post.

1427
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,430
Do you remember this guy?
Oh yeah,

1428
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:53,970
yeah,
yeah.

1429
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:54,803
Why?
Why did they think they're going to 

1430
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:55,750
wear?

1431
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,250
A lot of people thought that Obama was 
going to do that as well.

1432
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,720
President Obama was going to do that as 
well.

1433
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,870
Really?
And I thought maybe snowden.

1434
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,390
I thought snowden would have been a very
interesting one,

1435
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:05,224
but apparently what he said to meet a 
lot of sense was the difference between 

1436
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:09,730
when Chelsea Manning did was Chelsea 
manning was arrested,

1437
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:11,200
went through trial,
was convicted,

1438
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:14,610
and then he pardoned her.
Commuted her sentence that,

1439
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:15,783
that snowden never face trial and so 
because he fled and because he went to 

1440
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:21,340
the,
you know,

1441
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,860
essentially our enemy to Russia to live 
there.

1442
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,090
Yeah.
I can't do that.

1443
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:25,840
No,
no,

1444
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,220
no.
It doesn't leave when you,

1445
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,533
again,
this idea that somehow he kept all the 

1446
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,210
materials safe from the Russians.
Just it just cracks the Chinese.

1447
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:36,760
He spent time in Hong Kong and I carry 
you step foot in,

1448
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,760
in Hong Kong or it certainly,
you know,

1449
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,350
your cell phone with a one.

1450
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,880
You've gotten this idea that somehow,
you know,

1451
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,370
Glenn Greenwald,
who is an interesting cat.

1452
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,480
I,
I'm not saying he's not,

1453
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:47,314
but Glenn Greenwald and somehow snowed 
and we're going to beat the Chinese 

1454
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,740
intelligence service and the,
and the FSB is a,

1455
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,120
might be a bridge too far,
but um,

1456
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:56,954
so you'd have to have some pretty deep 
technological innovation to be able to 

1457
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:00,641
do that.
I mean,

1458
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,700
you'd have to really understand how 
those networks work and maybe snowden be

1459
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:06,460
able to protect certain aspects of what 
he was talking about.

1460
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:08,150
But I think we have to remember the 
also,

1461
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,003
he was not lex luther.
I mean it's sort of the narrative got 

1462
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:14,860
built up that he was a mastermind at NSA
and high school dropout.

1463
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:19,850
He was an Admin guy and it was an it 
admin guy who identified a weakness.

1464
00:58:19,851 --> 00:58:20,261
Hey,
fair,

1465
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:22,390
go to him.
He figured out a weakness in the systems

1466
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:24,100
and you know how to manipulate that.

1467
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,680
Not that someone can't be a high school 
dropout and be bright.

1468
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
Exactly.
But he was a high school dropout,

1469
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,240
I believe that's correct.
I think he got his ged.

1470
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,760
He's a.
He was obviously a fucking genius.

1471
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:38,761
He's a super smart kid,
but you know the whole thing.

1472
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,470
Yeah,
I think it's very strange.

1473
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,960
It's very strange because,
uh,

1474
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,140
on one hand,
look,

1475
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:44,974
nobody wants their God damn.
Emails peered into constantly when they 

1476
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:50,260
haven't done a damn thing wrong.
Think of a free country.

1477
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:50,891
You think,
well,

1478
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:51,880
Hey,
I'm a freak.

1479
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,470
I'm a free man.
Uh,

1480
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:55,000
I have a good job.
I don't,

1481
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,843
I pay my taxes.
I don't start any trouble why they 

1482
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,650
looked at in my email.
So in that sense,

1483
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,293
a lot of people felt like they were 
vindicated in their fears by this guy 

1484
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:08,560
coming out and what snowden.
I get that.

1485
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,510
Yeah.
But how did you see it?

1486
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,760
Well,
I saw this.

1487
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,920
I saw it in more of a simplistic 
operational perspective because again,

1488
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,243
what we talked about before,
everybody looks at these things from 

1489
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:18,544
their own life experiences.
My life experiences are different than 

1490
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,980
somebody who hasn't done it,

1491
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,550
but you know,
you sign up,

1492
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:27,560
you're fucking agreements,
you sign,

1493
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,920
you commit yourself to protect national 
security.

1494
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:34,490
You commit yourself to treat a 
classified material honorably.

1495
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,930
So just like the secret service agent,
you know,

1496
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,770
when you start making posts on your 
facebook,

1497
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:40,604
this is against the whole gig.
You're breaching your agreements and 

1498
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:42,950
again,
and,

1499
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,330
but people will hear that and they go,
well,

1500
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,460
but he was doing a service or,
and then they have the,

1501
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,790
they do have this,
this bullshit out there about how he,

1502
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,990
he tried,
he tried several times to go and,

1503
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,970
and,
and talk about this now.

1504
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,480
They never brought it to the New York 
Times or Washington Post or any of those

1505
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:56,991
places.
I mean,

1506
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,510
internally it was like he's got the 
narrative that says,

1507
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:00,360
well,
I talked to my soup,

1508
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,670
I tried to get this out there and 
everything.

1509
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,513
And once again,
the truth is not exactly in either 

1510
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:05,810
sides.

1511
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,591
Narrative.
Okay,

1512
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:07,424
I'll be,
you know,

1513
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,600
so you know,
the,

1514
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,010
the,
the far right that goes after him.

1515
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:11,960
It says he should be hanged for treason.
That's bullshit.

1516
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:12,800
No,
he shouldn't,

1517
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,310
but you know what I do believe he should
face,

1518
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,760
um,
uh,

1519
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,480
the court system,
you know,

1520
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:20,370
and I,
and I don't,

1521
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,010
you know,
people are gonna disagree with that.

1522
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:22,611
Fine,
fuck it.

1523
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:23,444
But,
you know,

1524
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,890
that's what I think,
but the idea of,

1525
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:25,724
you know,
some of the people went histrionics and 

1526
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:27,261
said,
you know,

1527
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,670
you should be hung.
That's ridiculous.

1528
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:29,504
That's not how we operate.
I also get the idea that people felt 

1529
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:33,670
like that was good,
you know,

1530
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,523
ultimately that we had that conversation
and I agree with that point because we 

1531
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:40,820
should always have those conversations,
but there's a way to do it as a place to

1532
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:42,170
do that as a manner of doing that.

1533
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,053
But would we have had that conversation 
without him because I don't think we 

1534
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:46,574
would.
Well,

1535
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,250
I don't disagree necessarily disagree 
with that,

1536
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:51,370
but I think that the point,
is it a.

1537
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:52,520
yeah,
you're right.

1538
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,353
Where we got what failed us was up on 
Capitol Hill where they fail to do what 

1539
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:58,391
they're supposed to do.
If they're,

1540
01:00:58,391 --> 01:00:59,224
as politicians that we've got there.
There are protocols in place and a 

1541
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:07,010
curious public or a curious,
uh,

1542
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,993
people's representatives are always 
supposed to be having these discussions 

1543
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:12,284
about where on the spectrum between 
security and civil liberties and 

1544
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:16,420
freedom,
you know,

1545
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,010
where does that pendulum rest at any 
given time?

1546
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,990
Um,
these people up on the hill in the Intel

1547
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:25,760
committees,
there's a,

1548
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:28,760
this is a well worn path from NSA,
from the CIA,

1549
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:33,140
from others up to that hill to brief 
those people on every fucking thing that

1550
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:33,770
goes on.

1551
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:34,340
I mean,
it just,

1552
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,020
this just then people are going to roll 
her eyes,

1553
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:36,854
but that's the way it fucking works.
And so then this is also this game it 

1554
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:42,830
gets played in Washington where they 
pretend like they don't know,

1555
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:45,020
and then they get outraged and they 
stand up and say,

1556
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:45,660
well,
I just,

1557
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,110
there's almost an angst ridden a horse 
shit.

1558
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,150
Those people didn't ask,
they didn't pursue,

1559
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:50,984
they didn't ask the questions.
They didn't demand that we have these 

1560
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,940
discussions internally to.
And so I think,

1561
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:01,010
you know,
politicians in part dropped the ball.

1562
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:02,840
They don't do what they're doing.
The healthiest thing.

1563
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:03,674
We could have a course or people up on 
the hill who are constantly questioning 

1564
01:02:09,171 --> 01:02:10,004
the system,
constantly talking about it because 

1565
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,740
you're right and it's.
It's very important.

1566
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:13,574
You have to figure out where that goes.
Now another bomb goes off somewhere and 

1567
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,840
that pendulum's going to swing back to 
security.

1568
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:18,531
People go say,
fuck it,

1569
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:19,860
I don't care.
Right?

1570
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,120
Check,
check my shoes,

1571
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:23,250
do whatever the hell you want to.
But you know,

1572
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,020
read my emails.
Just keep us safe.

1573
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,270
And in particular it's a big incident 
and God forbid,

1574
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,450
but that's where I guess my point being 
is that pendulum is constantly moving.

1575
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,860
Well,
does that frustrated to frustrate you?

1576
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:34,750
Because that's where the conspiracy 
theorists come in.

1577
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,170
Whenever something goes on and there's 
any sort of a terrorist attack,

1578
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,333
conspiracy theorist jump in and say this
is a false flag because they'd been 

1579
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:42,784
trying to erode our privacy and erode 
our civil liberties and this is the way 

1580
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:47,164
they do it.
So instead of looking at it in a broad 

1581
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:51,370
perspective,
like looking at it saying,

1582
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:51,820
well,
okay,

1583
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:56,590
is it possible that a terrorist act,
a terrorist act took place,

1584
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,710
and now they have to tighten up security
because of that?

1585
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:00,880
No,
no,

1586
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,270
no,
no.

1587
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,270
People are Matt automatically go to.
No.

1588
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:05,104
They orchestrated the terrorist attack 
so that they could tighten up security 

1589
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:12,270
because it's this overall global plan to
turn this off.

1590
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,460
One world government government.
Yeah.

1591
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,061
Yeah.
Well,

1592
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:17,450
I hope I get to be in charge of that one
world government.

1593
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,293
That's all I could say.
I would make a hell of a one world 

1594
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:22,080
government leader.
So how would you,

1595
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,350
how would you do things differently?
No,

1596
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,201
I would.
I'm just kidding.

1597
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,520
I would hate to be in charge of one 
world.

1598
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:28,160
Could you imagine what a goat rope that 
would be.

1599
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:33,180
I wouldn't even want to be a mayor.
Yeah.

1600
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,230
Being a mayor of the town,
a town of 10,000

1601
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:38,690
people.
You're gonna have 4,000

1602
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,520
to fucking hate you.

1603
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,820
Yeah.
Retail politics.

1604
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,660
I think of the worst,
you know,

1605
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,800
local politics and you see,
hey look,

1606
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:47,360
we're talking about Idaho again.
And was like,

1607
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:48,194
oh,
for fuck's sake.

1608
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,093
But in Idaho as an example,
I can walk down a street in Boise and 

1609
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,970
bumped into the governor,
Lieutenant Governor,

1610
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:54,320
we have a nice chat.
They're great guys,

1611
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,050
great people,
ranchers,

1612
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,080
and you know,
they do this.

1613
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,230
And in Idaho they do a,
there was a point to that story.

1614
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,020
I'll get it to a second.
But they have the legislature,

1615
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:05,010
just an office for three months.
They,

1616
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,950
they do all the work they need to do 
with.

1617
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,510
They get back to that damn jobs,
right?

1618
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,920
Insurance broker,
car guy,

1619
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:11,660
a guy,
a rancher,

1620
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:15,200
whatever it is.
So it's Kinda the way it should be,

1621
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,093
right?
You don't need people governing you 12 

1622
01:04:18,591 --> 01:04:21,290
months of the fucking year doesn't.
It's not necessary.

1623
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,090
Um,
but,

1624
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,480
uh,
the piracy,

1625
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,510
I forgot the point of the story,
but anyway,

1626
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,530
you've got this environment where you 
can watch the local politics.

1627
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:33,350
That's the point of the story.
And you can see the congress because I'm

1628
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:35,010
on the flights with them all the time.
And the senator,

1629
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:36,220
Senator Rich,
great guy,

1630
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:37,970
he's on the Intel Committee.
Brilliant guy.

1631
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:38,810
But you,
you,

1632
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:43,810
you see what they have to do to stay in,
in office,

1633
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,660
you know,
that it,

1634
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,493
particularly the congressmen,
they're always campaigning there always 

1635
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:51,170
raising funds.
They're always politicking it just.

1636
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,380
And you think that it's pretty fucked 
up,

1637
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:55,700
you know,
and so that's why I'm,

1638
01:04:55,701 --> 01:04:59,270
I'm a big fan of term limits and a big 
fan of saying,

1639
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,220
you know what,
this does nothing set in stone that says

1640
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:04,730
our congressman congresswoman have to be
just two year terms.

1641
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:05,623
Right?
We did that in the old days because 

1642
01:05:06,411 --> 01:05:07,244
nobody wanted to be in dc because it was
a swamp and they had to get back to 

1643
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:11,060
their farms and actually earn a living.

1644
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:12,523
So stretch that out to four years.
So you can be a congressman for a total 

1645
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:16,160
of eight years.
You get two terms.

1646
01:05:16,161 --> 01:05:19,960
You could be a senator for terms six 
years each and then get the hell out.

1647
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:21,670
Go back to your jobs,
do something else.

1648
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,923
And I think we would do,
we would deepen the pool of potential 

1649
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:27,940
candidates.
We would see other people come up,

1650
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,803
rise up.
It would take some of the money out of 

1651
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:32,080
it.
Maybe take a little bit of the influence

1652
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:36,610
on some of the influence out of it yet 
if I know somebody going to be in office

1653
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,683
and you know,
on the ways and means committee for 36 

1654
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:40,744
years,
I'm going to invest a lot of effort and 

1655
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:46,180
time and that individual if I'm a 
lobbying firm and on k street in DC,

1656
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,800
um,
but if I don't,

1657
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:49,720
if that person's not going to be there,
I'm going to share.

1658
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,760
I'll figure out how to work the system,
I'm sure.

1659
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,330
But I'm gonna it's gonna.
It's Kinda at least shake it up a little

1660
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,550
bit and I think it would take some of 
that money and influence out.

1661
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,931
But,
uh,

1662
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:00,100
I don't know where I was going with that
story.

1663
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,170
That was pretty boring.
No,

1664
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,160
no.
You were just comparing another million.

1665
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,023
The difference between local politics 
where people have an actual job on top 

1666
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:09,550
of being a local politician.
Yeah.

1667
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,181
I mean,
look,

1668
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:11,500
it's,
it's a dirty business.

1669
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,480
As soon as you're in the business of 
governing people,

1670
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:16,900
you're in the business of controlling 
people here in the business of trying to

1671
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:17,734
pass laws that help the people that put 
you in power in the first place and it 

1672
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:24,580
just gets you real squirrely.
It's a little dodgy.

1673
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,190
How about that dose ea on,
on President trump,

1674
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:31,000
but what I would say that came out that 
was supposedly,

1675
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,580
you know who did it that buzzfeed,
that the Buzzfeed,

1676
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,080
I think they were the ones who printed 
it.

1677
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,790
Just recent.
It's a recent one that,

1678
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:37,624
you know,
the Russian was supposedly that he was 

1679
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,830
gauged and shenanigans with that stuff.
The pen on the bed stuff that's,

1680
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,250
you know,
it was ridiculous about that.

1681
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,630
Was that major news sources reporting 
that as an unsubstantiated rumor.

1682
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,920
Yeah.
Like you can't do that.

1683
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,270
Yeah,
you can't do that.

1684
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:53,441
That,
that,

1685
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:54,274
that had been out and circulating and 
then how could they possibly entertain 

1686
01:06:58,451 --> 01:06:59,284
that when they know when the times and 
you can pick up the New York Times on 

1687
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:05,530
any given day and they've got a front 
page above the fold story that's relying

1688
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:08,050
almost exclusively on anonymous sources.
Just insane.

1689
01:07:08,051 --> 01:07:09,160
So I,
you know,

1690
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:10,750
I don't think,
but it was,

1691
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:11,584
it was amazing that they would run with 
that and it was a complete bullshit 

1692
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:15,920
report.
It's such a hatchet job hatch.

1693
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:16,511
I mean,
it's like,

1694
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:17,830
it's like a hack wrote it.

1695
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,610
I mean,
Lose Good and Hookers to pee on him.

1696
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,910
Yeah.
Well come on.

1697
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:22,744
It's supposedly the narrative became 
then for those that would like to have 

1698
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:25,114
believed that it became,
well the person that wrote it as a very 

1699
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,013
distinguished former mys six officer 
from a British secret service and they 

1700
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,090
had no,
not currently.

1701
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,670
Um,
it was just.

1702
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,410
No,
no.

1703
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:39,610
The world of the world of political 
opposition research,

1704
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:40,444
this shouldn't surprise anybody is,
it's populated by a lot of sketchy 

1705
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,550
dudes.
Um,

1706
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,010
and no way.
Yeah,

1707
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:48,760
I know.
I know somebody should do a series about

1708
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,700
it,
but,

1709
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,330
but real,
real,

1710
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,750
uh,
but anyway,

1711
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,650
so yeah,
that was a,

1712
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,570
that was a fascinating little glitch in 
the old,

1713
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,680
uh,
on the radar.

1714
01:07:56,681 --> 01:08:01,681
But I don't know,
it just seemed so strange and,

1715
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,093
excuse me,
one of the strangest parts was his 

1716
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:06,370
response to it.
Everybody knows I'm a Germaphobe.

1717
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,080
It's like what's like,
and it's like I tell all my people,

1718
01:08:11,081 --> 01:08:12,820
when you go to Russia,
they're filming anything,

1719
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,100
don't do anything stupid,
don't screw around,

1720
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,943
don't get paid on.
Do you really think I would just have 

1721
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:18,660
people peeing on me?
Yeah,

1722
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,810
I mean he's got a point there.
I mean,

1723
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,290
it is ridiculous.
I agree with it from as a tidy person.

1724
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,124
I'm a beating on.
My wife would say I'm a very tidy 

1725
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:27,080
person.
I,

1726
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:28,160
you know,
my first thought would be,

1727
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:28,994
oh,
who the fuck is going to change these 

1728
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,374
sheets and all this.
Now we've got a carpet and what the 

1729
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,940
hell?
Yeah.

1730
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,740
It depends on how much they've had to 
drink obviously.

1731
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,253
Oh,
you know what if they've eaten 

1732
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:41,150
asparagus,
who's into the WHO's into that?

1733
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,540
That's what I really want to know.
Yeah.

1734
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,483
And what happened?
What it's usually I've talked to girls 

1735
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:48,680
who are dominatrixes and uh,
one of the things they tell you,

1736
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:52,100
it's always these guys that are like big
time ceos.

1737
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,370
They run corporations with power type 
A's.

1738
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:56,204
You know,
that they want to take them up and shit 

1739
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,530
on their head.
That's what it is.

1740
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:01,364
Well,
when you describe it that way I can see 

1741
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,890
what the attraction is.
You know,

1742
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,610
I get it.
Yeah,

1743
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,370
I,
it's,

1744
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,300
it was,
but it was again,

1745
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:12,230
because that got out there completely 
unsubstantiated.

1746
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,870
But it became that narrative.
Right?

1747
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,320
And people would start talking about 
him.

1748
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:17,260
I said,
let me tell you about it.

1749
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:18,094
I overheard a conversation today.
Hopefully these people that I overheard 

1750
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:22,220
or you know,
I hope they are listening.

1751
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:27,730
I was at the hotel I'm staying at while 
I'm in town and I was staying at the bar

1752
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:29,900
and a cup of coffee to go this early 
this morning.

1753
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,823
And there were two fellows sitting at a 
couple of chairs and they were talking 

1754
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:35,504
about the new administration and you 
could tell they were seriously angst 

1755
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:39,620
written about the whole thing.

1756
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,600
They were hyperventilate,
very upset about it.

1757
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,850
And uh,
one of them said,

1758
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,500
well,
I tell you what I'm worried about.

1759
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:48,020
I'm worried about this whole Muslim ban 
thing.

1760
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:48,520
And,
and,

1761
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,160
uh,
you know,

1762
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,340
returning to the days of being a white 
supremacist nation,

1763
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,880
my budget,
both these guys were white and the other

1764
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,300
guy goes,
doesn't even blink at night,

1765
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,060
doesn't even question what this guy has 
just said.

1766
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,380
I think it goes,
I'll tell you what I'm worried about.

1767
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:01,214
I'm worried about him signing an 
agreement with Russia and in next thing 

1768
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:05,174
you know,
they go to war together and in the 

1769
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,820
Middle East,
not just one country,

1770
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:10,220
the Middle East to get their hands on 
all that oil.

1771
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,910
And the other guy says in response to 
that says that's already happening.

1772
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,760
And they were serious and this is what 
happens.

1773
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:17,930
Right?
And I'm of these guys.

1774
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,420
Well,
you don't have to tell them they were in

1775
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,150
a hotel lobby.

1776
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,310
They were,
well they weren't,

1777
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,880
they look,
so you don't know who these guys were.

1778
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,940
I don't know who they were,
but they were dressed what?

1779
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:25,783
Distinguished,
distinguished yell mid thirties 

1780
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:28,050
probably.
Uh,

1781
01:10:28,051 --> 01:10:29,540
and they really believed what they were 
saying.

1782
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,141
Oh my.
Well,

1783
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:30,974
they were reinforcing each other.
And I'm not saying it doesn't happen on 

1784
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:33,260
the other side.
Of course it happens.

1785
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:34,380
On the other side too,
you know,

1786
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:39,440
but that's the point is it's we've been 
people fucking going crazy.

1787
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,160
They're losing their minds and it's not 
just now with,

1788
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,013
with president trump,
obviously the people on the right that 

1789
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:44,390
we're doing the same thing with the 
previous,

1790
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,313
a previous president,
but I didn't know I wanted to turn 

1791
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,100
around and say something to them and at 
least just say,

1792
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,023
excuse me,
like do you think you've maybe over 

1793
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:52,790
there I was having dinner.
Not that I.

1794
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,310
not that I sit in and eavesdrop on 
people.

1795
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,570
This is your move this,
this is my thing.

1796
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,730
Intelligence Agency collects data.
Just go,

1797
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,720
you know,
it tends to be,

1798
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:06,600
I'm at dinner in New York last week and 
there was a table next to me and I would

1799
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:07,434
just sit in there.
I was waiting for my colleagues to show 

1800
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:08,871
up,
so I was,

1801
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,704
I'm going to drink.
And I was listening to the conversation 

1802
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,700
and they were again sort of feeding each
other about,

1803
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,550
you know,
apocalyptic results from the election.

1804
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,590
And one of them said this is the worst 
thing.

1805
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:20,424
And he was absolutely serious and these 
guys were probably in their early 

1806
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:24,570
sixties and dress very well.
You could tell they were,

1807
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,463
you know,
and their wives are with them and then 

1808
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:31,260
socializing one percent group and one of
them says this is the worst thing that's

1809
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:32,370
ever happened to this country.

1810
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,120
And that actually did make me then 
interrupt,

1811
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,070
which is ruined admittedly.
But I said,

1812
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,510
look,
I hope you don't mind me.

1813
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,160
You know,
I overheard what you said.

1814
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,443
Does that include nine slash 11?
Does it include Pearl Harbor doesn't 

1815
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,140
include the assassination of Lincoln.
It's an include the great depression,

1816
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,033
you know,
how,

1817
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,620
how do you define worst thing to ever 
happen to our country?

1818
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,770
And I know the guy looked at me like,
you know,

1819
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,500
I was a Douche bag and I was,
you know,

1820
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,033
at least it's all,
at least you recognized what he was 

1821
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:03,260
dealing with.
What I said I,

1822
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:03,950
you know,
again,

1823
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,610
I'll go back to my drink and I,
you know,

1824
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:07,320
but I just,
I would just curious.

1825
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,140
And you know,
there was no give and take.

1826
01:12:10,141 --> 01:12:10,920
There was no,
you know,

1827
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,380
I didn't get some magical 
responsibility.

1828
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,100
I guess I was big over the top a little 
bit,

1829
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:14,761
you know,
but no,

1830
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:15,300
that didn't happen.

1831
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,133
No,
they just went back to them so I don't 

1832
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:18,511
know.
Yeah,

1833
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:20,040
we should all just chill the fuck out a 
little bit.

1834
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,903
Well,
people get on their team and they stick 

1835
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:26,400
with it.
Whether it's team left or team right in,

1836
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:31,401
which is why all those people that are 
anti war refused to go crazy about Obama

1837
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:33,090
and the drones.
Yes.

1838
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:36,660
You look at all the drone deaths that 
happened during the Obama administration

1839
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:38,610
and what percentage of them were 
innocent civilians.

1840
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:39,444
It's pretty staggering,
but you don't hear about that from the 

1841
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:41,814
left.
All you hear about it from the left is 

1842
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:43,823
that the right is a bunch of warmongers.
They're doing terrible things and they 

1843
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,290
look terrible.
Things are done right there.

1844
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,720
Just that's how.
That's how the world operates.

1845
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,060
It would be nice if we didn't do 
terrible things.

1846
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,170
Yes,
it would be.

1847
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,203
It would be nice if there weren't places
in the world that were horrific right 

1848
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,290
now.

1849
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,500
All I could think of us.
So with that,

1850
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,230
what would I do for a living?
What's my.

1851
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,460
What's my revenue stream at that point?
But when I complain about,

1852
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,353
yeah,
what do you think about what's going on 

1853
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:09,240
right now in Israel?
Well,

1854
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:10,543
that's pretty significant,
but it's no explain to people what's 

1855
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:13,230
happening.
Well,

1856
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,830
I mean at the 30,000
foot level of sort of,

1857
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,570
not to have to start from a different 
direction,

1858
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:20,730
but it's a 30,000
foot level.

1859
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,800
We,
uh,

1860
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,673
we've lost a,
a significant amount of leverage in the 

1861
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,200
Middle East.
So as an example,

1862
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:29,034
when previous secretary Kerry from 
President Obama's administration talked 

1863
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:34,010
about,
uh,

1864
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,170
going to a conference to talk about 
peace in Syria.

1865
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,330
It's a joke.
It's ridiculous.

1866
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,750
We don't have any influence in there 
where they were not the player out there

1867
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:43,441
anymore.
We're not,

1868
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:44,274
because again,
this idea that we're going to step off 

1869
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:48,240
the world stage a little bit as we did 
that over the past several years,

1870
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,863
uh,
Iran in particular has realized more 

1871
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,453
influence,
more leverage in that region than 

1872
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:56,340
they've had in modern times.

1873
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,590
And they're ecstatic.
They're,

1874
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,690
they can't believe their good fortune.
Um,

1875
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,763
and you know,
I'm not just beating on that whole 

1876
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,710
ridiculous a nuclear agreement that we 
ended up signing,

1877
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:09,623
which if secretary Kerry was telling the
truth and saying that it was all based 

1878
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:14,920
on verification,
we're kind of fucked because I'm here to

1879
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:17,950
tell you we don't have really good 
verification on their programs.

1880
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,720
We and we haven't had it for a long 
time,

1881
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,823
so we rely on the Israelis to a great 
deal on some of our couple of our other 

1882
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:27,490
allies out there who have better human 
source intelligence.

1883
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,290
Uh,
but if it was down to us,

1884
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,393
you know,
we'd be flying a little bit blind 

1885
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,590
because it's up to,
it's a tough,

1886
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:33,640
tough target.
Um,

1887
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,930
so anyway,
uh,

1888
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:36,843
point being,
as the Iranians saw an opening over the 

1889
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:41,230
past few years,
uh,

1890
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:45,940
to do what they wanted to do for a long 
time and now they have,

1891
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,083
um,
a increasingly tight relationship with 

1892
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,340
Iraq of all places.

1893
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,310
The Russians saw the same thing that the
Iranian saw in the Middle East and,

1894
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:55,770
and,
and,

1895
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:56,603
and we'll get to Israel in second,
but Israel is just kind of sitting 

1896
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,151
there,
right?

1897
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,230
Like Fort Apache.
The Bronx,

1898
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,150
so Israel is sitting there,
you know,

1899
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:01,984
we,
they are questioning whether we've got 

1900
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,220
the same sort of commitment to them over
the past few years.

1901
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,470
Russia sees the same thing,
the Iranian see,

1902
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,270
so Russia goes in and they start doing 
what?

1903
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:10,810
Well,
they start,

1904
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,340
they've,
they've signed weapons agreements,

1905
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,710
arms agreements with a rock of all 
places,

1906
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,573
right?
Iraq rock.

1907
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,680
They're selling hardware,
uh,

1908
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:21,270
to the Iraqis after everything we were 
doing and all the blood and,

1909
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,193
and,
and,

1910
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,510
and so,
um,

1911
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,070
and then they,
they've done the same thing with,

1912
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,020
with Egypt.
They've signed weapons agreements,

1913
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:29,530
significant weapons agreements with 
Egypt.

1914
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,630
They haven't had a relationship with 
Egypt since the,

1915
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,120
since the Nassar days going all the way 
back.

1916
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,280
And increasingly,
you know,

1917
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,820
obviously the Russians,
you know,

1918
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,160
they were never ever going to give up 
on,

1919
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,840
on what they had in Syria.
They've got a,

1920
01:15:42,841 --> 01:15:45,010
they've got one port for their Black Sea
Fleet.

1921
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:46,750
That's it.
And it's in Syria.

1922
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:49,810
They're not going to the idea that we 
were going to work together.

1923
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,610
This is one of those fallacies again 
where you think,

1924
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,430
well,
maybe,

1925
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,263
you know,
our interests are aligned as far as 

1926
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,090
fighting isis.
No,

1927
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:58,510
they're fucking not that they,
they are not at all.

1928
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:01,240
And so the idea that somehow we were 
going to,

1929
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,393
you know,
work,

1930
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,423
you know,
and that Russia had the same sort of 

1931
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:08,320
agenda of Russia was never,
never gonna let Assad go unless they had

1932
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:11,620
a rock solid replacement who was on 
their team.

1933
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:17,130
So they've created this alliance.
A Turkey in the meantime is kind of slid

1934
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:21,700
in there as well with that st packed 
again because we kind of stepped off the

1935
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:24,250
stage and people were curious and when 
people are not curious,

1936
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,290
but people confused,
where does America stand,

1937
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,450
where are we,
what are our commitments?

1938
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,910
And when we don't say it out loud where 
we don't prove it,

1939
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,013
then they start looking elsewhere.
So Germany and Turkey start creating an 

1940
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:35,930
alliance,
uh,

1941
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,840
uh,
the UK and China,

1942
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,640
you know,
create economic alliances.

1943
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:40,751
Um,
you know,

1944
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:44,140
France and Russia working together and 
again in counter terrorism,

1945
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,333
you start getting these weird alliances 
that have been built up over now the 

1946
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,064
past recent few years and then we're 
surprised that somehow the European 

1947
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,020
Union is kind of coming apart a little 
bit at the fabric.

1948
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,630
Um,
and so anyway,

1949
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,690
but the point being is then Israel 
sitting there,

1950
01:16:58,810 --> 01:16:59,980
fort Apache,
the bronx,

1951
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,720
the Bronx,
um,

1952
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,633
obviously Netanyahu and President Obama,
not exactly the tightest of 

1953
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,400
relationships and you know,
they,

1954
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:14,930
they don't have a lot of options.
It's not like they could look around and

1955
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:15,620
say,
well,

1956
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,680
we'll align ourselves with somebody else
to protect our,

1957
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,530
what is obviously an existential threat 
for them.

1958
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:23,870
Um,
they don't have a lot of options.

1959
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,853
It's pretty much us.
And so that kind of creates the 

1960
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,634
environment that we currently existed.
Now obviously there's a feeling that 

1961
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:36,770
there's a bit of a sea change and that 
the US has recommitting itself to,

1962
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,480
to Israel,
to its alliance.

1963
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:39,920
Look,
it's the only democracy,

1964
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,380
legitimate democracy out there.
And,

1965
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,040
you know,
um,

1966
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,820
again,
like with any alliance,

1967
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:48,650
we should always be able to question and
everything,

1968
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:49,484
but we should understand that we've got 
to make these things as tight so that 

1969
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,170
there's no visible daylight between us 
and our,

1970
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,004
our key allies that others because 
they're always looking for that day 

1971
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:00,750
light that others could play off of and,
and,

1972
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:03,620
and look to take advantage of.
So that's a,

1973
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:05,630
that's a 30,000
foot look at,

1974
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,370
um,
at the region.

1975
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:09,530
It's very disconcerting.
There are six going on,

1976
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:11,450
seven failed states in the Middle East 
right now.

1977
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,673
And every one of those poses in a sense 
of threat to Israel because what are 

1978
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:17,150
they,
the Libya,

1979
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,430
Iraq,
Afghanistan,

1980
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:24,470
Yemen,
Somalia has obviously done.

1981
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:28,730
And when you say by failed states for,
for the uninitiated,

1982
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,370
what you mean is they essentially don't 
have a real government.

1983
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:32,450
There's no real government.
Yeah,

1984
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:34,510
there's no,
there's no sense of control.

1985
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,110
We're talking about millions of people,
which,

1986
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:36,980
oh yeah,
yeah,

1987
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:37,730
yeah,
absolutely.

1988
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,840
Absolutely.
And I mean,

1989
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:41,120
Libya,
it doesn't get much in the press,

1990
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,013
um,
because the previous administration had 

1991
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:46,910
no interest in talking about it because 
they had pushed for,

1992
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:50,640
for the regime change in Libya.
And um,

1993
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,200
that was,
that was a disaster we had again,

1994
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,040
let's re.
Yeah,

1995
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,920
I don't want to re litigate Iraq or 
Afghanistan or anything else.

1996
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,350
Frankly,
I think it was a drastic mistake,

1997
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,700
but it goes back to what you were saying
earlier in revenue.

1998
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,553
Sorry,
what you were saying earlier was that 

1999
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,093
these,
this idea that we shouldn't be involved 

2000
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:09,223
in policing the world.
The real problem with that is when you 

2001
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:13,130
pull back,
you create this vacuum.

2002
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,040
When you remove leaders,
as brutal as they are,

2003
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:17,660
you create a vacuum.
Yeah.

2004
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,800
You know,
when it was horrible,

2005
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:21,050
Saddam Hussein is,
there was,

2006
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,973
it was almost better for those people 
when that guy was in power then having 

2007
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,350
what's going on right now,
which is essentially.

2008
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,620
I mean it's,
it sounds horrible to say so horrible to

2009
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:33,530
say something like that.
But in the same with Libya,

2010
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:34,670
same with Libya.
Absolutely.

2011
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,170
And the funny,
not funny,

2012
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,250
it's terrible.
Say that that way.

2013
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:41,540
But the strange thing about Libya was 
Gaddafi was working on our behalf in the

2014
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,870
world of counter terrorism for several 
years leading up to his being removed,

2015
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,570
the only folks that,
that were involved in that exercise,

2016
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:48,404
that really had national interests in 
Libya where the French and the Italians 

2017
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,513
and they somehow convinced the previous 
administration to get involved and that 

2018
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:56,464
it was a good idea.

2019
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,450
Um,
and now I mean like Libya has got what,

2020
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:00,284
a hundred and 30 some odd tribes.
It's even worse than a rock concert in 

2021
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,770
sense of sort of a fractured tribal 
environment.

2022
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,330
And uh,
it's,

2023
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:09,890
it's,
uh,

2024
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,060
it's,
it's a disaster.

2025
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,913
So what I mean by each failed stake 
potentially poses a threat to Israel is 

2026
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:19,730
that what you get is you get the sucking
a sound as,

2027
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,530
as all the air leaves the country.
And uh,

2028
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,453
it becomes chaos.
And Chaos is where a group like the 

2029
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:28,830
Islamic state or al Qaeda or vocal 
Harambe,

2030
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:31,170
that's where the extremists make their 
money.

2031
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,040
That's where they make their hay.
So they're,

2032
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,980
they gravitate to places like that.
It's,

2033
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:36,870
it's,
it's guaranteed.

2034
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:41,300
And you know,
so I don't know how,

2035
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,380
I'm just way above my pay grade when you
talk about,

2036
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,214
well,
what does president trump do now with 

2037
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:45,960
the Middle East?
Well,

2038
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:47,610
he,
he met with Madison,

2039
01:20:47,611 --> 01:20:48,444
he met with a bunch of folks over the 
Pentagon today and one of the things he 

2040
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:51,080
said is,
you know,

2041
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:51,913
uh,
we're going to take action and destroy 

2042
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:54,720
Islamic state.

2043
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,100
Well,
good luck with that.

2044
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,183
You know,
that's one of those things where it's a 

2045
01:20:57,661 --> 01:21:01,080
nice sound bite,
but nobody should actually think that if

2046
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:05,160
we somehow rid Iraq and Syria,
the Islamic state,

2047
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,950
that we've solved the problem and 
creating another vacuum.

2048
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,813
Yeah.
And then someone else would come in and 

2049
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:09,860
fill it.
Yeah.

2050
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:10,693
I mean,
how do you take a place like that and 

2051
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:13,740
turn it into a democracy?
That's the real question,

2052
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:14,191
right?
Yeah.

2053
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:18,780
I don't think you'd do it too much.
Deeply ingrained behavior.

2054
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,730
Yeah.
Let me think about what it took for our,

2055
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:21,990
for our nation,
right?

2056
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:23,310
I think,
and we kind of want to every.

2057
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,144
We got short attention span,
so we just want everything to happen in 

2058
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:27,090
an accelerated fashion.
We had to leave.

2059
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:30,750
We're going to have all democracy in 
Iraq or something.

2060
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,723
They,
Afghans still don't have a clue what we 

2061
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:33,474
were trying to sell them.

2062
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,403
They don't have a fucking clue.
And a guy that worked for me when I 

2063
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:40,710
started the business of business,
been up and running for about a year and

2064
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:41,550
I had,
I had a Russian,

2065
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,470
uh,
working on staff,

2066
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,830
a very interesting cat was a former,
a gru,

2067
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,860
military intelligence,
and it had been a tank driver and he had

2068
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:51,810
been out in Afghanistan during the 
Soviet occupation,

2069
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,820
uh,
was still carrying some,

2070
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:57,750
some shrapnel around for that.
And when we went into Tora Bora,

2071
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:58,943
he,
uh,

2072
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,353
I remember he came up to me,
it was visibly shaken and he said that 

2073
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,440
was brilliant,
really brilliant,

2074
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:06,750
but don't stay sister,
like cockroaches,

2075
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:10,480
step on them over here and they come up 
over here and you fucking step on it.

2076
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,540
And he was really literally,
you can tell this guy just was,

2077
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:13,440
you know,
he was,

2078
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,860
he was starting to go off and he was 
absolutely correct.

2079
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,260
We should have gone in there and did our
tactical mission,

2080
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:20,550
which were very,
very good at.

2081
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,833
And then left,
but we were feeling the pangs of guilt 

2082
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,670
from having left previously after we had
that operation to get the Soviets out of

2083
01:22:29,671 --> 01:22:32,220
there.
And by the way,

2084
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,670
you know,
I,

2085
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,663
I'm one of those who are happy to admit 
that maybe if you sell shoulder fired 

2086
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:41,430
weapons systems to,
you know,

2087
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,773
a bunch of folks in Afghanistan at some 
point it's going to have to be a bad 

2088
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:46,620
idea.
So you have to go back and buy him back.

2089
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,480
Yeah,
that was a piece of work.

2090
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:49,314
But Anyway,
point being is we should have left at 

2091
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:51,924
that point.
But we were feeling guilty about having 

2092
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:54,750
left before and the idea was like,
Oh,

2093
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:59,370
if we just stayed than al Qaeda wouldn't
have found a home base in Afghanistan.

2094
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:00,204
And who knows what we might've prevented
and the honest to God's truth as they 

2095
01:23:03,131 --> 01:23:04,740
able to found a home base someplace 
else.

2096
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:05,980
And we would have just been sitting

2097
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,100
in Afghanistan for another 25 years.
Right.

2098
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,180
The leading up to now.
So anyway.

2099
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,103
Um,
I think that's one of the most 

2100
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,280
frustrating things about international 
conflict when,

2101
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,123
when people start thinking about it,
especially people like me that have 

2102
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:20,200
nothing to do with it.
You look on the outside and you go,

2103
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:22,850
how does this ever get resolved?
How does this ever get fit?

2104
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,880
Does it ever get fixed?
I mean,

2105
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:26,770
is it even possible?
I don't think.

2106
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:28,270
I mean,
it's not going to end.

2107
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:29,740
I mean,
when I say it,

2108
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,900
I guess I'm referring to Muslim 
extremism,

2109
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,850
jihadism,
whatever you wanna call it.

2110
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,500
Um,
now it's not in our lifetime.

2111
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:37,690
No,
not in our lifetimes.

2112
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,570
And it's got to be on several levels.
So I'm not saying,

2113
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:42,220
you know,
you know,

2114
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,230
there's that old saying you can't kill 
your way out of it,

2115
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:45,064
but you know,
it doesn't mean you can't make a good 

2116
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:50,170
faith effort and that,
but at the same time,

2117
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:51,670
but you have to work at,
on other levels,

2118
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:52,430
right?
You have to do,

2119
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:56,470
it's a meme right there.
We can,

2120
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:59,830
we just remove that as well as my 
spoiler on the house of cards.

2121
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,940
Who would have imagined that shows up 20
years old,

2122
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:06,000
I would've thought you'd seen,
goddammit.

2123
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:07,303
I just started a couple of months ago.
I'm only on season two anyway with the 

2124
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:13,020
uh,
the.

2125
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,730
Yeah,
so the,

2126
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:14,563
the um,
I forget where I was going with that 

2127
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,800
weed killing your way out.
Oh yeah.

2128
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:19,090
But you have to work on other levels 
too.

2129
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,050
So you've got to fill.
Yeah,

2130
01:24:20,051 --> 01:24:20,501
yeah,
of course.

2131
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:22,430
You got to work with community.
So like we got to.

2132
01:24:22,431 --> 01:24:23,264
It's a huge lift and the local and the 
state and the federal authorities here 

2133
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:27,004
in the US are actually spending a lot of
time trying to build some level of 

2134
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:34,600
communication and trust with the Muslim 
communities here in this country because

2135
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,100
at the end of the day,
uh,

2136
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:39,880
if you just want to talk about somebody 
popping off and doing something horrible

2137
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:41,830
here in our country,
again,

2138
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:44,680
the old concept of the lone wolf attack,
whatever you want to call it,

2139
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,013
um,
your real only chance of identifying 

2140
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:52,560
that individual because they're not 
coming up on comms and they're not,

2141
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:54,320
you know,
it's not on the radar already.

2142
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,350
They're not associating unless they do.
Maybe they do,

2143
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:57,184
but usually they're not associating with
known targets and so your best bet is a 

2144
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:05,530
mom or dad or a brother or sister 
picking up the phone and saying,

2145
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,720
I'm worried about,
uh,

2146
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,750
you know,
whomever,

2147
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,793
and I think that's probably more likely 
to happen now after San Bernardino when 

2148
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:12,784
that San Bernardino attack and there was
a lot of people that knew those folks 

2149
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:18,310
were really into guns and St Louis a 
bunch of crazy shit,

2150
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:21,070
but they just wouldn't let me just get 
outta here and nothing's going to happen

2151
01:25:21,071 --> 01:25:21,904
from this.
Let me just leave these fucking ruins 

2152
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,060
alone.
And then they wound up,

2153
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:26,383
you know,
because I also don't want to beat your 

2154
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:27,694
folks,
although,

2155
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:31,660
you know,
a wonderful new word.

2156
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:32,523
Now I'm a fit.
They also use to people who have left 

2157
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,680
Islam,
which is hilarious.

2158
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,570
Really high end.
Hirsi Ali,

2159
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:39,730
they call her Islamophobe.
Yeah.

2160
01:25:39,731 --> 01:25:43,480
I didn't know she had female genital 
mutilation when she was a baby.

2161
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:44,314
They cut her clitoris off.
She's lived under that oppressive 

2162
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:47,584
regime.
She risked her life to get outta there 

2163
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:49,893
should we risked her life to come to the
United States and they still call her 

2164
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,580
and Islamophobia for anyone that said,
I mean,

2165
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:55,930
this is like,
it's fashionable.

2166
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:57,003
Anyone says anything critical about 
Islam by becoming an Islamophobia or a 

2167
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:01,600
bigot,
you're a bigot.

2168
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,261
And then it's like,
yeah,

2169
01:26:02,261 --> 01:26:03,094
you're.
Yeah.

2170
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,123
Somehow it's

2171
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:04,961
A.
Yeah.

2172
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:06,410
I'm not even sure how we got to that 
point.

2173
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,150
But um,
well it's the left,

2174
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:09,020
you know,
people go,

2175
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,120
I mean,
it's just like the far left gets nutty.

2176
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:14,510
The far right gets nutty,
far reaches of any ideologies.

2177
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:15,620
They all,
you know,

2178
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,000
they,
they're blinded,

2179
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,853
you're blinded by their beliefs and they
are supported by other people who were 

2180
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:24,340
equally blinded.
And you're,

2181
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,233
you're right on the far edges is where 
the zealots tend to reside for either 

2182
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:31,850
side.
And so the friend fringe.

2183
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:33,140
Yeah,
I think we just came up with that.

2184
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,910
I think we can develop that theory 
really have been around for a while.

2185
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:40,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2186
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:42,170
You're learning a lot of new stuff here 
folks.

2187
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:43,540
Um,
but it's when you,

2188
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,280
when you talk,
when you have this,

2189
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,200
you know,
you have a,

2190
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,530
a,
just a massive amount of experience when

2191
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:49,364
it comes to foreign relations and when 
you're talking about the almost like 

2192
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,220
hopelessness of creating peace on earth,
you know,

2193
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,770
like that,
that concept has always been.

2194
01:26:57,771 --> 01:27:00,620
Everyone's always wanted peace on earth.
We all want,

2195
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:01,563
right?
But when you talk about the Middle East 

2196
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:04,870
and he talk about a hopeless that is,
and then you go back to like the fucking

2197
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,190
Carter administration,
you go back previous to that.

2198
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:09,500
I mean it seems like it's always been a 
mess.

2199
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,220
Yeah.
No.

2200
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,490
And it's,
you know,

2201
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:13,324
when you look at,
when you look at the relations that 

2202
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:17,980
these countries have amongst themselves,
it's pretty fucked up.

2203
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:19,320
And then you think about,
you know,

2204
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:22,060
our relationship,
our efforts with them and that's a whole

2205
01:27:22,061 --> 01:27:23,590
different level.
But there's,

2206
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:25,310
there's a,
I don't want to say it's,

2207
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:28,030
it's never possible that's too 
pessimistic,

2208
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,013
but from a pragmatic point of view,
I think we just have to be realistic in 

2209
01:27:33,491 --> 01:27:37,610
our foreign policy and we have to do 
what we can to create allies to do,

2210
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,753
do our best,
always acting in our own best interest 

2211
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:45,040
and just get away from this concept that
we're somehow,

2212
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:48,670
it's a community of nations all working 
together for the good of the world.

2213
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,610
Um,
some groups do,

2214
01:27:51,611 --> 01:27:52,444
like I said,
you can have your allies and that's a 

2215
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:56,230
great thing and we should always look to
promote that.

2216
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,930
And uh,
but you know,

2217
01:27:58,931 --> 01:27:59,764
ultimately I think we're the only nation
sometimes it seems that apologizes when 

2218
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:03,664
we act in our own best interest,
we almost feel like it's unseemly or 

2219
01:28:06,191 --> 01:28:08,350
it's not the right thing to do,
or Jesus or whatever.

2220
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:12,070
That's bullshit.
Every other nation out there,

2221
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,820
including our allies at closeouts,
they look at it first and foremost,

2222
01:28:15,821 --> 01:28:19,570
how does this benefit me?
How does this benefit our country?

2223
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:24,220
And if you just assume that's a 
principle in dealing in foreign policy,

2224
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,443
and then you also assume that another 
principle is that nothing is 

2225
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,120
unconnected,
you know,

2226
01:28:28,121 --> 01:28:28,930
everything's,
you know,

2227
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,763
nothing happens in a bubble.
Then with those two things as guiding 

2228
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,043
principles,
you gotta start to creating a foreign 

2229
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,820
policy that makes some sense,
you know,

2230
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,610
and is beneficial.
Again,

2231
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:40,151
the,
you know,

2232
01:28:40,151 --> 01:28:40,561
the,
the,

2233
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:41,394
the difficulty is in,
at what point do you exert your 

2234
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:43,984
influence?
At what point do you decide to be the 

2235
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:45,970
police person,
you know,

2236
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:46,300
but

2237
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,133
it's not just evidence placement.
The good man I conversation about 

2238
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,983
Bradley team.
You've met Chelsea if you turned it 

2239
01:28:52,091 --> 01:28:54,520
around,
but don't you think that that's evidence

2240
01:28:54,521 --> 01:28:55,480
of the fact that,
oh,

2241
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:56,314
it's because of the fact that we are 
essentially the premier superpower in 

2242
01:28:59,741 --> 01:29:00,461
the world.
And there's.

2243
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:04,830
Everyone else is a very distant second.
So it's Kinda like where the big boss we

2244
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:06,300
kind of have to go,
well,

2245
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:09,120
you know,
we probably shouldn't be doing that.

2246
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:09,973
And yeah,

2247
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,940
it is tough because you,
again,

2248
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:16,330
I agree with those people to say we 
can't be policing everywhere.

2249
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,040
You're talking about China and it's a 
good industry.

2250
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,380
It's a.
When you say were the lone superpower,

2251
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,281
you know,
some people would say,

2252
01:29:21,281 --> 01:29:22,150
well,
what about China?

2253
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:23,800
And uh oh,
it just said it.

2254
01:29:23,801 --> 01:29:28,720
Like president trump does China.
Then part of China's problem is,

2255
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,330
well they've got several,
but one is that their economy,

2256
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:32,443
you.
This idea that somehow they were going 

2257
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:33,924
to rise to the top of the heap in the 
world because of their economy I think 

2258
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:39,640
has always been flawed.
There's a lot of.

2259
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:40,503
We spend a lot of.
My company spends a fair amount of time 

2260
01:29:41,711 --> 01:29:42,544
looking at Chinese companies on behalf 
of financial institutions and others 

2261
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,590
from outside of China.
There's a lot of smoke and mirrors,

2262
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:51,190
a lot of bad paper.
They're floating around.

2263
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,053
They've got some problems,
really shaky problems in their 

2264
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:54,634
infrastructure and their economy and 
tied to that as a problem that if they 

2265
01:29:58,061 --> 01:29:58,894
can't manage the slow down if they can 
and if they can't manage and it's not 

2266
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,690
good for us either,
so we have to hope that they do.

2267
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:05,524
But if they can't manage a slowdown and 
part of that is in their economy and 

2268
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:08,974
part of that is,
is managing or putting a damper on 

2269
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:14,590
people's expectations,
you know,

2270
01:30:14,591 --> 01:30:17,200
they've kind of gotten away for some 
time now with people thinking,

2271
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:20,020
I'm rising up,
I'm coming up out of the poverty class,

2272
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:21,720
I'm getting up to the middleclass.
I can be real close.

2273
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,350
Well,
there's only so far in that economy,

2274
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,690
they're going to go and they've hit that
ceiling basically.

2275
01:30:25,691 --> 01:30:26,524
So they've got it.
There's a lot of discontent in a sense 

2276
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:30,240
and a lot of,
a lot of problems that they're,

2277
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,273
they're trying right now to mask.
I don't know whether they're gonna be 

2278
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:34,750
able to do it,
but we should all hope that,

2279
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,120
that they're somewhat successful.
Since again,

2280
01:30:37,121 --> 01:30:39,130
nothing happens in a bubble and we're 
connected.

2281
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:41,950
So if they have significant problems,
so you can be issues.

2282
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,800
But um,
and so I've never been,

2283
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:45,441
you know,
when people say,

2284
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:46,274
well,
what about trying to try and sort of a 

2285
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,270
rising superpower along with us?
Well,

2286
01:30:49,271 --> 01:30:50,380
yeah,
militarily,

2287
01:30:50,381 --> 01:30:51,400
I mean it,
you know,

2288
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,700
but we're still way ahead.
We're still well ahead.

2289
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,130
They're doing it like a mutually assured
destruction ahead thing.

2290
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:01,980
I mean,
we were all fucked if we go to war.

2291
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,830
I mean if we really have a world war 
that involves nuclear weapons,

2292
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,530
the whole planet.
Fuck yeah.

2293
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:08,320
Yeah.
Except for right.

2294
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:09,893
Come on up.
So it's kind of weird though that it's 

2295
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:12,834
like,
that mean we are the big super power as 

2296
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:16,284
long as none of these people like are 
ran or Pakistan or anybody who has 

2297
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:21,420
nuclear weapons,
as long as they don't launch anything,

2298
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:23,610
as soon as they launched everything,
we're all fucked.

2299
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,250
So we gotta kind of keep everybody from 
launching everything.

2300
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,940
Well,
and that's really what,

2301
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:29,833
where the crisis is.
The crisis isn't with us and Russia 

2302
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:35,330
going to war us in China going to war,
is that the crisis is,

2303
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,253
is,
is a smaller a nation with a nuclear 

2304
01:31:41,631 --> 01:31:44,630
weapons.
I'm losing it's shit for doing something

2305
01:31:44,631 --> 01:31:48,620
stupid or some of those materials 
falling into the wrong hands.

2306
01:31:48,621 --> 01:31:51,890
Those two scenarios are still the ones 
that are most worrisome.

2307
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,350
When you look at a country like,
uh,

2308
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,860
I hate to say this,
you look at a country like Pakistan that

2309
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:56,763
I was just going to bring them up.
I mean if Pakistan didn't have nuclear 

2310
01:31:58,521 --> 01:32:00,250
weapons,
we would not

2311
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,650
really be all that interested in 
Pakistan,

2312
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,600
a sketchy place.
And you know,

2313
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:06,670
Shane Smith was telling me about Jane 
Smith,

2314
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:07,504
the head of vice was telling me,
but what does that one city in Pakistan 

2315
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:11,644
that he was talking about that he said 
is essentially the most dangerous spot 

2316
01:32:14,801 --> 01:32:15,910
on earth.
He's like,

2317
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:18,210
there are so many murders created in the
city.

2318
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,640
Then you can [inaudible] you was,
he told them.

2319
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:20,474
I think that's exactly what it was.
It was just saying it's an insanely 

2320
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:24,860
dangerous murderous place.
Yeah.

2321
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:25,990
Yeah.
It's,

2322
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,100
it's,
it's A.

2323
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,560
Although there are parts of Pakistan 
that have beautiful.

2324
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:30,943
Yeah.
And parts of Elo hell are probably nice 

2325
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:37,510
to a nice spot outside of the lava side 
for the lava.

2326
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,980
Um,
but it's.

2327
01:32:38,981 --> 01:32:41,170
Yeah.
So I think it's those,

2328
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:44,560
it's those places like Pakistan that 
really have Iran.

2329
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:48,730
They continue their march.
This idea that somehow that at agreement

2330
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:50,420
stop them from developing that,
you know,

2331
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,810
even though even the previous 
administration couldn't keep that,

2332
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:53,980
you know,
she'll up any.

2333
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,900
Are you worried about Iran?
Yeah.

2334
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:56,860
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

2335
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,210
Absolutely.
In the sense that,

2336
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:01,000
um,
again they're continuing their,

2337
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:04,270
they're testing their ballistic systems.
They're obviously,

2338
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:05,104
I think they're still continuing 
spinning centrifuges and we don't know 

2339
01:33:07,691 --> 01:33:09,490
about it.
They've got a lot of hot women though.

2340
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,091
They.
Yeah.

2341
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:12,280
Well there is at so that.
Yeah,

2342
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,050
it was hot Persian broads to come over 
here.

2343
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:15,641
Man.
Persians.

2344
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:18,780
Yeah.
There's some other bodies like the,

2345
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,170
they,
they make them good.

2346
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,200
Yeah.
Well,

2347
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,900
stout genetics.
Yeah.

2348
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:24,030
It's uh,
it,

2349
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,240
it is.
Yeah,

2350
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:25,821
it is.
It's,

2351
01:33:25,821 --> 01:33:27,640
it's how do,
how do you account for that?

2352
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:30,550
You're a dangerous nuclear power,
but you've got these really hot women so

2353
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:32,500
we have put the two of them together and
make something happen.

2354
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:35,410
Yeah,
no.

2355
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,620
There was something like Bill Clinton 
make it happen.

2356
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,800
There was something that was going on.
We're a.

2357
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:42,663
trump was really like openly criticized 
for saying that he wants to put America 

2358
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:47,090
first.

2359
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:49,360
You know,
I thought that was so strange and people

2360
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:50,194
were saying it like it was one of the 
most horrible things a president has 

2361
01:33:52,691 --> 01:33:55,390
ever said ever.
I got so confused by that.

2362
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:56,493
I'm like,
isn't that what every country says all 

2363
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,013
over the world?
So you want them to put America second 

2364
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,980
somewhere in the top five?
Yeah.

2365
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,110
Yeah.
Sixth.

2366
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,093
Is that like really being a altruistic,
like what does that mean by someone 

2367
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:13,000
being upset that he wants to put America
first?

2368
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:13,420
I mean,
if,

2369
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,870
if there's bad treaties,
if there's bad agreements,

2370
01:34:16,871 --> 01:34:17,704
if there's,
if there's anything that doesn't favor 

2371
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:20,284
us or our economy or our safety,
why wouldn't you want them to put 

2372
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:26,620
America first?
That's really weird.

2373
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:27,483
Here's where I think we are with that.
Maybe I'm completely wrong on this 

2374
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:30,304
theory,
but if Donald Trump was any other 

2375
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:33,123
ethnicity been saying,
America first would not be construed as 

2376
01:34:36,311 --> 01:34:37,630
racist.
I think people,

2377
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:40,390
I think the far left construes it is 
racist because he's a white guy,

2378
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:43,060
right?
So everything through race,

2379
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,400
they view everything through race.
As far as I'm concerned.

2380
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:46,443
You think of Obama said that they would 
think he's being conciliatory to the 

2381
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:49,264
ride and you know,
that he's like trying to drum up paper 

2382
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:55,150
patriotism or say look at he's trying to
fire up the economy.

2383
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,500
It's all about jobs.
I just don't think it would be,

2384
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:58,334
you know,

2385
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,320
I just don't think it would have the 
same impact.

2386
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:03,290
And I think if Hillary Clinton said it,
I think she would get a pass,

2387
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,090
but I think you're right there.
So you know,

2388
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:07,603
some crazy shit about Russia that we 
should be able to respond militarily to 

2389
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,610
the cyber attacks.
I was like,

2390
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:14,773
you really can't say shit like that.
And apparently what was sad was that 

2391
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:21,680
they had said to the Russian people they
were in contact with,

2392
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:23,570
look,
this is all just rhetoric to worry about

2393
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:24,500
it,
but yeah,

2394
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,483
that's what I was reading.
I don't know if that's really how it 

2395
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:28,330
goes down.
No,

2396
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:28,910
it's,
it's,

2397
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:33,140
it's pretty crazy shit when you start 
trying to imagine what's that line where

2398
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:34,243
another nation engages in some sort of 
cyber shenanigans and we're gonna 

2399
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,273
respond militarily.
The Pentagon is still trying to figure 

2400
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:40,004
that out.
One guy has been working on this for 

2401
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,950
some time,
it's don't try and draw this her,

2402
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,130
so they haven't done it either.

2403
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,060
But the idea of what are your protocols 
for,

2404
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:49,490
for a cybersecurity,
for cyber attacks,

2405
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:51,270
cyber warfare,
uh,

2406
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,560
they're still trying to figure that out 
because it's so freaking difficult.

2407
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:56,210
But think about in this particular 
instance,

2408
01:35:56,211 --> 01:35:58,820
what we're talking about is not really 
cyber warfare.

2409
01:35:58,821 --> 01:36:00,950
It's someone getting a hold of some 
emails.

2410
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,870
So you read my emails,
I'm going to launch a bomb at you.

2411
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,960
It would have to be,
I'm hoping,

2412
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,450
I would think threshold will be higher 
than that,

2413
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,513
but it taking down infrastructure,
but if you want to look at it from a 

2414
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:13,850
simplistic point of view,
I mean,

2415
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:15,770
that's really what they're saying.
Yeah,

2416
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:16,440
yeah.
Yeah.

2417
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,810
And,
and that's where you're right,

2418
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:18,644
the rhetorics got and you can't do that.
You can engage in that sort of 

2419
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:22,710
conversation or you know,
uh,

2420
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,060
that's why I would like to think that 
the new president would have,

2421
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,850
you know,
or start to have more.

2422
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,683
And I think it may be happening more 
discipline and sort of the messaging 

2423
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,290
because you got to,
you can't,

2424
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,420
you can't say shit out there anymore.
Well,

2425
01:36:35,421 --> 01:36:36,254
that was driving me crazy because I 
would tell that to my friends who were 

2426
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:39,780
Hillary supporters and they,
you know,

2427
01:36:39,781 --> 01:36:41,330
they would try to ignore it.
I go,

2428
01:36:41,331 --> 01:36:44,740
how can you ignore that?
That is a fucking crazy statement if you

2429
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,583
have my email,
so I'm going to launch the military at 

2430
01:36:47,451 --> 01:36:48,370
you.
But it,

2431
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,393
there's still confusion.
Even if you think about there was a 

2432
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:55,040
cyber attack by a nation state,
a against our electrical grid,

2433
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,540
for instance,
took down the,

2434
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:57,383
the.
There's only three grids in this 

2435
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,180
country,
east West in Texas.

2436
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:01,610
So they took down the east grid.
Think of anything.

2437
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:02,803
Now,
if it's a serious and coordinated in a 

2438
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:09,830
sophisticated attack,
you may be down for three,

2439
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:10,491
four,
five,

2440
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:11,324
six weeks,
seven weeks could be longer because we 

2441
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:15,920
don't manufacture a lot of that,
that gear for the system anymore.

2442
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:16,753
Here in this country we're in,
we're putting lipstick on a pig for the 

2443
01:37:20,441 --> 01:37:23,510
most of the patchwork quilt of the,
of the power grid.

2444
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,090
And so it's a,
it's a fairly frail thing anyway,

2445
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,840
but if they take that down,
then you think to yourself,

2446
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:31,190
well,
how do we respond to,

2447
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,460
we do the same to the,
the,

2448
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:35,390
the attacking nation that engaged in 
that.

2449
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:38,990
Do we respond militarily?
And that's where the,

2450
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,980
you know,
again,

2451
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:42,050
the Pentagon,
it's been sitting there trying to figure

2452
01:37:42,051 --> 01:37:43,160
out how,
what do we do,

2453
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,050
what are the protocols,
what are the responses,

2454
01:37:45,051 --> 01:37:48,560
what's the,
what line do we need to see before we.

2455
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:49,663
So,
you know,

2456
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:52,200
this is a,
it's a whole different world and this is

2457
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:55,650
something to really pay attention to it.
Because going forward when talk about,

2458
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:56,011
well,
you know,

2459
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:58,890
maybe something happens and you get 
people starting to launch nukes.

2460
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,480
Yeah,
maybe again,

2461
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:01,314
you get some crazy as a leader of a 
small nation that decides to do 

2462
01:38:04,771 --> 01:38:06,540
something or they get overrun and you 
know,

2463
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:07,980
it falls into bad hands,
whatever.

2464
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,630
But more likely than not,
what's going to happen is something that

2465
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:17,631
spins out of Control in cyberspace.
And because we either,

2466
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,073
you know,
we overreact or we under react and then 

2467
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:23,730
we were playing catch,
I dunno.

2468
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:24,663
Yeah.
Just a constant game of arbitration and 

2469
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:32,670
coordinated communication and trying to 
soothe things out,

2470
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,740
keep things from getting too crazy,

2471
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,280
which is why,
again,

2472
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:38,850
I sometimes make fun of diplomacy,
but diplomacy is very,

2473
01:38:38,851 --> 01:38:39,684
very important.
So you've got to have those 

2474
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:42,030
communication channels open all the 
time.

2475
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,820
People have to be talking,
you know,

2476
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,490
the,
you know,

2477
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,290
Intel services talk to each other all 
the time.

2478
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,124
Even when you know two countries or even
when us in another country going at it 

2479
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:50,650
in the media,
you know,

2480
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,010
or we're really,
yeah,

2481
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:54,660
the Intel services tend to be at working
together,

2482
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,673
keeping that line of communication 
because they know it's pretty serious 

2483
01:38:57,511 --> 01:38:58,344
shit.
You got to do that and things can get 

2484
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,140
sideways really,
really fast out there.

2485
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,620
And so,
you know,

2486
01:39:02,621 --> 01:39:03,800
you got to hope that the,
you know,

2487
01:39:03,801 --> 01:39:06,300
the conversations continue and we've got
good people.

2488
01:39:06,301 --> 01:39:10,980
I look at the new administration sort of
second and third tier folks,

2489
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:12,630
you know,
were crap actually gets done,

2490
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:13,523
you know,
not the cabinet level or anything but 

2491
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,320
the down second,
third tier.

2492
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:19,590
And they brought in some,
some good pragmatic people.

2493
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:21,330
They've got some smart folks.
They understand.

2494
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:25,890
I think the way the world works,
they're measured in their response.

2495
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:27,360
Now,
does any of that matter?

2496
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:28,860
You know,
because the president is,

2497
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:29,491
you know,
can be,

2498
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:30,900
you know,
Tommy Lewis County.

2499
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:32,550
Yeah.
He's his own guy and all he's gonna make

2500
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:34,920
his own decision or if you're like,
who knows,

2501
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:35,730
I,
you know,

2502
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:36,650
I,
you know this,

2503
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:39,720
this caught everybody by surprise.
So didn't really.

2504
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,240
No one saw it coming.
Maybe there were a handful of people.

2505
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:44,430
I think there were four,
four people in the entire country.

2506
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,380
Uh,
but yeah,

2507
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:47,400
I mean,
anybody else who said,

2508
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:48,690
yeah,
I knew this was going to happen.

2509
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:49,524
They're just blowing smoke up your ass.
I don't think there were very small 

2510
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:53,580
number of people.
I guess that actually saw it.

2511
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:56,010
This was developing and what's going to 
happen now.

2512
01:39:56,011 --> 01:39:58,200
I had friends that jumped on the trump 
train early,

2513
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,450
really early back in when you thought,
wow,

2514
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,610
you're what you're doing what?
Um,

2515
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:04,610
but I think,
you know,

2516
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:08,520
did they see something or were they just
looking for a campaign they could ride?

2517
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,170
I don't know.
You know,

2518
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:12,020
that is part of the problem.
Right,

2519
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:12,511
right,
right.

2520
01:40:12,511 --> 01:40:12,781
Yeah,
yeah.

2521
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:14,120
Everybody's looking for a job in,
in,

2522
01:40:14,121 --> 01:40:14,570
in,
in,

2523
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,260
in a sense.

2524
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,093
Well,
there's also,

2525
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,810
I don't know if you've noticed this 
online,

2526
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:22,870
but there's a bunch of weird sort of now
now very obvious right wing guys,

2527
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:29,650
but people that were just sort of a 
online commentators or they would have a

2528
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:30,644
blog or a little of this or that,
and then when it kind of became a 

2529
01:40:34,251 --> 01:40:37,070
movement,
this trump thing became a movement.

2530
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,233
All of their stuff got really pro trump 
and they started using words like cock 

2531
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,333
column,
People Cox and like and fallen into 

2532
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:46,160
this,
this,

2533
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:46,993
these camps where you're just seeing 
these tribal sort of behavior patterns 

2534
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,123
play out.

2535
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:52,820
Yeah,
yeah.

2536
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,710
No,
absolutely.

2537
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,950
And some of that is because you know,
you again,

2538
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:58,300
you've got people that are thinking,
okay,

2539
01:40:58,301 --> 01:40:59,350
look,
this could actually happen.

2540
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,900
Would like a job.
I'd like to be on the winning side.

2541
01:41:01,901 --> 01:41:02,734
I like to jump on the team.
I'd like to be one of the people 

2542
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:07,660
considered as an ally instead of an 
enemy.

2543
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,330
And I find that that's the way the game 
works.

2544
01:41:10,331 --> 01:41:12,220
I guess our though it's bizarre to 
watch.

2545
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,061
Yeah,
I mean,

2546
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:13,631
I,
I,

2547
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:14,464
uh,

2548
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:19,660
early on I signed onto a national 
security letter with some other folks,

2549
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,960
basically said that,
you know,

2550
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,860
we didn't believe that a Donald Trump,
now president trump,

2551
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,990
uh,
was the right candidate for,

2552
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:27,940
from a national security perspective.
Right.

2553
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:30,420
And,
um,

2554
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,150
uh,
you know,

2555
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:32,940
I took some heat for that,
um,

2556
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,813
but some of those folks are now looking 
for jobs in the administration and I 

2557
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:37,600
think,
I don't get it,

2558
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:40,420
what did you.
But I will say this much,

2559
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,790
I once,
you know,

2560
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,400
once the person wins,
and this is maybe where,

2561
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,060
you know,
I,

2562
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,090
I have a hard time understanding some of
the angst that's out there.

2563
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:56,080
Once the president gets in,
you've got a duty to,

2564
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,840
you know,
work and make the country,

2565
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,430
you know,
go forward and work.

2566
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,293
And so I've got no problem supporting 
the administration in the sense that I 

2567
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:04,480
want them to do well.

2568
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:07,030
And I don't think there's anything in 
Congress with that and in the sense that

2569
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:07,860
I,
yeah,

2570
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,280
it wasn't my candidate,
you know,

2571
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,100
I'm fine,
but now that he's in,

2572
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,490
I want this place to do well and so I 
want this administration to do well.

2573
01:42:15,491 --> 01:42:16,324
I'm,
I'm glad that they've got good people 

2574
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:18,700
coming in.
Um,

2575
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,863
but you know,
I still say there's gonna be things and 

2576
01:42:22,741 --> 01:42:23,650
he's going to do that.
I'm going to say,

2577
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:24,221
yeah,
it's great,

2578
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,150
good,
excellent.

2579
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:26,490
And there's going to be things he 
doesn't know.

2580
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:29,140
What the hell is that?
And I,

2581
01:42:29,141 --> 01:42:29,974
you know,
if you can't be in that position and 

2582
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:35,410
you've always got to be all onboard or 
all against,

2583
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:36,910
I don't see how people live

2584
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:39,000
that way and that's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.

2585
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,133
Do you think it's possible that he could
pull this off and he could be a good 

2586
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:43,164
president and he could listen to the 
advice of the people that actually know 

2587
01:42:45,151 --> 01:42:47,580
how the world works and stay off 
twitter?

2588
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,370
I don't think it's possible to stay off 
twitter.

2589
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,500
I don't think it's,
it's like that old scorpion right on the

2590
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:55,740
back of the tweets with sad anymore.
Sad.

2591
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,900
He can't say that anymore.
It's got to stop that.

2592
01:42:57,901 --> 01:43:00,270
I can't just say sad.
I don't think that shit's going to end.

2593
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:01,253
But could you surprise people?
Could good things happen as a result of 

2594
01:43:03,901 --> 01:43:05,830
a change in administrations?
Uh,

2595
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:07,070
could the economy,
you know,

2596
01:43:07,071 --> 01:43:08,940
it gets see a bump.
Could we?

2597
01:43:08,941 --> 01:43:09,601
Yeah,
sure.

2598
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:10,770
Of course.
I hope it happens.

2599
01:43:10,771 --> 01:43:12,290
I really do hope it happens.
I'm really whole.

2600
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:15,360
P really does commit to rebuilding the 
infrastructure,

2601
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:16,453
you know,
that's what I think could get a lot of 

2602
01:43:17,761 --> 01:43:20,190
great jobs and would do a lot of good 
for us.

2603
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:21,001
Yeah,
I know,

2604
01:43:21,001 --> 01:43:21,834
I agree.
A hundred percent.

2605
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,371
Yeah.
Roads,

2606
01:43:23,371 --> 01:43:25,880
bridges,
pipes,

2607
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,030
water pipes.
Um,

2608
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,953
I think that there's,

2609
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,990
and I,
if he goes in that direction,

2610
01:43:30,991 --> 01:43:32,950
if we see that now again,
you got people questioning that,

2611
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,290
you know,
sort of the spending.

2612
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,570
Um,
so,

2613
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,200
you know,
the jury's out on and um,

2614
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:41,550
you know,
what they do with taxes,

2615
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,960
it seems like they're going to go in a 
decent direction on the,

2616
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:46,890
on the taxes.
But yeah,

2617
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:48,270
I,
I think it could.

2618
01:43:48,271 --> 01:43:49,104
I think it could surprise people because
I think what are missing is they see 

2619
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:54,530
chaos.
I see a lot of chaos,

2620
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:59,360
but you could also argue it's,
it's actually a beneficial thing to have

2621
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,194
a lot of people talking at you,
taking a light because they do seem 

2622
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:03,890
willing to listen to a lot of different 
people.

2623
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,510
Right?
At least early stage.

2624
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:06,880
I realized I could change or maybe you 
know,

2625
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:07,933
and I don't wanna make too much of it,
but they do seem like there's a lot of 

2626
01:44:10,671 --> 01:44:12,980
different voices that are being dragged 
in and saying,

2627
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:13,910
what do you think about this?

2628
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:15,980
What do you think about that?
Now he's going to make his own decision,

2629
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,620
but we get lost.
We don't see those things happen.

2630
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,513
You know,
it's like the discussions that they've 

2631
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:22,630
already started about how do we re,
uh,

2632
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,490
align the Intel community so that it's 
more efficient,

2633
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,170
more effective.
That's a good conversation to have.

2634
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:30,370
But we don't see that because people get
lost in the tweets and they get lost in,

2635
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,450
you know,
the various headline of the day,

2636
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:34,410
the cult of personality.
And there is.

2637
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,420
And there is,
to be fair,

2638
01:44:35,421 --> 01:44:38,540
there's a media out there that wants him
to fail as soon as possible.

2639
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,433
I mean they were just hoping that he 
wants to think that is because he's 

2640
01:44:41,271 --> 01:44:43,700
criticizing them because he's openly 
going into the war with them.

2641
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:46,100
Sure.
I guess that's it.

2642
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:48,050
And also,
you know what I mean.

2643
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:49,100
Let's be fair.
This is not,

2644
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:50,990
I'm not saying anything that people are 
going to be shocked by,

2645
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,360
but you know,
that this was not.

2646
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:57,860
Their candidate never would be the e 
stands for everything they don't like.

2647
01:44:58,490 --> 01:44:59,290
It's a very,
you know,

2648
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:01,430
a part of the media is very insular 
obviously.

2649
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:02,264
Again,
this is all stuff that people know so 

2650
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:06,770
it's no surprise,
but there's a large portion of the media

2651
01:45:06,771 --> 01:45:07,604
out there that really wants him to fail 
and they're actively working towards 

2652
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:14,480
that end.
So again,

2653
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:15,980
you could go back to the previous 
administration and say,

2654
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:18,250
well look what Fox News was there.
They were always questioning president,

2655
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,520
you know,
that was one voice,

2656
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:20,151
you know,
fine.

2657
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:23,180
And some talk radio.
But Eh,

2658
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:24,350
you know,
I don't know.

2659
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:26,000
So I think,
I think there's a good chance,

2660
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:26,983
a good chance there's a chance that the 
president could turn out to be a lot 

2661
01:45:30,021 --> 01:45:31,040
better.
Uh,

2662
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:32,003
there's probably a good chance it'll 
turn out to be better than people 

2663
01:45:34,401 --> 01:45:35,760
thought.
Um,

2664
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,830
and you know,
I,

2665
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:39,140
you would like to think that everybody 
would want that to happen,

2666
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,780
you know,
who sits around and hopes it.

2667
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,013
Obviously.
Again,

2668
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,090
there were people on the right that 
wanted Obama to fail.

2669
01:45:44,091 --> 01:45:44,924
Okay.
I,

2670
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,940
that course again,
but it's what we're talking about before

2671
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:47,570
when you said,
you know,

2672
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:51,740
sort of the zealots on each side,
I don't understand that mentality.

2673
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:52,401
So it's around.
I says,

2674
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:55,850
I hope this guy fucks up really because 
you're living here,

2675
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:56,800
right?
So,

2676
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,600
and this is your country and you got 
kids and you just want to say,

2677
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:00,620
I told you so.
Yeah,

2678
01:46:00,621 --> 01:46:01,440
yeah,
yeah.

2679
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,890
They want the other side to fuck up.
They want the other team,

2680
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,880
but you know,
that's the problem is they're looking at

2681
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,300
as the other team instead of looking at 
as one big team.

2682
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,160
Once it gets in.
I mean,

2683
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:11,990
we're supposed to be all on the same 
side.

2684
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,780
Once a guy gets in,
you might criticize his movements,

2685
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:18,980
you might criticize his decisions,
but ultimately you should want him to do

2686
01:46:18,981 --> 01:46:19,814
well because it will be good for the 
entire country and you can disagree on 

2687
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,440
policy is fine,
but you know,

2688
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:25,753
if you disagree then find,
get out there and do something 

2689
01:46:27,411 --> 01:46:28,280
constructive about it.

2690
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,150
Right.
I mean a donate or oh,

2691
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:32,390
you know,
working uh,

2692
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:35,300
some sort of volunteer position or you 
know,

2693
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,430
canvass your neighborhood.
Do you know the political thing?

2694
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,170
I mean people made a lot of fun of the 
tea party,

2695
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:40,004
but look,
the tea party did what you're supposed 

2696
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:44,000
to do in a democratic society.
They organized,

2697
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:47,560
they know politics,
they worked,

2698
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:51,240
they canvassed,
they got representatives elected and,

2699
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:52,074
and you know,
they pushed their agenda in a proper 

2700
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:54,750
manner.
So fuck it.

2701
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:56,910
Maybe there,
maybe the far left or get over.

2702
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:59,400
It's butthurt and they'll actually start
doing that shit.

2703
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:00,263
But yeah,

2704
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:01,363
hopefully,
hopefully it just leads to more 

2705
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:04,670
discussion,
more debate,

2706
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:08,240
more communication and more people 
having a better understanding of how the

2707
01:47:08,241 --> 01:47:09,074
system works.
I think if one thing that we can look 

2708
01:47:10,641 --> 01:47:11,474
forward to with trump is that he's so 
transparent and if something pisses him 

2709
01:47:15,231 --> 01:47:17,660
off,
he's immediately going to talk about it,

2710
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:21,500
that we're going to get to see more and 
understand more about it,

2711
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:22,850
how it works behind the scenes.

2712
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:23,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

2713
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:24,420
No,
I think that's right.

2714
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:29,000
And I think that's one of those things 
that people look at and you know,

2715
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,350
unless they hate them,
they look at that as a positive and they

2716
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:32,071
think,
you know what,

2717
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:32,904
I'm Api that he's out there tweeting 
[inaudible] I want them to bypass the 

2718
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:37,760
media and tell me what's going on and 
all that sort of thing.

2719
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:38,613
And so,
and I think he genuinely believes that 

2720
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:43,770
that was a big a part of why he got 
elected.

2721
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:45,760
So he's not going to change that shit.
Why would or.

2722
01:47:45,761 --> 01:47:46,110
Yeah.

2723
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:48,650
So love it.
Get crazy when look,

2724
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,870
everybody looks at someone who's in 
power,

2725
01:47:50,871 --> 01:47:53,630
whether they're the president or 
whatever it is.

2726
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,630
They look at them as being some 
irreproachable.

2727
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:57,763
Some,
some person have like much higher moral 

2728
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:03,560
cloth and value and an intellect and we 
see him.

2729
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:04,900
He's clearly not right,
right.

2730
01:48:04,901 --> 01:48:07,130
You know,
it gets mad with he such shit.

2731
01:48:07,131 --> 01:48:09,800
Not Rosie O'donnell.
He goes after people and you go,

2732
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:11,540
this guy's like,
he's nuts.

2733
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:12,230
No,
that's right.

2734
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,790
And that's what.
And that drives the media crazy.

2735
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:14,663
It drives,
it drives the academics and others on 

2736
01:48:16,601 --> 01:48:20,420
the that have typically occupied the far
left,

2737
01:48:20,421 --> 01:48:21,980
fragile,
crazy cause he does look,

2738
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:23,750
you know,
prime minister.

2739
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:25,423
Yeah.
I've got a very progressive liberal 

2740
01:48:26,601 --> 01:48:27,650
friends who,
you know,

2741
01:48:27,651 --> 01:48:29,120
that's the first thing they say is such 
an idiot.

2742
01:48:29,121 --> 01:48:30,380
He's,
he's so stupid.

2743
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:32,480
And he appeals to all the stupid people 
out there.

2744
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,460
And I said,
you know what,

2745
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,293
you know,
how do you think you ended up with 

2746
01:48:35,211 --> 01:48:38,840
president trump by spending eight years 
telling people how stupid they are.

2747
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:39,510
Right.
And,

2748
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,120
and,
and,

2749
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:43,070
and minimizing their importance and 
making fun of them.

2750
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,670
Yeah.
So,

2751
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,670
you know,
there you go.

2752
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:48,600
Congratulations.
It's

2753
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,980
definitely a part of it.
I mean,

2754
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:51,750
he played off of that really 
brilliantly.

2755
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,210
He's a very smart persuader in that 
regard.

2756
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:55,740
You know,
Scott Adams,

2757
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:56,823
who is the creator of Dilbert,
who predicted this whole thing a long 

2758
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:02,910
time in advance and took a big hit for 
it,

2759
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,680
told me it cost them millions of 
dollars.

2760
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:06,780
People boycotting him,
hating him,

2761
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:07,883
and by the way,
he doesn't even vote because he's not 

2762
01:49:09,871 --> 01:49:10,830
voting for trump.
He says,

2763
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:12,510
I don't want to have a dog in the war.
He was like,

2764
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,160
I don't want to have a dog in the fight.
He goes,

2765
01:49:14,161 --> 01:49:14,994
I feel like it's.
I can be objective about it if I don't 

2766
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:20,250
talk about it or if I don't vote.
So he's not voting.

2767
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,290
He didn't vote for trump.
He didn't vote for anybody,

2768
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:23,124
and he said,
what he thinks is that trump is an 

2769
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:27,180
excellent persuader.
He's like,

2770
01:49:27,181 --> 01:49:27,730
he's,
he's.

2771
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:29,840
His powers of persuasion are amazing.
Yeah.

2772
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:30,953
And he goes into the way he understands 
how to manipulate the press and say 

2773
01:49:33,211 --> 01:49:35,190
outrageous things.
So they talk about him constantly.

2774
01:49:35,191 --> 01:49:36,960
So he gets free press.
I mean,

2775
01:49:36,961 --> 01:49:40,330
what he did in that sense,
Scott was totally right and he was like,

2776
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,540
Scott was looking at it completely 
objective.

2777
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:43,374
Lee,
he's not a trump supporter and many 

2778
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:45,414
people accused them of being so,
and that's why he got took so much heat 

2779
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:47,740
about.
He's like,

2780
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:48,130
he's going

2781
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,420
to be president,
and they're like,

2782
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:51,610
you're a piece of shit,
and they hated him because of it.

2783
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,280
It's really fascinating because when you
get to know Scott,

2784
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:55,114
you realize he's a brilliant guy,
but he's unafraid to discuss what he 

2785
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:01,054
actually believes will take place 
regardless of whether or not people 

2786
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:07,150
think that's what they want or what am I
smart.

2787
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:07,984
I mean it's.
I didn't know that about them to really 

2788
01:50:09,851 --> 01:50:12,640
enter the podcast I had with him as a 
really entertaining.

2789
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:13,540
If you ever want to listen to.
Yeah,

2790
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:14,170
no,
definitely.

2791
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:15,580
Definitely.
That's really interesting.

2792
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,533
I'm like everybody else.
I got a few of his cartoons clipped out 

2793
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:21,420
and stuck up on my cubicle online.
I don't have a cubicle.

2794
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:27,160
Probably Office bunker in a basement so 
she could rollerblade in.

2795
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:31,480
Dick Cheney was a in the bunker.
Yeah.

2796
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:32,890
Where's the.
Where's the bunker?

2797
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,013
I can't,
I can't.

2798
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:36,060
I can't tell you what.
Tell me where it is.

2799
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,570
It's a real thing.
A real bunker.

2800
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,040
Yeah.
Oh,

2801
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,033
how did he go in there?
And she's out there running around the 

2802
01:50:41,771 --> 01:50:42,604
surface playing golf,
continually pushed out bass fishing and 

2803
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:45,790
shit.
Like,

2804
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:50,590
hi all bass fishing death 11.
He was doing everything man.

2805
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,780
He's out there and drink a beer on the 
dock.

2806
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:56,270
Cheney's seven miles underground with no
qualifications.

2807
01:50:56,271 --> 01:50:57,880
Tell Dick he's going to need to stay 
down there.

2808
01:50:57,881 --> 01:51:00,460
It's still bad out here.
Why did he,

2809
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:03,280
why did he go into the bunker?
Continuity of government.

2810
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,860
So in case they killed Bush,
right?

2811
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:10,120
Be Tucked away.
Yeah.

2812
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,133
Wow.
So I mean it's the same reason why you 

2813
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:13,443
don't let everybody stand on the 
inauguration stand during the 

2814
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:16,560
inauguration.
Right?

2815
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,091
Right,
right,

2816
01:51:17,091 --> 01:51:17,590
right,
right.

2817
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,900
Randomly choose somebody as the 
designated survivor.

2818
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:20,773
Well,
whenever they start talking about how 

2819
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:22,144
security so locked down,
I remember that guy who was the sign 

2820
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:27,514
language interpreter for Obama.
It turned out to be a complete 

2821
01:51:30,251 --> 01:51:31,084
psychopath who didn't know sign language
at all and he was up there just making 

2822
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:36,813
fucking signs and shut tastic.
And this guy was standing three feet 

2823
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:43,330
away from the fucking president.
Nobody vetted him.

2824
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,380
Nobody.
Nobody.

2825
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:46,900
Nobody fucking did anything.

2826
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,793
There've been a few security screw ups.
There was a little while back before 

2827
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,370
that incident that you're talking about 
the guy.

2828
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:55,871
Yeah.
The guy in the elevator,

2829
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:56,660
which was an.
Oh yeah,

2830
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:57,251
exactly.
Yeah,

2831
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:58,180
yeah,
we talked about that.

2832
01:51:58,181 --> 01:51:58,681
Yeah,
yeah,

2833
01:51:58,681 --> 01:51:59,514
yeah.
That was,

2834
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:02,260
it was a great to a great story.
Not,

2835
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,120
not great in the sense that it was a,
it was a fuck up,

2836
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:06,340
but at the same time it was fascinating.
So,

2837
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:07,380
uh,
it was,

2838
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,290
uh,
at CDC,

2839
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:10,320
he went down,
he went down to Atlanta.

2840
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,670
That was right.
And he got onto the president.

2841
01:52:12,671 --> 01:52:13,504
Sorry,
the president got on the elevator and 

2842
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:17,740
uh,
he had his detail with them obviously,

2843
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:21,130
and this one fellow went to get on the 
elevator and who does that?

2844
01:52:21,131 --> 01:52:23,830
Who even thinks that the presenter,
I'm going to keep the door open.

2845
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:26,350
I got to get on,
I got to Texas,

2846
01:52:26,351 --> 01:52:27,910
or Ah,
I got my lunch,

2847
01:52:27,911 --> 01:52:31,520
I got to get to my desk.
And so it gets on the secret service.

2848
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:33,700
Asked him to leave obviously.
First of all,

2849
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:34,990
he shouldn't have been on there.
They should have had,

2850
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:35,853
you know,
a couple of guys standing outside the 

2851
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:38,140
door.
He asked him to leave.

2852
01:52:38,141 --> 01:52:39,070
He won't,
he won't leave.

2853
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:42,190
They rides up basically.
And then as it turns out,

2854
01:52:42,191 --> 01:52:44,370
he's armed and he's a guard.
Right.

2855
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:47,740
He said private security guard for that 
facility on,

2856
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:50,270
under contract with a company that had 
the contract for security.

2857
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,280
It was armed.
They didn't even know it.

2858
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,360
So server that.
No idea.

2859
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:53,770
Yeah.

2860
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:54,603
He's got a standing in an elevator and 
he's in the elevator three feet away 

2861
01:52:57,971 --> 01:52:58,400
from the process.

2862
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,650
Yeah.
Unbelievable.

2863
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:00,723
So there,
there've been little situations like 

2864
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:04,030
that.
It's a tough,

2865
01:53:04,031 --> 01:53:05,160
tough job,
but you know,

2866
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:08,020
that secret service operation.
I know,

2867
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:08,854
it seems like it only makes the news 
when there's some bad thing that 

2868
01:53:11,111 --> 01:53:13,960
happened to fuck up or something.
People find funny,

2869
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:14,320
like,
you know,

2870
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,330
some hookers or whatever,
but uh,

2871
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,280
it's a,
it's a tough ass job.

2872
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:19,510
Oh,
I can only imagine.

2873
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:23,770
And we should applaud them.
How few of those fuck ups ever had.

2874
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,471
Yeah,
exactly.

2875
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:26,260
Exactly.
And you know,

2876
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:26,731
they,
they,

2877
01:53:26,731 --> 01:53:27,531
they do.
It's a,

2878
01:53:27,531 --> 01:53:30,110
it's kind of a thankless job in,
in many,

2879
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:31,930
many ways.
And it's,

2880
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:35,870
it's just really a,
it's always high stress.

2881
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:38,450
It's always stressed.
And so I,

2882
01:53:38,451 --> 01:53:38,651
yeah,
I,

2883
01:53:38,651 --> 01:53:40,460
I give those folks a lot of credit,
just like the FBI,

2884
01:53:40,461 --> 01:53:42,950
FBI has staff with brilliant people,
great people.

2885
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:43,823
Which just imagine this woman who made 
this facebook post about not being 

2886
01:53:46,321 --> 01:53:47,820
willing to take a bullet for the 
president.

2887
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,160
What if she said that about the CEO of 
allstate?

2888
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:52,030
Right?
You'd be like a good move.

2889
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:54,780
Don't take a bullet.
Like that's how crazy the job is.

2890
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:55,643
That there is a consideration that she 
might one day have to take a bullet for 

2891
01:53:59,041 --> 01:53:59,874
the president.
Yeah.

2892
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,160
And apparently she wasn't.
Okay.

2893
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:03,920
Very good.
Yeah.

2894
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:04,763
Maybe she was just angry and maybe she 
didn't do her job because she's a 

2895
01:54:07,441 --> 01:54:07,990
patriot.

2896
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,771
Yeah.
Hopefully.

2897
01:54:08,771 --> 01:54:09,604
So that would be nice.
But I think she's gonna at least be on 

2898
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:14,020
ice for a while based on that.
But,

2899
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:14,960
uh,
yeah,

2900
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,850
you know,
it's,

2901
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,713
it's,
uh,

2902
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:20,650
and that's true of any executive 
protection detail.

2903
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:21,550
Uh,
obviously it's,

2904
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:25,080
it's a heightened situation when you're 
talking about the president or you know,

2905
01:54:25,081 --> 01:54:26,350
us,
dignitaries or whatever,

2906
01:54:26,351 --> 01:54:29,530
but anybody in that business,
there's no room for ego.

2907
01:54:29,531 --> 01:54:30,364
Can't have an ego if your body guards to
make people think about bodyguards and 

2908
01:54:33,101 --> 01:54:35,010
they tend to think about somebody who's 
a,

2909
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:36,550
you know,
protecting,

2910
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:38,080
you know,
the Kardashians or something,

2911
01:54:38,081 --> 01:54:40,060
you know,
it's not a celebrity bodyguard,

2912
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:45,450
but the executive protection world is a 
fairly large business and you know,

2913
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:48,010
it's,
it's,

2914
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:52,450
it's a really tough industry and there's
no room for egos and it's a,

2915
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:56,230
requires a real variety of skills,
diplomacy,

2916
01:54:56,231 --> 01:54:59,200
common sense on top of all the typical 
skills you would imagine.

2917
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,660
And it is,
again,

2918
01:55:01,661 --> 01:55:04,000
it's just a sort of a thankless job.
You know,

2919
01:55:04,001 --> 01:55:07,960
you're often dealing with principals who
really don't even want you there.

2920
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,060
You know,
high net wealth families.

2921
01:55:10,061 --> 01:55:13,590
I net wealth individuals and they just 
needed a tolerant.

2922
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:16,060
They tolerate it.
They don't really want you there and,

2923
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:16,890
or they,
you know,

2924
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:19,330
they think you're after awhile you're 
just there to carry bags.

2925
01:55:19,331 --> 01:55:21,430
And so the folks that do those jobs,
you know,

2926
01:55:21,910 --> 01:55:23,950
in serious details,
it's really tough.

2927
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,720
And then like out out in Hollywood,
you know,

2928
01:55:25,721 --> 01:55:27,070
you sometimes get down,
you know,

2929
01:55:27,071 --> 01:55:28,000
the bodyguard is,
you know,

2930
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:28,853
they,
they all hire whoever happens to be 

2931
01:55:29,711 --> 01:55:31,100
biggest and that's the worst thing,
you know,

2932
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:31,841
you don't want it some,
you know,

2933
01:55:31,841 --> 01:55:32,674
some big thick neck guy out there 
thinking that he's going to protect you 

2934
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:39,390
and that he's the best guy when it could
in fact be the five foot two woman who's

2935
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:42,530
going to be actually the smartest 
because she's got all the right skills.

2936
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:44,350
She's got the other,
you know,

2937
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:46,950
and if you've got something busted up on
top of the principal,

2938
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,210
you've already fucked up,
right?

2939
01:55:48,211 --> 01:55:49,800
You've already missed the opportunity 
to,

2940
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:51,540
to,
to sort the problem out.

2941
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:51,840
So,

2942
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:52,673
right,
sometimes it's better with a physically 

2943
01:55:53,431 --> 01:55:56,130
vulnerable person because they take 
steps to make sure that it never gets to

2944
01:55:56,131 --> 01:55:58,410
that point.
Whereas the big guy thinks he can handle

2945
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,800
it,
always looks to handle it or,

2946
01:55:59,801 --> 01:56:00,371
or,
you know.

2947
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:01,001
Yeah,
exactly.

2948
01:56:01,001 --> 01:56:02,110
So,
you know,

2949
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,033
again,
how much are we are we veered off into 

2950
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:05,080
that conversation.
But it's a,

2951
01:56:05,081 --> 01:56:06,790
it's a fascinating world.
And,

2952
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:07,600
uh,
you know,

2953
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,540
it's again heightened when you're 
talking about the president.

2954
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:12,820
Um,
so beyond.

2955
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:13,963
Yeah.
Yeah.

2956
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:16,150
How do you feel about

2957
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:17,411
w w,
w,

2958
01:56:17,411 --> 01:56:18,244
what do you think?
Like we should we be concerned about 

2959
01:56:20,291 --> 01:56:21,640
Putin and Russia?
I mean,

2960
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:24,040
is that something we need to go back to 
when I grew up?

2961
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:25,073
I mean,
you and I are pretty much the same age 

2962
01:56:26,170 --> 01:56:28,630
when we're in high school.
You remember that fear,

2963
01:56:28,631 --> 01:56:29,464
like everybody had this fear hanging 
over our head that we were going to go 

2964
01:56:30,881 --> 01:56:33,700
to war with Russia is going to be a 
mutually assured destruction.

2965
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:35,920
Nuclear War.
There was nothing we could do.

2966
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,953
I used to go to bed.
Sometimes they think about that when I 

2967
01:56:38,351 --> 01:56:39,520
was like 14.
I'd be like,

2968
01:56:39,521 --> 01:56:42,010
fuck,
I don't want to die in a nuclear bomb.

2969
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:42,801
Exactly.
No,

2970
01:56:42,801 --> 01:56:44,420
I 100 percent.
I mean,

2971
01:56:44,421 --> 01:56:46,930
I remember when in elementary school,
uh,

2972
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:48,593
you know,
we'd have a duck and cover under your 

2973
01:56:50,541 --> 01:56:52,010
desk.
Good luck with all that.

2974
01:56:52,011 --> 01:56:53,270
I remember one of my,
one of my friends,

2975
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,810
once I was sitting under the desk and 
mark said,

2976
01:56:57,050 --> 01:56:57,883
we started talking.
I looked at him and I had older 

2977
01:56:59,181 --> 01:56:59,691
brothers,
you know,

2978
01:56:59,691 --> 01:57:02,060
so they'd already told me that help 
bullshit that exercise was.

2979
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:03,073
But I realized that my friend Mark Air 
sitting there as we kind of ate our 

2980
01:57:05,331 --> 01:57:06,164
lunch underneath a desk,
what seemed like this was going to do 

2981
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:09,620
it,
this was going to protect us.

2982
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:11,600
And I remember looking at him and I told
him,

2983
01:57:11,601 --> 01:57:12,020
I said,
mark,

2984
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:13,520
this is not going to stop a nuclear 
bomb.

2985
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,920
There's no way that thing's going to 
just blow the shit out of us.

2986
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,330
And he was like,
oh my God,

2987
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:20,990
I think I ruined the kid for,
for life.

2988
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,553
But he got to work in the CIA.
And this poor dudes still shaken into 

2989
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:28,540
God to protect their duties.
Uh,

2990
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:29,820
so anyway,
uh,

2991
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,083
no,
I think we should be worried about 

2992
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:35,420
puente in the sense that he,
his agenda,

2993
01:57:35,421 --> 01:57:38,220
his interest don't match up with ours.
Um,

2994
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,313
we should be worried in the sense that 
he honestly believes that the biggest 

2995
01:57:42,441 --> 01:57:44,960
catastrophe was the collapse of the 
Soviet Union.

2996
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,830
Uh,
and he's never believed.

2997
01:57:49,610 --> 01:57:51,980
He's never believed that there was a 
peace dividend from the,

2998
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,480
the,
the end of the Cold War.

2999
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:55,220
Never ever thought that way.
And we did.

3000
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:58,910
And there was talk about up on capital 
hill after the end of the Cold War,

3001
01:57:58,970 --> 01:58:02,360
that fall of the Berlin Wall,
we could shut down the CIA,

3002
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:03,253
what do we need that for anymore?
And that was a same thought that 

3003
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:05,894
happened after World War Two.
World War Two ended and Harry Truman 

3004
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:11,240
signed an order that ended,
uh,

3005
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:14,960
the office of strategic services,
which was the precursor for the CIA,

3006
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,500
shut it down,
took two years,

3007
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:21,380
two years while the,
the Soviet Union started building up and

3008
01:58:21,381 --> 01:58:24,200
rampaging for,
uh,

3009
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:26,990
the president of thank you know,
maybe this is actually a good idea.

3010
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:29,120
So then he created the CIA at that 
point.

3011
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,073
Uh,
but,

3012
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:32,410
you know,
we,

3013
01:58:32,590 --> 01:58:33,423
we thought we were going to get some 
sort of dividend out of the end of that 

3014
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:36,423
and it just wasn't gonna happen.
The Russians never ever believed that 

3015
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:39,524
Putin and particular in his,
his cohorts never thought that was the 

3016
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:42,011
case.
So yeah,

3017
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:44,620
we should be concerned about Russia.
They're not going to ever be,

3018
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:46,300
it's not going to be a bipolar world 
again,

3019
01:58:46,301 --> 01:58:50,070
where there the other major superpower,
but um,

3020
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:53,830
in the sense that we need to deal with 
him realistically,

3021
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:56,500
we should always talk fine,
let's do a diplomacy,

3022
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:58,660
but we just need to be pragmatic and 
understand.

3023
01:58:58,661 --> 01:58:59,320
Look,
we're not going to.

3024
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,153
Our interests aren't the same and if as 
long as we keep that in mind as sure I 

3025
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:05,120
talk all we want to them.

3026
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:07,200
Yeah.
He's a fascinating guy.

3027
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,820
He's a physicist.
What he did by,

3028
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:10,320
you know,
running Russia,

3029
01:59:10,321 --> 01:59:11,154
stepping back and being sort of a puppet
master for awhile and then jumping back 

3030
01:59:14,431 --> 01:59:16,710
in 2012 and running it again.
Yeah.

3031
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:18,890
I mean that's,
you know,

3032
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:20,183
that's the type of behavior that people 
are terrified of when someone is just 

3033
01:59:24,301 --> 01:59:28,650
sort of a blatant dictator but masked as
a democracy.

3034
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:29,520
Right.
And he's like,

3035
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,530
he doesn't even really try the masking.
Not Anymore.

3036
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:34,850
After 2012 we just kind of ramped it up.
Yeah.

3037
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:35,920
He's,

3038
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,753
he's done in part.
And I what I said that he thinks it was 

3039
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:40,500
a catastrophe.
That's,

3040
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:41,373
those are his words.
He thought he said the collapse of the 

3041
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:47,920
Soviet Union was the greatest 
catastrophe of the 20th century and he's

3042
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:48,754
absolutely serious about it.
So he's been trying to rebuild that in 

3043
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:54,500
some fashion or another ever since then.
And it's not just territory,

3044
01:59:54,501 --> 01:59:55,990
although he's done a pretty good job of 
that,

3045
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:58,450
you know,
we forget that before Crimea,

3046
01:59:59,090 --> 02:00:00,230
um,
you know,

3047
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,150
he rolled troops into Georgia,
right?

3048
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:02,560
Not,
not,

3049
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,700
not the state of Georgia Thinking,
oh my God,

3050
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:06,850
no,
that doesn't make sense.

3051
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:09,070
I don't think Mike knows what he's 
talking about.

3052
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:09,993
Um,
so,

3053
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,460
but in Georgia,
the Republic of Georgia,

3054
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:15,040
and uh,
I'll be damned,

3055
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:18,040
but he's still got troops there.
He's got a lot of troops are and it's in

3056
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:20,200
a upc.
Kazia and south assess you.

3057
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:24,380
And then he's also obviously took Crimea
and why to take Crimea.

3058
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:26,440
Well,
because it's important to his fleet.

3059
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,170
It's not gonna.
It's not gonna happen.

3060
02:00:29,171 --> 02:00:31,330
He's not going to risk losing that.
And then,

3061
02:00:31,331 --> 02:00:33,820
you know,
part of the Ukraine and,

3062
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:35,650
but it's not just territory that he's 
interested in.

3063
02:00:35,651 --> 02:00:37,240
It's leverage,
its influence.

3064
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,133
And that's where,
when we go back to that conversation 

3065
02:00:39,101 --> 02:00:39,934
about the Middle East and we realized 
what they'd been doing in the Middle 

3066
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:44,440
East in particular,
they've been active in other places,

3067
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:45,980
but mostly in the Middle East.
Uh,

3068
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:50,660
that's all part of this same process,
this and it's so,

3069
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:53,650
it's not a mystery why he does things.
It's if you,

3070
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:58,860
if you take him at his base word,
which we should do because he's,

3071
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,183
he,
he tends to say exactly what he intends 

3072
02:01:01,361 --> 02:01:03,470
to do most of the time.
Um,

3073
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:06,430
and not try to read our values into it,
right?

3074
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:06,941
Not Say,
well,

3075
02:01:06,941 --> 02:01:08,750
I'm sure he doesn't mean that.
I'm sure what he means is like,

3076
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,390
you know,
he's,

3077
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,620
he,
he wants to get to democracy eventually,

3078
02:01:11,621 --> 02:01:12,920
but that's a lot of horseshit.

3079
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:15,430
But we tend to mirror our values on 
other people.

3080
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:16,293
Right?
So when we were talking about earlier 

3081
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:18,940
about how,
you know,

3082
02:01:18,941 --> 02:01:19,774
there's not another nation out there 
that really kind of approaches global 

3083
02:01:21,821 --> 02:01:24,460
concerns a way that we do with certain 
set of principles and,

3084
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:26,200
and desires,
even if we make mistakes.

3085
02:01:26,201 --> 02:01:28,030
And obviously we do from time to time,
of course.

3086
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:30,100
Um,
then,

3087
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:31,090
you know,
you look at,

3088
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:33,150
you look at Russia and you think that,
you know,

3089
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:35,680
he doesn't,
he doesn't do that.

3090
02:01:35,681 --> 02:01:37,640
He doesn't look at something and go,
hmm,

3091
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:38,643
maybe that would be best for all of us.
I don't think he's ever had that 

3092
02:01:41,751 --> 02:01:42,740
thought,
you know,

3093
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:43,574
he,
he literally is single minded in his 

3094
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:48,830
desire to do whatever.
We'll build back up Russian influence in

3095
02:01:48,831 --> 02:01:49,664
the world.
So we have to be pragmatic about it and 

3096
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:51,540
dealing with them

3097
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:53,490
and to get a better understanding of 
him.

3098
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,470
Um,
I think,

3099
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:55,304
uh,
there's a great podcast between Sam 

3100
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,683
Harris and Gary Kasparov,
the chess champion who was a big critic 

3101
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:04,590
of Putin has managed to stay alive 
somehow or another q and a,

3102
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:05,483
I guess because he's just so famous.
But that was a thing with one of his 

3103
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:10,103
political opponents.
He thought that if he was public he 

3104
02:02:12,961 --> 02:02:13,794
would be much less likely to be killed.
And they shot him right in front of his 

3105
02:02:16,441 --> 02:02:17,990
fucking girlfriend and public.
Yeah,

3106
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,880
yeah,
yeah.

3107
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,840
And that's it.
There've been a number of incidences,

3108
02:02:21,841 --> 02:02:23,220
bunch bunch of those.
I mean,

3109
02:02:23,221 --> 02:02:24,054
he's a on a totally different level,
but Kasparov highlights the fact that 

3110
02:02:27,451 --> 02:02:28,284
he's a former kgb agent and says like,
you have to understand the mentality of 

3111
02:02:31,861 --> 02:02:34,560
the KGB,
like once you are kgb,

3112
02:02:34,561 --> 02:02:36,540
your kgb for life.
I mean,

3113
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:40,590
it was an extreme form of nationalism 
and patriotism and this,

3114
02:02:40,591 --> 02:02:44,100
this loyalty to the KGB that.

3115
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:45,021
Yeah,
absolutely.

3116
02:02:45,021 --> 02:02:46,540
He's eight and he's absolutely right.
There's no,

3117
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,620
he's not going to change.
But again,

3118
02:02:48,621 --> 02:02:50,060
we,
we do this thing where we,

3119
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:53,210
you know,
it's basically called mirroring,

3120
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:54,160
right?
I mean it's like I,

3121
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:56,150
and so you know,
and we and we,

3122
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,073
and then we get tripped up and we think 
you could look at Iraq and Afghanistan 

3123
02:02:59,361 --> 02:03:01,040
as an example.
Of course they're going to love this.

3124
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:03,650
You gotTa love democracy.
And because we love it,

3125
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:04,763
we want to do well.
We want to improve their literacy rate 

3126
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:09,230
and we want to do these things well 
that's all great stuff,

3127
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:12,920
but it doesn't work in the sense that 
that's not how they view things.

3128
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:13,821
You know,
cars.

3129
02:03:13,821 --> 02:03:14,654
I looked at that.
That is a shitload of money that I'm 

3130
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:21,740
gonna be able to steal here.
Cars I family was completely corrupt and

3131
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,600
remember there was that period of time 
when we just adored him.

3132
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:24,740
We were,
it was adulation.

3133
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:25,240
You know,
how,

3134
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:26,600
how wonderful his cars I look out.
Well,

3135
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:29,000
he dresses and that was boring.
What the hell?

3136
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:31,460
So yeah.
So Putin,

3137
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:35,180
I think again,
not in a sense that we've got some world

3138
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:38,180
war three coming up against Russia.
That's not the case.

3139
02:03:38,181 --> 02:03:39,740
That's not why we should be concerned 
about them.

3140
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:41,780
Although you do have to,
you know,

3141
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:44,840
again,
worry about military buildup,

3142
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:46,360
worry about their,
uh,

3143
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:48,140
a nuke program,
you know,

3144
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:48,974
and,
and what they're doing with their ears 

3145
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:53,260
and what we're doing with ours.
A unilateral disarmament.

3146
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:54,660
Not a good idea.
You know,

3147
02:03:54,661 --> 02:03:56,420
whether we're talking about Putin or 
anybody else,

3148
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:57,273
um,
you can always want peace and you can 

3149
02:03:59,061 --> 02:03:59,894
strive for peace.
But I have not seen a world that works 

3150
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:05,840
differently.
You've got to do that through a position

3151
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:06,674
of strength.

3152
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,873
I think these conversations are so 
important because when a guy like you 

3153
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,863
talks about this,
you're not talking out of your ass and 

3154
02:04:13,851 --> 02:04:14,684
you get a chance to understand how crazy
the situation is worldwide and how 

3155
02:04:19,161 --> 02:04:21,800
difficult it is and what a balancing act
it is.

3156
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

3157
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:23,090
It is.
And,

3158
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:24,200
and you know,
and it's tough.

3159
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:28,670
I wouldn't want to be like the head of 
the State Department.

3160
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:30,980
I mean the chief diplomat,
it's a tough ass job.

3161
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:32,183
You don't get any sleep now,
but you've got to do it and you got to 

3162
02:04:34,131 --> 02:04:35,870
keep that level.
It's just like fighting terrorism.

3163
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:36,704
It's like fighting Islamic state.
You've got do it on several different 

3164
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:40,270
levels.
Community outreach and you know,

3165
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:43,380
they're trying to solve problems here,
doing it militarily.

3166
02:04:43,381 --> 02:04:44,214
All these things have to work together 
and we got to be smart enough to do 

3167
02:04:45,601 --> 02:04:46,990
that.
So the same thing with,

3168
02:04:46,991 --> 02:04:48,180
with dealing with Russia.
Yeah.

3169
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:51,420
Well you know,
but the narrative that somehow trump was

3170
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:55,170
being played by Putin was his best 
friend was until I don't,

3171
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,033
I'm not buying any of that shit.
I think what we'll find is you need to 

3172
02:04:57,841 --> 02:04:59,190
watch more.
Keith overman video.

3173
02:04:59,220 --> 02:04:59,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

3174
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:00,061
Oh,
right.

3175
02:05:00,061 --> 02:05:00,894
No,
I know.

3176
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:03,950
Who Doesn't love Keith Olbermann silent.
Cool.

3177
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:07,230
Cool.
I think what we're going to find is,

3178
02:05:07,231 --> 02:05:08,064
is,
uh,

3179
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:11,550
is uh,
what trump probably I think maybe again,

3180
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:14,890
who knows?
Maybe please pop it.

3181
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:16,120
Um,
I think what,

3182
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,500
what he's thinking is,
you know,

3183
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,353
what we need to,
as an example of the military will get 

3184
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:21,150
to build up the military.
Well,

3185
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:22,470
he knows that,
you know,

3186
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:25,010
he's smart enough to understand that,
you know,

3187
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:29,130
we got that a wall to fall because we 
outspent the hell out of the Russians.

3188
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:30,270
Right.
We,

3189
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,253
and also part of it was Reagan.
They actually didn't know if Reagan was 

3190
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,170
crazy enough to hit the button.
Right.

3191
02:05:37,171 --> 02:05:38,760
And so that,
unknowing,

3192
02:05:38,761 --> 02:05:39,594
that uncertainty about what Reagan was 
all about combined with the fact that 

3193
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:44,250
we,
we were outspending them,

3194
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,620
um,
and they couldn't keep up.

3195
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:50,850
That's what brought the Soviets 
eventually to realize,

3196
02:05:50,851 --> 02:05:51,510
yeah,
this is,

3197
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:53,400
you know,
we've got to realign things because this

3198
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:53,980
isn't going to work.

3199
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:54,813
As soon as they found out that Nancy 
Reagan based all of our decisions and 

3200
02:05:56,951 --> 02:06:00,140
all advice on astrology,
yeah,

3201
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,150
they're probably like,
wait,

3202
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,290
what?
Yeah,

3203
02:06:02,291 --> 02:06:04,920
hold on.
Let's get them on the phone.

3204
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:06,580
We're going to need to talk.
This was real.

3205
02:06:06,730 --> 02:06:09,340
She being serious.
Astrology.

3206
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:10,181
Yeah.
What was that?

3207
02:06:10,181 --> 02:06:12,560
Astrologers name was gene.
Something sounded that.

3208
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:13,403
Yeah.
Find out what the Nancy Reagan Bill 

3209
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:17,300
Clinton again.
I can.

3210
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,133
I never get tired of looking at.
My favorite thing is his look to to 

3211
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:24,280
fucking Hillary.
Don't look at me.

3212
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:27,890
Yeah.
Just growing out of it.

3213
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:29,303
That white man bite,
he gets almost all his hips starting to 

3214
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:39,220
make it.
His sister of Nancy Reagan,

3215
02:06:39,221 --> 02:06:40,570
astrologer.
Joan Quigley.

3216
02:06:40,571 --> 02:06:43,600
Nancy listened religiously to what Joan 
had to say.

3217
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:44,933
Wow.

3218
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:47,780
Joan Quigley.
Huh?

3219
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,460
Even the flight schedule or a forest 
one.

3220
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:52,543
Wow.

3221
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:56,380
That's news to right now how big it is 
right now,

3222
02:06:56,381 --> 02:06:57,220
but this is a trump

3223
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:59,730
trump signs order to bar some refugees 
signaling.

3224
02:06:59,731 --> 02:07:04,680
Prioritizing Syrian Christians letting 
Syrian Christians through.

3225
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:06,330
Yeah.
That's ridiculous.

3226
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:08,850
Have a priority.
How do you know that they're going to be

3227
02:07:08,851 --> 02:07:09,684
fucking Syrian Christian?
How do you know they're really 

3228
02:07:10,891 --> 02:07:11,724
Christian?
They're going to have priority probably 

3229
02:07:13,111 --> 02:07:14,520
be wearing a cross.
Oh,

3230
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,220
well that's.
That's.

3231
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:17,203
That sounds crazy.
Identifying specific countries with 

3232
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:21,054
Muslim majorities and carving out 
exceptions for minority religions flies 

3233
02:07:23,701 --> 02:07:24,534
in the face of the constitutional 
principle that bands of government from 

3234
02:07:26,401 --> 02:07:30,480
either favoring or discriminating 
against particular religions.

3235
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:32,370
Ramiro said,
this is the trump card.

3236
02:07:32,371 --> 02:07:34,710
Okay,
if you were a Muslim,

3237
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,760
you could come in,
but if you were a Christian,

3238
02:07:36,761 --> 02:07:41,200
it's almost impossible and the reason 
that that was so unfair,

3239
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:43,660
everybody was persecuted in all 
fairness,

3240
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:46,360
but they were chopping off the heads of 
everybody,

3241
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:48,820
but more so the Christian tell is,
is the president.

3242
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:49,900
He says,
crazy.

3243
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,640
You know I,
I believe that's a run on sentence.

3244
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,073
Might be a little bit of a run on trump 
said in an excerpt of an interview with 

3245
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:57,610
the Christian Broadcasting Network.
Oh,

3246
02:07:57,611 --> 02:08:01,060
thank God he's talking to them.
Is a Jim Baker still on that?

3247
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,030
Jim Baker selling food scene.
Jim Baker.

3248
02:08:04,031 --> 02:08:05,190
That video.
Let's,

3249
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:06,073
let's,
let's end with this because this is a 

3250
02:08:09,410 --> 02:08:12,190
jim and Tammy Faye Bakker.
Tammy Faye died from diet coke.

3251
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:15,610
Diet coke gave Tammy Faye brain cancer 
and she died.

3252
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:18,340
She,
she's strict jugs of diet coke every day

3253
02:08:18,341 --> 02:08:19,780
and she got,
got the cancer.

3254
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:20,741
So,
uh,

3255
02:08:20,741 --> 02:08:24,520
I don't like when people say the byway 
diet coke,

3256
02:08:24,521 --> 02:08:26,500
I'm just fucking around.
I don't really think,

3257
02:08:26,501 --> 02:08:28,870
don't send me.
I don't really think she got cancer from

3258
02:08:28,871 --> 02:08:31,180
that.
She probably got cancer from Jim Baker's

3259
02:08:31,181 --> 02:08:34,490
dirty Dick,
Coca Cola Company for trout.

3260
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,280
We tried televangelists,
Jim Baker,

3261
02:08:36,281 --> 02:08:37,114
survival food.
He sells survival food and he sells it 

3262
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:43,720
as a potential a base for your table.

3263
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:45,910
What he wants you to do is take these 
buckets.

3264
02:08:45,911 --> 02:08:49,270
They pulled that video down away.
Okay.

3265
02:08:49,271 --> 02:08:51,490
So it's like the walls of water breaks.
Yeah.

3266
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:54,880
Well he sells these buckets of food.
They must've pulled it.

3267
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:57,310
They must have had them pull it.
What was the guy's name that was running

3268
02:08:57,311 --> 02:08:58,780
that,
that runs that Youtube Channel?

3269
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:02,880
Let's give him his proper video is gone.
So it doesn't say the channel.

3270
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:04,940
What's the.
Oh his channel's gone.

3271
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,131
Another.
The channels not.

3272
02:09:06,131 --> 02:09:09,020
But it doesn't say who the sad face 
there.

3273
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:11,940
Quick search to try to find that dude's 
name.

3274
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,660
Cause he's got a bunch of really 
hilarious videos,

3275
02:09:13,661 --> 02:09:16,360
but he made a compilation of all the 
wackiest moments.

3276
02:09:16,361 --> 02:09:20,710
I'm Jim Baker show where he tries to 
sell the survival food and he's got like

3277
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:24,490
this table that he sets down instead of 
on like legs.

3278
02:09:24,491 --> 02:09:28,570
It's set down on these buckets of 
survival food that he recommends.

3279
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:30,370
This is where you store your survival 
food.

3280
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:31,213
You use it as the base of your table.
Midcentury modern look stupid because 

3281
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:37,540
you can't get your feet under the table.
Then here it is.

3282
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:38,770
Oh,
what's the dude's name?

3283
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:41,740
Vic Berger.
Vic Berger Presents Jim Baker's buckets.

3284
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:44,640
So He's,
he starts,

3285
02:09:44,641 --> 02:09:45,474
uh,
this is Jim Baker's what he looks like 

3286
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:48,160
now.
He's got himself a new Tammy Faye.

3287
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:50,580
And so he's got all those buckets of 
food behind him.

3288
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,680
That's him right there.
And that's his new gal.

3289
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:55,780
I could not have picked him out of a 
lineup and look at it.

3290
02:09:55,781 --> 02:09:58,030
So this is buckets of food that he's 
selling.

3291
02:09:58,610 --> 02:10:00,010
He's hilarious.
And to the right,

3292
02:10:00,011 --> 02:10:05,011
what does that buckets of milk new bulk 
sampler bundle?

3293
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,230
Twenty 3,375
servings.

3294
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,810
Only 2000,
$500 by the way.

3295
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:13,930
That's really a bargain.
And half of that goes to Jesus and look,

3296
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,820
it's got.
He's got a shovel with this.

3297
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:17,610
Why do you have a shovel?
Well,

3298
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:21,550
for Aiden,
I guess cook on that shovel.

3299
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:24,220
I'll get those two guys.
Jesus Christ man.

3300
02:10:24,450 --> 02:10:29,450
Scoop in that bulk sampler bundle.
Reaching in and eaten it.

3301
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:33,050
What the fuck is he eating?
So why is he doing the.

3302
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:34,440
If you could just eat it with his hand.
This.

3303
02:10:34,450 --> 02:10:36,980
He's an animal.
So that's how he eats pussy to.

3304
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:39,710
Gets right in there.
Just picks them up by the ass.

3305
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:42,500
Now obviously Bill Clinton one more 
time.

3306
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,210
Yeah,
let's end on the bill.

3307
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:49,430
You had to end up with Alex Super App.
That's like curry looks very appetizing.

3308
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:53,090
Psycho,
wonderful butterscotch pudding type of.

3309
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:56,013
And who doesn't want it?
There's an apocalypse who doesn't want 

3310
02:10:57,921 --> 02:10:59,690
to just have buckets of putting in line 
around.

3311
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3312
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,420
So that's what the shovels for.
Yeah.

3313
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:05,593
Jesus Christ.
He is going to have diarrhea like 

3314
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:09,040
nobody's business as soon as commercial.
So she's.

3315
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,180
Oh,
she uses a scenario,

3316
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:14,210
Tammy Faye.
A powerful good times.

3317
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:15,643
So let's,
uh,

3318
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:16,513
let's put,
put,

3319
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:19,540
pull up that Ivanka video one more time.
We'll watch this one.

3320
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:22,340
We'll send you off into the bit.
You want to give a plug to your security

3321
02:11:22,341 --> 02:11:23,800
company.
You know,

3322
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:24,693
I always,
always happy to mention that diligence 

3323
02:11:25,581 --> 02:11:26,414
for all your intelligence and security 
risk mitigation needs work with 

3324
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,570
operations and stuff.
Here it is.

3325
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:32,690
Oh,
here we go.

3326
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:36,590
Here we go.
Good job.

3327
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,590
Good job of Funko.
Fight in that lower lip.

3328
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:42,840
So I think if you just started,
we just started gyrating.

3329
02:11:43,450 --> 02:11:44,540
Here it comes here,
comes to the look.

3330
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:48,160
Fantastic.
She's just glaring error.

3331
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:52,190
It is.
He took a look at her face.

3332
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,613
Oh Nah,
she nods and she's fucking burning on 

3333
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,640
bad luck.
Oh,

3334
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:05,510
she's so pretty though.
So looks like a young Tracy Lord.

3335
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,990
On that note.
No gentleman.

3336
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:10,200
Mike Baker.
Uh,

3337
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:12,050
Joseph.
Thank you brother.

3338
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:14,860
Thanks for coming back and falls apart.
We'll see you in six months.

3339
02:12:14,861 --> 02:12:16,760
At least explain to us what happened,
what went wrong.

3340
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,020
I will.
I'll do it.

3341
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:18,980
I'll do it.
You got my word.

3342
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:20,000
All right folks,
that's it.

3343
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,133
We will be back on Sunday.
So we're not going to be here for the 

3344
02:12:23,841 --> 02:12:24,674
fight companion on Saturday,
but we're going to play the fights and 

3345
02:12:26,991 --> 02:12:27,824
not watch them.
So I'm not watching them on Saturday 

3346
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,913
night.
I'm going to record them here and then 

3347
02:12:31,581 --> 02:12:35,090
we're going to come in on Sunday and 
it's going to be branded shop.

3348
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,950
Eddie Bravo,
Brian Cowen,

3349
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:37,784
and my pal Jimmy Burke.
It's going to be a good God damn time 

3350
02:12:40,341 --> 02:12:41,174
folks.
So if you want to get in with us Sunday 

3351
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:44,890
7:00
PM Pacific,

3352
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:47,810
don't watch the fights before then.
We'll have it on record.

3353
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,580
Will probably fast forward through the 
commercials.

3354
02:12:49,581 --> 02:12:51,560
I don't know how we're going to do that.
We'll figure it out.

3355
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,550
See you soon.
Bye.

3356
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:02,273
Mm.
