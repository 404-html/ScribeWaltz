1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
The cord to Sir.
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,860
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,640
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for flashlight and enter in the

4
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:16,410
code name Brogan, you will get 15%
off the number one sex toy for men.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,330
It's the number one cause. It's awesome.
It feels wicked good on your penis.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,680
With that said, my pal Duncan
trussell's here, buckle up bitches.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,870
Here we go. Better late than
never going to experience my girls

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,160
with such a long absence of two weeks
off the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:49,161
you were Jones and I was Jones and we
had to bring you back the three most

10
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:54,210
pertinent guests in the same week. Joe
Diaz, Ari Shaffir and they'll finally,

11
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,950
Duncan Trussell my favorite
buddy. Hi, I'm, I'm,

12
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,590
I'm psyched to have you on for a whole
bunch of reasons because there's a bunch

13
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,220
of nutty shit that's been going down
that we must discuss. All right.

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,960
Did you hear about the Cork Glue on a
particle that the large Hadron collider

15
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,100
has created? No. Oh,
this is fantastic stuff.

16
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,430
We talked about it yesterday or
Monday or yesterday. Okay. Yesterday,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,570
one sugar tube of this shit
weighs 40 billion pounds. Wow.

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,910
It's more dense than a neutron star.
It's like the singer,

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,760
single densest piece of matter
that that theoretically is,

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,640
is physically possible and
they created it. What w

21
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,860
they created it and what happened exactly
as it go through the ground and the

22
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:42,370
fucking, who knows? You have a marble,
you drop the marble and the ground.

23
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,700
It shoots right through China,

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,230
comes out an exit wound like Kennedy's
head and then it goes back down and goes,

25
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,320
it's like a nonstop thing. You like
gravity, you know what you mean?

26
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,770
Comes up and down through the
earth. The earth, I think I own, hi.

27
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,010
What the fuck does, I think I
heard something. Not about this,

28
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:01,510
but the possibility of this and how that
could be one of the possible extinction

29
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:05,430
events is that it sets off a chain
reaction and sucks everything in. Yeah.

30
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,920
Oh my God. Well, if you think
about the idea of that this,

31
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:14,390
this cork glue on thing, the idea
that they can create this, you know,

32
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,720
this is the bottom line about all this
shit is it's never going to stop right

33
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,020
there.

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,470
No way they're going to keep going and
if they can create something that's this

35
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,420
heavy,
what if they created enough of it?

36
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,510
We're really is like something that
goes through the fucking earth.

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,780
If you had something that was
so heavy that it would like,

38
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,830
you would drop it and it would just
shoot down through the earth. Yeah.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,740
Where would it stop? It
wouldn't, would it? I don't know.

40
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:41,450
I mean if it's so heavy that it smashes
rock and then when it hits the core,

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,390
what happens?
Does the core melted?

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,220
Is it it? Maybe it gets melted in
the core. It makes a volcano. Yeah.

43
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,140
What does it make a new volcano?
I mean,

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,090
does it matter how big this cork gluon
plasma? We're talking probably a tiny,

45
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,520
tiny thing. Yeah. It's
nothing like a micro meteorite

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,420
or something. Yeah, it's, it's the,

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,780
the crazy thing is these guys
that are doing this stuff,

48
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,410
they all know that this is crazy
and they're joking around about it.

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,680
So there's some photos now
of them playing half life.

50
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,420
If you just look up large Hadron collider
is guys get theater theatrical with

51
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,730
halflife street theater.
There's them, he's got, uh,

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,370
the orange safety helmet on just like the
half life of character with a crow bar.

53
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,860
And the other guys got like a head
crab on. Have you seen it? You seen it?

54
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,990
I just opened it. It's hilarious. They
know what the fuck they're doing. I mean,

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,330
I guess they just,
you just have to keep doing it,

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,340
but they're aware of it and all
the while there's this wall,

57
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,210
this all comes out.

58
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:45,211
This is a cosmologists have
reconciled this a seemingly impossible

59
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,410
contradiction. The contradiction of the
super position. Contradiction, you know,

60
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:55,060
the super position is that something can
exist and not exist at the same time.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,650
And there's two different,
there's,

62
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:01,180
there's the multiverse theory and
there's the many worlds theory.

63
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,450
And apparently they figured out some
way to reconcile these two theories.

64
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,140
It's so hard to fucking understand.
It's like,

65
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,150
it's so difficult to wrap my
brain around, you know, I'm,

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm just not really smart enough or
have enough experience with this kind of

67
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:22,540
shit. But, you know, the observability
of the universe, it's like,

68
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,740
it's when you get down to a quantum
particles, when you get down to, you know,

69
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,470
subatomic particles,
it gets really weird.

70
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,780
It's a hard to understand
how this can be real,

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,550
that something can appear and disappear
and no one knows where it went.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,750
And they can also appear in both, in two
different positions at the same time.

73
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,010
And it's the same particle.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,600
Isn't there also something where
apparently your expectation of the thing

75
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,650
somehow impacts it? The viewer, they
don't understand that either. You know,

76
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,640
there's, it's really hard for me to
explain it without butchering it,

77
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,000
but you can look up Dr Quantum,
you know, there's some,

78
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:02,680
some videos of it online where it's
explained in cartoons for complete retards

79
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:05,670
like you and I, and it's
basically they, you know,

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
they shoot these particles and there's
a different reaction when people are

81
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:12,810
watching then when people aren't
watching, you know, and uh,

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,030
the idea that something is
in a superposition basically
means it could be in

83
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,280
motion and it can be
still at the same time.

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,210
It's like the way they describe it as the,

85
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,870
it's like you cannot see a dead cat and
a live cat that have the same cat at the

86
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,340
same time.
You know?

87
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,730
And the idea that a lot of people
believe is that every single possibility

88
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:39,010
happens for every single it.
Like say you open up a door,

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,240
every fucking possible thing
happens once you open up that door.

90
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,040
Infinite possibilities,
but not to you, to you.

91
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,510
One thing happens and you live in this
one dimension. And in this one dimension,

92
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,920
this one thing happens.
And for everyone else,

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,561
you know,

94
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:02,561
or all these other use that exist in an
infinite number of different universes.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,970
You don't experience that,

96
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,850
but it happens. That's why goals are so
important because when you have a goal,

97
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,780
you're setting something in the future,
which is,

98
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,330
if you think about things in
the way you just described it,

99
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,340
what you're really thinking about is in
this great array of possibilities in the

100
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:22,174
future,

101
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,010
there's one node that contains within
it all the different possibilities that

102
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,170
involve whatever your goal happens to be.

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And so the goal becomes literally a kind
of compass that's guiding you toward

104
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:40,120
this place and temporal spatiality
where these things that you want to have

105
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,750
happen happen. That's what everybody
says. If you want to be successful,

106
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,870
have a goal, and you know when I
want, before I knew about this,

107
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,300
I used to think that meant yes,

108
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,570
because it will give me the discipline
in the motivation to work towards what I

109
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:53,260
want.

110
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,260
But metaphysically you may actually be
sort of guiding the ship of your life

111
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,751
towards this temporal possibility and
then getting the things that you want.

112
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:04,680
It's a lot of

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,370
right. But there's also the problem of
the cynic in the cynic point of view,

114
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:13,400
which, you know, Penn and teller or
big cynics on that bullshit show.

115
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,440
And I really liked Penn Jillette.
He's a very fun guy. And uh,

116
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,340
one of the things that he really nailed
is all these assholes that pitch the

117
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,820
secret and you try and tell people with
horrible terminal diseases that it's

118
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:29,110
their fault. But that shit is
ridiculous because it is not absolute.

119
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,000
It does not work in all circumstances.

120
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,720
And little babies are not responsible
for getting hit by bullets and drive bys.

121
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,390
Cause that shit does happen. So it
is not, it's not clean, you know?

122
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,500
Oh No, it's not clean. But if you
want to get really weird, if you,

123
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,100
if we're talking about
this idea that you're,

124
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,540
your perception and faith
guide you into the different,

125
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,840
all the different universes that exist,
then Penn and teller,

126
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,530
there's such skeptical assholes that
maybe they've guided themselves into a

127
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:56,960
universe of absolute boring bullshit.

128
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,410
Those guys just want to live in a world
of like, you know, what's it called?

129
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,580
Newtonian physics where everything comes
from an accident and all that stuff.

130
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,310
It's the religion that's
the religion of the day.

131
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,031
So you're,

132
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:12,110
what you're saying is that because
they've refused to believe in any psychic

133
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,040
phenomenon,

134
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,650
they refuse to believe in anything
trippy or woo woo that they're,

135
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,160
they live in a limited world.

136
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,770
Penn and teller should know
my mom got bone cancer.

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,670
My mom went to a faith
healer. My, my mom, uh,

138
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,390
her bone cancer is now like almost gone.
You tell me.

139
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,330
We did the faith healer do it.
Was it her faith that did it?

140
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,350
It's fucking bone cancer.
Masta ties breast cancer into our bones,

141
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,700
her tumor markers.

142
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:42,930
That's how they measure bone cancer or
less than when she went in and got the

143
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:47,280
original diagnosis. So it's
reversing, it's going backwards now.

144
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,660
He went to a faith healer. I'm not a liar.
I don't, you know what I mean? I'm not, I,

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,110
I'm not making this shit up, dude. Do
I think it could be other things? Sure.

146
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,830
Probably a combination of everything.
But that was on medication as well. Yeah,

147
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,690
she was. She was, she was,

148
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,570
and she also cut sugar out and there's
a lot of different things that she did,

149
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,800
but one component of it was
this event that she went to.

150
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,180
Now do I believe in faith
healers? Nah, no, I don't.

151
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,480
But I do believe that if somebody can
create the illusion in the mind of a

152
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,010
person,
some kind of event,

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,190
to give them the faith to believe
that they can heal themselves,

154
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,350
then maybe that works. The
mind controls that. I mean,
think about it. Your body is,

155
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,580
when cancer happens in your DNA starts
fucking up. That's part of your body.

156
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,120
That's you, yourselves. Are
you, your neurons are you?

157
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,880
It's all you to think that
you can't control that.

158
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,330
The thing that some deeper part of
you can't control that. It's crazy.

159
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,164
Of course you could.

160
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,470
Is it that or is it that this faith healer
puts her on this incredibly positive

161
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,410
vibration and because of the fact that
he thinks that this woman or this was it

162
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,940
a woman or she thinks she
was a woman or as a man,

163
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,230
my mom was your mom a metal?
Are you saying?

164
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,273
I never checked.

165
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,440
You don't know if the faith healer
or as a man or a woman of faith,

166
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:07,980
you are as a man. His name's John
of God. Well, maybe your mom,

167
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,300
because of the fact that she so
believes and so needs this to happen.

168
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:16,980
She goes and maybe all the sudden she
has this incredible feeling of positive

169
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:21,981
expectations and instead of doom and
gloom and that's enough to turn things

170
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:25,680
around. That's it. That's what I did.
Then she's also on medication too, dude,

171
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:30,630
you gotta you have to, the idea is it's
like you're not medication. You know?

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,690
I don't know.
Bone Marrow River where

173
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,860
you're, you're, you're in a way your
phone away. That's not what you want.

174
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:45,810
You want bone come back. You're,
you're, you're not just your mind.

175
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,910
You're not just your body.
So it's like,

176
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,920
I think you'd have to
address the problem with,

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,220
well you are just your mind and your body,
but it's all one unit.

178
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,380
You are,
you want to address each piece,

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,680
each piece of the puzzle,
like give your mind something to work on.

180
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:05,940
Your mind is dealing with the horror of
riding around in a car that's breaking

181
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:08,010
down and it will soon turn into warm food.

182
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,310
That sucks when you have a western
doctor being like, well, you know,

183
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:15,660
statistically, which the
doctor did say to my mom, uh,

184
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,490
she had six months to live and that
was like over a year ago. Uh, the,

185
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,500
the doctor, when your, when
your mind hears that, it's
not like, ah, you know what?

186
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,130
I'm going to really start healing
now. You're just like, fuck,

187
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,810
I'm dead meat. I'm about to go on to
infinity. And so then they're like,

188
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,820
we understand that you're
feeling depression,

189
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,200
so we're going to prescribe
some antidepressants to
you to help you deal with

190
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,120
the sorrow of your own demise.

191
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,430
Now you're fucking with
your brain in the wrong way.

192
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,300
You're messing it up with antidepressant.

193
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,260
They do when people are diagnosed
with terminal cancer that give them

194
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,240
antidepressants, Pallium, Xanax,

195
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:56,020
calm down the anxiety or just going
to relax you and do infinity. Whoa.

196
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,730
That sounds like a good move though.

197
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,590
If you're fucked up on ease your mind
bone cancer. Yeah, no. If it's a wrap,

198
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,210
it's a wrap. Right. And when it's
going to be a wrath eventually for all,

199
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,080
what would it be better to go
out? No, that's the problem man.

200
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:12,360
Especially with the problem
with cancer is that, um,

201
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,400
we've heard so much stuff about
it that you hear, you know,

202
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,750
the cancer diagnosis for a lot of people,
you're like, I'm dead. Right. But, um,

203
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,340
one of the other things that my mom did,

204
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,510
and there's some great books out there
that are, uh, basically say that,

205
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,480
uh,
cancer loves sugar.

206
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,890
So if you're fucking drinking
a lot of sugar sugary stuff,

207
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,150
then the tumors will grow faster.
So somehow cancer doesn't do that well.

208
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:41,240
And then an acidic environment.
So if you start drinking alkaline,

209
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,120
alkaline, alkaline. Yeah.

210
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,090
So it's something like drinking lemon
juice and all this stuff. Healthy

211
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,560
for a lot of Greens, a lot of, uh, yeah.

212
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,140
Well that's really what's best for the
body. You have to know where our bodies,

213
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:55,220
I mean, the Paleo Diet is one
that's really popular right now.

214
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,160
And the idea is that, you know, during
the caveman days, what do they eat?

215
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,850
They eat vegetables that were edible
and they eat meat. Yeah. You know,

216
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,440
and that's really what
you're supposed to be eating.

217
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:06,970
You're not supposed to be eating any
pastas or grains or anything funky, right.

218
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,940
Anything that people created and
you know, no soups. Gluten. Yeah.

219
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:13,340
You're supposed to eat pasta and I mean,

220
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,090
you're supposed to eat meat and grain
or meat and vegetables. Yeah. No Pasta,

221
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:21,530
no grains, nothing human created. And
just think of yourself as like, you know,

222
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,400
a person living in that era. You know,
really that's the healthiest way to live,

223
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:28,190
man. You know, the healthiest way to
live is to get a lot of vegetables,

224
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,130
a lot of like Broccoli and
anything with like, you know,

225
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:34,550
with fiber that's going to clean
out your colon vitamins. You know,

226
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,890
Brock Lesnar had to go
in for a colon surgery.

227
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,150
He had diver diverticulitis that
you get from eating too much meat.

228
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,440
It's a disease that you get from
literally not having vegetables and it's a

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,640
terrible one where your guts rot out.
It's really scary shit.

230
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,280
Can I tell you guys something
that's really embarrassing
that has to do with uh,

231
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,630
in tennis.
[inaudible] um,

232
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,350
this sounds so stupid and someone
sent me this video as a joke,

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,120
which is this guy showing how
to shit what? Yeah, the Western,

234
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,230
I was using one of those platforms that
you put over the toilet feed up on this

235
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:12,760
platform. Yeah. Cause that's the healthy
way to squat. Did this technique,

236
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,330
and I have to tell you,
I am shitting like a 10 year old.

237
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,900
It's the craziest fucking thing ever.

238
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,710
Possibly even mean you shouldn't,
we haven't brought you shooting before.

239
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,370
Where you having promised shitting before
w no, not having problems shitting,

240
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:31,150
but it's like, you know like people,
Americans will sit on the toilet and read.

241
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,770
Right, right. I'm going to read a book.

242
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,370
It's like shitting is not supposed to
take that lock. Yeah. Look at your dog.

243
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,140
How long does it take your dog to shit.

244
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,130
If your dog takes longer than like a
minute to shit, your automatic like,

245
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,970
oh something's wrong.
Something's wrong with the dog food.

246
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,760
That's exactly right.
And that's why you're a scientist.

247
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,870
No Man. I, the problem is, is
like joy it though it's more of a,

248
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,500
I enjoy the whole process. I could
squirt it out real quick if I want it to,

249
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,490
but I enjoy it feels good.
Joy having turds. Yes.

250
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,170
You don't enjoy taking a nice shit.

251
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,350
Hmm.

252
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,860
Do you? I love it. I love it to him. I'm
going to say his favorite activities,

253
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,860
especially when I eat a lot of lettuce
and it just comes on nice and loose shows.

254
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,050
Ah, yeah. But it's not
something I look forward to.

255
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,150
I like the little plop splash
that plops back and I'm like,

256
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:24,610
gives you a little kiss on your butt
hole from little piece of water.

257
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,530
You don't look forward to it.
Like when you're coming home,

258
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,970
you're entered into the
door and you're like,

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,020
I am going to take a giant shit right now.
You don't look forward to that.

260
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,410
Well now of course. I mean I wouldn't,
looking forward to it. It's like a weird,

261
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,400
like I, I look forward to it. The walking
dead, the second season coming out.

262
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,720
That's, I look forward to you
don't look forward to a shit.

263
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,750
Okay.

264
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,540
It's not, I mean, yeah. Okay, fine.
I look forward to it, but it's not,

265
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,070
it doesn't take up my time.
I'm not like,

266
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,930
I'm not listening to love songs on my
radio therapist about potty over there.

267
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,820
I know how many times a day do your shit.

268
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,820
I shit once a day.

269
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,280
All right. Wow. That's it.

270
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,980
So you're not enjoying Coby this crazy
fucking African African you to change

271
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,371
your diet.

272
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:06,960
You're supposed to shit twice a day
should all three times a day probably.

273
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,610
If you eat a lot more, you're
supposed to, first of all,

274
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:12,070
you're supposed to eat several meals a
day and that's supposed to be just one or

275
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,970
two meals a day,
right?

276
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,610
If you want to be lean and
healthy and have a lot of energy,

277
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,670
the key is to not having your body in
a constant state of digestion, right?

278
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,480
So your body is wanting to
adjusting minimal amounts,

279
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,210
not some big fucking giant gorging meal
that just rent your whole system. Well,

280
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,960
if you do that,
what's that stuff going to do?

281
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,970
It's going to sit inside you and wait
for the one big evacuation event at the

282
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,180
end of the night. No, it's going to shit
throughout the day. It's going to be done,

283
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,560
was going to push it out.

284
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,893
Gotcha.

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,280
So, um, have you, because of your mom's
situation, have you changed your diet?

286
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,710
Any of you started getting like
conscious about what you eat?

287
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,600
Uh, you know, not because of my
mom's situation weirdly, but, um, I,

288
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,960
I did start taking vitamins a and,

289
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:57,810
and I've started taking this
stuff called fanning and Relora,

290
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,530
which lowers the,
uh,

291
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,520
there's a chemical in your
body associated with stress.

292
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,210
It gets released by your
adrenal gland and it has some,

293
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,250
apparently lowers the amount of that
stuff in your body. What's it called? Uh,

294
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:17,100
one of the pills is called
[inaudible] and I guess t, h, e,

295
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,520
t, h, e, n, and the other stuff is
called rural Laura. And one's like this.

296
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,920
It's one of them's like more
relaxing than the other.

297
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:28,390
You take it at night and the
other one is just a it like,

298
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,620
I don't know if you'd call it a no.
Tropic new tropic. How do you say it?

299
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,000
Nootropic yeah, new tropics. It
does say on the thing, you know,

300
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,760
helps focus and I have to agree.
It really does

301
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,470
wait to try this new tropic formula that
we've, we've come out with. We're a,

302
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,680
we're finalizing it and they'd just
finished the formula that this guy,

303
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,990
Chris Markus, have you tried any
of it? You've been trying it.

304
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm done with my supply. This, this
shit gives you the most fucked up,

305
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:58,410
vivid dreams ever. I'm going to get
you some last night. Here's my dream.

306
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,800
My, the House that I grew up in,
Arnold Schwarzenegger lives in it,

307
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,230
but it's not the house I grew up in.

308
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:08,790
It's some weird house that's on the
rocks right in front of water that

309
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,800
apparently is semi public.

310
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,690
So Arnold Schwarzenegger is living
there now and he's like swimming around.

311
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,630
But all these people are staring at him
because of his situation and because of

312
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,590
the scandal. But he doesn't give a
fuck. Not only is he not give a fuck,

313
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,170
but he's in really good
shape now in my dream.

314
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,210
And he keeps wanting to pull his balls
out and now he's, he pull his balls out,

315
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,620
but he puts his little bikini
underwear on, like, you
know, like a Frenchman would,

316
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,463
where I was like,

317
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,850
and he pulls his ball somehow or another
through the back of his underwear and

318
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,520
there where his ass cheeks
are and they're giant.

319
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,940
These giant balls that he has hanging
outside of his underwear by his ass hall.

320
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,390
Somehow or another, they're that
big. And you know, he's an old man,

321
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:59,391
but he looks spectacular and he moves
like with confidence and grace and dives

322
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,210
into the water. And I'm like, I gotta
get my wife away from this motherfucker.

323
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,790
I'm looking at this old crazy man,

324
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,630
like he's just going to fuck every
woman within a, um, a mile radius.

325
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:14,330
And it's like, he has
no, no inhibitions, no,

326
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,480
no worries about it.

327
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,690
And all these people were watching him
and there's a family that's sitting

328
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,150
behind this rock and they're
like, you know, there's,

329
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,030
they're sitting there watching
Arnold moving around swimming.

330
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,320
He keeps taking his pants off.

331
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,740
He keeps taking his bikini bottoms
off and like washing. And what shop,

332
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,230
whatever it is. It's some crazy,
well, I don't know what it mean.

333
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,140
Freud would have a fucking
field day with this chair.

334
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,170
Like what is this dream
supposed to represent? Well,
terrified of Arnold Swartz.

335
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:44,280
And I would love to have seen your face
while dreaming and just like the little

336
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,790
flinches and your face with it,
whether they were filings or fear.

337
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,010
Yeah. Well you have to look at
it like this. Uh, they say, uh,

338
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,270
one way to analyze dreams as you look
at every part of a dream is a projection

339
00:19:55,271 --> 00:20:00,160
of some aspect of your life. So Arnold
Schwarzenegger, isn't that your id?

340
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
Isn't that your lower primal self? Some
kind of like that. That would be that the,

341
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,040
the dry, the sex drive,
the like the drive,

342
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,950
the power drive. So you're kind of
vanity drive. He's a bodybuilder.

343
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,160
That's like the most vain thing you could
possibly do. And then the public ocean,

344
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,800
you could say, well the
public ocean, that's your, um,

345
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,400
is that your public life is that you're
doing the podcast and you kind of like

346
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,920
have all your shit in front of everyone
on the planet and so you're seeing like

347
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:34,580
a projection of your ed swimming
through are reacting to like,

348
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,310
I think I'm thinking about
all sorts of negritude. Yeah,

349
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,090
we talked about yesterday.
I don't think it's me.

350
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,780
I don't think that represents me. I see
where you're going with that. But no,

351
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,760
because what this represents to me now,

352
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,480
when I found out that he fucked his maid
and they shot Lowe's and it was made in

353
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,270
that apparently he was doing it for a
long time. What he represents to me,

354
00:20:55,271 --> 00:21:00,271
it's like this almost like unbridled
hedonist that regardless of the stakes of,

355
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,080
you know, of whatever fucked
up thing that he does sexually.

356
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,590
You now he's the governor,
he's a giant movie star,

357
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,350
multimillionaire married to a Kennedy,

358
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:16,351
basically Shriver's she's some sort of
a Kennedy right in into this respectable

359
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:17,740
family,

360
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,380
but yet banging maids fucking all
sorts of checks all over the planet.

361
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,170
I'm sure he just never pulled
it back, you know? And that's,

362
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,370
that to me is amazing. There's
something about it in, in my dream,

363
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:34,120
he was just completely without,
without remorse.

364
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,140
When in my dream he was owning it and
my dream, he was, you know, this is me.

365
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:43,020
I'm this crazy freak. I'm out here.
I bathe, I UC my balls, you know?

366
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,950
I mean, that was who he was. In my dream,

367
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:48,670
we've smiling and laughing and waving
to people and he didn't give a fuck,

368
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,330
you know, but in real life, I mean the
poor guy is falling apart and real life.

369
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:57,040
He's a 60 year old man, kicked out of his
house, you know, and his family knows, he,

370
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,850
he, you know, he had a child the
literally two weeks apart from the,

371
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:05,640
his own child with the maid, the maid
that was there made for 20 fucking years.

372
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,210
You think will survive all this. I know
you will. No, no, that's a wrap. Yeah.

373
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,560
You think like, if you made a
termino fought fire right now,

374
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,050
Don people are done with him.
How could he do this, this, this,

375
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,470
this is what I think. I mean, it's
possible. Anything can happen.

376
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,820
I might be just talking out of my ass.

377
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,990
I'm the first one to say I'm amazed
at some of the people that have made

378
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,350
comebacks. You know, we'll look at Bill
Clinton. Bill Clinton's a respectable,

379
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,910
you know, former president
now, dude, I remember when I
was, it was during the 90s.

380
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:34,710
Well, we were working on news radio and
the Monica Lewinsky scandal went town. Uh,

381
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,140
Bill Clinton, man, dude,
they, hey, you need him.

382
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,110
If you listened to Republican radio,
which I used to listen to all the time,

383
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,570
there are people that wanted him dead.

384
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,840
They thought that he
represented everything foul
about the world and the fact

385
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,050
that they caught him getting head from
some 20 year old girl and then lying

386
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,830
about it. And then they drag him. I
mean, they impeached him. You know,

387
00:22:56,831 --> 00:23:00,700
people think impeach means kicked out
of office. It's not what it means.

388
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:01,860
Would impeach means you,

389
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,350
you bring someone in to decide whether
or not you're kicking them out of office.

390
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,400
And that's what they did with him. Man,
they sat him down and he had to say,

391
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,970
that is not my recollection of
the war. You know, that's not,

392
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,880
what is the word? You know? He's talking
about the word, you know, sex. The,

393
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,130
I didn't, I did not have sexual relations
as I took it to mean sexual relations,

394
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,220
you know, and they can't even say,
what the fuck are you saying, man?

395
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,690
It's the worst man.
Wait,

396
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,870
when whenever I really start feeling
like we live in an advanced civilization

397
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,870
and what really, I had a hard
time and we're really doing it.

398
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,770
Then I hear about this sexually
repressed bullshit where like, so what?

399
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,970
Swartz and Agar, God, his fucking
made pregnant Clinton got a blow job.

400
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,740
Who Cares?
Meanwhile,

401
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,660
George Bush is fucking dropping bombs
on Iraqi babies and everybody's like,

402
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,010
it's fine. He's a great
president. He's killing humans.

403
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
Well,
I liked it out.

404
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,880
The Obama's doing it in the liberals
aren't saying a fucking boy.

405
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,170
Isn't that the greatest
hypocrisy of all time? Amazing.

406
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,990
Somehow because Obama's dropping
bombs on Libya, it's okay.

407
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,500
All those democratic actors that love
to talk during table readings and where

408
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:09,550
Obama pins, you can all go suck my dick
or stupid you guys. You're all dumb.

409
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,750
You all got sucked into a system and he's
done a lot of other great stuff. Yeah,

410
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,430
he's, he is the same thing as Bush.
He's just showing them. Yeah. You know,

411
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,140
Georgia Bill Mar,

412
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:22,390
which is what I thought you were talking
when we have a conversation before

413
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,800
podcasts.
We talked about it yesterday,

414
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,010
how Bill Maher had this really brilliant
point about how he calls himself a

415
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:31,030
Christian and yet when they were asking
him about Osama bin Laden's death,

416
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,511
he was like,

417
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,820
anybody who questions whether or not
that's good should have their mind,

418
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,590
their head checked, you know, like,

419
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
which is nothing like Christianity's
nothing like Christian doctrine.

420
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,270
There hasn't been a Christian
president for a long,

421
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:47,950
I'd like a Christian president. I'd
love to see. That would be a real one.

422
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,030
It'd be a real one. Would be Ron Paul.
Yes. Ron Paul has a legit Christian.

423
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:56,340
He's so legitimate. He doesn't even
believe in evolution. You Know Ron Paul,

424
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,470
thanks. Scott says, well,
he's not stupid, man. Look,

425
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:04,240
he's got some wacky ass fucking ideas,
but he, he believes in creationism,

426
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,610
you know,
and look,

427
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,750
life itself is fucking beyond
bizarre. All right. I'm,

428
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,570
I'm not ruling out the
possibility of creationism,

429
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,520
but when you start
talking about evolution,

430
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,580
just being a theory and you don't
necessarily agree with that theory,

431
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,260
like you're in Wacko Ville. Like evolution
is not just a theory, it's provable.

432
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,900
There's like there's
transitionary fossils, there's,

433
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:30,670
there's thousands of scientists
for hundreds of years
have been collecting data

434
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,910
and they can show natural adaptation.
They can show change,

435
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:37,120
they can show things in our lifetime.
We could show about humans,

436
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:40,020
especially like men in
Tibet that have gone, uh,

437
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,290
that live at very high altitudes and their
bodies have changed and evolved to be

438
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,960
very different from our bodies.
Yeah. And they've done this to,

439
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,950
to adapt to this really harsh new
environment. It's just what happens man,

440
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,200
if you read the trial
ogs, yes. The Mckenna.

441
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,490
Yeah. Rupert Sheldrake. Yeah. When they
start talking about the morphogenic field.

442
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,330
Yeah. So that like the idea is that
like, and, and so the evolution,

443
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:08,080
like their idea of evolution, they, they,
they asked this really awesome question,

444
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:10,750
which is like, you have Newtonian
physics, the laws of the universe,

445
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,830
how the universe works.

446
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,550
And some people apparently think that
these laws of the universe are eternal

447
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:18,910
laws never changing. They don't
evolve. Everything else is evolving,

448
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,040
but the laws of the
universe stay the same.

449
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,240
And so the awesome question they ask
is, well, okay, where, where did,

450
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,990
where did these laws exist before
the big bank? What did they exist in?

451
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:32,380
Some kind of bizarre field that it's like,
you know,

452
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,490
the Mckenna has some awesome name, 40 puts
hyper, he attaches hyper to everything.

453
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:39,880
So I'm kind of like hyperspace
she all platonic field, but like,

454
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,740
where do they exist? Do they
exist there? So they're awesome.

455
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:48,741
Crazy idea is this thing called a super
attractor that exist in the future,

456
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,360
which is like this perfect form.

457
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,220
This like the mckinna freely uses the
word God because he's not afraid to use

458
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,420
words to like, you know, put
handles on things. But, uh,

459
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,900
it's this idea of this super
perfection that exists in the future.

460
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,330
Kind of like the ultimate goal.
Like what we're talking about.

461
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:07,830
And it's so powerful.

462
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,730
It's trends in dental object at the end
of time and it's pulling us towards it.

463
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,790
And so evolution is literally is us
being drawn into a relationship with this

464
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:22,680
perfect form and shifting to become it,
to like transform into it.

465
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,090
And that's what the, the force of
evolution has now. You know, creationism,

466
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,240
it's almost the reverse of
creationism or something.

467
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,090
It's like the creator instead of
existing at the beginning of time,

468
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,770
blasting out everything is somehow
sitting at the end of time,

469
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,950
sucking everything into itself,
which is

470
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,860
pretty cool. Yeah. Well,
there's a law or, or,

471
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,250
or rule or an ethic to
the universe and that's a,

472
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:51,250
things keep getting more and more complex.
Things don't seem to simplify, right?

473
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,020
Nothing in our lifetime does at least
nothing that we can observe over the

474
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,410
course of the life of the earth does
from the earth cooling to earth,

475
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:02,700
developing single cell
organisms to multicell organisms
and flowering plant life

476
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:05,850
after the, you know, the
Yucatan crater after the, the,

477
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,310
the big explosion that
killed the dinosaurs.

478
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,730
I mean everything just keeps getting more
and more and more and more complex to

479
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,560
the invention of course,
of electronics.

480
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:17,820
And that's where things have gotten
really particularly bizarre because if you

481
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:22,020
look at life and you look at electronics
and you know you were objective,

482
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:26,160
you are not a human being,
you are not a carbon based life form.

483
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,280
You were just something without form
that objectifies or disseminates

484
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:35,610
information. Something that looks at all
the, the data and comes to a conclusion.

485
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,260
Well if you looked at the human life on
this planet and then you looked at the

486
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,790
life of technology, man, um,

487
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,470
I know technology doesn't have cells
and I know technology doesn't have

488
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,850
fingernails and shit like that, but God
dammit, isn't it growing with us? It,

489
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:54,510
isn't it evolving with us and are there
dead ones that are just laying around

490
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,880
just like old fossils and bodies at apple,

491
00:28:56,881 --> 00:29:00,390
two computer that you have sitting in
your fucking garage and we turn on,

492
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,250
it doesn't really work anymore,
but you still keep it.

493
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,090
That's like your grandma's body.
You know, that's a dead body man.

494
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,070
And we have a symbiotic relationship
with this stuff now. Whereas, you know,

495
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,510
like I've talked about this many times,

496
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:16,950
I leave the fucking house
without my phone. I'm scared.
I am a lost in the world.

497
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:21,810
I am such a little bitch. I can't drive
in my car without my phone. And I'm like,

498
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:23,860
what do I have to goals and money?
I,

499
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,330
I'm terrified that I don't know
anybody's phone number anymore.

500
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,330
I know like four or five people's
phone numbers. Right. You know?

501
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:33,840
So if I went to a payphone when
goodluck fucking finding one,

502
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,490
are there any payphones anywhere?

503
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,870
I would have to go to like a seven
11 and buy one of those rechargeable,

504
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,150
you know, those are reusable
phones. Yeah. Murder phones. Those,

505
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,550
one of those a fair
phones. And, and you know,

506
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,140
and try to like figure out how
to call people. They're fun.

507
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,740
Well that's what I was thinking
they use them for. Right.

508
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,590
I always feel like they use
them for crime and for affairs.

509
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,610
Yeah. Um, have you seen uh, the
transcendent man? Yes. You saw that? Yeah.

510
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,020
Which is incredible. Amazing.
What is it? It's cursed

511
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,090
well, uh, is a, uh,

512
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,280
they call them a futurist and he's
responsible for many, many patents.

513
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,710
He's a brilliant,
brilliant man and um,

514
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,970
he is a huge proponent of the idea
of the technological singularity.

515
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,360
And the idea behind that is that one
day artificial intelligence is going to

516
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,530
literally and virtually come alive and
we're going to merge with it somehow.

517
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,270
We are either going to be downloaded into
computers or consciousness is going to

518
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:35,290
be replicated and indistinguishable from
our current consciousness and that will

519
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,830
be downloaded into computers and
though our biological body will die,

520
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,470
are RF electronic signal,

521
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:44,770
that is our consciousness that has
been recreated. Like, you know,

522
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:48,520
like you copy a Microsoft word
file. Yeah. You will copy your mind.

523
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,460
You will copy your consciousness,
your soul. Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:54,670
You will copy something and
you will put it into this,

525
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,040
whatever the fuck it is
that holds all this stuff.

526
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,310
But what we're saying is that life is
almost completely connected to technology

527
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:08,470
and it's a very, very short time
that this has happened 200 years ago.

528
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,000
There were no cars,
you know,

529
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:14,380
so in those 200 years we have been
connected to cars who was, um,

530
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,010
a really fascinating video that someone
sent me that I put up on Twitter.

531
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,480
I retweeted it the other day.

532
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:22,300
You can find it if you just scour
through my Twitter, but it's a,

533
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:25,360
a time lapse video of,
uh,

534
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,260
of cars moving back and forth on freeways
and how it looks like blood and the

535
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:38,020
car. Yeah. How it looks like the
pulsating of blood coming back and forth,

536
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,250
you know,
I mean it's,

537
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,600
that clearly is the breath of breathing
in and breathing out the, you know,

538
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,670
the heartbeats in and out the cars, leave
the house and come back to the house.

539
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,210
I mean, it really is. It really is like,
that's crazy. It's a type of life form.

540
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,530
It's just, it happens so slowly. All
this traffic sucks my Dick, you know,

541
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:00,090
on the fucking my car is dying,
shit and all these things that you,

542
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:01,630
you micro manage that,

543
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:06,460
that scenario and then you don't see
it as this pulsating thing of of cars

544
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:09,790
coming in and cars going out and how
many of them go in the same God damn

545
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,420
direction? Yeah, every

546
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,240
day. Here's the thing,
man, and this is where the,

547
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,580
I think about this all the time because
the way forever for things to work,

548
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:17,900
the way they're working right now,

549
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,210
which is for there to be capitalism and
there to be super rich people and super

550
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:28,211
poor people in war and all the things
that you know or rather distasteful or

551
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:32,870
seem to be a, I seem to be a
destructive for that, to exist.

552
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,880
Each of those little nodes of
consciousness that represent
that bloodstream have

553
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:41,240
to think they're individuals and have
to think they're more important than all

554
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:45,200
the other ones. So you've got a bunch
of blood cells all thinking, yeah,

555
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,750
I got to get to work. What the fuck's
wrong with this asshole in front of me?

556
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,720
And not realizing they're all
part of this one super organism.

557
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,270
And if somehow everyone's consciousness
shifted from the idea of like,

558
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:59,750
I gotta get to work to whatever
the next thing would be,

559
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:04,640
which is I'm connected to this
super mind that is the planet,

560
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,830
which I think is going to,
that's what the singularity will be.

561
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:10,070
It will be some technologically, uh, uh,

562
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,580
applied empathy that allows everyone
to connect their consciousness to the

563
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,280
mother earth.
Yeah.

564
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:21,020
That moment capitalism kind of ceases
as we know it and capitalism, of course,

565
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:25,610
it's just a, it's a symptom of
something deeper. But that, that model,

566
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,610
the model that's running
everything is no longer possible.

567
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,150
Now,
model encourages a competition.

568
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,210
Not Model encourages people to push and
strive and push beyond their comfort in

569
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:42,410
order to, you know, to create more action
and create more money to create more,

570
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,200
more building, more
construction, more, more things,

571
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,120
more prisons, more la, buying more things,

572
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,500
more diseases so we can have more
realism this out. Yeah. All of it.

573
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,100
It all accelerates. They
invented diseases. It's a,

574
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,980
it's a fascinating thing
man. You know, the, uh,

575
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,970
the idea that everything moves in the
same direction is that the single celled

576
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:09,140
organisms, you know, that, you know, or
even how about we look at blood, you know,

577
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:12,740
when you're talking about it looking
like a blood moving through arteries,

578
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,030
you know, blood is a
single cell, you know,

579
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,080
single cells of blood move as in the
same as this huge animal that has a,

580
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,740
you know,

581
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,740
billions of cells and not just that but
is also a host for all sorts of bacteria

582
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:30,230
and stuff that live inside of our bodies.
But we have to,

583
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,650
in order to keep it going in the
same direction as those cells,

584
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
we have to have all these different little
tools that we use to sort of justify

585
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,610
existence. All these different little
tools like the love of having your baby.

586
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,560
Yeah.
The love of orgasms.

587
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,180
You know the love of going on stage or
of creating something you know or you

588
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:53,120
think about the one thing that's
the most satisfying, you know,

589
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:57,410
outside of childbirth and in having
your own children is creating, you know,

590
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:02,411
people who don't create things I think
as a whole are way less happy than people

591
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,680
who do create things.
And I know dudes that make pool cues.

592
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,450
I know dudes that make belts,

593
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:12,260
they make custom wallets and there's a
something that they get when they like,

594
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:14,050
you know,
I bought a wallet from this dude and you,

595
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,330
you buy a wallet from him and he sells
you the wallet and he made it for you and

596
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:20,570
shit. Like there's a smile that
he has. Like he created something,

597
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:24,650
he created a piece of artwork and
someone else is appreciating a, wow,

598
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:28,880
I love how you did this is wow, this is
awesome work. It's so clean and well done.

599
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:31,310
He's like, thank you. I
like his effort and his,

600
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:34,790
his creativity have gone
into an actual object.

601
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,920
And to us that's very,
very, very satisfying.

602
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,780
And then there's the comedy satisfaction
that you get for performing mean this

603
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:45,000
all we you and I understand. I mean, I
don't understand. I guess it's in music,

604
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,500
it's probably just the same thing.
You meet,

605
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,450
create a song and then people love
that song, creating something in.

606
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,130
Then what are you doing when you creating
something while you're doing the same

607
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,770
fucking thing. You're,
you're pushing the machine,

608
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,270
you're pushing it in your way and
your way is making people happy and,

609
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,680
and giving people some
positive energy by your DVD.

610
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,470
And there's an industry behind that
and they come see what the clubs,

611
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:08,940
and this is industry behind that.

612
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:12,930
Even behind putting gas in their cars
and you know, it's, it's, it's a really,

613
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:16,710
it's amazing how many different pieces
are in place. If you, if you take back,

614
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,820
if you like,
you know,

615
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:22,650
zoom in on the idea of what is creation
and creation is taking something from

616
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,950
the nothingness and bringing
it into the somethingness.

617
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,290
And so you sort of become the doorway
for something that come from the

618
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:30,660
nothingness into the something that's,
so when you're creating,

619
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,960
you're actually experiencing as flow
through from the infinite into the finite.

620
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:40,650
And that I think that is the feeling
that we love so much is that sense of

621
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,783
feeling that,

622
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,180
that thing when you're working on jokes
and all of a sudden it goes from being a

623
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,900
drudge to all of a sudden it's
like, Holy Shit, you know,

624
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:51,520
it's happening and all of a sudden you
get sucked into this weird vacuum and you,

625
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,810
you've written for like two hours
and it feels like a second. You know,

626
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,760
that that sense of being pulled into a
momentary current or something's coming

627
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,970
out of you that's clearly
not necessarily you.

628
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,590
That to me is like one of the ultimate.
It is, it's the ultimate feeling.

629
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:12,540
And I have the, you know, I think if
you go by this idea of this attractor,

630
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
the,
that Mckenna talks about,

631
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:18,990
or this thing that exists and hyperspace
that it's what it wants to come through,

632
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:23,280
I send to this universe that wants
to express itself through us. And,

633
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,450
um, I, I think that's the compulsion
that you're talking about.

634
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:30,640
I think that's an alternative
viewpoint obviously. Um,

635
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,900
there's the cynical way of looking
at it. Like, no, no, no, no.

636
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,770
That's a natural inclination that
people have. Monkeys are curious.

637
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,320
This is what we do.
We think about things.

638
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,770
And every joke that you have was
just priest a cumulation of your life

639
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:47,310
experiences and you're figuring
out a little bit, congratulations.

640
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,080
You're not tapping into the universal
consciousness will be ranked back.

641
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,410
Sarah Pailin is on the line and we're
going to have a nice little sit down with

642
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,870
a future president. The
United States maybe. Huh?

643
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,100
Well let's hope he doesn't fuck anybody
that he's not married to buy imaginary

644
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:05,250
rituals. Uh, th the thing about
it, but you know what I'm saying,

645
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,730
the cynical point of view
about the idea of creativity,

646
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,360
there's something to that point of
view too. You have to address it.

647
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:15,050
You can always go hippie.
And um, one of the things,

648
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,700
I bet I bounced back and
forth. I don't think it is
either, but it is a little. Um,

649
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,250
I bounced back and forth with the
idea of the imagination being a,

650
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,040
almost like when you,

651
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,950
when you have imagination that the
imagination is the real force behind the,

652
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:36,070
the evolution.
What imagination is is we think

653
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,240
of as like, oh, I can see things. I go and
work around problems. I have this idea.

654
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,470
But when you imagine an idea,
when you imagine a product,

655
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:48,510
do you imagine how to design an engine
for a car and you're the first, you know,

656
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,700
your Henry Ford or whoever the fuck made
the first engine. Yeah. When you're,

657
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:56,701
your imagination has this idea for this
thing and then you build it and design

658
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:01,480
it and boom, it's there.
That thought what there,

659
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:05,310
there was no thought of that before
it existed. It's not that it brought,

660
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,900
people were running around thinking of
the car and I know what's going to look

661
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:11,890
like. There was no thought of it.
You created this or it came to you.

662
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,430
There was a something from
nothing. Something from, from,

663
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,130
what is that from the ether.
Something from these.

664
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,200
Even if it's just these synapses
firing in your mind, where is the,

665
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:26,740
what does the signal, what is the root
of this signal to be? So you know,

666
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,820
mathematical about it and say,
wow,

667
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:32,080
it's just human ingenuity
and that's what it is.

668
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,470
It's good old sticktuitiveness and you
roll up your sleeves and you figure out

669
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:38,740
this world. I want that Henry Ford
created a great thing and you know,

670
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:41,820
whilst in there and chop my shadows or
news or great felly and federal budgets,

671
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,900
neurons sweating. Yeah. You know,
I don't necessarily know it's,

672
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,910
it is possible that the imagination is
something that is information that is out

673
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:55,230
there like the, the idea of the akashic
records, the idea of uh, you know, yeah,

674
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,740
there's shit out there and then we'll,

675
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:01,450
we are his little antennas and that our,

676
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:03,970
when we tune into something,
if we pick up this,

677
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,900
this signal for the engine and
someone picks that up, excellent.

678
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,300
Once that piece is in place, oh and
then it flowers and blossoms, like,

679
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,510
like a Fibonacci sequence on a
fucking a sunflower, you know,

680
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:19,960
it all bursts out, you know,
exponentially in certain directions.

681
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:24,550
And then that starts creating more
inventions with all, which also burst out.

682
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,940
But all of them emanate in
the imagination. Initially.

683
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,400
All of them have to be thought up auto.

684
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:33,860
All of them have to be created
by the human minds, right?

685
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,330
Or what the human mind can tune into.
There's no

686
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,510
play into this universe as a human,

687
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,010
but through a pussy and there's no way.
Now,

688
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,090
there is no way for an idea to come into
this universe except through a thought.

689
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,870
There's no way for an invention
except to come through our mind.

690
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:53,770
Our minds are the,

691
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,950
our minds are sort of the creative
orifice is through which all innovation,

692
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,790
every invention, every idea comes,
it's through the human mind. Now,

693
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,060
if you want to think that some day you
just wake up and you get in the shower

694
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:12,670
and you get lucky enough for your neurons
to fire a certain way where you figure

695
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:17,650
out how to reduce the cost of making
solar power panels and solve the, uh,

696
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:19,510
you know,
the energy problem on the planet.

697
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,420
If you want to think that that's
an accident, fine. If it helps you,

698
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:26,080
it seems like it helps a lot of people
to think that the universe springs from

699
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:29,680
some kind of lightening pole adding
plasma or the earth eyes or humor or

700
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:33,830
biological life on the earth. And some
people like to think that their neurons

701
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,030
get lucky and fire cause they squeeze
their brow together in the right way and

702
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:42,260
popped out an idea. But I think you'll
find that most of the great creators,

703
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,810
they don't think that
you know when you write,

704
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,950
but is that because the best way to
create this and not think about yourself?

705
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,400
The best way to create is like when
you start thinking about yourself,

706
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:56,060
the ego starts tripping over his own dick
and you start thinking about like how

707
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:56,890
cool you are.
Yeah.

708
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,170
That's like when you see a guy on stage
and the guy like obviously thinks she's

709
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:04,040
cool. The worst it's the worst is
the feeling is this feeling of gross.

710
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:08,990
Nist is a disconnect and that disconnect
also disconnects him from creativity.

711
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,110
Whereas if you see a guy on stage
and he's just in the moment, man,

712
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,120
he doesn't give a fuck.
He just tuned into it.

713
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,970
It's so compelling and so interesting,
you know,

714
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,540
so maybe it's a trick,
you know what I'm saying?

715
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,540
Like maybe this idea that you know that
we are tuning into the infinite and that

716
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,080
is maybe not,

717
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:31,310
maybe it just requires a certain state
of mind to be creative and that state of

718
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:34,790
mind is to avoid the ego.
It's also like, like the car,

719
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,080
they don't just invent the car,

720
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:39,380
you invent the wheel first and it's
because somebody sat there like, Hey,

721
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,100
I need to take stone or take
heavy thing over here. You know,

722
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,370
I understand the intent of that movie.
I think it's awesome.

723
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:50,330
Necessity inventions come with necessity.
It certainly is. But guess what?

724
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:54,380
Antelopes on event and shit. They keep
getting jacked by Jaguars left and right.

725
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,750
They're stupid fucks.
They never figure it out every year.

726
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,710
They never invented Anil mobe car where
they can just give the finger to the

727
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,220
Jaguar, beep the horn run over the
Jaguar babies they see in the road,

728
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,620
they can't do it.
We can.

729
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,100
And the one of the reasons why we can is
because we're conscious because we can

730
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:13,880
think and, but what is thinking?
The real question is what are,

731
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:18,050
what are all these things firing together,
solving problems.

732
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,160
What is all that really? Because some
people can't solve shit. There's,

733
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:25,790
it's very clear that there's a,
there's different types of people.

734
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,290
There's people that are super solvers
and there's people that can barely solve

735
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:32,540
taking a shit and wiping
their ass correctly.

736
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,570
There's people that can barely
show up for work every day.

737
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,830
Everything they do is a fucking mass
and they make more people that are just

738
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:42,440
like that. Well, if you think that
there's an order to the whole thing,

739
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,540
what are those fucks here for?
You know,

740
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:48,500
are they here just until robots can
become invented to do menial tasks?

741
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,280
Is that what it is? Well, yeah.
Here's the thing. What you did,

742
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:53,490
this is what you do especially eat them.
You think of an IC,

743
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,580
you know when things get bad, for sure
they think of like the greatest idea ever.

744
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,480
Your brain's though. Then he'd get mad
cow disease. Try On's will fuck you up.

745
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,350
You can, if you cannibalize your
candidate, every, the brain, the brain,

746
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,820
just the lags, nature, nature's balls and
Asshole, they're rates are goes bitch,

747
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:14,790
you got a problem,
people brains you fucking crazy pictures.

748
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,530
They're delicious. If you
look at, if you, so the idea,

749
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,080
just to get back to this idea of
like where do thoughts come from?

750
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,080
Well if you,

751
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,630
if you take things out of the temporal
perspective and look at things as some

752
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:31,980
unified whole,
and by temporal you mean

753
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,360
by present and future.
Okay.

754
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,000
So let's look at the whole thing
is like from the perspective,

755
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,500
if we could jump out of time and we
could look at whatever this event was,

756
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:45,090
let's call it the big bang for now and
the series of reactions that happened

757
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,050
directly after the Big Bang and those
first few seconds that the people at the

758
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,000
particle accelerators want to understand.

759
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,440
And then you follow that all the
way to the condensation of gas.

760
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,740
I guess that made matter,
an event and the galaxies and the guy.

761
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:02,880
And then you follow all the way
that to the first, uh, uh, mix,

762
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,040
chemical soup that,
whatever that was.

763
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,020
And then the DNA starts
forming out of that.

764
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:11,460
And then that DNA somehow
gets encapsulated in a
membrane and we have cells in

765
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:11,821
the cells,

766
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,150
gained symbiotic relationships with
other cells and become multicellular

767
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:19,200
organisms, which have
symbiotic relationships. And
eventually you end up with us.

768
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,410
We still are at basically a DNA trail
going all the way back to before DNA to

769
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,570
matter, all the way back
to this explosion of light.

770
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,420
And so a thought is an idea,

771
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:35,421
a merging from infinity from the ultimate
explosion trillions of years ago and

772
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:39,840
to the present moment. Now, if
that ain't come in from nowhere,

773
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:43,500
I don't know what is, you can say,
well no, it's my neurons that did it.

774
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,300
Well your neurons did it right now,

775
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,220
but you're a chain of super reactions
that led to this moment in time when you

776
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:53,670
invented the thing you invented, right?
You know, you're not just your neurons,

777
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:58,671
you are connected to the an
entire ecosystem and you're
connected to a infinite

778
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:02,740
past. You know? And it's
just, I guess when you start
looking at things that just,

779
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,460
you know,
there's your 60 year lifespan,

780
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,450
I suppose things can start looking
pretty grim and Penn and teller ish.

781
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,750
But if you really just step out of time
and really look at what's going down,

782
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:14,670
it's like it's fucking crazy,
man.

783
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,770
We got blasted out of some infinite passed
and we're like yapping about it right

784
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:20,160
now.

785
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,301
Well,

786
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:25,290
it seems to me that we are passengers
on a spaceship that is about three hours

787
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:30,190
from slamming into another planet and
we just woke up from hyperspace. Yeah.

788
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,540
And we're looking at the maps and we
are going, how the fuck did we get here?

789
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,690
What are we doing here?
Does anybody is a radar online yet?

790
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,730
We are starting to decipher radar,
sir.

791
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:41,730
But we do have a window and we're
moving very close to something.

792
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,340
We're not exactly sure what it is.
Yeah. And then you know. Exactly.

793
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:44,940
You know what I'm saying?

794
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
It's like we're waking up in the middle
of history right now and all of us are

795
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,060
some, at some point in time
we're realizing that, oh my God,

796
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,200
there were no one has a firm grip on
exactly what the fuck is going on.

797
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,580
We really are like a space ship
about the slam into something.

798
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,750
You really are moving. We have massive
momentum. We're in a tractor beam.

799
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,210
We all keep going. Yeah, we're
moving towards that thing.

800
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,770
But we're all moving in
this certain very tangible,

801
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,890
very physical direction.
And no one knows exactly why,

802
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:20,280
but everyone keeps it going. And we
kind of have to keep it going. I mean,

803
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:23,310
that's one of the beautiful things about
materialism and all these different

804
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:27,360
things is that if these things are in
place, man, do, you're forced, you know,

805
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,690
I'm writing, you know, writing a book and
now one of the chapters, it's all about,

806
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,490
it's called, um, uh, if you get cancer
from your cell phone, your fucking pussy.

807
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,930
So maintaining your manhood and ever
changing world is the idea of it.

808
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,240
That as things become
more and more complicated,

809
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:47,140
it's very difficult to be true to your,
your nature as a human being, as a man,

810
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:52,530
and that one of the biggest ways that
you become a bitch is you get a job and

811
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:54,640
get jobs.

812
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,930
We'll turn you into a bitch more than
anything that a man and counters in his

813
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:02,080
whole life, having a boss, having
something that you don't want to do,

814
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:03,670
that becomes most of your life.

815
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,650
Most of your life is eight hours a
day that you're waking the, the, the,

816
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:11,460
the two plus commuting hours you throw
in there, the most of that is it.

817
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,580
Shit you don't want to do.

818
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,510
Your life becomes mostly what you don't
want to do and then once you start

819
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:20,050
getting things and that you have to
pay for her car payment or an apartment

820
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:21,550
rental or God forbid,

821
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:24,910
you start fucking shit now the kids and
they don't have to pay for them. Yeah.

822
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,230
Then you become a real bitch because
then you can't say what you want because

823
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,020
you're worried about getting fired. You
know? I've had people say that to me.

824
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,040
Like you say things like that.

825
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,860
Do you ever worry that the UFC is
going to say something or do you, well,

826
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:38,770
I'm in the luxurious position where
I don't have to worry about that,

827
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,680
but God damn, fuck yeah, of
course I would, you know,

828
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:44,950
if I was barely getting by and I didn't
have money saved up and I didn't have

829
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:46,600
other career paths,
you know,

830
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,860
being a comedian is the most beautiful
fucking thing to ever have as your main

831
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,760
occupation because we can
always go to that, you know,

832
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:59,230
and we can always speak our mind and
if people know they can count on you.

833
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,940
Like one of the reasons why this podcast
is so successful is because there is no

834
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,660
bullshit going on in this podcast.
There's a lot of speculation.

835
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,410
There's a lot of what ifs.
There's a lot of stoner talk,

836
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,020
but every fucking thing that I say,

837
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,810
I say because I believe it I owl or I'm,

838
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:19,480
I'm being honest about my thoughts,
right?

839
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,780
Just not a lot of people that are
thinking like that in this world.

840
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:27,340
There's not a lot of people who have
the luxury with their job to be honest

841
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:29,350
about their points of view
all throughout the day.

842
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,150
But what do you do? And this is something
that I always wonder and I share it.

843
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,910
You're at this idea that you have I,
and you're right,

844
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:40,350
having a job is a form of slavery.
When you get locked into the system,

845
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,580
you get locked into the machine.

846
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,300
But what would the world be like
if you applied this philosophy?

847
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:49,200
If everyone on the planet heard you
saying that and suddenly left their jobs?

848
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,700
Yeah, it would be
impossible. Why do we have,

849
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,650
we have far too complex society where
there's a bunch of shit that needs to get

850
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:58,380
done that nobody wants to do. What
is that? Oh, I really want to know,

851
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:01,890
like this is an idea I always want to
explore is like what it, what Ha. Okay,

852
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:06,090
let's just say it just for a thought
experiment. Everyone on the planet,

853
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,640
this thing happens in the spaceship.

854
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,400
They all wake up and we're all
looking at what we're doing.

855
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,780
90% of what we do is robotic,

856
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,990
ritualistic bullshit that that is not
allowing us to fully experience life.

857
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,480
We'll do it be some good
things that would happen.

858
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:25,170
Like government jobs that are
completely useless would go away.

859
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,070
Like the real stupid jobs that

860
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,760
are only in place because the government
wants to provide jobs and make

861
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:34,640
government bigger because it's one of
the ways they can show they're doing well

862
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:38,150
and helping the economy. You
know, that's a, that's a terrible,

863
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:41,540
horrible trap and that would be, those
people would be forced to contribute.

864
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,930
That would be something you,

865
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,180
you're going to now forced to actually
have something that you, you know,

866
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,600
you're going to give to
society and they're going to
give you food in return for

867
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:53,160
this thing. You know, they're
going to give you clothing,
they're going to get you.

868
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,460
It's going to be some sort of a
system in place. You know the,

869
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,900
the real problem though is what about
all the shit that nobody wants to do?

870
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:03,960
Right? What about create, what have I'm
making computers. What about landscape?

871
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,570
Yeah.
What are we going to do without,

872
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:08,660
but we're going to only have third world
countries that are handling our shit.

873
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:12,860
And this, this entire country becomes
a bunch of lay abouts with no jobs.

874
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,340
See,
that's where it gets fun.

875
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,470
There's a lot of people that have jobs
that have bosses that love their fucking

876
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:22,430
job. You love being a landscaper or they
love the NRA. They love being a true,

877
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,480
totally true. But those numbers are
pretty small. Yeah, absolutely. Anything.

878
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,610
It's 10% I don't think you're 10% of
the people I know love their job. Well,

879
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:31,760
I'll tell you, he loves their
job. Mcdonald's workers.

880
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,030
Have you ever gone into a Mcdonald's?
It's like a temple of happiness.

881
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,160
Those people are just miserable.
Grease stain,

882
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,310
the, the, the, the, so, but
I, this is, uh, you know,

883
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,630
speaking of hippies on the way.

884
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:46,870
That's a good point that you brought
up because they're replacing Dunkin Dot

885
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,010
Dunkin donuts. They're replacing
Mcdonald's employees, the

886
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,660
with kiosks. They have that already
at del Taco by my house or not.

887
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,200
Don't talk at El Pollo Loco and you just
go up and it's just like everything's

888
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,140
touch screen and you just
slide your card and Bam.

889
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,890
Now man, cause how many
McDonald's customers can read.

890
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,410
But you know what the best is,

891
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:11,730
is being able to actually for once
order everything exactly how you want to

892
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:14,120
without having to waste the
person's time. You know, like,

893
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,890
like you order your burger, you're
like, yeah, I don't want Manet's. Oh,

894
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:19,980
like mustard ketchup. Yeah. Let's
add this. Let's add like your,

895
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:23,670
for once you're actually being able to
order shit exactly how you want without

896
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,640
making people feel bad
anymore. Man, I can't do it.

897
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:29,730
If you see food inc Jesus fucking Christ,

898
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:32,360
watch that and then go have a
fucking make rib or whatever

899
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,970
card. Yeah, it changed my, uh, my
whole philosophy and all that stuff.

900
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,560
I still eat fish though.
Fuck fish.

901
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,370
Flatfish that's all I eat it like
burger king or Mcdonald's rather.

902
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:46,620
Are you filet of fish? Lifelong
enemy. If the crab really I have no,

903
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,400
I feel I did not feel bad about
eating crabs. Crabs suck. But like,

904
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,430
I don't feel bad about eating seafood.
I can't feel sorry for fish.

905
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,530
It's really difficult.
You don't take care of their young,

906
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,800
so I need to know about fish. They
eat other fish. They eat other fish.

907
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,810
Dethroned by the way,

908
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,020
you can catch bash all you can
catch bass on little tiny bass.

909
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,590
[inaudible] it look like bass. We can
catch them. They eat little baby bass.

910
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:13,380
The moment cons. You eat your own species.
Yeah. I don't feel bad eating here. Yeah,

911
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,630
they'd shit their shit. The
rugs out. The guy comes over.

912
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:19,360
It doesn't mean fuck the girl.
Just Jesus all over the eggs.

913
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,690
It's like what kind of a stupid,

914
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,140
they're so disconnected you them perverts.
If the seat,

915
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,960
well they can't stop for even a second.

916
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,930
Even the fuck there's no time and your
soul is going to come along and eat your

917
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:34,170
ass.
Some eggs on the world of the,

918
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:39,171
of the ocean and of lakes is so fantastic
and bizarre and and really alien to

919
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:45,120
us. Hedberg I have a joke about how awful
the ocean would be. A fish gets scream.

920
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,120
It wouldn't be mad. You think about it,
everybody's a murderer. Even whales,

921
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:56,940
a murderers,
wells go around eating krill.

922
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,780
You know there's very few vegetarian fish
and it doesn't matter because even the,

923
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,940
whatever vegetarian foods there are,
they get killed.

924
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,300
I mean the ones that do exist
that eat algae and shit like that,

925
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,330
you just there to clean up bitch and then
every now and then someone's going to

926
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,450
come around and eat your ass,
chomp out an experimental chomp.

927
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,200
How often does a shark, a human
swimming? They don't like getting humans,

928
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,570
but they take an experimental bike,
they're hungry,

929
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,520
they're hungry and you're easy and the
rest of the world is moving very fast and

930
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,770
leave this fucking stupid
thing with rubber flippers.

931
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:28,710
It's barely moving just like
this fucking thing real quick.

932
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,670
It's like eating like something out of
your refrigerator that you're just like,

933
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:33,750
man,
maybe it's still good.

934
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,800
I don't surf.

935
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,130
I have friends that do it and they say
it's the most amazing thing of all time,

936
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:44,190
but fucking man,
every year someone gets jacked.

937
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,020
I was using the analogy that if every
year someone got attacked by the wolf man,

938
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,360
would you still go in the woods during a
full moon? Now, why the fuck would you?

939
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:54,840
Well guess what? Sharks are way
scarier than the god Damn Wolf Man.

940
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,350
Cause they're real and they don't
take days off. It's not like,

941
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:00,120
oh it's on a full moon.
We don't have to worry.

942
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:05,040
We can go swimming in the ocean now know
every fucking day sharks are out there

943
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,940
and they're way scarier than Werewolf.

944
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,270
But isn't it like the odds of you getting
in a shark attack like your, your,

945
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:13,260
your odds will be better if you know,
getting hit by like a meteor or something.

946
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,390
Like do you know what, you
know, they're not that small.

947
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,320
It depends on where you're at.

948
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:18,960
If you go to South Africa that your odds
are very high that you're going to get

949
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:19,794
bit by sharks.

950
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,690
There's an area in South Africa where
they can drag a surfboard behind a boat

951
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,200
and there's videos of it cause it's
that fucked up cause they have a huge

952
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,360
population in South Africa
of great white sharks.

953
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,490
And People Go fucking surfing out there,
man.

954
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,080
And you'll drag a boat or drag a surfboard
behind a great white or brown behind

955
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,960
a boat and a great way would just
come along and nail it. They had one,

956
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,850
they dragged it, didn't just
dragged it for like five minutes.

957
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:46,330
Three sharks nailed it in five minutes.
It's heroin.

958
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,360
And one of the,
one of the,

959
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,780
aside from being permanently crippled
and terrified at the seed for the rest of

960
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,171
your life,

961
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,280
one of the awful things about being a
shark attack victim is always hearing that

962
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:57,270
fucking statistic.

963
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:02,271
My odds of getting bitten by a shark
and you're looking at your stub like,

964
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:06,470
yeah, fuck that statistic. I got
uh, my, my arm ripped off dude.

965
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,650
Recently a write up in Santa
Barbara that got bitten half,

966
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:15,210
he a hundred yards from shore swimming
with his buddies in a 16 foot great white

967
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:17,910
came along and bid him in
half. And they were like, well,

968
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:21,690
it's real rare for shark like that to
exist in this part of the world. Yeah.

969
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,040
What the fuck are you talking about?
Just because it's

970
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,930
rare. It's still the ocean.
It's all connected. Yeah.

971
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:32,620
The ocean is one big playing
field. Okay. There's no nets.

972
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,450
There's the occasionally
nets for fish of course,

973
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,780
but there's nothing that separates this
part of the fucking field from the other

974
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:41,260
part of the field. There's just habitat
and they choose if they want to,

975
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:43,570
they can keep swimming.
They can take a chance.

976
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,540
They're in a certain area for a reason.
It's because the food sources there,

977
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,374
but guess what?

978
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,790
There's a reason why with some killer
whales are up near Alaska us cause they

979
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,190
found a fucking food source.
They wandered that area,

980
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,730
started killing things there and said
I was a good spot. Now Shit moves man.

981
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:02,430
Ocean is like a giant buffet
tray and when you go into a,

982
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,440
you become part of the buffet.
Whether you like it or not,

983
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:08,800
you're your anything in the ocean could
eat you and there's so many things that

984
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:13,030
would love to that. That last moment,
dude, that's what I think about.

985
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,900
You're out there swimming,
body surf and having fun.

986
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:20,020
You see your girl on the
shore, hey, you're swimming.

987
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:23,650
Then all of a sudden it
feels like somebody punched
you really hard in the leg

988
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,300
and then you look down and there's
just blood guys are hanging out at your

989
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,820
fucking ripped arteries and there's just,

990
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,170
there's just some white shape underneath
you carrying your leg off to Atlanta

991
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:36,910
has and that and you know what I mean?

992
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,780
That's your last moment as you sink under
the waves and suck in water because he

993
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:45,580
lost so much blood. Maybe you wake up
in the hospital two days later. Right.

994
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:46,414
But you know what,

995
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,350
how is that any better than the cows last
day when that fucking pissed and goes

996
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:53,620
to his brain a couple of days before
you eat them in a cheeseburger.

997
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,730
Not a good last day. Last Day.
Everybody's last day. Sox Win.

998
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,880
Not necessarily really. You think
your last day is going to be the shit?

999
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,620
I think that there, well, I
mean yes because it depends
on how you do it, I guess.

1000
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,200
Depends on how you do it, but some key
survival stash of mushrooms around,

1001
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,640
you know,
like a real,

1002
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,820
like a 10 gram stash that you
can just bust into it every time.

1003
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,790
Then you'll like this, this mother fucker.
It looks like it's, yeah, this is it.

1004
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,810
You know, I'm, I'm drowning in my own
lung fluid here. You know, my, my,

1005
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,710
my feet or black with rot. Okay,
it's over. I can't breathe.

1006
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,020
We just chew down these
mushrooms real quick.

1007
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,250
Just like fucking out of this HUD
families like, father, please don't do it.

1008
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:32,680
Don't take those things.
Don't take those things.

1009
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:35,260
We want you here when you're dying.
Leave us.

1010
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,140
You're just trying to have a nice little
mushroom trip before you blast off.

1011
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,390
You know,

1012
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:43,390
out of this Huxley on his deathbed wrote
because he couldn't talk on a sheet of

1013
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:45,371
paper,

1014
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:50,371
the medical prescription for 500
micrograms of LSD intravenously,

1015
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,010
which his wife injected
and do him on his deathbed.

1016
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:58,360
He's the guy who wrote brave new world.
Oh my God, I'm not tripping. Wow.

1017
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,860
Have you heard of Bitcoin? What
have you heard of Bitcoin? Spell it.

1018
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:06,400
B. I. T. C. O I n no,

1019
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,880
it's this new peer to peer currency
that's going on the Internet right now.

1020
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:13,300
It's kind of based off of Torrance. You
know, I know what you're talking about.

1021
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:17,380
You're talking about that psychedelic
store where you can buy anything you want.

1022
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,630
I don't, I was wondering if
you guys knew about that.

1023
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,160
There's a store that if
you set up your computer

1024
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,880
correctly,

1025
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,930
like you have to put like some kind of
make it random like IP addresses so it's

1026
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:27,764
not trackable.

1027
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,420
Then you can access to this access as
one website called the silk roads. Yeah,

1028
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,150
and you can pretty much
buy any drug you want to.

1029
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,630
And these guys have been buying acid.
They're using bitcoins though,

1030
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:43,430
so it's even more untraceable. Is it
really untraceable I doubt it. Yeah.

1031
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,410
I think I, I think
anyone could fuck, yeah,

1032
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:49,210
it seems like the dumbest age of wired
for those folks who don't know what we're,

1033
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:52,370
well if you just Google,
this is the phrase to Google,

1034
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,900
the underground website where
you can buy any drug imaginable.

1035
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,980
If you Google that,

1036
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,190
it'll come up a bunch of
different articles from bunch
of different publications.

1037
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,150
I read the one in wired magazine,

1038
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:05,000
which just one of my favorite
online things to read.

1039
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,460
I use Gawker Gawker's awesome too.
Uh,

1040
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:10,640
but basically what they're saying is that,
you know,

1041
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:15,350
it describes a guy who did it. It's
this guy here, I'll describe it.

1042
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,090
Three weeks ago, US Postal
Service delivered an ordinary
envelope to Mark's door.

1043
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,350
Inside was a tiny plastic bag
containing 10 tabs of LSD.

1044
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,410
If you had opened it,
unless you were looking for it,

1045
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,570
you wouldn't have even noticed mark,

1046
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:33,110
a software developer had
ordered 100 micrograms of
acid through a listing in the

1047
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:34,850
online marketplace.
Silk Road.

1048
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:38,060
He found a seller with lots of good
feedback who seemed to know what they were

1049
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:42,560
talking about. Added the acid to his
digital shopping car and hit checkout.

1050
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,280
He entered his address and
paid the seller 50 bitcoins,

1051
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:50,480
untraceable digital
currency worth about $150.

1052
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,800
Four days later, the drugs sent
from Canada arrived at his house.

1053
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,160
Um, what was the website
that you order? The LSD.

1054
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:03,530
That seems to me like this is one of
those things that was a great idea for a

1055
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:03,741
little,

1056
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:06,590
but until everybody started talking
about until Gawker put it on their front

1057
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:11,420
page. Yeah. Or wired. It's
actually emanated from Gawker.

1058
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:15,170
I did like the idea of bitcoin. So
trying to start a currency, you know,

1059
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,280
outside of the normal currency,
you got it.

1060
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,800
You got to have balls to order LSD.

1061
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:26,810
That I would start off with Tylenol pm
and then work my way up cause you gotta

1062
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:30,500
give me your address. I'm going to no
matter what. That seems just crazy.

1063
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,490
I couldn't enjoy that.

1064
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,190
I do the acid you'd get
so God damn paranoid that
someone was going to boot down

1065
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,180
your door and fucking stick a gun in your
mouth while you're sleeping and scream

1066
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:46,050
at you. Where's the fucking
drug? Shoot your dog. You know,

1067
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,180
I mean, did you hear about the DEA raid
and fucking, I think it was an Arizona.

1068
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:53,990
We're a guy who was a former marine,
was a gun down in a,

1069
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:57,820
in an ill conceived drug raid.
They shot him 71 times.

1070
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,640
He had a little Baggie of weakness house.
Yeah, I heard of that. Yeah, that's,

1071
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:05,090
that's the kind of shit that are
really killed. Hi. Yeah, no shit.

1072
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,950
That shit kills my eye anyway.
That's like it.

1073
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:08,720
That's how I know I'm
about to have a bad trip.

1074
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:13,010
Is that the fantasy swat team starts.
It's surrounding the house.

1075
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,140
Well that's the problem also in
environments where drugs are illegal,

1076
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,070
psychedelic drugs,
marijuana where those things that

1077
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,630
you'd want and are nice and they're
illegal end. When you buy them,

1078
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,690
you have to be in contact with bad people.

1079
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,060
You have to be in contact
with drug dealers.

1080
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:32,160
You have to be in contact
with people who are willing,

1081
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,190
willing to risk going to
jail to sell you this shit.

1082
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:39,240
And a lot of times these fucking guys
get popped and a lot of times maybe they

1083
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:42,630
don't like you. So when they get popped
and they have to talk to the cops,

1084
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:44,910
the cops is, where are you
getting this shit from? Hey,

1085
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:47,790
I'm buying this from this former marine
man. This guy's fucking crazy. You know,

1086
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,120
he's got a gun and he's selling coke at
his house. And so what did the cops do?

1087
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:51,361
Well they said,

1088
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:55,020
well we've got to fucking far marine and
coke and the guy's crazy and he's got

1089
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,720
guns. We need to get the swat team
together, put on the vest and the helmets.

1090
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,130
And so then they fucking gun this guy
down when really maybe all it was is he

1091
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,320
knew a shithead cause that's
where he bought his pot.

1092
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,900
You know who the fuck knows?
I mean I'm reading into the whole thing.

1093
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,170
He might've been crazy,
but when you,

1094
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,480
my point is when you're dealing
with the world of illegal drugs,

1095
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,150
you're dealing with
criminals. Right. And that's,

1096
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,320
that's one of the biggest
travesties of, you know, the,

1097
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:21,600
the having these personal freedoms taken
away from us is that it's forcing you

1098
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:22,680
to interact with people.

1099
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,660
We're at a father fucking mind. But
that's the annoying thing. Yeah.

1100
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,840
Cause you know, you hear, listen,
marijuana is a gateway drug.

1101
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:29,980
You start smoking marijuana,

1102
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:32,590
you're going to have a heroin needle
hanging out your arm by Christmas.

1103
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:36,790
But it's like really marijuana
is not a gateway drug.

1104
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,160
Drug dealers are gateway drugs.

1105
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,110
And when a kid can't go to a store that
solely sells marijuana and goes to a

1106
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,470
dope dealer in some trailer, North
Carolina, like where I used to go,

1107
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:48,910
the guy's like, hey boy, you want to,

1108
01:03:48,911 --> 01:03:52,540
but you want to try and get an eight
ball on top of that. It's great coke.

1109
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,400
And then the next thing you know
you're like, oh sure, why not?

1110
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:56,470
I'll try some coke or I'll try some meth.

1111
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,880
That's one way you're looking at it.

1112
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:01,510
But I could see that someone who's curious
and tries marijuana would eventually

1113
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:04,450
be curious and try heroin or be
curious and try math. Or you know,

1114
01:04:04,451 --> 01:04:07,360
if they have friends that
are dumb, especially if
you're young, it's very deep.

1115
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,470
If you do math, I know this person that
fucking moron, you are a fucking moron.

1116
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,770
But what of your dumb and what a few
young and what if you have a friend who

1117
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:18,030
just did math and he's like, it was crazy.
It was wild. I thought you get hooked.

1118
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,180
No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm
fine. And you're dominant.

1119
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:23,190
You listened to your dumb friend and
then boom, you're doing math. You know,

1120
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,270
I can see that,
I can see that,

1121
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,170
but it still doesn't take away from the
fact that one of the main problems is

1122
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:33,910
that we have this distrust of
the, uh, the, the entire system.

1123
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,150
We have a distrust of the
police and the law enforcement,

1124
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,220
distrust of the lawmakers.

1125
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,970
And one of the big reasons for
this distrust is marijuana laws.

1126
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,490
We know they're ridiculous.
They know they're ridiculous.

1127
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,130
It's 2000 fucking 11.

1128
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:51,970
And you go online and you
look up the statistics and
you look up all the studies.

1129
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,630
You go, well, hey, this shit isn't deadly
at all. Not always. It's not deadly.

1130
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:57,520
It seems to shrink tumors.
And look,

1131
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:59,920
it seems to help people with add
and it seems to help children.

1132
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,260
When you go online,
you find the information.

1133
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:06,820
It's so completely diametrically opposite
of what they're fucking telling you

1134
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:08,200
and beaten your, your, your head.

1135
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:11,890
And with that you start to disregard
what they say about other shit too.

1136
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,440
And then you try math because you say,
well fuck,

1137
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:18,190
they were lying to me about weed. Maybe
methane that bad. You know, maybe coke's

1138
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,680
not a big deal.
And then all these fucking terrible,

1139
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,390
really dangerous drugs that are,

1140
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,080
I don't know if you've had a friend that
has had an addiction problem and been

1141
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:28,330
there weather while they're
in the throes of addiction.

1142
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,980
It's like having a friend that's bit
by a vampire. Yeah, it really is.

1143
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:35,020
It's like you can't do anything
for them. You can't, you're,

1144
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,010
you're holding them down.

1145
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,190
Their fangs are popping out and
it's like you see them shaking.

1146
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:42,280
Shuddering sweating. What did you,
what was your friend? What happened?

1147
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:43,540
What did you have a,

1148
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:48,220
my friend was addicted to Vicodin and
I went over to his house because he's

1149
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:52,030
like, can you come get rid
of my Vicodin? And I'm like,

1150
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,920
I'll be right over because
it is, I love biking. It

1151
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,310
has a good friend.

1152
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:00,610
You went through a period of time where
you got a bunch of pills and you got

1153
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:04,240
real weird for a while. Man, I
dunno what the fuck you were taken,

1154
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:07,390
but you took too much of it and you kept
taking it. You were telling me, dude,

1155
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:10,760
if I have it in my house, I just take
them. Yeah. It's like world of Warcraft,

1156
01:06:10,761 --> 01:06:13,990
I to flush them down the toilet.
What was it? What were they? Well,

1157
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:18,460
so what had happened is a
friend of mine who really isn't,

1158
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:23,170
I clearly probably not the night sky,
just gave me a fucking handful,

1159
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:25,960
a shitload of pills,
like its own weird mixture of pills.

1160
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,670
So like I,

1161
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:33,100
I think I was a little depressed at
the time and like listening to a lot of

1162
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:37,760
Elliot Smith. Oh No, it's okay. Go stab
themselves today. Yeah. So like I went,

1163
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,830
I was living in echo park and have these
pills and I go into my depressed little

1164
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,760
apartment, like eat
pills. It was really it

1165
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:49,640
dark time, man. And, and,
and uh, and I got sick. I
wouldn't, I guess you could say,

1166
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,460
I don't think I got physically addicted.
I don't think I got a habit,

1167
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:57,850
but I got a little
psychologically addicted and I
got scared because I could see

1168
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:00,500
the, you know, the fucking,
I could feel the pole,

1169
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,630
so I flushed them down the toilet.

1170
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,970
Wow. That's a smart move. That's
it. Hard move to make though, right?

1171
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,880
You were at the door of addiction,
right?

1172
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,770
Yeah. And I could feel, I could,

1173
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:15,090
I could see where it could go.
Um,

1174
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:16,770
and that's why fucking pills suck.

1175
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:19,600
And that's why you should avoid them at
all costs because they fucking suck. I,

1176
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:19,861
you know,

1177
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:24,861
I just threw my back out and my
dad gave me some pain medication,

1178
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:30,060
which I took and this is the first time
I've taken like a pharmaceutical pain

1179
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:34,620
killer and a long time and I hated it.
It just made me feel like shit,

1180
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:35,700
I was puking yesterday.

1181
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:38,610
I don't know if that it was from that or
the fact that we had pregnant old shell

1182
01:07:38,611 --> 01:07:42,450
fish or I'm pregnant, but like
those things suck, man. Uh,

1183
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:47,220
all pills, uh, suck.
They're terrible for you,

1184
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:50,940
but they're awful for you.
Outside of like, you know,

1185
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,730
Xanax and Oxycontin,
which I still use every day.

1186
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,460
I do, I did kind of see your, your drug,

1187
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:02,560
your drug dealer giving you
kind of like the gateway thing.

1188
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,640
I know a friend that allegedly recently
went to go get mushrooms and this person

1189
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,590
has only done we'd and
mushrooms and their whole life.

1190
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,640
And the first thing the guy says,
hey, I got some DMT right now also.

1191
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,490
And it was like,
can you imagine just giving somebody TMT

1192
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,780
going from like, oh, what's the DMT?
I'll try that. That shit's all my fault.

1193
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,490
I Know Jeff,
you started a DMT explosion.

1194
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,320
Crazy. But I did. How often do
you get emails from fake cops?

1195
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,310
Probably every day. I don't,
I can't respond to emails
anymore. It's impossible.

1196
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,290
I get too many of them.
So don't even try.

1197
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,580
I do what I can to respond to Twitter
messages and nice short form things and

1198
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,090
talk to people outside of clubs, you
know, after shows and stuff like that.

1199
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:46,430
But there's just too many people wanting
my time and too many crazy fucking

1200
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:50,180
people. But there's definitely fake
cops. There's definitely other cops.

1201
01:08:50,181 --> 01:08:53,600
Fake people returning to your cops,
I'm sure. But look, it's real simple.

1202
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:56,750
I always say like, I don't travel with
it. I don't, I don't, uh, you know,

1203
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:00,080
I'm not looking to get high and other
towns, I'm not looking at, you know,

1204
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:04,070
get fucked up on mushrooms in Seattle.
I'm not, I'm not doing anything stupid.

1205
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,260
And I have a respect for law enforcement.

1206
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:10,550
I know that they know these laws are
retarded. I have no, a lot of cops, man,

1207
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,410
believe me.
What they hate is criminals.

1208
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:17,120
They hate scumbags and murderers and
people knocking over fucking people stores

1209
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:20,870
and houses and stealing
and making societies suck.

1210
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,990
And a lot of that is drug dealers
too because as we said, you know,

1211
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:26,750
people were willing to take those
fucking chances to sell drugs.

1212
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,720
A lot of times they're doing that because
they were doing something else before.

1213
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:33,050
They had some fucking pyramid scheme
before that and before that they were,

1214
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:36,650
you know, selling stolen car radios
or there's a lot of people involved.

1215
01:09:36,651 --> 01:09:39,140
When you get involved
in that illegal world,

1216
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:42,230
the world of Shit that can
get you locked up in jail.

1217
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:45,730
There's a lot of people that only
operate inside that realm. You know,

1218
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,240
they go from one little illegal scam to
the next cops hate them and they should

1219
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:53,930
for a fucking reason. I
personally like cops, you know,

1220
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:57,110
people think that because I like pot,
I don't like cops.

1221
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,390
Cops to me are a huge fucking important
part of a healthy and safe society.

1222
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,420
And when you hear about bad cops,
I personally believe that it's a,

1223
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:10,940
a small fraction of the actual cops.
Most cops are,

1224
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:14,930
they behaved admirably in front
of a bunch of fucking cunts.

1225
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,400
Cause that's what most people are.

1226
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:20,180
Most people are dumb cunts and they're
out there doing dumb stupid shit.

1227
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,350
And these cops running these dumb cons
doing dumb stupid shit all day fucking

1228
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:28,940
long. Every day of the week. I admire
their fucking patients for the most part.

1229
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,690
By the way,

1230
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:33,070
I'd love to see the cop painters out
there cause I think fallen apart in you're

1231
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,140
ready because the way you handle it. No,
I just tend just touch them. I like that.

1232
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:38,750
And it did it. It's fine. You sit
right on top of your belly too.

1233
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,000
Maybe you should like back
that bitch up a little bit.

1234
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:44,990
So you know there's some space between
me and the microphone. I'd love to see,

1235
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,780
I'd love to see what a copywriter does
when they're fucking house gets broken

1236
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:50,930
into. Yeah. Cops. Some cops are bad man.

1237
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:53,270
I know a guy who was selling
weed who got robbed by cops.

1238
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,880
Don't think I've talked
about it on the podcast.

1239
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,930
I've never had a problem with cops.

1240
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,510
I think if you have a problem
with cops for the most part,

1241
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,930
watch the show cops and you'll realize
what these cops are dealing with. They,

1242
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:06,290
they seem pretty nice and then they're
dealing with it, but like you said,

1243
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,560
a bunch of fucking retards or
watch Steven Seagal law. Man,

1244
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:14,190
what the fuck is he doing?
He's a cop. He just busted

1245
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,040
a cock fighting ring and Arizona.
They bridged,

1246
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,850
drove into a house with the fucking
tank and they busted people fighting

1247
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:24,660
roosters. Steven, look, dog gets
out. This is real life, man.

1248
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,460
He's so strange to me. God is no one
more bizarre to me and Steven Seagal.

1249
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,550
It's hilarious. Why did he drive into
a chicken house to the tank? Well,

1250
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,400
I did our TV. Why did real cops let him
come to a bust? The whole thing. I mean,

1251
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:42,270
I guess he's some sort of a weird
real cop in Louisiana I guess.

1252
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:45,840
I don't even think he is. I think he
just shadows them or something like that.

1253
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:48,420
I think he's like an
honorary sort of a thing.

1254
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:52,110
Like Shaq was Shaquille O'Neal
was like an honorary sheriff.

1255
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,640
Well he loves chickens.
Shaquille O'Neal, Steven to,

1256
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,440
he just loves chickens. These are my
precious, these are God's children.

1257
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:05,100
I don't give a fuck about birds either.
Birds to me are just like fish.

1258
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,460
I have a pen. Go fuck themselves. Guilty
eating chickens cause those little,

1259
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,330
those little fucking orange checks.
There's Tony chicks eat chickens.

1260
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:14,520
Chickens are cunts.
Once they become full grown,

1261
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:17,340
their cuts chop their fucking
heads off and cook them up.

1262
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,450
I don't have no problem with eating
chickens. They're cold blooded assholes.

1263
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:23,460
They don't give a fuck
about you slap a chicken.

1264
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,190
I do jokes about birds like people.

1265
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:28,440
So like saying that the apocalypse and
the birds are falling from the sky as the

1266
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:31,530
apocalypse and I'm like, you don't know
if people were falling from the sky,

1267
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:35,080
it would be the apocalypse.
Like birds. I said my pet bird,

1268
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:41,280
the moment he died, that thing's
going to eat your fucking eyeballs

1269
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,250
about you,
man.

1270
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,830
Let it shitheads something happened and
saw that fucking offered Hitchcock movie

1271
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:54,110
the birds. I just watched that today's
I got, that's happened to birds. Hey,

1272
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:56,460
have you seen somebody back then
didn't have a fucking shotgun?

1273
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,820
That that is the dumbest fucking movie.
If there was common sense,

1274
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:04,740
that movie would not exist if it was
so retarded that there were so many,

1275
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,060
like just watching it.
Like,

1276
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,910
why don't you just fucking get
in that room and don't move?

1277
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:11,310
Why are you having bird attacks
and you're scared of birds,

1278
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:14,810
but you're still going outside at
all. You know what I mean? They,

1279
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,570
every time somebody went
outside, somebody died. Oh,

1280
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,350
how come nobody's got a goddamn
tennis racket up in this bitch?

1281
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,830
I'll tell you what, these are only crows
are right. If it was crows outside,

1282
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,400
oh fuck. Off Off Hosan Crows.
I'll go out there with a,

1283
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,830
a goalie mask on and uh,

1284
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,970
some sparring gear like to cover up all
my vital areas and a cop and to tennis

1285
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:38,310
rackets,
and I'll take on a swarm of birds.

1286
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,030
I'll just swap those pitches out of the
sky. It would be an awesome workout.

1287
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,530
Cro advocate here,

1288
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:49,590
if a big enough flock of
crows descended on you, yes.

1289
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,540
They could carry you away. That's true.
Yes it was. Because what happened?

1290
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,420
I would be a whirling dervish like a
fucking tornado of tennis racquets or

1291
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:03,120
you're going to get swooped into. That
may be you, but I got some cardio bitch.

1292
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:06,150
I work out. The real product
would be if it was eagles,

1293
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,650
if you had a swarm of eagles,
you're dead dead.

1294
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,490
Never seen the videos of
eagles killing wolves.

1295
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,650
Yup. Yeah. What the fuck did you know?

1296
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:18,670
They train them to kill wolves because
they get the wolf furs and they sell like

1297
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:22,000
wolf pelts are worth a lot of money
because you know a lot of the guys where

1298
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:22,781
they do it,
you know they're,

1299
01:14:22,781 --> 01:14:25,480
they're farmers and shit and they have
sheep and the wolves come and eat the

1300
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:29,140
sheep. So they, they, they
train eagles to kill the wolves.

1301
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,810
And I would've never
believed it was so easy.

1302
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,950
These eagles are like undefeated
versus walls feel sorry for the world.

1303
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:40,540
That's incredible. Feel bad for the,
they swooped down and they just Jack.

1304
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:44,470
These motherfuckers grab them by their
necks and you realize like an eagle has

1305
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:47,590
like they have like five
fucking knives in each hand.

1306
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,270
You know how many closets they have?
I don't have feet. I don't know. Four.

1307
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,160
Let's go. Let's go with,
you can see on the Internet,

1308
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:59,190
but they in basically they
have some fucking wolverine
type weapon and they just

1309
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:03,910
grab the neck of this wolf
and just fuck him up, man.

1310
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,800
Yeah,
but it's not just that.

1311
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:09,400
It seems like they get them by the neck
and then they plunge their beacon to him.

1312
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:14,170
They just, oh, their beak is a
murderous weapon. A Cessna stone.

1313
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:17,290
When I watched birds that I thought the
blonde chick was so hot in that movie

1314
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,390
that I was like online trying to
find out if she was alive. Five.

1315
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:24,760
You ever thought like leg fucking somebody
that was so desirable back in the day

1316
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:27,910
and it still fucking hurt just
because of who's just used to be,

1317
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,720
a lot of guys are still doing that.
I would fuck that girl.

1318
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,630
You ever watch a celebrity rehab this
this season? I think so. You know,

1319
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:37,480
Janice Dickinson,
she's that model who's a,

1320
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,260
seems like a troubled lady.
I'm sure she's a nice person,

1321
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:44,830
but she's got a lot of issues and she's
always like fucked up and Rehab and

1322
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:48,940
she's got a lot of plastic surgery and
she's got this young boyfriend and his

1323
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:52,570
boyfriend is like really not a very good
looking guy and he shouldn't be with

1324
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:53,800
Janice tickets.
You know,

1325
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,890
if Janice Dickinson was 20 there's no
way she'd be with this fucking dude.

1326
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,710
But you know, he's 30 and
she's 50 or whatever the fuck
she is. And he's, you know,

1327
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,610
he's with Janice Dickinson,
that plastic surgery phase that all droop.

1328
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:09,310
She's got like early eighties
plastic surgery or they hadn't,

1329
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,050
it hadn't evolved to where it's at.

1330
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:16,051
So it's kind of fallen off the blonde
checks daughter with somebody like Melanie

1331
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:19,060
Griffin or something like that too.
I was, I was like, wow, really? Yeah,

1332
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,640
I hate those puffed lips now. And people
so say gel in their lips. Friend of mine,

1333
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:27,730
his wife did that and I had a conversation
with her and I had to avoid looking

1334
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,860
at it while we're talking.
I'm like,

1335
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:34,240
oh gross that you expect an alien
to pop out of it. It was so weird.

1336
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:35,530
She had just done it,
you know.

1337
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:39,280
Have you ever had a time to have
three and then the bottom one,

1338
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,900
that's what it seems like the wolves have.

1339
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,200
There's a video online called
Golden Eagle domination.

1340
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,230
It's just eagles fucking up everything.

1341
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:52,330
Fucking of wolves and rabbits and just
swooping down and snatching things.

1342
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:57,520
I got to see a few of those fly when I
lived in Colorado, I saw a golden eagles.

1343
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,810
They actually live there. You can catch
them in the woods. Um, yeah, they're,

1344
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:06,370
they're pretty scary man. That whenever I
see them fly over, I always think of it,

1345
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,570
decided to attack me,

1346
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:12,650
take my eyes at this video should showed
one just ate a fucking Turkey and then

1347
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:17,450
one just caught a deer. There's a dare,
some murderous mother fuckers. Man,

1348
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:22,550
there's a Fox jacked. This is just
an all, there's the wolf hope.

1349
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:27,230
Fuck man. Watch this shit.
Watch a shit. Yeah, dude,
you're going to freak freak out,

1350
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,860
man. They're so big. We don't realize how
big they are. First of all, look at this.

1351
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,360
God takes the wolf down and grabs him
by the neck and just kills his ass.

1352
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,930
You don't realize how big these
fucking things are. Look at this man.

1353
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,890
Look at that. He flipped him over
and the poor. Whoa. Look at that.

1354
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:47,660
Boom Dude. They kill wolves. Wow.

1355
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,230
The natural world is so scary,
man.

1356
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,070
There's so much crazy shit going
on in the natural world. Yeah.

1357
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:00,071
It's like a big barroom brawl that she's
been going on for after constant fight,

1358
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:01,070
but I mean the,
the,

1359
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:04,580
the really nutty thing that our little
pea brains is the idea that almost

1360
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:09,050
everything in the world eats and
kills everything else with its face,

1361
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:15,170
the most intimate way possible to
grabs things in with it's fucking face.

1362
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,760
Just reps things apart and that's no,
that's how life,

1363
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:23,660
that's how life passes on. That's
the cycle of life. The cycle of life,

1364
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:28,661
his teeth and claws and just
murder and tearing with your face.

1365
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,430
Yeah. Wrestle it down. Get your face
inside. It's rib cage and eat its heart.

1366
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,970
Does Golden Eagle is a bad motherfucker
now he's pulling goats off of cliffs

1367
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,380
ever.
See when they do that,

1368
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:43,670
they pull them off cliffs and just
drop them on the rock. Which is that,

1369
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:45,290
this is something I've
wondered about that.

1370
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,560
What did they do it that's like
a tool that they use or is that,

1371
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,610
did that guy just catch an
accident happening? Well,
they do it a lot. It's, it's,

1372
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:57,290
it's common but it's also a product of
the environment where they're fighting

1373
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:00,800
them. If they were on, it looks
to me like to do an an on purpose,

1374
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,560
but it also could be that
the trying to pick them up,

1375
01:19:03,561 --> 01:19:05,120
but they're doing it over
and over and over again.

1376
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:08,540
But it also where they're fighting or
they're trying to kill these things and

1377
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:09,440
fly off with them.

1378
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:13,670
I mean it's in a a crazy spot where if
you go six inches to the right or six

1379
01:19:13,671 --> 01:19:14,630
inches to the left,

1380
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:19,490
you're going to fall 3000 fucking feet
is this one's flying off with one,

1381
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,460
but then he gets to the
bottom and he lets it go.

1382
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,460
So I think they're trying
to fly off with them.

1383
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,630
But Eagles are such evil fuck eds that
they'd try to bite off shit that they

1384
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,690
can't even carry.
They try to like claw into this big,

1385
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,070
big goat and fly away with it and
they can't. So like all right,

1386
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:40,430
well I'll just see at the bottom and
just drop it. You look at this, this one,

1387
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:44,690
a tax a bear. Well it's good for,
the energy's good there. You know,

1388
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,270
you're expending fewer
calories and that's like,

1389
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:49,280
isn't that what it's all
about when you're an animal,

1390
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:51,230
you're conserving energy
and trying to get,

1391
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,680
trying to get more energy before
you run out. We are so lucky.

1392
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:57,830
There's no Mortera doctorals uh,
could you imagine,

1393
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:59,810
cause that's what a
fucking bird is by the way,

1394
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,680
which people don't understand
is that a bird is a dinosaur.

1395
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:08,070
That is the direct descendants of
dinosaurs. They are the closest

1396
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,360
thing that we have to understanding
what real dinosaurs look like for that

1397
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,760
things. Do they run times?
Did you know about that? Yeah.

1398
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:18,300
Chickens will grow Fang sometimes.
Wow. Fucking hate chickens.

1399
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,290
They think a lot of dinosaurs actually
had feathers to dinosaurs that existed

1400
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:27,140
even in, uh, you know, the, the pre 65
million years period where the, the,

1401
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:30,420
the thing hit. They had feathers. I
wish I could, or accord at the time.

1402
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:35,421
Eddie Griffin explained to me how
dinosaurs super intelligent creatures,

1403
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:38,430
Eddie Griffin, he explained to me
how Bruce Lee died once. He told me,

1404
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:40,020
he talks to me for like 20 minutes.

1405
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,720
He came in the room and
there was a hundred other
motherfuckers in this room and

1406
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,670
Bruce Lee looked at all
them bitches and said,

1407
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:53,820
which one of y'all niggas wants a dot
first and then they all came at him and

1408
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:58,930
they could not get close enough because
his feet and his hand was moving so fast.

1409
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:02,890
These pitches was just dropping left
and right. But they had a chill day.

1410
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,640
Had to kill him, would poison season
if I couldn't get a call to him,

1411
01:21:06,641 --> 01:21:09,510
he had to kill him. The poison. And I'm
sitting there listening to this call.

1412
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:12,040
Oh my God.
And I'm trying to remember in my head,

1413
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:14,480
I wish I knew how Bruce Lee died.
Yeah,

1414
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,610
I could tell him cause I felt like he
died like of a drug overdose or something.

1415
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,450
What does Bruce Lee's actual deaf. I
don't know because, hold on one second.

1416
01:21:22,451 --> 01:21:25,580
Bruce Lee. Firstly. Yeah. How did
he die? I thought he got murdered.

1417
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:28,690
Didn't know Brandon leave at
Bruceton Brandon. We got like,

1418
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:32,340
it was supposed to be a blank.
Yeah. I thought Bruce Peace

1419
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:37,320
inside of it. Oh, let's see.
How did his, how did he die?

1420
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:42,150
Die, Die, die, die, die.
Appreciate. I should know this
man death. Here we go. Bam.

1421
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:45,930
I mean,
he collapsed in while doing dubbing work,

1422
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,120
suffering from seizures and headaches.

1423
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:53,330
He was immediately rushed to the Hong
Kong Baptist hospital where doctors his

1424
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,850
cerebral edema. So that's
bleeding of the brain, right?

1425
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,360
They were able to reduce swelling
through the administration of a man,

1426
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:02,790
a tall whatever the fuck that is,
uh,

1427
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:06,060
the same symptoms that
occurred in his first collapse.

1428
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,820
We're later repeated on
the day of his death.

1429
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,440
So he started having a bleeding
of the brain apparently. You know,

1430
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:16,350
who knows the man that could have
been from kicks to the head. Yeah,

1431
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:20,420
it's very possible. Um, he did
a lot of stunt work and the,

1432
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:24,840
the reality of movies is that you
get fucked up. Brock. A, I mean,

1433
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:28,980
not Brock Lesnar Bas Rutten was telling
us about how he got injured on the set

1434
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:32,460
of that show lights out. Remember
he was talking about him or his arm?

1435
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:35,190
His one arm that's smaller than
the other arms. We just had,

1436
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,770
I just did a movie with him.
I just said this here come the boom movie.

1437
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:41,050
So it was hanging out with him for
a couple of weeks and he had um,

1438
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:45,720
surgery where they open up his nerve
canals because his nerves were compressed

1439
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,580
and they like atrophied his muscles and
his arms stop working correctly. Yeah,

1440
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:54,480
it's pretty fucking serious shit man.
This is all from just stunt work,

1441
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:59,520
just doing his own stunts on this,
this TV show course and Bruce Lee was,

1442
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,890
you know, he was doing
movies. We're dudes,

1443
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:06,190
we're swinging sticks at him
and nunchucks and throwing

1444
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,010
kicks at his head and punches.
Guess what man?

1445
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,390
Shit's lips and things happen.
Man. Did you see that tweet?

1446
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:16,870
Someone sent to us about the,
I think it was in the UK.

1447
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,520
This woman's slapped a Dj on a bat
and killed him. She punched him. Oh,

1448
01:23:21,521 --> 01:23:25,570
she punched him for $5. Five
bucks. Yeah. And he died,

1449
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:30,550
dropped him and in Santa Monica in front
of, Oh, a guy pushed another guy down,

1450
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:34,200
killed him. He hit his head or he went
into a coma. He fell on the sidewalk.

1451
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:36,590
It just went into a coma and are
trying to find the guy. My buddy,

1452
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:40,270
my buddy was living on
long island and he was a,

1453
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:43,840
he's a standup comic and he was a bouncer
at the time, you know, uh, it was like,

1454
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,250
you know, for, for extra money.

1455
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,070
And one of the guys that he worked with
just punched a guy. The guy was drunk.

1456
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:52,000
I got loud, guy punched him, guy fell
back, hit his head, dead, dead. Wow,

1457
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,320
you're in jail now. Well, your body
is fucking fragile, man. You know,

1458
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:58,840
I'm amazed at all the shit that I've seen.

1459
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:03,380
I've never seen anybody die in all my
years of competition and all my years of,

1460
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:06,910
of, of watching UFC fights, I've
seen some close calls though, man.

1461
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:11,920
We fought in a tournament once at
the bay state games in 1986. And the,

1462
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,310
when you have no regulation,
like a sport like taekwondo,

1463
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,910
taekwondo has very little
like local regulation.

1464
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,970
You're allowed to have
these tournaments where you,

1465
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:24,820
you have high school gymnasiums and you
fill them up with people and they're

1466
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:29,080
fighting on hardwood floors and they're
kicking full blast to the face and

1467
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:30,700
getting knocked the fuck out.

1468
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:35,140
And people getting knocked out and falling
unconscious and slamming their head

1469
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:36,040
off the ground and they have,

1470
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:40,420
might have an EMT there to watch out
for you to help you when your brain is

1471
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:42,930
bleeding through your ears and nose.
And um,

1472
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:47,920
so we fought in this one and the
arena was a thin piece of nylon,

1473
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:52,570
like a, uh, like a competition
area that they would lay out.

1474
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:57,490
Their wood was marked with a square,
with a circle in the square over a frozen,

1475
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,940
like an ice skating rink that was
thought out. So it was cement.

1476
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:04,990
It was just straight cement
with a thin layer of vinyl,

1477
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:09,430
which was the competition area.
So we fought on cement. Wow. Yeah.

1478
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,960
And no one ever, someone
should've died. Someone got hurt.

1479
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:17,610
I knocked the guy out and he fell
forward and he smashed his face on this

1480
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,660
because he broke his eyebrow open.
His biggest injury was his, uh,

1481
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,490
his eyebrow more than I kicked
him on the other side of the head.

1482
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:27,830
I kicked him on his, um, uh,
kicked him with a wheel kick.

1483
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:31,930
So that was his right side of his head
and he fell on his left side of his face

1484
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:34,480
got fucked up. Well, you know
the thing man, where like,

1485
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,240
there was like a certain amount of
time it took to run a mile. You know,

1486
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,070
there is like,
I don't remember what it was,

1487
01:25:39,071 --> 01:25:42,280
but that time keeps getting shorter and
shorter and shorter as humans evolve

1488
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,010
eventually because of the UFC,

1489
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,940
some ways he's going to develop enough
punching strength to punch through

1490
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:52,810
someone's face and to their brain.
That's going to fucking happen, man.

1491
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,280
Someone's going to get the punch.

1492
01:25:54,281 --> 01:25:58,420
Someone's going to punch like a watermelon
right into someone's like a movie

1493
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:01,510
fucking head. That's going to happen.
They're going to develop this drink.

1494
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:03,950
They're going to learn the training
and it's going to happen in front of

1495
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,740
millions of people,
and that's the end of the UFC.

1496
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,840
Really think that's going to
happen to your hand will fuck up.

1497
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,560
That's not what they said about the
mile. They were like, they're still,

1498
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:14,210
we've gotten a lot better
at taking it to people.

1499
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,770
Gotten not just better
at throwing punches.

1500
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,120
They got better at taking punches too.

1501
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:21,140
There's a certain amount of pounds that
it would take to punch through a human

1502
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:21,450
head.

1503
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:24,710
Someone knows that there's
a certain amount of pounds
and the same way there's a

1504
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,280
certain amount of time they thought
someone could run a mile in.

1505
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:31,730
Someone is going to turn someone's
head into a fucking glove on front of

1506
01:26:31,731 --> 01:26:32,840
millions of people.

1507
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,210
It's going to make the worst sound
you've ever heard in your life.

1508
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,600
We'll hear rogue and he'll
go, ah, you'll hear a scream.

1509
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:42,230
Everyone will scream and this guy I'll
just be looking down and it'll look like

1510
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:44,540
it's fucking fist is in a strawberry pie

1511
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:49,970
face. That's going to happen
man. And then the UFC,

1512
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:52,040
they're going to have to start
wearing like helmets or something.

1513
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,680
Well that was one of the proposals
that people have proposed helmets,

1514
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:59,110
super proposed, all sorts of crazy
thing. Helmets like your cycle or cycle?

1515
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:02,570
The whole, well I think they were
thinking about like contact sports,

1516
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:05,600
like football or football players
have to helmets. Yeah. But you know,

1517
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:08,750
it's been kind of statistically proven
at least when in comparison with rugby,

1518
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:12,380
which is a pretty God damn violent game
that rugby players suffer less brain

1519
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:14,930
traumas and football players
do because football players,

1520
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,100
because they're wearing those helmets,

1521
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:20,210
they just feel like they can just charge
right the fuck at union and smash heads.

1522
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:23,960
Whereas you know there's a real
repercussion for bone to bone contact,

1523
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:27,950
head to head. But that helmet man just
gives you that feeling of protection.

1524
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:30,440
But what doesn't get
protected as the brain?

1525
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:35,390
The brain inside rattles around
like a fucking, like a jumping bean,

1526
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,620
a little sack of Jello that was
attached to the walls with thin string,

1527
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,340
you know, and then snap, snap slosh slosh.

1528
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:46,460
I'm thinking how strong the brain
is that like imagine if like you,

1529
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,510
if like you punched your hard drive,
like it would never work again.

1530
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:53,920
It's like our brains get slammed
around and they still work. Yeah.

1531
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,290
It's amazing how much trauma the
brain can take. By the way, man,

1532
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:01,160
if they start making people wear
football helmets for the UFC,

1533
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:05,310
it will be the funniest sport on a
planet to see guys in Speedos with the

1534
01:28:05,311 --> 01:28:08,540
flooring.
The weirdest looking.

1535
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:12,500
Well when then someone will rupture
someone's liver with a kick and then body

1536
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14,060
armor, you know, and talking
about no tournaments.

1537
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:15,920
We used to have the
where these body things.

1538
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:19,440
He's like chest protectors right now
because they thought people kick too hard.

1539
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,990
The body, it was certain kicks you still
even the chest protector on your fucked.

1540
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:26,060
If so many hits me, the turning side kick
to the body with a chest protector on,

1541
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:30,380
that's not good enough.
Sign up protection. Like
you hold pads for someone.

1542
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,510
You know,
if you hold Moy Thai pads,

1543
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,650
they're like a big thick pad and you know
you slam into them and still some guys

1544
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:37,161
where they kick all,

1545
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:39,950
you hold that shit for Bas Rutten
he'll kick right to that pat.

1546
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:44,240
It'll fucking hurt man.
And that's a big ass thick pad.

1547
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,570
The thing about that little ass thin
thing that they put on their body and

1548
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:49,940
talking window tournament.
So if someone in a Shin kick,

1549
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:51,760
like a roundhouse kick that
they would do to a tie,

1550
01:28:51,761 --> 01:28:54,540
pat is nothing compared to
like a spinning kick, right?

1551
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,010
When you can spin your
body and really get that,

1552
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,200
that fucking that torque into it,
whether it turning side kick,

1553
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,310
it's just there's so much
power that can be developed

1554
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:06,300
by martial arts techniques. It is kind of
amazing. No one's ever died. It's gonna.

1555
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:09,450
Well No, I think that is
the UFC. 50 years from now,

1556
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:12,900
something's going to have to change
because it's going to be people punching

1557
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:17,010
through faces. People, someone's going
to kick right into someone's stomach,

1558
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,460
Paul back and just a coil of intestines.
Just wrapped her

1559
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:26,730
legs break. I've only seen one in
person live, but it was a trip, man.

1560
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:31,470
It was Corey Hill. This dude is 155
pounds and he was like six one or six two.

1561
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:34,980
It was really tall and skinny.
I mean he's like a beanstalk man,

1562
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,870
like amazing aided looking and he threw
a kick and the dude check the kick and

1563
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:43,560
his leg just snapped. Just like in
those videos that you see online,

1564
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:48,270
you've seen a bunch of them alive.
Yeah, Dad. I never saw that growing up.

1565
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:52,620
Never saw that man. I saw Moy Thai
fights. I saw kickboxing matches.

1566
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,420
I never saw anybody break a leg.

1567
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,080
But as soon as the internet
came along he just slept.

1568
01:29:57,090 --> 01:30:00,870
You know like oh it's happening. It's not
that often, but yeah, it happens, man.

1569
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:04,050
I that's like one of the worst acid
trips in my life. When I was in college,

1570
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:04,590
I was,

1571
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:09,150
I was on acid and I'm with my friend and
I was downstairs playing ping pong with

1572
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:13,320
somebody having the, it was like
going to be a star spangled trip.

1573
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,840
You know where you can tell
where just like this is awesome.

1574
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:19,470
You're feeling great. We're playing
ping pong. God, life is beautiful.

1575
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:22,680
I love my friend comes down the stairs.
It's face.

1576
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:27,450
Why does it ghost stumbles into the ping
pong table, knocks it down. He's like,

1577
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,980
I broke my arm man.

1578
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,760
And He'd been outside skateboarding and
just fell on his arm and snapped his arm.

1579
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,560
And then that was like,
you know,

1580
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:37,230
entering in a six hours of
hell is my tripping friend.

1581
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,390
Had to go to the hospital and
get a cast put on his arm.

1582
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:43,620
So he was tripping and his arm was,
well Joey Diaz is a way we're story.

1583
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,240
I'm sure you know Joey Diaz was
tripping when he found his mom did. Uh,

1584
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:54,030
yeah, I'll take a broken arm over that
every day. Especially when you 13.

1585
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,170
Oh, I've had my arm break. I
haven't had my mom when you're 13

1586
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:05,010
probably tripping for the hundredth time
to have these 13 hey, if you guys can I,

1587
01:31:05,011 --> 01:31:07,380
this is kind of off subject
and if you've seen it,

1588
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,000
I don't even know if
you can play it legally,

1589
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:12,690
but if you guys seen the widest kids, you
know, pledge of allegiance sketch. No.

1590
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,750
Can we play that? Is that okay to
play it? Are we allowed to again,

1591
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:19,460
because we're on Sirius now.
Ah, it's so good. God dammit.

1592
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,560
It's get started Aaron on serious
last week. So this is probably,

1593
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:27,480
we get sued or they buy insurance
and everything for that jam. Yeah,

1594
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:31,080
you gotta be very careful that as that
I got a Thai massage the other day was

1595
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,330
first massage I ever had

1596
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,110
and it's so weird how,

1597
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,090
how [inaudible] this stranger like climbs
up on that first they turn off all the

1598
01:31:41,091 --> 01:31:43,970
lights and your lay there and you're
only in your underwear and this little

1599
01:31:43,971 --> 01:31:46,910
Asian girl just jumps on
you came and see who she is.

1600
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:51,110
She's jumping on you and just like rubbing
every part of her body against your

1601
01:31:51,111 --> 01:31:54,050
body. And she had her, both
of her hands down my pants,

1602
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:59,230
just like go like massaging my ass
like two inch be beside my asshole.

1603
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,230
And then there was this one point where
she had me in like this weird commerce

1604
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:08,200
Sutro thing where she had to her my legs
up and like been around her and like it

1605
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:11,740
was like having sex with
somebody but not having sex.

1606
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:15,670
And at the end of it I wanted to fuck
this girl and I didn't even know what she

1607
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:18,220
looked. Where's the parlor? Where
is this? Uh, this was just burping.

1608
01:32:18,221 --> 01:32:20,740
That's the only reason I didn't get
fucked. So if it was outside of Burbank,

1609
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:21,940
I'm sure that I check would have like,

1610
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:24,780
it sounded finished me off or
something because that was,

1611
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,870
she was pretty close though. It was
an hour and a half of just this girl.

1612
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,210
If you're not getting laid out there,

1613
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,680
go get yourself a $50 Thai massage and
find it the sketchiest neighborhood.

1614
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:38,200
You can man that.
That was awesome.

1615
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,810
I wish I knew about that
when I was 18 years old.

1616
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:44,980
I would be getting one of those
once a week or so. Good for you.

1617
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:45,760
You should get them.

1618
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,560
I should. I don't, but you
know what? I started lifting
weights really heavy again.

1619
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:51,030
I had this guy,
Steve Maxwell,

1620
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:53,370
who's is a world famous
strength and conditioning coach.

1621
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,630
He's a friend of mine and I've worked
out with him a bunch of times and he flew

1622
01:32:57,631 --> 01:33:01,110
in just to work out with me
for two days and it, you know,

1623
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:06,200
and he put me through two
hours of incredibly brutal
shit like yesterday and the

1624
01:33:07,951 --> 01:33:10,140
day before, two days in a row. Unbelief.

1625
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:13,140
You feel fucking fantastic
when it's over though.

1626
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,710
You feel like further where
you feel fucking completely
exhausted but your body,

1627
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:21,060
you feel like fuck if I do this,
if I do this two or three days a week,

1628
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:25,230
every week I will be a fucking
superhero. You know, he just,

1629
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,150
cause he's got me doing all kinds of crazy
kettlebell swings and all these clean

1630
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:34,500
and jerks and all the strong man shit
is crazy different fucking exercises.

1631
01:33:34,501 --> 01:33:38,790
But he said one of the most important
things is you need to get body work done

1632
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:41,700
after you do stuff like that,
you need it. It's not a luxury,

1633
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,550
like you got to get massages,
deep tissue,

1634
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,160
and even that painful
shit that you don't like.

1635
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:49,850
Like do you ever get like a
real sports deep tissue massage?

1636
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,820
I don't know. I don't
think I, yeah. This took,

1637
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,860
was standing on me at one point digging
her po like foot into my back and it

1638
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:59,720
hurt like hell. Massages are
supposed to hurt a little bit.

1639
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,880
That's how you know you're
getting a good one. He's like the,

1640
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:05,590
they're digging nd you, we've mad
cute. Most of us, maybe not you,

1641
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:09,150
but most people just take the
worst care of their bodies. Right.

1642
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,360
I take pretty good care of my body,

1643
01:34:10,361 --> 01:34:13,960
but not as much as I should
because I use it so hard. You know?

1644
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:16,930
That's why I had to take a couple of
months off of Jujitsu because of this

1645
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:18,430
reoccurring back injury that I had.

1646
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:21,130
I thought a thing called a rib
head that kept popping out.

1647
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:24,130
So I kinda stopped lifting weights.
I stopped doing Jujitsu.

1648
01:34:24,131 --> 01:34:27,520
I just concentrated on just
kickboxing or two whole months.

1649
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:29,650
I did very little weightlifting
like once every couple of weeks.

1650
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:33,430
So we'll do it when it pops out.
Like was fucking brutally painful.

1651
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:35,080
Where is it in your chest and your back?

1652
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,590
It's in the center of my back and it
would pop out whenever I'd roll with like

1653
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,360
really big good guys.

1654
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:44,020
Like when I have a crazy sparring
session where it's, you know,

1655
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:47,230
you know me and some other black belt
and it's just a attacking, attacking,

1656
01:34:47,231 --> 01:34:49,340
attacking, you know, and
you're moving so much in,

1657
01:34:49,341 --> 01:34:51,580
there's so much explosion that you,

1658
01:34:51,581 --> 01:34:55,150
this little thing in my back was weak
and that would be the weak link and it

1659
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:59,390
would pop out and I would keep rolling
too cause I would, I knew why it was hot.

1660
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:03,290
It was okay. It would hurt. I wouldn't be
able to move right for another, you know,

1661
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:06,160
it would fuck me up but an hour from that

1662
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,760
I'd be fucked. That's how
it works, man. I just, My,

1663
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:12,670
my dad came to visit and I just moved
all this shit for like a bed frame and I

1664
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:16,840
was like carrying the bed frame and you
always know you're going to be fucked up.

1665
01:35:16,841 --> 01:35:19,480
Cause there's this moment where
your back's like, hey yeah,

1666
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:20,890
that you knew it doesn't really hurt you.

1667
01:35:20,891 --> 01:35:25,630
It's just like a spring or something
pops in your bag, something fucking shit.

1668
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,800
Then the next day I was in agonizing pain,
but I want,

1669
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:31,530
what is that window of not
well that's right. Yeah.

1670
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:35,850
For the inflammation sets in the injury
sets in and then your body's going to

1671
01:35:35,851 --> 01:35:38,990
inflame around it to try to protect it
and that's going to tighten everything up

1672
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:40,280
and emailing, Gosh. Yet.

1673
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:44,550
So this fucking back injury just kept
happening over and over again. So I said,

1674
01:35:44,551 --> 01:35:44,881
all right,

1675
01:35:44,881 --> 01:35:47,550
it happened like three or four times
over the course of like three or four

1676
01:35:47,551 --> 01:35:50,430
months. So I said, obviously
I need to take some time off.

1677
01:35:50,431 --> 01:35:54,150
So I took like two whole months off
and then after that two months I just

1678
01:35:54,151 --> 01:35:58,350
started, uh, like lifting out, lifting
heavy again and working out hard again.

1679
01:35:58,351 --> 01:36:01,950
And my body is just starting to
ramp back up,

1680
01:36:01,951 --> 01:36:05,980
but now is the most important time
to get massage and time massage too.

1681
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,170
And Maxwell put me through a a bunch
of different time massage stretches to

1682
01:36:10,171 --> 01:36:13,860
where he got on top of my
body standing on my back,

1683
01:36:13,861 --> 01:36:18,060
like pulling on my back while he
was pulling my wrists and stretch.

1684
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:21,940
Everything's popping and stretching
it. Ah, but you need to do that man.

1685
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:26,100
Amazing Body needs to be fucking you.
You body's pliable.

1686
01:36:26,101 --> 01:36:28,530
It needs to be manipulated
and it's malleable.

1687
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,760
I've been trying to get
back into the gym again.

1688
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:34,900
There was a time I was
running five miles a day,

1689
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,690
which for me that's like,
it's a lot. That's a lot.

1690
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,850
I was doing five miles a day
working out all the time.

1691
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:43,370
I can't get hooked on the gym again. I
don't know what's wrong with me. I've,

1692
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,480
I'm thinking about going to a doctor.
It's like I want to work out,

1693
01:36:46,481 --> 01:36:51,250
but like I can only get, you know, two
workouts in and I feel really great,

1694
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:54,070
but then I just don't go back again.
So hard to get that.

1695
01:36:54,071 --> 01:36:58,150
Did that structure that this is very
similar to the problem with writing.

1696
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,140
It's very similar to the
idea of resistance that
was offered up in that, uh,

1697
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:05,890
Steven Pressfield's book, the war of art.
It's the same thing. It's like you're,

1698
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:09,850
you've come up with excuses and reasons
to sabotage yourself and then not doing

1699
01:37:09,851 --> 01:37:12,820
it to resist the progress.
Were you exercising before,

1700
01:37:12,821 --> 01:37:17,650
during a breakup or something? No, it
wasn't like a d no, it was, uh, it was,

1701
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,840
it was,
what was your lifestyle at that time?

1702
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:23,020
That was when I was doing that
ridiculous show for fuel TV,

1703
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:27,280
galaxy cabin log cabin and space.
That was where we were.

1704
01:37:27,281 --> 01:37:31,330
Joey Diaz played a, a guy living in
a boat that was inside your nose.

1705
01:37:31,331 --> 01:37:34,060
Is that what your neck now?
He was playing,

1706
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:38,290
he was fishermen and so he's playing a
fisherman inside my dead grandfather.

1707
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:39,430
His neck,
the fisherman,

1708
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,990
fisherman that lived inside of the boat.
Right.

1709
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:48,370
He's like an alien in the way that he
tries to attack people as he like lives in

1710
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:50,770
the next,
if they're dead grandfathers and try,

1711
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,860
their grandfather comes back and
you think it's your grandfather.

1712
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,100
It was a really absurd, that was the
best show ever. I think it's online.

1713
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,810
It's on the website, right?
Galaxy cabin. If you Google it,

1714
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:05,430
did you have some of the weirdest ideas
running through your fucking head? Well,

1715
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:07,440
yeah. I mean that's the thing though, man.

1716
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:12,441
Like the trick is to let yourself
make those weird ideas and it's,

1717
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,310
it's like really hard to
like give yourself permission
to really make the weird

1718
01:38:17,311 --> 01:38:19,950
shit. But sometimes I'll
see, I'll see stuff,

1719
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:24,810
I'll see videos and stuff that people
do. Like a, Tim and Eric are like,

1720
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:27,510
some of the people are really out on
the fringes of things and it's like,

1721
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:32,170
God damn it man. You have to have such
balls to make something like that. Right?

1722
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:36,090
It's so insane and so weird.
And if you try to describe it to someone,

1723
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:40,830
they're there. It's not, won't even sound
funny and it might not even be funny,

1724
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:44,600
but it's still, you brought this bizarre
thing out into the universe. Well,

1725
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,680
it's because Tim and Eric
can do what they want to do.

1726
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:49,860
They either on what does it fuel TV or
something like that and now they're on

1727
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:52,800
adult swim. Who's watching?
You know what I'm saying?

1728
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:53,880
I mean how many people were watching,

1729
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:55,290
how many people are
watching what they're doing,

1730
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:57,990
how many people are telling them
what to do? There's show is so weird.

1731
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:01,680
You got to think that someone is letting
them be them. You know what I'm saying?

1732
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:05,070
And that's why it's so fucking good.
Imagine if they had,

1733
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,130
if they were working for center
it live and they said, listen,

1734
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:11,740
I got this idea for a sketch. It's called
dance floor Dale. Have you seen dancing?

1735
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,700
If you haven't seen dance floor
deal at leas and gentlemen,

1736
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:17,760
please Google Tim and Eric's dance floor.
Dale.

1737
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:20,610
It's one of the most humbling things
I've ever seen on the Internet.

1738
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,760
It's so good and so weird and so out
there and so perfect in its weirdness.

1739
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:27,660
Everything.
The guy and the girl,

1740
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:30,540
it's about a guy and a girl meet on a
dance floor and they start crying. And a,

1741
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:32,790
both of them are real odd
looking and they start fucking,

1742
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,880
and it becomes crazy and psychedelic
with all these colors. And uh,

1743
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:40,420
and I remember watching it
clapping after it was over alone,

1744
01:39:40,450 --> 01:39:43,920
alone in my office,
just clapping in front of my laptop.

1745
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:46,590
Have you seen the two Terrys no.

1746
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:51,510
That's something they did for
funny or die where they play. Uh,

1747
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:53,350
I think we're hiring plays this,

1748
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:58,320
but they play like trailer trash
or hooked on glass. Uh, and uh,

1749
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:02,670
Tim has bay is fucking Eric and
it's really vulgar and disgusting,

1750
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,960
but they give birth to a puppet
that's kind of this mystical puppet.

1751
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:11,550
It's like 10 minutes and it
is the trippiest, darkest
most awesome thing. It's,

1752
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:15,510
I think it's called the two
Terrys. It's so funny, but it's,

1753
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:18,210
they're really man there. They
just did a movie, you know,

1754
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:22,180
what is it that Tim and Eric
Million Dollar movie there?

1755
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:24,360
I tell you what dance
for deal was so good.

1756
01:40:24,361 --> 01:40:27,240
I'm actually scared to watch their
other stuff cause I don't want to be

1757
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:28,350
disappointed.
It's all good.

1758
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:32,280
I mean they definitely go to these weird
creepy places like half the time you're

1759
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:37,080
like, Whoa, what am I watching? But
some of that shit is very just amazing.

1760
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:41,190
Brilliant. Especially at like the fake
company was the fake company that they use

1761
01:40:41,191 --> 01:40:45,360
throughout the Cinco. Cinco. Like any of
the product from single, the one with, uh,

1762
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:48,040
it wasn't a single apple
or something like that. Uh,

1763
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:52,830
the guy from growing pains,
the father who was in it,

1764
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:56,080
I can't remember his name. I don't
know guy. Anyways, they're the,

1765
01:40:56,081 --> 01:41:00,400
they're the best man. But you know,
you watch David Lynch or like,

1766
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:03,130
did you ever get to watch the antichrist?
That movie I mentioned,

1767
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,280
you watch any of these fucking shows,
these,

1768
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:09,970
these giant productions that get made and
whenever I see something that's really

1769
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:15,190
vividly weird or like gummo
think of fucking Gummo.

1770
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:17,020
Whenever I see a movie like that,

1771
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:20,500
I always had such respect for the person
who made it because they had balls man

1772
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:23,740
to like, what does Gummo Gum owes this
movie by? What's the guy's name? I,

1773
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:26,890
I'll tell you the guy's name right now.
He just did an, I believe, hold on.

1774
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:30,190
I'll tell you the guy's name. Gummo
is by harmony Corrine. Corrine.

1775
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:34,630
And he just did a,
a little video for Diane word,

1776
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:37,330
which you guys are saying that
he did this video for them,

1777
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:42,331
but harmony Corrine is this
insane director who one
documentary made that never

1778
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:43,571
got released his,

1779
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:48,190
he was going around New York and provoking
fights with guys much bigger than him

1780
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:52,990
to videotape himself getting his
ass kicked. Like he's a crazy,

1781
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,010
crazy, crazy guy. Yeah. Check
him out in any way. Gum.

1782
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:01,930
I was just this weird fucking movie
about these weird like white trash kids

1783
01:42:01,931 --> 01:42:05,290
living in a neighborhood.
It's awesome. But G,

1784
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:09,790
G U M M O and it's a documentary.
It's not a documentary. It's a movie.

1785
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:13,390
It's a movie. It's a move. So
it's not real. It's not real.

1786
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:17,710
I just wanted to clearly get that
weird kid eating some in the bathtub.

1787
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:22,330
This kid just sits in the bathtub and
his mom like feeds him in the bathtub.

1788
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:26,200
Like, that's one of the
scenes is fucking creepy man.

1789
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:31,000
She's awesome. Well it is cooled
and stuff like that can exist.

1790
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:35,230
It can exist because you know the
normal Hollywood machine is not going to

1791
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:37,780
approve something like that
cause it's too hard to sell.

1792
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:41,590
You have to get someone who has money
in a vision in the org can talk someone

1793
01:42:41,591 --> 01:42:44,890
with money into like, hey, here's my
vision. What do you think? Can we do this?

1794
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:47,170
Right. You know? Yeah.
When that's the thing,

1795
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:50,020
when you go into a pitch and
you have a really weird idea,

1796
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:54,370
all anyone at a network is going
to think is like this will never,

1797
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:56,110
no one's ever gonna Watch this.

1798
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:59,420
Even if in your mind you have this
pristine virgin up version of it,

1799
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:03,220
it's awesome. Selling really weird
stuff is quite difficult, but when it,

1800
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:07,540
whenever weird stuff makes it through,
a lot of the times it does really good.

1801
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,651
People love it.

1802
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:11,740
That's why adult swim is so popular
because there the one of the few guys that

1803
01:43:11,741 --> 01:43:13,870
actually let the weird
shit through and they,

1804
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:18,200
they produce just nothing but weird shit.
Sometimes I'll turn on my TV and uh,

1805
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:20,860
I have a projector and
there's a projector.

1806
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,830
The projector comes down and the,

1807
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,880
it takes like maybe 30 seconds
for the image comes on,

1808
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:32,860
so I'll hear the words before I
see the image. And so it's like,

1809
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:37,930
I can't do that. Why I'm part dog.
And then I'm like, what the fuck?

1810
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:43,180
Oh, it's adult swim once.

1811
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:47,680
Fucking weird show after the next. And if
my TV just happens to be an adult swim,

1812
01:43:47,681 --> 01:43:51,500
when I turn it on, it's like play the
game of what the fuck show is this?

1813
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,670
Before I could see the image,

1814
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,280
I can't tell what channel
it is until I see the image.

1815
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:59,420
Have they played your episode of Aqua
Teen Hunger Force aqua teen hunger unit

1816
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:04,100
now our special, they changed.
They changed the name.
What does that man, it's,

1817
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,320
I got to be on this cartoon,

1818
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:11,321
which is my favorite cartoon and
one of the funniest shows ever.

1819
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:17,100
Like I, it's just such a hilarious
show. But yeah, I got to play a,

1820
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:22,190
I'm on one of the episodes and I play,
I didn't get to read the whole script,

1821
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:24,110
but I play a triangle.

1822
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:29,000
I am on the episode with Neil Hamburger
plays another triangle type alien.

1823
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,900
Um,

1824
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:34,070
and I guess we're inventing these cell
phones that are basically in the future

1825
01:44:34,071 --> 01:44:35,600
are going to destroy mankind,

1826
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,870
but right now they're just very
convenient and everyone kind of knows it.

1827
01:44:38,871 --> 01:44:40,760
So like, oh yeah, that's
fine. They're like, yes,

1828
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:45,380
in a hundred years it will
devour all matter. But you
know, for now they're very,

1829
01:44:45,381 --> 01:44:46,940
they haven't really fast
Internet connection.

1830
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:53,420
That's what I recall. It's been a while
since I did it. That is by the way,

1831
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:57,050
so true. That could still be real.
That's what it was in that Kurzwell doc.

1832
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:00,350
That's the thing is like these guys in
the Kurzwell doc, which is like you,

1833
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,840
they don't just show raise
the transcendent material.

1834
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:07,400
Man Kurzweil has this quite optimistic
version of reality where nanobots exist

1835
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:09,980
in our bloodstream,
heal every disease and we live forever.

1836
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:14,030
But then they go to these other
computer experts and when you watch it,

1837
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:17,810
or initially you think they're going
to kind of refute this ridiculous idea,

1838
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,480
but they don't refute the
idea. They're just like, well,

1839
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,990
it is an inevitability that in the
future we will invent an artificial

1840
01:45:23,991 --> 01:45:25,790
intelligence.
It's more intelligent than us,

1841
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:30,950
but to think that this
artificial intelligence is
going to be kind to us and not

1842
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:35,060
just treat us like bugs or insects
will think of the thing is a god.

1843
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:39,170
It'll look at us as these like
weird little like Mala ski insects,

1844
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:44,320
like basically we're like cows and right
now we're in the process of building a

1845
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:46,430
butcher.
That's the idea.

1846
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,160
We're trying to construct
this super powerful butcher.

1847
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:56,640
That's what knows everything and knows
everything. Yeah, it's really weird.

1848
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:59,520
Not only that, the butcher that
can create an even better butcher,

1849
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:01,440
almost instantaneous,
yeah.

1850
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:06,190
Can go through 50,000 years of
progress within months. You know?

1851
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:09,260
That's going to be the really nutty
thing about artificial intelligence.

1852
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:12,170
It's once it's actually sent in and
you can create its own artificial

1853
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:15,650
intelligence that's far
superior to anything that
we've created and I'll do that

1854
01:46:15,651 --> 01:46:19,850
instantaneous. Yeah, they're literally,
we would be able to harness all matter.

1855
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:22,370
I mean, thinking about what they're
doing with this large hadron collider.

1856
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:25,010
Simple little monkeys like you and I,

1857
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:28,860
but with autism and much
more college education, they,

1858
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:31,100
they've created this crazy machine.

1859
01:46:31,101 --> 01:46:35,570
It's 17 miles in a circle that's spinning
these atoms around a cunt hair under

1860
01:46:35,571 --> 01:46:38,030
the speed of light and
slamming them into each other,

1861
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:42,140
making the most dense matter known to man.

1862
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:46,260
I listen as humans. This is us doing
it. Imagine the kind of shit that a,

1863
01:46:46,261 --> 01:46:50,460
a computer that can think centi
and artificial intelligence

1864
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:55,440
or are they going to even bother though
if when artificial intelligence becomes

1865
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:59,760
sentient, maybe they'll just clean up
all the stupid shit that we've done.

1866
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,100
Maybe they won't pro
progress any further at all.

1867
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,310
Maybe logically they'll look at it and
go, what is the sense of, you know,

1868
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:09,500
maybe that is a biological imperative
of human beings that we've created

1869
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,620
intelligent life,

1870
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:14,550
but that may be intelligent life won't
be under the same restrictions or

1871
01:47:14,551 --> 01:47:17,280
programming as we are.
And then it'll say, well,

1872
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:20,610
why don't we balance this fucking
place out first? Well, we don't know.

1873
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:22,530
And that's the thing.
That's what this thing's about.

1874
01:47:22,531 --> 01:47:24,210
It's like we really don't
know what it's gonna do,

1875
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,810
but sometimes I think
about it and I think, oh,

1876
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:32,070
maybe the way the alien comes
to earth is not an a spaceship,

1877
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:35,640
but maybe the alien is outside of time.

1878
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:38,070
And the way an alien
comes to the planet is it

1879
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,520
goes into the minds via thoughts.

1880
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:45,090
The denizens of the planet gives
them the inspiration to create it.

1881
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,880
So then they all start creating the alien.

1882
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:50,070
The alien comes through
the organic beings.

1883
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:55,190
And then it's just some weird thing
made of metal and wires and some super

1884
01:47:55,191 --> 01:47:57,900
intelligence that we made.
But that's the alien. That's,

1885
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,400
I think it's in Kurzweil's book.
He says,

1886
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:03,840
the first contact we have with extra
terrestrial intelligence or intelligence

1887
01:48:03,841 --> 01:48:06,480
outside of humanity will be
through the roof. The machine.

1888
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:11,610
It will be with a super intelligent,
uh, I don't like that word. Will,

1889
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:16,320
it could be, yeah. Could be, may
have already happened. Very possible.

1890
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:18,120
We've already made contact with some,

1891
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:21,510
something from somewhere else or that
we're in constant contact with it,

1892
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,390
you know, I mean, human
beings, we, you know,

1893
01:48:24,391 --> 01:48:29,391
we've found tribes in Brazil that are
isolated from us and we try to stay as far

1894
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:33,600
back as possible. That's the, uh, that's
what they do. They try not to interfere,

1895
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,460
you know, there, you'd find them online.

1896
01:48:35,461 --> 01:48:38,400
There's photographs of him and his
tribe and they're covered in red paint,

1897
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:42,110
pointing arrows at a helicopter. It's
pretty trippy. Well, I mean, that's the,

1898
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:46,740
the stitching stuff, you know, that's
such an Cichon Cichon Zachariah,

1899
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,520
Zachariah Cichon just watch this
documentary on Netflix about that shit.

1900
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:55,170
And it freaked me out, man.
What's it called? Ancient aliens.

1901
01:48:55,171 --> 01:48:59,040
Maybe it's a series on Netflix. I can't
remember the name of it, but it's like,

1902
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:04,110
it's a series on the history channel.
Yeah, I watch it. But it's, it's, it's,

1903
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,340
it's very sensationalistic though.
But just the drawings,

1904
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,050
I mean when you look at the cave
drawings, yeah, it does look like helmet,

1905
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:13,500
not cave drawings and you have to worry,
think about,

1906
01:49:13,501 --> 01:49:18,390
it's the Mesopotamian stuff from
Babylon and from Iraq, from Sumir.

1907
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,360
That's the fascinating shit is
really the constellation stuff.

1908
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:25,260
The really trippy shit as they have clay
tablets from 6,000 years ago that show

1909
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,640
the solar system shows the son and shows
all the planets in their correct order

1910
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:33,840
in the correct size and the correct
orbit. And it's a, it's a trip because,

1911
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:36,010
you know, we didn't, well first
of all, there's an image of Pluto.

1912
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:39,060
I mean if they add all those planets and
one of them was in the place where it

1913
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:43,140
should be. If it was Pluto, they didn't
know about Pluto until 1930 and this,

1914
01:49:43,141 --> 01:49:47,980
this is 6,000 fucking years ago.
I mean this is way, way before

1915
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,150
people were getting burned to death for
suggesting that the earth was round and

1916
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:54,940
that the earth was not the center
of the universe, but rather,

1917
01:49:54,941 --> 01:49:55,810
you know something else.

1918
01:49:55,811 --> 01:49:59,770
I mean with Galileo and Copernicus and
didn't Copernicus when they subject to

1919
01:49:59,771 --> 01:50:03,790
house arrest for suggesting anything
other than the, the, the, the, the church,

1920
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:08,140
his idea of what the universe and how
it was all structured. This is way, way,

1921
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,540
way before that.
All the Sumerian shit.

1922
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:15,250
And for those who don't know what this
says, Zechariah [inaudible] guy claimed,

1923
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:17,200
he claimed that the,
uh,

1924
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:22,350
the ancient Sumerian text detailed
a race from another planet,

1925
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,200
this planet called Nibiru that came in
an elliptical orbit and it came within

1926
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:32,830
Mars and Jupiter and got near
Earth every 3000, 600 years.

1927
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:35,440
These people called the Annunaki,

1928
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,130
which the literal translation is
those from heaven to earth came,

1929
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:42,370
which is like very similar
to the Elohim of the Bible,

1930
01:50:42,371 --> 01:50:44,620
which is those who came down or giants,
you know,

1931
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:47,410
people thought of them as giants and
cause all sorts of different ways of

1932
01:50:47,411 --> 01:50:49,240
describing them. But there's these, uh,

1933
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:53,080
this crazy fucking images that they had
in these clay tablets of little monkey

1934
01:50:53,081 --> 01:50:56,440
people, not just black people. They say a
black person wants. And I was like, wow,

1935
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:00,980
that's an alien. You know what I mean? No,
I don't know what you mean. This is the,

1936
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:04,600
they all have beards and they all,
they're all look like,

1937
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:07,930
like people that probably lived in that
era. They don't look like black people.

1938
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:11,860
They look like a weird gods.
These weird helmets on and shit.

1939
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:13,320
They're much bigger than everybody else.

1940
01:51:13,321 --> 01:51:16,750
And what about the skull compressions
that people did where they like tried to

1941
01:51:16,751 --> 01:51:21,260
stretch their heads out for
some reason? Yeah, I mean it's,

1942
01:51:21,261 --> 01:51:23,860
it's very,
it's obviously there's something,

1943
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:28,060
something crazy was going on in that era.
You know, there was, there was a lot of,

1944
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:31,510
they knew a lot of weird shit
and they knew it out of nowhere.

1945
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,480
Like they went from 5,000 years ago.

1946
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:39,220
I mean you're literally talking about
there was ego you go to like 6,000 years

1947
01:51:39,221 --> 01:51:44,170
to 10,000 years ago if you follow
what most archeologists believe.

1948
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,140
They were basically
cavemen 10,000 years ago.

1949
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:51,970
I mean there was no written language.
There was no, there was none of this shit.

1950
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:56,590
There was no astrology, astronomy. I mean
they had all the signs of the Zodiac.

1951
01:51:56,591 --> 01:51:58,690
They had constellations mapped out.
They had.

1952
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:03,691
I mean there is an amazing culture that
came out of nothing and there's two ways

1953
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:06,970
of looking at it.
There's the way that they look at it.

1954
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,350
The Zechariah Cichon and fans,

1955
01:52:08,351 --> 01:52:13,351
I believe that aliens came down and
genetically altered a lower primates,

1956
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:18,480
added their DNA to monkeys or
some apelike animal and made us,

1957
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,100
and this is a constant theme throughout,

1958
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:25,720
you have fall adjusts lore and people
who are really into flying saucers and

1959
01:52:25,721 --> 01:52:26,620
alien invaders.

1960
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:30,880
They all have this genetic
engineering theme to it,

1961
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:33,430
that that is the missing link in quotes,

1962
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:37,590
the difference that separates us from
from lower hominids because there's like,

1963
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,410
there's a,

1964
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:43,180
there's that giant fucking leap between
us and any of the other monkeys.

1965
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:48,050
I mean, there's not, there's no
god, it's not nothing close to us.

1966
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,810
All the other apes or nothing like us.

1967
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:55,280
We were so fucking advanced in comparison
to all and we were amazed that we can

1968
01:52:55,281 --> 01:52:58,670
teach a chimp to spell his name for a
piece of candy. You know what I'm saying?

1969
01:52:58,671 --> 01:52:59,451
But you know what,

1970
01:52:59,451 --> 01:53:03,050
if we came into a village in some champ
was sitting there with a cell phone that

1971
01:53:03,051 --> 01:53:05,570
he made out of a coconut, you'd be like,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1972
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:09,140
Hold this chimp down. Hold them down and
put the, you know, trank I'm tracking.

1973
01:53:09,141 --> 01:53:11,930
I'm tracking them. Get them in the
cage. [inaudible] Kevin the cage.

1974
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:14,540
He's making his own cell phone. He
made his own cell phone. You know,

1975
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:16,870
we would freak the fuck
out if we know we had a,

1976
01:53:16,871 --> 01:53:21,200
a chimp to figured out how to make
his own house and built a car,

1977
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:22,430
we would arrest that.
Chimp,

1978
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,300
chimp figured out how to build his own
cars and he's out there in the forest,

1979
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,050
you know,
with a,

1980
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:30,710
he taught all these other chimps to melt
down metal and they're hitting it with

1981
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:33,920
hammers and flattening it out and
building shields. We'd be like, Whoa,

1982
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:37,490
what the fuck is going on? Primitive,
primitive, primitive human shit.

1983
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:39,620
We would never allow in chimpanzees.

1984
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:44,420
You have imagined like if chimp
started building castles, fuck that.

1985
01:53:44,421 --> 01:53:48,200
Exactly. But bows and arrows with chimps
had bows and arrows and started hunting.

1986
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:50,960
Other chimps, we would kill
them. We would lock them up.

1987
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,830
There's no fucking way we would let
that go down, but you know this,

1988
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:58,880
this idea that that human beings at
one point in time were like that,

1989
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:03,800
that we were some sort of a lower animal
like that and slowly evolved and then

1990
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:07,790
rocketed ahead of everybody else.
The big question is how did that happen?

1991
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:11,470
I think probably would happen.
I mean, who the fuck knows? The,

1992
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:15,950
the ancient alien theory
to me is possible to me. I,

1993
01:54:15,951 --> 01:54:19,280
the way I look at it,
if there are humans and there are monkeys,

1994
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:25,220
it's very possible. There's something as
far removed from us as we are from ants.

1995
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:29,630
You know, if this, if this exists,
this, this model of the world,

1996
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:33,650
if you just use your imagination and
very simple steps and think about what

1997
01:54:33,651 --> 01:54:37,430
we're, we're going to be, if we don't blow
ourselves up a thousand years from now,

1998
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:40,850
if we do have this, this human, you know,

1999
01:54:40,851 --> 01:54:44,870
a technology interface a thousand
years from now and we become like super

2000
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:46,130
fucking hyper advanced.

2001
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:51,430
That is just as the distance
is just as far to me as us,

2002
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:56,120
to some sort of an alien that comes here
from another planet and it seems like

2003
01:54:56,121 --> 01:54:57,080
very possible.

2004
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:02,500
It also could be that human beings
have existed in this form for far,

2005
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:06,440
far, far, far longer than we really true.

2006
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:11,690
Then the W W we we care to believe
because the, the current like sort of, uh,

2007
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:16,460
the way, uh, a straw, a
astronomers or, um, uh, excuse me,

2008
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:20,000
um, uh, anthropologist when they,
when they look at, you know, the, the,

2009
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,650
the history of this earth,
you know,

2010
01:55:21,651 --> 01:55:25,640
you can only go back a certain amount
of years before things are just total

2011
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:27,830
guesswork, you know, and for human beings,

2012
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:30,820
when you talk about like
ancient civilizations, when,

2013
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:35,360
when those anthropologists sit down and
try to study clay pieces of pottery and

2014
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:40,190
shit and you, you start getting into like
six and thousand and 7,000 and 8,000,

2015
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:44,100
who the fuck is to say
there wasn't some incredible

2016
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,500
shit 20,000 years before that.

2017
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:51,810
If we're talking about sue mayor and
today we're talking about 6,000 years.

2018
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:55,650
Okay.
What if 6,000 years before that,

2019
01:55:55,740 --> 01:56:00,000
there was an amazing civilization
that had existed for 50,000 years.

2020
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:02,610
So much more knowledge than we have today.

2021
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,760
But they all got fucked up by asteroids
or by shifting of the polar ice cap or

2022
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:13,320
supervolcanoes artificial intelligence
that's possible. Too long made us,

2023
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:14,980
and we're all actually programs.
Right.

2024
01:56:14,981 --> 01:56:17,400
And the artificial intelligence
eventually ran out of batteries.

2025
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:21,320
Fucking died and rotted.
Gotcha. It's the old,

2026
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:24,090
it's like in a Mad Max.
Beyond Thunderdome.

2027
01:56:24,091 --> 01:56:26,910
The kids have a record player and they
figured out how to spin it and it makes

2028
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:30,600
us sound, which they like. Do you remember
that? It's like that we're just like,

2029
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:34,350
you know, we're, we're
grasping at these like ancient,

2030
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,210
we barely have an understanding of
these ancient technologies. I, I, I,

2031
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:42,660
you know, I'm obviously much
less of a skeptic than you are,

2032
01:56:42,661 --> 01:56:47,661
but the idea that some like genetic
Johnny Appleseed style aliens that are

2033
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:51,780
outside of time and space came
to this planet fucked a monkey,

2034
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:56,250
put some genetics into a monkey in a
way that allowed that monkey over the

2035
01:56:56,251 --> 01:57:00,090
course of a certain amount of time
to build a spaceship. In other words,

2036
01:57:00,091 --> 01:57:02,310
the planet or a time
machine or whatever it is,

2037
01:57:02,311 --> 01:57:06,030
and you're going and doing this all over
the universe because for you planets or

2038
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:11,031
just some kind of factories to organically
grow the super advanced machine that

2039
01:57:11,101 --> 01:57:13,200
we're all being compelled
to build and we don't,

2040
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:16,230
many of us don't even realize it.
That makes a lot of sense to me.

2041
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:19,110
It's a simple way to produce something.
It's a,

2042
01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:22,470
especially if you're something that's
not stuck in time the way we are,

2043
01:57:22,471 --> 01:57:25,620
or if your lifespan is
millions and millions of years,

2044
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:28,980
then why that sounds like something
we would do. Yeah. Does sure.

2045
01:57:28,981 --> 01:57:31,710
If we leave all the other aliens,
say if we came to a planet,

2046
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,680
it was filled with only monkeys and,
but we could say,

2047
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:38,730
let's take one monkey and and our shit
to it and just monitor that monkey. Yeah.

2048
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:41,040
And then we'll come back
after the things created.

2049
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,470
Whatever the thing is we're working on,
you know,

2050
01:57:43,471 --> 01:57:47,400
when the things created the art
of super artificial intelligence,

2051
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:49,560
that's when we come back.
Or maybe we don't come back at all.

2052
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:52,350
It sounds like such stoner hippie talk.
But look,

2053
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:55,140
if we exist and we study monkeys,

2054
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:58,860
you look at all the Jane Goodall Work
and all the fucking shit that people have

2055
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:03,700
done throughout history by studying
chimpanzees and gorillas and people have

2056
01:58:03,701 --> 01:58:07,980
been doing that shit forever. They'd
been studying lower primates for forever.

2057
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,860
Why would we think that we're the end?

2058
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:13,410
Why would we think that
something else couldn't exist?

2059
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:18,240
It's far more advanced than us, just
as advanced as we are to, you know,

2060
01:58:18,241 --> 01:58:22,200
in comparison to fucking monkey swinging
from the trees and in Venezuela we can

2061
01:58:22,201 --> 01:58:23,034
be just like that.

2062
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:27,930
But it is also possible that we are a
slow process of evolution that keeps

2063
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:29,760
getting jacked by natural disasters.

2064
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:34,770
There's a lot of evidence
for ancient society or not
interest societies or other,

2065
01:58:34,771 --> 01:58:38,680
but ancient cultures that
we don't understand. There's
a thing called the, uh,

2066
01:58:39,330 --> 01:58:43,000
anti [inaudible] mechanism.
I don't know if I'm spelling it,

2067
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:46,360
I'm not saying it right, but this is
the way you spell it. It's a n, t.

2068
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:49,180
I. K. Y. T. H. E. R. A.

2069
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,780
It's an to Kethora mechanism and it's
something that was found in 1901 and it

2070
01:58:56,021 --> 01:58:59,530
dates back to a 150,
200 BC.

2071
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:01,570
So this is before Christ supposedly.

2072
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:06,960
And it is this incredible machine with
a degree of mechanical sophistication is

2073
01:59:08,021 --> 01:59:10,900
comparable to a 19th century Swiss clock.

2074
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:14,860
And they don't know what
the fuck this thing was.

2075
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:19,990
And first they thought that it was a,
they speculated that it was a designed to,

2076
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:23,650
uh, maybe look at, first of
all, they thought it was a hoax.

2077
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,870
And then when they realized it was
real, they said, well, maybe they're,

2078
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:28,660
they're charting the stars
with this fucking thing.

2079
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,940
They really don't have any idea,

2080
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:36,060
but no one believed that anyone from this
date was capable of something of this

2081
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:39,340
sophistication.

2082
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:44,341
Like as far as like what we understand
about inventions when you're going 2000

2083
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:47,350
plus fucking years ago,
people couldn't make shit like this,

2084
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:50,050
but apparently they could.
There's a lot of evidence, man.

2085
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:53,680
There's a lot of weird evidence
that trickles down. You know,

2086
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:58,000
it shows like that. There were probably
some ancient cultures that were like,

2087
01:59:58,001 --> 01:59:59,500
all right,
way ahead of where we thought there.

2088
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:02,090
I believe that the most out of everything,
yeah,

2089
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:05,200
that seems to be more likely
than the alien thing or that we,

2090
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:08,650
where are we crashed here like a friend,
like we were from Mars.

2091
02:00:09,070 --> 02:00:13,660
There's a lot of people on the ship and
people that believe that that Earth was,

2092
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:13,990
uh,

2093
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:18,990
only a inhabited with lower animals and
lower primates and that Mars was the

2094
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:22,730
more sophisticated planet. And
then, you know, Mars there,

2095
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:26,440
they're absolutely convinced.
Now Mars had life and Mars had water,

2096
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:30,100
a lot of water flowing water and that
something happened to Mars and Mars lost

2097
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:33,310
its atmosphere. Whether it got hit
by a media, which is very possible.

2098
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,390
And you know,

2099
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:37,420
that's where all these fucking people
like Richard Hoagland tweak out about all

2100
02:00:37,421 --> 02:00:41,230
these weird shapes on the surface
of Mars and try to say, yeah,

2101
02:00:41,231 --> 02:00:44,910
we'll do no faces. They tried to say
that this is a pyramid and this is a,

2102
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:49,010
you know, this is a dye condor.
He drew structure and you know,

2103
02:00:49,170 --> 02:00:52,540
Tetra Hydro and they try to like make
all these weird connections between one

2104
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:55,060
rock to another rock and
they use mathematics and say,

2105
02:00:55,061 --> 02:00:58,270
this is very similar within one
degree of the, you know, the math,

2106
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:02,470
the way the layout of the great sphinxes
and the Pyramids of Giza. You know,

2107
02:01:02,471 --> 02:01:05,140
so who the fuck knows? But you
know, the thing is it's like,

2108
02:01:05,141 --> 02:01:07,180
look at the alternative
thing to believe in.

2109
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:12,370
You've got the idea that aliens
came inseminated the planet.

2110
02:01:12,371 --> 02:01:17,371
We're descendants of something from
another planet or the more popular theory,

2111
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:21,490
a bolt of lightning hit a plasmatic.

2112
02:01:21,491 --> 02:01:26,440
See what the fuck is that? Now that sounds
crazier than both of those theories.

2113
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:27,370
But wait a minute.
It's not,

2114
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:31,510
because what you're saying that the
aliens always existed and then that they

2115
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:33,870
didn't, no one made them
out of a bolt. Enlightening.

2116
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:36,200
I mean where the fuck did it
all comes down at Wyatt Bolt.

2117
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:39,140
The lightening got thrown in.
That's why not look, it's a,

2118
02:01:39,141 --> 02:01:43,850
it's a can of something happened.
Oh it's like a fucking lick up a storm.

2119
02:01:43,851 --> 02:01:45,140
A storm caused some shit.

2120
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,950
You know that electricity somehow or
interacted with amino acids and created

2121
02:01:48,951 --> 02:01:50,930
some little fucking Amoeba.
I'll tell you this,

2122
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,860
if I pause and choose between hanging
out with Penn and teller are you,

2123
02:01:54,861 --> 02:01:57,560
I'll take you any day of the
week, man. Penn's a great guy.

2124
02:01:57,590 --> 02:02:00,320
You'd like hanging out with them and
the whole fucking like I'm sure Penn and

2125
02:02:00,321 --> 02:02:03,320
teller. I'm sure Penn is great,
but I'm saying like that version,

2126
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:07,820
that current religion, that current idea
of things is so dry and boring to me.

2127
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,380
What do you,
when you're saying that current,

2128
02:02:09,381 --> 02:02:13,140
like what do you exactly do you mean?
I'm saying like the skip dice,

2129
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:18,180
cynical rationalist view of how life
came into onto this planet c is,

2130
02:02:19,641 --> 02:02:22,790
so if nothing else,
super boring,

2131
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:26,520
it's the most boring a
bolt of lightning hit, uh,

2132
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:30,200
hit some carbon and cause it
to, is it Darrell man? To me,

2133
02:02:30,201 --> 02:02:32,900
that Shit's not boring at all.
That's so fascinating.

2134
02:02:32,901 --> 02:02:36,890
The idea that that can happen and that
it is an inevitable process that happens

2135
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:40,370
just with nature. If that's what
we're creates it, if it's, you know,

2136
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:44,930
amino acids or water or whatever,
it gets in contact with some force.

2137
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:48,620
I mean that's amazing to me that I
don't think there's anything dry or dull

2138
02:02:48,621 --> 02:02:53,621
about that fact that that eventually
becomes consciousness to me is just,

2139
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:58,160
it's just higher order life from single
cell to multicell to this thing that we

2140
02:02:58,161 --> 02:03:02,570
are now, which is some sort
of an adolescent stage of
evolution between, you know,

2141
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:03,740
a conscious,

2142
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:08,741
a universal being and monkey
fuck monkey like Arnold a uh,

2143
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:14,050
fuck monkey. You know, Arnold is like,
he's like the epitome of the, the,

2144
02:03:14,051 --> 02:03:18,530
the, the transition. No Man wants to be
the governor and he's still a fuck monkey.

2145
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:21,490
Just shoot loads and has made,
what if he,

2146
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,590
what if he just Jerome about him
every night now. It never stopped.

2147
02:03:25,290 --> 02:03:30,110
I haven't as giant. I go back
to fleet. Joe, remember him?

2148
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:30,801
His balls.

2149
02:03:30,801 --> 02:03:34,520
I remember like this guy is just taking
his underwear off in front of everybody.

2150
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,020
How fucking crazy it was.

2151
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:38,660
It was one of the strangest
dreams I've ever had in my life,

2152
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:42,590
but it was so vivid and it's because of
these nootropics. I'm taking a guarantee.

2153
02:03:42,591 --> 02:03:44,780
You Chrissa Marcus who's
doing them with me.

2154
02:03:44,781 --> 02:03:48,780
He told me one of the weird side effects
of these things. You have crazy as well.

2155
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:51,740
We're going to get him. It'll be
where we are. We're filling out the,

2156
02:03:51,741 --> 02:03:54,220
we're finishing our paperwork and
everything where the testimonies,

2157
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,600
I want to get tested.
I'll get you some,

2158
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:58,460
I'll get you some right after the podcast.
We'll,

2159
02:03:58,461 --> 02:04:01,550
we'll call him and we'll have them
shipped over. But um, all right,

2160
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:03,770
so that's the end of the podcast.
Listen folks,

2161
02:04:03,771 --> 02:04:05,720
we were sorry we took the two weeks off,

2162
02:04:05,721 --> 02:04:08,420
but we enjoyed the fuck out
of coming back and we're very,

2163
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:11,840
very happy that we stayed in the top 10
of iTunes the entire time we were off,

2164
02:04:11,841 --> 02:04:13,350
which is amazing.
I,

2165
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:17,210
I'm honored that you guys
are a downloading it and
telling your friends and all

2166
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:19,130
that good shit.
We got a lot of cool shit coming up.

2167
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:22,490
We've got a lot of things in
the works. Click gas. Yeah.

2168
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:25,540
Cliffy be tried to reschedule to another.
He wanted to move to Friday.

2169
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:27,190
I can't do Friday.
I want to be in Vancouver.

2170
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:31,160
I think that's going to be Tuesdays me
a special edition at like 10:00 AM what

2171
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:32,540
we're going to do.
Either way.

2172
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:35,620
We've got a lot of other stuff
coming on too and we uh, we,

2173
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:38,430
I can't tell you about some things,
but we'll be back next week.

2174
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,900
Um,
I'm not sure with WHO,

2175
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:43,740
but most likely next week it'll be Monday
and Tuesday and I'm getting together

2176
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:48,360
with Kevin Smith next week two and we're
going to blaze and do a podcast at his

2177
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:51,270
place. Just me and him. So
I'm looking forward to that.

2178
02:04:51,271 --> 02:04:53,610
That's going to be fun as fuck. And I'll
let you guys know about all that shit.

2179
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,800
Sounds comedy. Hold tonight. We've got

2190
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:27,250
He's allergic to hanging out with us.

2191
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:31,470
I'm not allergic and using us for
the podcast. That's cool man. Yeah,

2192
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:32,620
