00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,050
Hello Freak pitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,241
Well,

3
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,890
and that's something that I think that
we've historically had this really weird

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,030
approach to medicine,

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:14,031
which I think is kind of a secondary
effect of thinking scientifically.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,030
And,

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,540
um,

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,710
obviously I,

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,360
my background is in neuroscience.

10
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:23,361
I worked as a scientist for many years
and I am very much a scientific thinker

11
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,040
and I'm all about the scientific method.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,270
But I think that we sometimes are
at fault when we're a little bit too

13
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,650
reductionistic and our views.

14
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,570
And so if you look at the
history of modern medicine,

15
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,190
of signing a evidence based medicine,

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,970
what ends up happening is that we look
at a problem and we try to fix the

17
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,971
problem and we look at it as if you can
somehow cut that piece of the person's

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,270
physiology completely out of them,

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:48,990
solve it,

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,100
and then put it right back in.

21
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,920
And it doesn't have any effect
on anything else in their bodies.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,491
I mean,

23
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,750
you look at medication,

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,230
right?

25
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,063
Um,

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,850
any,

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,590
any form of pharmaceutical,

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,060
they all have side effects.

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,430
If you think about what a side effect is,

30
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:02,580
it,

31
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,590
it comes down to how medication works.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,230
Medicine is a molecule.

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,070
It's some sort of molecule that fits
in a receptors somewhere in your body.

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,340
And the idea is that you want
it to have really high efficacy.

35
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:19,341
So let's say that I'm somebody
who has a problem with um,

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,080
blood pressure for example,

37
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,840
or actually let's just jump
into depression because
I've been talking about this

38
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,560
a lot lately around um,

39
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,421
Robin Williams.

40
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,690
I had Paul Gil Martin on my podcast
just last week to talk about that.

41
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:35,070
He hosts the mental illness happy hour
podcast and has really great insights

42
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:35,904
into,

43
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,420
um,

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,051
mental illness.

45
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:41,160
And I of course publicly have dealt
with depression most of my life.

46
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:42,480
I take medication every day.

47
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,590
I go to therapy every week.

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,723
I'm very open about it.

49
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,680
For a lot of people,

50
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,491
they would look at you,

51
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,350
especially people that don't
have any issues with depression,

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,180
obviously very intelligent,

53
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,290
beautiful young.

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,340
Why would you be depressed,

55
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,500
tripping over themselves,

56
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,340
trying to date you,

57
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,031
you,

58
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:57,400
you,

59
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,920
you're obviously very successful
in pursuing intellectual pursuits.

60
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,330
Why would you be depressed?

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,193
Exactly.

62
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,071
Why we're getting,

63
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,860
a lot of people don't understand the
differences between depression and sadness

64
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,580
and they don't understand that
depression is a biological illness.

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,870
They don't think of it and they also
don't think of it in terms of like people

66
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,890
look at it in terms of like,

67
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,011
well,

68
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,270
you've got all these sums,

69
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,470
these numbers.

70
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,711
Look,

71
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:21,660
there's all stack on that.

72
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,820
Almost Ken can make it
worse for certain people.

73
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,031
I mean,

74
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,380
you look at somebody like Robin Williams,

75
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,790
he had so much going for him,

76
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,031
right?

77
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,661
He was famous,

78
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:28,290
he was loved.

79
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,011
He had all this money.

80
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,940
How could he be depressed?

81
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,800
He didn't have the problems that you are.

82
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,240
I have and you know what?

83
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,840
Then you have this extra layer of guilt.

84
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,670
You have this extra layer of shame,

85
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:41,910
this extra layer of why the
fuck am I still depressed?

86
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,830
No matter how much success I get,

87
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,940
no matter how much money I make,

88
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,520
no matter how much people write me
letters and say that they love me and

89
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,373
whatever,

90
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,580
I can't seem to to beat
this feeling inside of me,

91
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,290
this constellation of symptoms
because it's not coming from that.

92
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,850
It's coming from your brain and is it,

93
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,780
I mean,

94
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,610
I don't suffer from depression,

95
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,070
but I have had many friends who do and um,

96
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,300
I have always wondered what it's because
it seems to be that when you go to a

97
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,710
doctor and they start treating it,

98
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,480
whether they treat it with medication
or they try to adjust your diet and in

99
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,870
prescribed exercise first,

100
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
that there's no like one simple fix and
everybody's completely different and

101
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:22,990
people get,

102
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,040
people get upset about that because I
think it goes back to to kind of what I

103
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,780
was talking about before,

104
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,650
which is a meandering way to,

105
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,121
okay,

106
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,100
so again,

107
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,780
to go back to this idea of a drug,

108
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,681
you take a drug,

109
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,060
let's say I take an antidepressant.

110
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,750
My antidepressant specifically is a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,

111
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,260
an Ssri that's called [inaudible].

112
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,320
That's the off brand.

113
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,460
I think it's Alexa,

114
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,210
um,

115
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
is the brand name.

116
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I take that it binds to my serotonin
receptors in my brain and it allows me to

117
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:59,341
dump more serotonin into the synapse
that the gap between two brain cells so

118
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,030
that I always have more available.

119
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,940
It basically tells my brain
that I need more serotonin.

120
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:06,070
So I make more serotonin
available to myself.

121
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,341
It's a,

122
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,570
it's a re uptake inhibitor.

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,501
And so,

124
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:08,860
um,

125
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,641
or sorry,

126
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,270
it keeps more serotonin in,

127
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,290
in the gap instead of sucking
it back into the cell.

128
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,730
So I always have more available
to me now it's a molecule,

129
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,920
it's got a shape just
like anything out there.

130
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,000
It has geometry,

131
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,780
so it binds to this specific receptor
in the brain because it got a similar

132
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
shape to that.

133
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
There are other things in your
body that are similarly shaped.

134
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,010
And so what ends up happening
is when you take a drug,

135
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,080
the specificity of the drug is only
based on whether or not the key fits in a

136
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,610
locked somewhere in your body.

137
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,010
But let's say that you
had hundreds of thousands,

138
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,760
millions of locks available to you and
one key and you started going through,

139
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,800
you'd be able to stick
that in a bunch of locks.

140
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,251
Some of them,

141
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,450
it might even turn,

142
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,050
but it would,

143
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,520
it would fit in the lock of
multiple locks hanging on that wall.

144
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,890
So what ends up happening
is I take this drug,

145
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,510
it binds in my brain.

146
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,460
It does what it's supposed
to do in my brain,

147
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,200
but it also may be does other shit like
makes me really fucking tired or it

148
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,060
makes it so I don't want
to have sex as often.

149
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,320
It's a side effect.

150
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,860
And the reason that you have a side
effect is because there's other parts of

151
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,380
your body that the drug binds to.

152
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,570
It's the same thing with medicine.

153
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,470
Like you were saying,

154
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,780
you operate on somebody whose heart,

155
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,690
the heart is connected to other things.

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,320
It's it,

157
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,590
it's the source of blood
flow throughout your body.

158
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,960
It is connected to hormone levels.

159
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,440
There's all sorts of things that can
happen when you put somebody on her under

160
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,101
anesthesia,

161
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,600
when you cut them open,

162
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,950
when you uh,

163
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,311
you know,

164
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,641
you,

165
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:40,180
you cause an immune response
and inflammatory response there,

166
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,570
your body is a holistic thing.

167
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,360
And so when you start
jacking with certain things,

168
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,980
other things are going to happen.

169
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,490
That doesn't mean you should throw
the baby out with the bath water.

170
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,700
But medicine is a risk
benefit analysis always.

171
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,990
How do they find the,

172
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,920
it seems to me that they find the right
medication by experimentation that they

173
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,430
try it.

174
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,770
And is that just because it's,

175
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,810
cause we don't have any tests.

176
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:04,644
I can't,

177
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,160
you can't go up as a doctor.

178
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,851
You can't come to me,

179
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,740
stick a needle in my spinal cord,

180
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,910
take out my cerebral spinal fluid and
measure how much their tone in I have in

181
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,390
it.

182
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,223
I wish you could.

183
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,930
I wish I could take some sort
of a blood test or I could,

184
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,003
you know,

185
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,510
p and a cop and then you could analyze
that p and say you're low on Saratonin.

186
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,800
You need an Ssri.

187
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,880
That would be what works for you.

188
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,620
Because other people's depression
comes from problems with dopamine,

189
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,410
comes from problems with norepinephrine
or some combination thereof.

190
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,580
But there's no test for it.

191
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,450
It fucking sucks.

192
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,530
There's no test for it.

193
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,100
And so what ends up happening is
you have to play a musical chairs.

194
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,030
You try a drug,

195
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,660
maybe it does.

196
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,890
The first drug I tried for aunt,

197
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,250
uh,

198
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,230
when I decided to finally
go on antidepressants,

199
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,870
fucked me up so bad.

200
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,741
I took an s,

201
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,011
n,

202
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:49,731
d r I,

203
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,860
a selective serotonin norepinephrine,

204
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,420
dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

205
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,770
I was so fucking depressed,

206
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,650
I couldn't function and we decided
let's throw the book at it.

207
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,170
Let's take the drug of all drugs,

208
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,860
the monster drug that does everything
and I couldn't sleep for a week.

209
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,870
I felt like I was on straight up crank,

210
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,750
like on crystal lot done.

211
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,080
I quit smoking.

212
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,071
No,

213
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,521
seriously,

214
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,271
I quit smoking.

215
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:11,901
It was awesome.

216
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:12,920
That's when I quit smoking.

217
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:13,820
That's an important point.

218
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,160
Terrible for your body.

219
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,700
Horrible.

220
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Did you do anything to try to naturally
stimulate your body to produce more

221
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,440
serotonin?

222
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
Did you try a lot of exercise?

223
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,270
Did you adjust your diet
but you didn't quit smoking?

224
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,951
I did.

225
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:35,390
I mean ultimately got on the
drugs only on the drug for a week.

226
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,370
So as soon as I got off the drug again,

227
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,170
I immediately wanted to smoke again.

228
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,180
But at that point I'd pushed
through it and I said,

229
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:41,481
you know,

230
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,314
I'm,

231
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,190
I'm at my lowest.

232
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,870
I was at my lowest
point I've ever been at.

233
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:45,171
So I was like,

234
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,250
fuck it can't get any worse.

235
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,701
And I did.

236
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:47,390
I quit smoking.

237
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,830
The thing about depression that is
fascinating to me is that there are some

238
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,831
correlations between how do are you happy
with what you choose to do with your

239
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,744
day.

240
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,850
I had a friend who was,

241
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,800
he was on like some serious

242
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,680
and they changed his life.

243
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,311
They got him,

244
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:07,640
he,

245
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,590
he quit his business,

246
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,570
he quit his job,

247
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,760
brother started his own business,

248
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,930
got involved in relationship,

249
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,060
and then once he got
to a really good place,

250
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,180
he slowly weaned himself off the
antidepressants and now he's great.

251
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,480
Yeah,

252
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,080
and that happens to a lot of people
and so I think that there's different,

253
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,320
what we have to understand too is of
course all psychiatric disorders or

254
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,400
spectrum disorders,

255
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:25,640
right?

256
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,520
There's really extreme examples
and there's barely any examples.

257
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,640
And if anybody who's ever taken
a psych course or who studied,

258
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,390
you know,

259
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,740
if you were a psych major in college,

260
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,570
you know that as you've
studied the DSM four,

261
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,050
which is like,

262
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,010
it's called the diagnostic and statistical
manual that they use in psychiatry

263
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:40,844
and psychology.

264
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,700
It's basically the big Bible of all
the things you can be diagnosed with.

265
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,691
The more you study it,

266
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,171
the more you're like,

267
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:45,800
I have that.

268
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:45,921
Oh,

269
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:46,401
I have that.

270
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:46,491
Oh,

271
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,780
I totally fucking have that.

272
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,360
And you realize everybody has,

273
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,120
everybody can convince
themselves that they have these,

274
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,500
it's like web MD,

275
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,321
you know what I mean?

276
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,410
So it's only once it is sufficient,

277
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,333
Lee,

278
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,420
detrimental to your life that
it affects your relationships,

279
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:03,690
it affects your ability to work,

280
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,560
it affects your health,

281
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,550
whatever the case may be.

282
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,320
And usually within the DSM,

283
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,050
there maybe like eight things and it's
like you have to have five out of these

284
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,884
eight things.

285
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,660
And so anybody can read it and go,

286
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:12,961
Oh,

287
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,970
I felt depression before.

288
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,600
But what they don't realize is there
is a difference between depression and

289
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,733
sadness.

290
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,590
There's also a difference
between parody depression.

291
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:26,130
So depression that lasts years,

292
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,993
decades,

293
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,380
and the type of depression that people
get that's directly linked to life

294
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,160
events.

295
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
And that's your dog dies,

296
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,531
you look well,

297
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,040
a big one,

298
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,120
you lose your freaking job.

299
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,250
Like we've seen so many
documentaries lately about this.

300
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,630
As the economy took a downturn,

301
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,750
people lose their job and then they
end up committing suicide because they

302
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:42,991
can't.

303
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,630
It's like this cascade of awfulness.

304
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,250
That's a really common one.

305
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,701
Um,

306
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:48,060
you know,

307
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,290
family member dies,

308
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,520
you have a stillborn or you have an
abortion or you how you have a baby,

309
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,301
a healthy baby.

310
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,740
Postpartum depression is incredibly
common and in that case that's much more

311
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,480
common that people can take meds,

312
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,690
they can do all these things and once
they get back to where they were before

313
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,040
that horrible life event,

314
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,010
they're okay to get off off the meds.

315
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Some people are able to get their
depression managed without medication

316
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,450
perfectly well.

317
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,940
Some people aren't.

318
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,110
Is the different reactions of different
people have two different medication?

319
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,670
Is it because their depression has
a different source or is it just a

320
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,750
biodiversity?

321
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,480
I think it's more of a biodiversity
thing than a source thing.

322
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:31,350
I mean as sources,

323
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:31,951
hard to say.

324
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,870
So depression is both
when you think about it.

325
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,040
Well,

326
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,420
brain and mind are the same thing.

327
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,930
Most modern neuroscientists say that
brain and mind are two sides of the same

328
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,441
coin.

329
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,720
That mind is just an
emergent property of brain.

330
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,370
Nobody's a dualist anymore.

331
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,400
They don't think that you
can like heal the mind.

332
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:50,040
And it has no effect on the brain
because it's the same fucking thing.

333
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,641
So there are,

334
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:50,851
you know,

335
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,920
some people's depression comes from the
fact that their dopamine levels are,

336
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,550
are not healthy or they're norepinephrine
levels are not healthy or whatever the

337
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,180
fuck.

338
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,740
But I think the common view of depression
now is that there's some sort of

339
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:09,741
biological difference in your brain and
oftentimes that's either caused or it

340
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:15,111
develops out of childhood or early
life experiences where you know,

341
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,510
you have some sort of trauma
or you have some sort of um,

342
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,711
development.

343
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:23,341
You have some sort of,

344
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:23,671
you know,

345
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:24,870
interaction with family,

346
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:25,830
whatever the case may be.

347
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:26,760
And it doesn't have to be,

348
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,330
you know,

349
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,440
you were molested as a child.

350
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,590
It can literally just
be like you didn't feel,

351
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,460
um,

352
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,710
loved or whatever the case may be.

353
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:39,711
And you've got this brain
difference combined with
this emotional experience and

354
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,771
what ends up happening.

355
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,670
Because when you're very young,

356
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,990
you're brain is very plastic.

357
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,980
So when you're very young,

358
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,950
you're learning skills that are going
to last you the rest of your life and

359
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,050
you're actually building
your brain architecture,

360
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,170
certain neurons connecting
and disconnecting and
reconnecting and pruning out

361
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,680
the tree.

362
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,340
The beautiful tree that is all of the
cells in your brain is getting pruned when

363
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,970
you're young and if you're depressed
when you're young and you're experiencing

364
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,170
those kinds of things when you're young,

365
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,070
you're going to prune a tree that's
prone to depression as you age because

366
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:12,700
you're going to keep reinforcing
those neuronal connections.

367
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,150
That's why therapy is so important.

368
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,930
Meds in and of themselves are never
going to get you in a place where your

369
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,580
depression has really well managed.

370
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,990
It's going to get you in a place where
therapy is going to be working better for

371
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,770
you.

372
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,480
Meds are going to be an immediate and
necessary interventional strategy so that

373
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:35,140
you're not crying or you're not
trying to kill yourself or you're not.

374
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:39,400
Whatever your symptoms of so you can
actually fucking get out of bed to work on

375
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,234
yourself.

376
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,100
That's what meds are there for me.

377
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,190
It.

378
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,650
Meds keep me from staying in bed all day.

379
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,120
That's a variable though.

380
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:49,000
Finding the right counselor has
got to be incredibly difficult.

381
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,420
It's tough.

382
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
It's like I always liken it to the
women who are listening to the podcast.

383
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,720
I liken it unto when you were first
deciding to go on birth control,

384
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,920
a lot of women will go um,

385
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,420
to their gynecologist when they're 15,

386
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:01,781
16,

387
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,471
17 and say,

388
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,240
I want to go on birth control
and they'll give them Ortho,

389
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,230
try cycling or whatever,

390
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:05,800
the pill,

391
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,790
the regular old pill,

392
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,624
and they'll be fine.

393
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,780
A lot of women will take the pill the
first time and it'll make them really

394
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,410
sick.

395
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,790
Like every time they take the pill,

396
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,150
it makes them want to throw up or it
gives them cramps or something's weird

397
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:16,581
about it.

398
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:17,620
It affects us and they go,

399
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:17,801
oh,

400
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,060
of this drug doesn't work for me and go,

401
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:19,451
Oh fuck,

402
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:19,691
okay,

403
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,750
let's try one with lower levels of
estrogen or progesterone or let's try the

404
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,340
ring or the Depo Provera shot,

405
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:26,110
or maybe you need an Iud.

406
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,731
I was like that.

407
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,620
It took me multiple times
to find the right drug.

408
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:31,180
And I think it's the
same thing with therapy.

409
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,040
I think it's the same thing
with psychiatric medicines.

410
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,791
It's not,

411
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,050
we're not monolithic,

412
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,540
so the same combination isn't
gonna work for everybody.

413
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,380
And the truth is if that makes you afraid
of modern medicine or if it makes you

414
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:44,020
think that psychiatry is
Wu or something like that,

415
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,350
it's the same thing as
cancer in many ways,

416
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,590
there's so many parallels.

417
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
Cancer's not one disease.

418
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,710
It's a spectrum of diseases.

419
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,150
If I got diagnosed with breast cancer
and you got diagnosed with breast cancer

420
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,150
and we both went in with
our diagnosis the same day,

421
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,180
our oncologist would give us different
treatments because we would have

422
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,440
different genetic markers.

423
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,260
We would respond differently to
different types of chemotherapy.

424
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,460
Chemotherapy,

425
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
it means chemical therapy.

426
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:15,010
It's a really big umbrella term for all
the different kinds of cancer treatments

427
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:15,880
that are available.

428
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,740
Maybe you would get more radiation,

429
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,780
maybe I would need surgery,

430
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:23,560
but your metastasis would make it so
that surgery wasn't a viable option.

431
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,110
It's,

432
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,240
it's a spectrum.

433
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,150
Disease and psychiatric
illness or the same way.

434
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,820
The variable though of the
counselor has to be kind of weird.

435
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,741
It is weird.

436
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:35,920
It's a weird find someone that you can
confide in whole heartedly and it takes

437
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,620
time a really long time
finding the correct sex.

438
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:38,891
Right.

439
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,160
Whether or not as some men do
better with women counselors.

440
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,200
I have a male counselor,

441
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,153
um,

442
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,120
like I would never,

443
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:46,511
it's funny,

444
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,650
I have a male therapist but I have a
female gynecologists like I would never in

445
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:55,070
a million let a dude like puts speculums
and me and like dig around in my

446
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,910
cervix.

447
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,000
But I'm totally comfortable
with a male therapist.

448
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,370
When did the depression started?

449
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,783
When I was child.

450
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,920
So you were dealing
with it your whole life?

451
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,580
My whole life.

452
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,413
Oh completely.

453
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,740
Some of those years,

454
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,720
like when I was dating bill
or when I would be moving,

455
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,690
those were some of the worst years because
it was so stressful cause he didn't

456
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,200
have friends and because I was
unmedical I was unmedicated then.

457
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,871
Yeah.

458
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,480
I didn't start taking medication
until about three years ago.

459
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,580
Really got 27.

460
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,390
Did you try other methods you try?

461
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,870
I didn't try.

462
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,610
I tried some things and I,

463
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,270
I've been in therapy my whole life.

464
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,990
My parents first put me in therapy when
they first started to decide that they

465
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,420
were thinking about getting a
divorce and I was a young man.

466
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:33,590
I was maybe six or seven.

467
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,210
So from the time I remember,

468
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:39,500
I've understood the therapeutic process
and they always really promoted that in

469
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:39,621
me.

470
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,680
So then even after the divorce
and remarriage is and all of that,

471
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:43,900
I started doing the,

472
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,010
the therapy thing on my own.

473
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,260
Then when I went to college
and I was very much on my own,

474
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,670
I went to college when
I was 16 by the way,

475
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,830
and lived on my own at
60 I was fucking weird.

476
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:52,490
K Yeah,

477
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,241
so I was a little,

478
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:53,901
I'm an adult,

479
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:54,734
but I wasn't.

480
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,221
I did that.

481
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:55,821
I went to therapy.

482
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,930
I did all those things by myself,

483
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:58,640
but I always had this mental block.

484
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,050
I always had this like,

485
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,561
oh,

486
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,640
I don't need meds.

487
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,800
Meds means you're really crazy.

488
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,440
Meds means you really don't have control.

489
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,240
And not until I kind of hit
a very bad rock bottom a few,

490
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,730
maybe three years ago did I finally say,

491
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:14,121
you know what?

492
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:14,570
Fuck it.

493
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,403
I've,

494
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,510
I think I actually have to do this.

495
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,860
I think it would be good for me.

496
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,430
And then it was the same experience that
I've heard over and over and over from

497
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,850
people where finally they get on the
meds that are right for them and they

498
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,480
calibrate to their dosage
and maybe they've been on
it for about two months and

499
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:30,740
they just have this epiphany of like,

500
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,200
why the fuck did I wait so long?

501
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,420
I could have felt like this my whole life.

502
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,940
What the fuck was I thinking?

503
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,880
Because you're so societaly.

504
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,860
We're so resistant to looking at mental
illness the same way we look at physical

505
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:46,694
illness.

506
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,511
We're so,

507
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,590
it's so easy.

508
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,010
Paul Gil Martin just made this point
when he was on my podcast last week.

509
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,680
If you went up to somebody with diabetes
type one diabetes and you were like,

510
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:58,550
what the fuck dude?

511
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,440
Why don't you just think more positively
so that your pancreas makes insulin?

512
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,610
Like what's wrong with you?

513
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,160
Why can't you just make more insulin?

514
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,271
It's like they'd be like,

515
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,440
what are you talking about?

516
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,420
It's the same thing with depression.

517
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,190
People put the onus on you.

518
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,113
Like they,

519
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,370
they look at it like
it's a disease of will,

520
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,510
but it's not.

521
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:17,901
It's a,

522
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:22,901
it's a biological illness and that's
just very hard for people to understand.

523
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,810
And so what you end up doing is carrying
around a lot of guilt and shame and a

524
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,441
lot of feelings.

525
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:27,591
Like,

526
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,341
I'm not good enough.

527
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,490
I can't will myself out of this
if I just think more positively.

528
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,600
It's not about that.

529
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,130
And I did that for years.

530
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,293
Years.

531
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,260
You just deal with it.

532
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,220
And I destroyed,

533
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,580
oh,

534
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,990
so many relationships.

535
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,050
I can only imagine.

536
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,990
I can only imagine being
trapped in that scenario,

537
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,450
but I'm also very sensitive to the

538
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,830
variables that different people
go through with their bodies.

539
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:54,090
I have hypothyroidism,

540
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,770
I have to take thyroid medication.

541
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,581
It runs in my family.

542
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:57,420
My mother has it grown.

543
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,200
Has it too.

544
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,620
Yeah.

545
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,310
And uh,

546
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,690
I,

547
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,170
I know I should get headaches,

548
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,720
these weird headaches at the
end of the day where I was like,

549
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,200
ah,

550
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,891
so fuck.

551
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,990
Like I could fall asleep
and it wasn't like,

552
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,520
it wasn't like I was like,

553
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,354
now I,

554
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,291
I get tired,

555
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:10,921
I go to sleep.

556
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:15,360
But it was like I could fall asleep just
watching TV and be out for like eight

557
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:15,691
hours.

558
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,650
Like it didn't make any sense.

559
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:17,850
It was like a weird tired,

560
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,200
like I was in pain.

561
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,981
So,

562
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:20,370
uh,

563
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,510
and I get these weird headaches.

564
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,940
And then once I finally got on medication,

565
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:24,271
it was like,

566
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,104
whoa.

567
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:25,930
Yeah,

568
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,171
right.

569
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:26,470
You're like,

570
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,681
oh,

571
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,514
this is,

572
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,040
this is what other people feel like,

573
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,520
right?

574
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,310
Like I thought I was normal
because that's another thing.

575
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,680
There's such a stigma in this country,

576
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,970
not just about mental illness,

577
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:41,470
but about any sort of illness where
people can't openly freely talk about it.

578
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,440
So you end up living in this weird
bubble where you don't really,

579
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,190
like,

580
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,850
I know people that have mental illness
that didn't even realize they had mental

581
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:52,600
illness until they finally
had a conversation with a
doctor about it and they

582
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:52,900
were like,

583
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,111
oh,

584
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,160
this isn't normal.

585
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,460
Like not everybody doesn't hear
voices or everybody does it.

586
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:57,791
It's like,

587
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,540
yeah,

588
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,390
because you're so afraid to
talk to somebody about it.

589
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
So that's,

590
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:07,180
I mean that's a really
important part of this.

591
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,730
I think it's just getting past the stigma.

592
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,740
That's why when something
like this with Robin Williams,

593
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,140
which is so fucking depressing happens,

594
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,200
a lot of people rally
around it and they say,

595
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,471
hey,

596
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:20,590
maybe we can use this as a
teaching moment because this guy,

597
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:23,440
no matter how good his life was,

598
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,890
he had this thing that he ultimately
couldn't kick and it wasn't his fault.

599
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,770
It just is that way sometimes and hey,

600
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,150
maybe you have it too.

601
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,770
I think in some ways it's good when high
functioning people come out and talk

602
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:42,730
about their illnesses because then people
who are actually experiencing things

603
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,410
like loss of employment,

604
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,191
loss of a loved one,

605
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:45,940
whatever,

606
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,480
or who have had a bad go of it for
other reasons or like even you,

607
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,500
like you had said before,

608
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:51,490
like even you,

609
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,020
but you're pretty or,

610
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,790
but you're successful and you're whatever.

611
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,511
Well,

612
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:56,500
if you could have that,

613
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,850
then of course,

614
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,440
it's not weird that I have,

615
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,891
you know,

616
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:04,360
it's like it's a good thing for people
to be able to see that they're not alone

617
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,194
like that.

618
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:14,900
Yeah.
