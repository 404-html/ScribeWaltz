1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,870
What is that gadget?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,200
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,280
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the fleshlight and entering

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,771
the code name,

5
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:11,350
Rogan,

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,180
you would get 15% off the number one sex
toy from men as if there's some fucking

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,790
competition is there,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,550
you know,

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,940
there's,

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,600
is there a battle?

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,433
The sex toys,

12
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,950
I saw one the other day that you can put
it in the dishwasher and it was pretty

13
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:23,731
bad ass looking,

14
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,890
but it vibrated and I
don't think vibrating.

15
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,300
That's not real life.

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:27,950
Yeah.

17
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,840
I don't need a vibrating
and fix the Jina anyway.

18
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,630
If you enter in the code
name Rogan and get 15% off.

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,430
And if you go to a,

20
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,720
also we're sponsored by [inaudible] Dot
Com oh and it makers of Alpha brain,

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,010
we have a new alpha brain,

22
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,250
uh,

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,250
for people in Europe where it's illegal
to sell vitamin B six in some parts of

24
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,303
the world.

25
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:47,940
Yeah.

26
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,960
And a couple of other nutrients.

27
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,140
So we replaced them with
legal ones in those countries.

28
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,540
So there's a new Alpha brain
for folks that live in Europe.

29
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,980
It's called Alpha brain source.

30
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,811
And that she would,

31
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:57,391
I really soon,

32
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,670
we also have the court accepts mushrooms,

33
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,560
Supplement shroom tech sport,

34
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,060
which is great for people that are like,

35
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,530
if you're into really working out,

36
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,331
if you really like,

37
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:05,550
like,

38
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:05,700
uh,

39
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:05,971
you know,

40
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,410
really hard working out,

41
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,281
that's good for you.

42
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,114
If not,

43
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,680
if you're one of those Brian characters,

44
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,740
he's not necessarily right and you don't
need those trim tech sport and your

45
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,574
life.

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,503
There's no need.

47
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,310
We also have shroom tech immune,

48
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,311
which is a great immune immunity
booster and it's good stuff.

49
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,150
It's,

50
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,810
I don't know the science behind it,

51
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,130
so I can't really explain.

52
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,060
But as it was explained to me what it
is is something in this mushroom tricks

53
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:34,590
your immune system and the thinking that
it's like a cold and your immune system

54
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,890
pumps up and prepares for
a fight that never comes.

55
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,480
And so,

56
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,570
and it has zinc in it,

57
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:39,870
honestly,

58
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,720
has a bunch of stuff and it's
good for your immune system.

59
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,760
And we also make a new mood,

60
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,500
which is a five HTP supplement,

61
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,071
which is,

62
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,904
um,

63
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,110
just gives you like a
little serotonin boost.

64
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:50,944
It makes you feel good.

65
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,020
Again,

66
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,380
uh,

67
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,110
all the stuff that we
sell@onnit.com I always say,

68
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:55,651
if you,

69
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,484
if you like anything,

70
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,181
it's too expensive.

71
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:00,480
Please just buy the ingredients somewhere
else cheaper and put it all together

72
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:00,811
yourself.

73
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,730
Steal the ingredient list online,

74
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,180
copy it and replicate it
and enjoy yourself were,

75
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,750
you know,

76
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,750
more concerned about not ripping anybody
off and you're not buying something

77
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,960
that you don't want to buy that
I can't overstate this enough.

78
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,660
That's why also there's a hundred
percent money back guarantee.

79
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,340
If you don't like anything,

80
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,270
you don't have to return it.

81
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,880
You just tell us you don't like it
and you get 100% of your money back.

82
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,020
It's really that simple.

83
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,460
I think what we're selling is good shit.

84
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:30,240
If you go to [inaudible] dot com it's
o and n it and entering the code name

85
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,590
rogue and you get 10% off.

86
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,491
All right,

87
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,450
kids strapped the fuck in.

88
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,510
I hope you've prepared yourself.

89
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,580
I hope you sacrifice the sacred plant
to the fire Gods because Michael ropers

90
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:41,731
here,

91
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:42,564
bitches,

92
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,750
we're going to get to
the bottom of some shit.

93
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,933
This,

94
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,080
this is an unusual,

95
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,660
very unusual man that's with us today.

96
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,321
First of all,

97
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,730
thank you very much for doing this man.

98
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:56,960
I really appreciate it.

99
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,794
It's an honor.

100
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,881
I bought your book.

101
00:02:58,881 --> 00:02:59,140
You,

102
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,891
me a copy of it today,

103
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,810
but I already have it cause I
bought it about five years ago,

104
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
which is crossing the Rubicon.

105
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,241
That's when it came out,

106
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:04,421
right?

107
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:04,611
When,

108
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:05,444
when did I,

109
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,540
uh,

110
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,200
uh,

111
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,310
August of a

112
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,653
bowl for

113
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,650
when I first became aware of you
was that speech that you gave,

114
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know where you were,

115
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,340
but as a speech that
you gave where you were,

116
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,210
you were talking in front of a,

117
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,740
some judge and some sort of a courtroom
somewhere and you were explaining how

118
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,741
you were an la police department officer
and you caught the CIA selling drugs

119
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,590
and you were just fucking saying it.

120
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,090
You were just standing
in front of this judge.

121
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,310
What was that instance?

122
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,400
[inaudible] who was that?

123
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,460
That was a,

124
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,190
you're a fighter and,

125
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:41,580
you know,

126
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,660
war and battle and stuff.

127
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,560
This was one of those
certain circumstances.

128
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:44,711
One,

129
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:44,860
uh,

130
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,050
one of my favorite,

131
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,950
um,

132
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,540
axioms about combat,

133
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,600
about fighting somebody was,

134
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,410
was given to me by a
chief warrant officer.

135
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,300
Four from Armenia,

136
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,390
from army criminal intelligence division.

137
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,240
You don't shoot unless
you get a head shot.

138
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,160
And I had the head shot that day on the
director of Central Intelligence and it,

139
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,851
you know,

140
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:03,091
it's,

141
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:06,510
it's Kinda like something that you can
spend your whole life in a fight or

142
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,850
combat waiting for everything to line up,

143
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:09,331
but you know,

144
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:11,160
when it lines up and it's like,

145
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,181
that's what happened.

146
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,700
So 18 years I had been trying to,

147
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,534
uh,

148
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,500
uh,

149
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,040
make somebody pay attention to the fact
that CIA had been bringing drugs into

150
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,874
the United States.

151
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,833
Um,

152
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,291
and,

153
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:22,531
uh,

154
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:27,150
and I had lost a career because I blew
a whistle on that and I'd been 18 years

155
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:28,770
and I finally got a
chance to nail the guy.

156
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,530
That seems so crazy that you're the
first guy to come out with that.

157
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:32,920
I mean,

158
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,311
I've know,

159
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,730
I've heard stories before
and I know I knew about the,

160
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,180
um,

161
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,580
the Mena Arkansas situation with a,

162
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,960
what was that gentleman's name?

163
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:41,770
Clinton.

164
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,190
Indiana.

165
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,630
Clin 10.

166
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,250
Terry Reed and the other dude,

167
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,530
the dude that got caught that
was over that Barry seal.

168
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,071
Barry Seal.

169
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:48,551
That's the guy.

170
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,950
He's the guy who died with George Bush,

171
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,160
has phone number in his pocket.

172
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,010
You know,

173
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,660
I mean,

174
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,130
that's a fascinating story.

175
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:59,131
There's a guy who says that he was
bringing in drugs for the CIA for a long

176
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:00,880
time,

177
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,080
right from South America.

178
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,500
And they would have a spot where they
would drop it off and apparently two kids

179
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,420
saw it and these two kids,

180
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,560
they killed these two kids.

181
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,390
And then they said it was suicide,

182
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,260
was the train track,

183
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,453
the train track desk.

184
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,960
So the parents fought for some sort of
an autopsy and the autopsy found out that

185
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:20,830
these kids had been murdered and then
it just spirals into this thing on

186
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,221
whining.

187
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,480
But who would have ever believed
before there was something like that?

188
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,691
I mean,

189
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,291
that's a big,

190
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,760
that was a really big case.

191
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,020
Well,

192
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,290
I,

193
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,750
yeah,

194
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,750
I came out with it publicly after I
resigned from LAPD in November 78.

195
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,023
Um,

196
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,810
and I resigned because chief gates
was going to let me get killed and he

197
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,800
wouldn't give me back up.

198
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,431
And you know,

199
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:42,091
and it was,

200
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,910
it was really six scenario.

201
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,110
I had perfect rating
reports and all this stuff.

202
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,850
So then I resigned and then
I went to the La Times.

203
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:53,340
So my clock on being public started in 79.

204
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,390
Uh,

205
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,580
but here's what's interesting
about all of that stuff.

206
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,360
You go back,

207
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,400
CIO has been dealing drugs ever since
before there was a CIA long story.

208
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:01,821
It's,

209
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,950
it's an economic issue more
than it is anything else.

210
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,810
It's just something
where they can't pass up.

211
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,800
It's just too much money.

212
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,180
It's going out there anywhere.

213
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,050
Um,

214
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,150
and it helps them do things that
they don't have to get approved.

215
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,420
Right.

216
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,870
Well,

217
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,010
that's only part of it.

218
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,850
Uh,

219
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,460
you have to remember that Bill Casey,

220
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,281
Ronald Reagan,

221
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,160
CIA director was a stockbroker.

222
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,930
The CIA was created by a,

223
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,150
the Dulles brothers,

224
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,770
John Foster and Alan Dallas,

225
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,700
um,

226
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,560
who were partners in Sullivan chrome.

227
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:27,741
Well,

228
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,401
they created,

229
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,510
founded the CIA,

230
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,344
Allen Dulles is,

231
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,440
so it's the Cin Wall Street have
always been one in the same thing.

232
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,150
And to deal with drug money,

233
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,170
which one I wrote,

234
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,020
a lot of the stuff that's
in Rubicon is that,

235
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,770
um,

236
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,770
you can move it with profits to earning
ratios off books in a crooked economic

237
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,780
paradigm and with price to earnings.

238
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,080
If,

239
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,670
if you launder $1 million worth
of drug money onto a corporation,

240
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,091
let's say,

241
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:53,571
Gee,

242
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,790
you as a price to earnings of 30 to one,

243
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,390
you've just created $30
million in stock value.

244
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,700
There's a huge multiplier.

245
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,300
And the CIA,

246
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,190
this is all part of the same correct,

247
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,580
corrupt economic paradigm
which is destroying us.

248
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:12,080
Now that's the case that I started on
then trying to find out what the fuck is

249
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,130
going on around here.

250
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,790
How did you find out and did other people
know and just keep their mouth shut?

251
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,653
Like how did you,

252
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,740
how did you know,

253
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,870
how was their like ultimate proof to you?

254
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,410
Well,

255
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,070
uh,

256
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,560
well when I saw it with
my eyeballs was proof,

257
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,940
but see how I got into,

258
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,410
it's a completely different deal.

259
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,460
Um,

260
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,110
I have a special birth.

261
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,980
My mother was a senior crypt analyst for
the Army Security Agency in World War

262
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,550
II.

263
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,620
Her work product went
to Secretary of state,

264
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,990
secretary of war and
President Roosevelt highest,

265
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,310
she worked on Japanese codes,

266
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,144
the Russian codes.

267
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:41,900
Okay.

268
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,910
My father was a decorated air force,

269
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,560
a hero of veteran.

270
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,110
He was in [inaudible] World War II.

271
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Then it came up on all this stuff
and he both were connected with CIS.

272
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,750
I came from a CIF family.

273
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,970
So I mean I used to come
home from grade school and,

274
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:57,530
and say,

275
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:57,801
mom,

276
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,311
what's for dinner?

277
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:58,701
And she'd say,

278
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,534
I can't tell you.

279
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,910
Ah,

280
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,830
Gotcha.

281
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,580
So,

282
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,350
so anyway,

283
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,990
uh,

284
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,320
uh,

285
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,480
so I was marked and plus I was gifted,

286
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:08,751
you know,

287
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:13,751
I was a good smart guy and so I was being
groomed because the CIA has people in

288
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,100
police departments all over the
country and they have for years.

289
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,120
Laura Nola,

290
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,953
that's what they do.

291
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
So I was being recruited into that
because I already had a cute clearance,

292
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,210
which I had had just from
living with my parents.

293
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,150
And so that kind of marked me as
somebody who would like on the inside,

294
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,984
but I wasn't really,

295
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,380
you know,

296
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,290
I wasn't going to go along with
drugs one when that's what I saw,

297
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,040
what it was.

298
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,850
I wouldn't do it.

299
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,470
And everybody else who's
just going along with it,

300
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,220
or do they just turn a blind dog?

301
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,523
There's,

302
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,691
how does it mean?

303
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,524
How has it,

304
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,610
how does it go?

305
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,181
How does it work?

306
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:47,690
Well,

307
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,710
what happens is that,

308
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,910
I'm sure you understand this,

309
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,744
this is that,

310
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,500
uh,

311
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,840
we w w we live in a world
that's full of sell outs.

312
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,070
We're surrounded by sell

313
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,441
outs.

314
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,150
We're surrounded by a,

315
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,030
and this came up really recently with,

316
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:00,450
with,

317
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,360
with occupy and my French and Mark
Thomas and all this stuff that we got

318
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,620
together involved with that.

319
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,580
It's about honor.

320
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,690
Um,

321
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,170
and,

322
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,680
and,

323
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,400
uh,

324
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,760
uh,

325
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,610
some people just aren't
capable of selling out,

326
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,121
I guess.

327
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,290
And I guess I'm one of those,

328
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,660
but most people resign themselves.

329
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,520
And not everybody knows this.

330
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:17,701
Like,

331
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,040
not every LAPD cop knows this happens,

332
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,281
you know,

333
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,600
it's compartmentalize.

334
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:21,871
But,

335
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,704
uh,

336
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,663
uh,

337
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,180
there's a lot of people out there in
law enforcement and I think we've seen

338
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:27,511
this,

339
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,050
uh,

340
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,120
with the occupy movement of the way
veterans and some cops have responded to.

341
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,730
There's a lot of people inside the
system who were really honest and they're

342
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,830
just waiting for somebody else
to show them how to do it.

343
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,740
Wow.

344
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,270
What a terrifying situation.

345
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:46,620
So you're the first guy to step up and
you step up and step out and say that in

346
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,870
front of all these people on television,

347
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,310
what happens then?

348
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,670
Yeah.

349
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,590
I'm not so sure I was
the first to step up.

350
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm like that.

351
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,150
Well,

352
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,150
I was the first to do it and stay alive
and the first to do it and find a way to

353
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,780
get shit like this done.

354
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,500
Do you think it's almost safer to come
out with something like that than it is

355
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,830
to be the guy who hasn't said
anything and they could silence?

356
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,431
Yeah,

357
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:08,920
I mean,

358
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,570
yeah,

359
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,860
being transparent publicly is
your absolute best offense.

360
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,870
And that's something I've
done for 35 years now.

361
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,990
But you got to a point in one point,

362
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,520
were you appointed one point where you,

363
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,410
where you were worried
about your own life,

364
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,670
like you left the country for awhile,

365
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,593
right?

366
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,830
Many times I've,

367
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
I've never not really been,

368
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,350
uh,

369
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,840
that you like one of those dudes like
wakes up and hears something and just

370
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,890
fucking packed your bags.

371
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:32,724
He gets on a plane.

372
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,150
No,

373
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,361
I mean,

374
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,380
how many times did you do it?

375
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,661
No.

376
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:34,850
Oh

377
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,211
No.

378
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:35,640
Uh,

379
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,140
uh,

380
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,820
you make peace with it.

381
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,710
You have to learn how to live with it.

382
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,113
Um,

383
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,500
one of my training officers that LAPD
had been a marine with the fifth marines

384
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,520
in the citadel at way,

385
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,301
and he said,

386
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,500
you can get used to anything.

387
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,390
And that was a,

388
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,710
that was a real teacher.

389
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:54,920
So it's not that you can't
live on adrenaline forever,

390
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,851
you know,

391
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,380
so you make peace and then,

392
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,120
but being public is,

393
00:10:59,121 --> 00:10:59,860
uh,

394
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,380
is,

395
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,840
is always the best safety.

396
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,790
Why were you worried about your life?

397
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,990
What was it specifically?

398
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,900
Well,

399
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,320
what,

400
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,870
what I,

401
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,531
what I would have,

402
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:10,660
what I was exposing.

403
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,940
Now you have to bear in mind that
when I was at LAPD and I resigned,

404
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,820
I had pulled like the tail
of something out of a hole.

405
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,280
I didn't know what was
attached to the rest of,

406
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,030
it's like,

407
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,090
I'm just gonna pull on this one
worm and Allston until I ended.

408
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,630
It's the,

409
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,740
it's the can of worms.

410
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,480
So,

411
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,730
uh,

412
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,770
but clearly what I had,

413
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,180
the CIA was directly involved in bringing
heroin into this country illegally of

414
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,230
using police officers in their pay or
control with the clearances to protect

415
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,400
those drug shipments.

416
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,170
And they were laundering the drug money.

417
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,310
Uh,

418
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,791
and,

419
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,720
and that it had to have been
known at a White House level.

420
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,560
And that was in 1970 78.

421
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,550
That's incredible.

422
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,460
And they thought that you just
keep getting away with it.

423
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,330
Well,

424
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,631
yeah.

425
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,464
But yeah,

426
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,260
those who went in a
rigged game gets stupid.

427
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:00,850
Yeah.

428
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,211
Those,

429
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:01,291
yeah.

430
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:01,541
I mean,

431
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,270
you know,

432
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,130
it's always fucking playing your way
and this and that get real sloppy.

433
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,993
It's true.

434
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,301
Wow,

435
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:08,030
that's a

436
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,720
brilliant point.

437
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,070
I've never heard anybody put it that way,

438
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,060
but you're absolutely right.

439
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,380
It's just human nature.

440
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,940
Yeah.

441
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,220
Yeah.

442
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,471
And,

443
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,630
and what I say now,

444
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:14,861
you know,

445
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,290
with the collapse of human industrial
civilization as the dinosaurs are not

446
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,480
capable of being anything
other than dinosaurs.

447
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,270
Well it is certainly if you
look at what we're doing,

448
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,700
why we're struggling at home so badly,

449
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:32,590
we insist on engaging and all these
things overseas that are pay strange

450
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,430
dividends and we don't,

451
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,761
we don't,

452
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:33,941
you know,

453
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,170
there's nothing tangible about it.

454
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,000
But tangibly in this country right now,

455
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,800
like people were having a
really fucking hard time,

456
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:43,801
but yet all of this money and all these
resources are going overseas to fight

457
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,120
wars that almost no one agrees with.

458
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,670
And when you look at it like
that is just sloppiness.

459
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,080
That just seems sloppy.

460
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:50,790
It's this,

461
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,030
it's so preposterous.

462
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,890
I mean it's so without merit.

463
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,610
Like if there wasn't some sort of a nine
11 attack and you propose this sort of

464
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,600
a ridiculous war,

465
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,820
everybody but like get
the fuck outta here.

466
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,490
But because of the initial nine 11 attack,

467
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,780
because there was something so big,

468
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,220
they capitalized on it.

469
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,020
And now they have written the
bad intentions right into the,

470
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,270
when you were on Leno
recently with Ron Paul,

471
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,560
I saw the great segment.

472
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,483
I mean like,

473
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,240
Ooh.

474
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,571
So,

475
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:15,990
uh,

476
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,200
but what I caught him and,

477
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,960
and I've been doing it.

478
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,130
I,

479
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,361
you know,

480
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,670
I've met Ron Paul and know him.

481
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,000
We're not good friends.

482
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,320
He's been in a film I made,

483
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:24,720
but I've tracked him for
a long time when we're,

484
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,040
when Ron Paul said,

485
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,090
um,

486
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,570
now the White House is trying to tell us
that Iran had something to do when with

487
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:31,141
nine 11.

488
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:31,261
Well,

489
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,094
that's what they ended.

490
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,720
The audience went berserk.

491
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,630
The collective
consciousness and waking up,

492
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,070
everybody here is like,

493
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:41,551
wait,

494
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,780
filled right up to here,

495
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,730
right up to here right now.

496
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,200
And they're just ready.

497
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,650
And,

498
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,190
and really that's why I think Ron Paul
such a threat right now because of Ron

499
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,060
Paul wins in Iowa,

500
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,433
not would,

501
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,550
uh,

502
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:53,970
uh,

503
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,360
it's a whole new political ballgame in
this country because that all of a sudden

504
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,040
it's,

505
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,580
it's going to be the norm,

506
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,190
a substantial norm for people to see
somebody like Ron Paul not believing all

507
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:05,970
that bull shit,

508
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,870
then it's safe for them.

509
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,240
How rig do you think voting is,

510
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,160
uh,

511
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,230
do you think is rigged at all?

512
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,710
Do you think it's 100% legitimate?

513
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,220
Well,

514
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,210
you think it's rigged still.

515
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,351
Listen,

516
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:20,460
after 2000 and I've been an investigative
journalist for a long time and I've

517
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,840
done a lot of writing about this.

518
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,890
They took the election 2000 was
stolen election 2004 choice point,

519
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,731
Dee Dee bold,

520
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,830
all the software and all that.

521
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,510
I watched that documentary
making democracy.

522
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,860
Unbelievable.

523
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,420
So fascinating.

524
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,160
But they can rig within certain,

525
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,200
because there are people
who see the polling places.

526
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:39,000
There are people and people know,

527
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:39,571
you know,

528
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,370
we had 80 people come in who are on Paul.

529
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,080
So they can't just say if
80% of the people vote green,

530
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,900
the 80% voted red cause
nobody would believe it.

531
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,870
Right.

532
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,220
All right.

533
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,350
So I think that Ron Paul is so far,

534
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,380
way much further ahead than
he's being shown in the polls.

535
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,740
I really think that there is a,

536
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,610
let's say Ron Paul is in
the forties and 50s and I,

537
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,730
which they wouldn't dare
let be known the and,

538
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,631
and the point is,

539
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,700
if he wins are wins with a landslide.

540
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,520
It's,

541
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,690
it's now Democrats and
Republicans no more.

542
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,231
It's Ron,

543
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,450
Paul and the Democrats
and the Republicans.

544
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,590
So we've got a whole new paradigm.

545
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,963
Wow,

546
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,800
I won.

547
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,041
Yeah.

548
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,670
So he has to win by such a substantial
margin that they can't fake it.

549
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,160
It has to almost be unanimous.

550
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,840
But you know,

551
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,673
it's so far,

552
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,750
the frightening thing to a lot
of people about it is the dis,

553
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,090
the sheer change that,

554
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:35,680
or a Ron Paul would bring about.

555
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,510
And you know,

556
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,840
that a real change like that is
absolutely terrifying to people.

557
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,960
Even though they know that the situation
right now is completely fucked up.

558
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,250
Completely unfair.

559
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,720
The congress is bought,

560
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:47,770
everything is stolen.

561
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,060
It's a total wreck.

562
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
They would still,

563
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,490
they're terrified of change.

564
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,623
It's terrified.

565
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,430
Not so much anymore.

566
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,680
You've got to get beaten into
a state of reasonableness.

567
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,461
You think it's the,

568
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,630
it's at the tipping point.

569
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:03,340
We're at the collapse of human industrial
civilization says 2008 that the world

570
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:04,780
is turned inside out several times.

571
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,100
It's getting nothing but worse.

572
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,420
And people are,

573
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,240
you know,

574
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,350
one of the best lines I heard
out of the occupy movement was,

575
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,680
uh,

576
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,040
somebody was asking the protesters are
moving along in New York and what are you

577
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,691
protesting?

578
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,800
And this really attractive,

579
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,080
smart woman says everything.

580
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,660
Everything,

581
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,120
everything is corrupt.

582
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,040
Everything is a lie.

583
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,600
Everything is bogus.

584
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,220
And all,

585
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,471
you know,

586
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,000
there's a lot of us that can see that.

587
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,720
Is it gotten worse or have
people just gotten more aware?

588
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,880
Both.

589
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,660
Both.

590
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,130
Both.

591
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,510
So it's accelerating as well as people
picking up on the rate of chain.

592
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,570
Now you gotta remember I'm,

593
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:45,071
I'm this guy,

594
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,580
it's been at this 35 years and you
don't want it to look so healthy.

595
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,350
You should be a fucking mess.

596
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,561
Oh,

597
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:50,980
I am.

598
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,090
The amount of stress.

599
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,500
But you look fine.

600
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,580
I eat really good.

601
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,060
Yeah.

602
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,290
I,

603
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,610
I'm on two and a half acres
in northern California.

604
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,500
Outside of Sebastopol.

605
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,413
Permaculture,

606
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,331
you grow your own.

607
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:01,571
Well,

608
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,300
we're growing food and I eat raw organic.

609
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:08,080
I go out and pick a raw salad out of my
garden and just eat it after you pick

610
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:08,770
the leaf.

611
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,340
Oh Wow.

612
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,060
And uh,

613
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,200
and so I eat good.

614
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,130
Uh,

615
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,180
and other than that I'm maybe good genes
and I spent a lot of time working out

616
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,530
and training over and over the years,

617
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:17,920
you know,

618
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,300
to,

619
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,133
uh,

620
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,150
I had to and I hung with some
really cool people along the way.

621
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,463
Right now my,

622
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,100
I have a bad rotator cuff here.

623
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,990
The cartilage is gone,

624
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,070
so I can't work out too much.

625
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,670
Oh really?

626
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,503
Yeah,

627
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,021
yeah.

628
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:29,711
That's a drag.

629
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:32,080
We're shoulder injuries or
they're very complicated,

630
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,460
very difficult to fix.

631
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,200
A lot of people have shoulder issues,

632
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,140
becomes a big problem till
they have surgery on it.

633
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,790
And even then like surgery,

634
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,660
now they're pretty good at it.

635
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:41,800
But back in the day,

636
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:42,910
if you had a shoulder issue,

637
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,721
it was a big one.

638
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:44,201
It's just such a,

639
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,460
such a complicated joint.

640
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,141
But that's a,

641
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,580
so that's the way you blew off steam.

642
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,160
But I can't imagine being under

643
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,300
that kind of pressure,

644
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,143
having,

645
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,600
knowing that people were upset at me
knowing what I w you know what you said,

646
00:17:56,601 --> 00:18:00,470
you know about all these
fucking bad people and your,

647
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,403
you know,

648
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,730
okay.

649
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,051
And you,

650
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:03,300
you,

651
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,870
you're,

652
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,620
you're out there,

653
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,920
you know,

654
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
exposed constantly,

655
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:06,840
uh,

656
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,081
you know,

657
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:08,880
doing radio interviews,

658
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,870
constantly doing,

659
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:10,704
you know,

660
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,050
um,

661
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,960
uh,

662
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,910
I wouldn't have been able to do any
of this without my spiritual life and,

663
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:18,211
and,

664
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,150
and some very deep and
profound spiritual practices.

665
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,250
A,

666
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,083
I'm a guy in,

667
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,830
I believe that this planet is alive.

668
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,260
A guy in a guy.

669
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,011
What kind of,

670
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,140
what does this is like a religion?

671
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,970
Yeah.

672
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,120
Guy At mother earth.

673
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,983
She's alive.

674
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:34,520
You know,

675
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,670
isn't it interesting that,

676
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:35,980
uh,

677
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,330
you,

678
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,340
you take the planets out from the sun,

679
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,080
Mercury is a god.

680
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,190
Venus is a goddess squat bar.

681
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,020
Mars is it got every other
planet is a god or a goddess,

682
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:46,801
except for this one.

683
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,280
Why?

684
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
Her name is Gloria.

685
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,313
She's alive.

686
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,851
So,

687
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:51,301
um,

688
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,150
is this something that's
actually written down as,

689
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:54,630
as an ideology or is it just your,

690
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:58,750
you have a philosophy behind it kind of
originated with Dr. James Lovelock and,

691
00:18:58,751 --> 00:18:59,584
and it's,

692
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,010
uh,

693
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,900
it's,

694
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,790
it's new and it's also very old.

695
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,330
You know,

696
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,510
I'm,

697
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,111
I'm also,

698
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,620
I've also studied native American
spirituality quite a bit.

699
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:07,920
And,

700
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,721
and it's,

701
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,440
it's exactly the same thing.

702
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,730
Yeah.

703
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,091
Well,

704
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:16,710
it seems to me that we have a pretty
limited idea of what life is or what's

705
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,401
conscious.

706
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:17,730
You know,

707
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,250
we feel like if it can't
react and communicate with us,

708
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,240
it can't be conscious.

709
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,931
But there's,

710
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:22,251
you know,

711
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:22,351
a,

712
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,080
apparently there's been some studies
that show that it's very possible that

713
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,890
plant's recognize people when they're in
the room and they feel energy and they

714
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,460
can actually react to someone
doing something to them.

715
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,030
You know,

716
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,300
they might have some sort of
consciousness that we can't understand.

717
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,520
We just only assume that consciousness,

718
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,480
human consciousness,

719
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,460
there might be rock consciousness.

720
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:41,671
I mean,

721
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,170
everything might have a consciousness.

722
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:45,570
It might just be enabled
to express itself.

723
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,180
And the idea of this has a giant
super organism is so fascinating.

724
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,860
Oh yeah.

725
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,990
It's so amazing because
we know that everything,

726
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,000
nothing exists on its own.

727
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,601
I mean,

728
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:59,220
every single body is a mixture of
all sorts of different bacteria,

729
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,840
microbiotic particles and all sorts of
different things that are constantly

730
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:04,471
helping you.

731
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,340
Or macrobiotic,

732
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,820
you know,

733
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,480
like when you eat,

734
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,350
you're eating yogurt,

735
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:07,501
you know,

736
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,670
you're taking in troops.

737
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,181
You know,

738
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,420
when you taking the Acidophilus,

739
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,600
you're bringing in healthy animals,

740
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,220
living organisms.

741
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:14,520
I mean,

742
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,520
it's so fascinating that we absolutely
need that in order to stay healthy and be

743
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,514
alive.

744
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,400
One of the things I just did
[inaudible] was a very cool,

745
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,750
I live in the West Sonoma County,

746
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,683
uh,

747
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,670
and I,

748
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,110
there's a spa and I had,

749
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,440
I had done it like three months
without a day off for collapsed.

750
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:31,621
That,

751
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:31,950
that's,

752
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,783
that's my,

753
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,301
my,

754
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:33,450
uh,

755
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,580
company and doing the radio show.

756
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,570
And so I treated myself and they have a
spa where you go and you actually take a

757
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:44,571
bath in a hot living compost pile
and it's specially bred complex,

758
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:46,530
but the,

759
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,420
everything is alive and
it's warm and you become,

760
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,350
and it just,

761
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:50,710
it just,

762
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,590
it sucks stuff out of you
that's just really cool.

763
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,310
Wow.

764
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,790
Yeah.

765
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,623
Wow.

766
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,763
That's freaky.

767
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:57,941
Yeah.

768
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,990
They said it's so weird though.

769
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,310
What a,

770
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,570
a s a different,

771
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,260
you know,

772
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,130
we're like a soup,

773
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,761
you know,

774
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,970
we're not just one ingredient and it's
really fascinating and the think of the

775
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,450
earth as being that just the
expressing itself in a larger way.

776
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,740
There's a great movie that just came
out this year called Anima Mundi,

777
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:14,981
m,

778
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,950
U N D I a out of Australia
and it's got big names.

779
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,480
I've got Noam Chomsky in it.

780
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,010
It's got a whole bunch and
it's all about [inaudible].

781
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,970
And there was some tremendous,

782
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,930
uh,

783
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,300
tremendous awakening things in
the [inaudible] you just look at.

784
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,200
And the science is really
good to support that to see.

785
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:36,010
I think the big problem is now is if,

786
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,080
let's say you and I are
Martians or from another planet,

787
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,990
we just came down here to check out
what's happened and what these creatures

788
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:41,351
down here,

789
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,040
right?

790
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,970
And the first thing that like,

791
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,510
well,

792
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,141
they're insane.

793
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,190
They're destroying the place.

794
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,700
Right?

795
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,320
You know,

796
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,590
and,

797
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,130
and that's all we have to live on.

798
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,720
So what are they doing?

799
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,740
They're shifting where the,

800
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,740
and I really think that
that originates with,

801
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,590
uh,

802
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:54,910
uh,

803
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,780
genesis one.

804
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,201
I mean,

805
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:56,421
I'm,

806
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:57,490
I'm at war with God,

807
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,770
or at least the religion
to the god of old,

808
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:01,270
the guys that brought us to this point.

809
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:01,930
And,

810
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,250
and,

811
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,830
and I'm at war with the God that
gave Man Dominion over the planet.

812
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,143
Bullshit.

813
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,710
That's why we're destroying it.

814
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,210
We'd been separated from it.

815
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,110
We were taught that we,

816
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:11,220
and,

817
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,850
and I don't believe that that's true.

818
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,690
And I believe that if there's any one
lie that's enabled all this corruption,

819
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,390
uh,

820
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,600
a lot of it to be hidden
under the guise of religion.

821
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,351
Uh,

822
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:20,800
that's,

823
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,633
that's the big one.

824
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,980
So you think then if you can get enough
people to recognize this earth as a

825
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:27,880
living thing,

826
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,990
we could change the way people
behave and change the practices.

827
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:32,380
So it doesn't seem to be,

828
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,000
it doesn't seem to have been that long
ago people didn't destroy the earth at

829
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:37,740
all.

830
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,350
But you know,

831
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,790
just a few hundred years ago,

832
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,020
the oceans were clean,

833
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:41,440
right?

834
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,681
I mean,

835
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,041
how many,

836
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,140
how many hundreds of
years ago was there were,

837
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,820
was there no pollution?

838
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,921
No.

839
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:51,550
You would have to go back probably to
the 12 hundreds earth know that there was

840
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:51,760
a,

841
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,210
there was part of it in,

842
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:53,741
in Rome.

843
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:54,470
Yeah.

844
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,940
Uh,

845
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,450
poop.

846
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,670
But let's go back 40,000 years ago.

847
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,050
Okay.

848
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,883
Okay.

849
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,140
And then are our ancestors who
were going og or whoever the F,

850
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,920
you know,

851
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,490
um,

852
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,440
well first they were
living their religion.

853
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:05,951
24,

854
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:06,271
seven.

855
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,200
There was not a textbook.

856
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,231
So you didn't,

857
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,430
nobody persuaded them,

858
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,061
converted them.

859
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,400
That's just the way they live.

860
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:13,480
The earth was the Bible.

861
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,740
Wow.

862
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,520
Okay.

863
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,590
Some things are sacred and you know,

864
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,270
there are things that you don't do,

865
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,070
like stick your finger
into a light socket.

866
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,520
Thou shalt not because you know,

867
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,770
it hurts or you die.

868
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,360
And there were rules in nature.

869
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,010
Thou shalt not stay out in the cold and
over x number of hours or after this was

870
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,950
that that was the religion
because it was a direct feedback.

871
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,551
Well,

872
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:37,300
I've always felt the native American
ideal of using every single bit of the

873
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,450
animal that you kill in,

874
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:38,771
in,

875
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:39,920
in honor of the animal.

876
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,520
That there's something
very important about that.

877
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,121
I went to,

878
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:43,450
uh,

879
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,140
it's fair,

880
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,560
uh,

881
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,190
Tom Brown of Tom Brown tracker schools,

882
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,650
a friend of mine and I
went to his Drucker school,

883
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,560
maximize sister and I went to
his tracker school in February.

884
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,423
And that's,

885
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,690
that's what they teach too,

886
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,640
you know,

887
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:54,890
but,

888
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,341
but anyway,

889
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,740
so our ancestors 40,000
years ago running around,

890
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,310
right,

891
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,380
they didn't all of a sudden
stop one day and going,

892
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:04,550
why am I having this wilderness
experience that was all north.

893
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,700
That was so what,

894
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:10,460
what Mankiw's task is now with the
collapse of human industrial civilization,

895
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,180
which is here,

896
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,190
which cannot be stopped,

897
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,640
um,

898
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,050
is not so much to learn,

899
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:19,640
but to remember stuff that
we've known inside of us.

900
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,780
Um,

901
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,500
forever and you've got to clear
a lot of garbage out of the way,

902
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,580
you know,

903
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,300
to get there.

904
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,720
And,

905
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,553
uh,

906
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,230
I'm pretty optimistic about what I see.

907
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:30,480
I mean,

908
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,750
I,

909
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,380
I started collapsing that
my company collapse net.com.

910
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:34,214
There's the plug.

911
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,430
Um,

912
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,450
and we're in 68 countries.

913
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:39,130
We're getting 40,000 visitors a day.

914
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,580
You're optimistic and won't way like the
collapse is going to be a good thing.

915
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:42,821
I know,

916
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:43,251
I'm seeing,

917
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:43,370
yeah,

918
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,300
people awakening.

919
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,490
I am seeing people,

920
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:46,880
uh,

921
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,151
the,

922
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:47,630
you know,

923
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,100
as I said in the movie collapsed.

924
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
Mankind's choice now is evolve or perish,

925
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,670
grow the fuck up or die because the
laws of nature cannot be overturned.

926
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,900
And that's the fundamental thing that's
wrong with this infinite growth paradigm

927
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,734
that we live in.

928
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,790
Okay,

929
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,140
we'll do that separate.

930
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,090
So,

931
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,923
um,

932
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,650
where was I?

933
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,120
All of that done all that done and that
world we live in is dying and there's a

934
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,500
new consciousness emerging.

935
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:16,190
Now,

936
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,330
my friend Colin Campbell,

937
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,140
who was one of the,

938
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,973
uh,

939
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,820
he's the Godfather,

940
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,800
that people well movement said that,

941
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:21,921
uh,

942
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:22,401
the species,

943
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,380
homo sapiens might not become extinct,

944
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,960
but the subspecies of petroleum man,

945
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,010
most certainly will.

946
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,060
Wow.

947
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,540
Okay.

948
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,410
So there's posts,

949
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:30,921
petroleum,

950
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,340
human,

951
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,930
and there's a new consciousness
emerging and there are,

952
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,120
there are tens of millions
of us around the world and,

953
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,840
and,

954
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,930
and truly I think there may be hundreds
of millions or a billion or more of us

955
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:42,441
around the world.

956
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,330
We just haven't been allowed
to see each other yet.

957
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,840
There's something with that matrix that
keeps you from seeing all the other

958
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:48,674
people who feel,

959
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,240
that's why with you and Ron Paul on a,

960
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,730
on Leno,

961
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,620
when the audience started cheering,

962
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,450
it was like that was a,

963
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,260
that was a bitch slap bucket of cold
water to the face of Barack Obama and

964
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,310
everybody in Washington,

965
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,780
you know,

966
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,740
who thought they could actually
get away with this stuff again,

967
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,421
you think Obama,

968
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:08,450
do you think Obama knew what was gonna
happen before he got into office?

969
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,313
Cause he seems,

970
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,270
it seems to me,

971
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,890
me seems so ineffective.

972
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,790
It's almost like he had an
idea of what it would be like.

973
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,930
And then when he got in,

974
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:20,000
there is just nothing like that.

975
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,250
Barack Obama's extremely effective.

976
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,830
He's extremely effective
for his client base,

977
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:29,831
which is the banks that
is a banking president and
there's no difference between

978
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,880
Democrat and Republican.

979
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,210
He,

980
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,580
Barack Obama had no intent,

981
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,370
you know,

982
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,610
he seemed like one of us when
he was running for president,

983
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:38,930
he seemed like one of us,

984
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,210
it seemed like he was going to,

985
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,490
you're not with microphones on elbow.

986
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,980
It's probably cause

987
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
he was,

988
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,390
you know,

989
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,590
he probably started off,

990
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,350
thank you.

991
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,270
I wanted to know.

992
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,130
I always wanted to know.

993
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,420
I mean,

994
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,730
it wouldn't have been Nama.

995
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,520
He wouldn't have ever gotten close to,

996
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,440
to the nomination unless his
loyalty had been secured.

997
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,970
Oh Wow.

998
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,710
It's so crabbing at that's real.

999
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,553
Yeah.

1000
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,320
It's such a fucking Rina.

1001
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,521
Yeah.

1002
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,320
If it really is that rigged,

1003
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:04,561
I mean,

1004
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:04,890
it,

1005
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,131
it's,

1006
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:06,750
it's almost preposterous.

1007
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,570
It's able to go on as long as it has.

1008
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,291
I was,

1009
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:10,920
uh,

1010
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,211
I've,

1011
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:11,760
I've had,

1012
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,593
I've done a lot of shit.

1013
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,620
I've been around a long time.

1014
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,380
I was the press spokesman for Ross Perot.

1015
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,130
Whoa.

1016
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,130
In Los Angeles County in 1992 at a time
when Ross Perot was ahead of both George

1017
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,071
Bush and Bill Clinton.

1018
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,740
Remember that?

1019
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,480
10 Poles.

1020
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,190
Okay.

1021
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,461
Hi,

1022
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,300
I'm Ross Perot shorts,

1023
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:27,710
floppy or texting with a big nose.

1024
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,910
Remember when he took out that and
he basically bought a half an hour of

1025
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:35,840
television in prime time and
explain what's wrong with,

1026
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:37,850
what was it with the tax structure.

1027
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:38,631
I forgot what it was,

1028
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:39,650
but it was just and,

1029
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:40,011
and,

1030
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:40,240
uh,

1031
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,290
the debt debt.

1032
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,050
And he explained it
all and spelled it out.

1033
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:46,670
And he's the only one that made any sense.

1034
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:47,751
I mean,

1035
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,040
he seemed like a crazy dude,

1036
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,540
but everybody wants to be president.

1037
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:50,980
It's crazy.

1038
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,221
Well,

1039
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:51,351
what,

1040
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:51,671
what,

1041
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:55,090
what I'm saying with that is I've been
around presidential politics a long time

1042
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,140
and I studied that a lot of ways.

1043
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,600
My rubicons in the
Harvard BizLibrary okay.

1044
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,043
So,

1045
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,271
yeah,

1046
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,104
it's that rate.

1047
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:02,950
Yeah,

1048
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,820
it is that Rick.

1049
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,073
It's terrifying.

1050
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,213
It's terrifying.

1051
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,170
This is the freest country the
world has ever known and it's,

1052
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,210
it's been fucking hoodwinked
by giant corporations.

1053
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,060
We have been,

1054
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,800
uh,

1055
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,633
uh,

1056
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,481
there was a guy,

1057
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:18,680
I had a source,

1058
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:22,340
somebody who was in a position to know
when William Casey had his first briefing

1059
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,700
as DCI director of central intelligence
under Ronald Reagan would have been in

1060
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:26,870
January of 81.

1061
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,430
Um,

1062
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,900
he said to those in the room,

1063
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:30,171
he said,

1064
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:33,800
we will know that we have been successful
when everything the American people

1065
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:35,630
believe is true is false.

1066
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,723
Wow.

1067
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,290
Holy Shit.

1068
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,153
Yeah.

1069
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,010
It's just amazing that
this has sort of been,

1070
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,580
uh,

1071
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,670
the way governments have done
things since the beginning.

1072
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,320
So like no one has ever like been
straight with the people and had it all,

1073
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:52,154
you know,

1074
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,131
even,

1075
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:53,681
and I mean it,

1076
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:57,700
has there ever been a culture ever that
has been like completely cool as far as

1077
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:01,390
the government goes and just
watched the movie last night,

1078
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:04,120
the cove and even in that movie
was a movie about dolphins.

1079
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:08,290
How much the Japanese government lied
to the people about mercury poisoning.

1080
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,651
Yeah.

1081
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:12,090
Well apparently that's what Shane Smith
from vice.com was telling us about the,

1082
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:12,480
the,

1083
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
the knelt down a much
more of a health issue.

1084
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,683
Then the,

1085
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,060
then the government is letting
on all of that stuff is cooked.

1086
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:20,894
But

1087
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,090
the reason why,

1088
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,050
let's,

1089
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,200
uh,

1090
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,060
let's take a quote quote
from a Myer Rothchild.

1091
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,760
I,

1092
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,020
it was my senior Rothchild,

1093
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,240
the guy who was a of the London house.

1094
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,151
Oh.

1095
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:33,500
He said,

1096
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,010
ah,

1097
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,410
give me control of a nation's currency.

1098
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:39,710
It's money and I care
not who passes its laws,

1099
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,491
who governs it.

1100
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:41,324
It's

1101
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,030
the infinite growth.

1102
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,060
And look at what we're seeing around
us with the economic collapse,

1103
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:48,490
the endless fucking corruption.

1104
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,320
No,

1105
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,520
it killed me when all was going down,

1106
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:55,280
when the bailouts were happening and
Obama actually had the nerve to say that

1107
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:57,640
there was going to limit the bonuses,

1108
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:00,100
that these guys got to
half a million dollars.

1109
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,480
You like w as if someone actually talked
him into thinking that that made any

1110
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:09,360
sense to regular people.

1111
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,100
The regular people going to go set up.

1112
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,551
Yeah.

1113
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:11,851
You know,

1114
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,290
he had to get his half a mill.

1115
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,153
He had to get,

1116
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,740
the bank is falling apart.

1117
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,910
People are bailing out the bank with
their tax dollars and then somehow or

1118
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:21,151
another,

1119
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:24,930
it's rig in the way that
the CEOs get bonuses.

1120
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:25,201
What,

1121
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:25,350
what?

1122
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,890
How could that,

1123
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,221
what did,

1124
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:29,910
what does that bonus based on those
who win in a rigged game get stupid?

1125
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,990
Barack Obama thinks people believe
that he actually killed Osama bin.

1126
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:34,824
Fucking Loddon.

1127
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,420
Nobody believes it.

1128
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,440
I don't believe it.

1129
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,160
No,

1130
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm not convinced.

1131
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:39,480
There's too,

1132
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,880
I've talked to too many military
people that don't believe it.

1133
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,230
I've talked to people that,

1134
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:43,470
you know,

1135
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,450
probably shouldn't be talking
about it and they're like,

1136
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,670
this is fucking horseshit.

1137
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,440
We know that that guy has
been dead for years now.

1138
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,381
This will please.

1139
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:49,591
Yeah,

1140
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,424
it was fire up.

1141
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,360
You can take a shit on the floor if you
want your Michael Ruber do whatever you

1142
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:56,730
gotta do buddy want you to be comfortable?

1143
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,170
Well,

1144
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,860
I'm pretty impressed that
he's smoking because,

1145
00:30:58,861 --> 00:30:59,730
and then maybe collapse.

1146
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:02,510
He smoked probably like a
carton in the first 10 minutes.

1147
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,040
No,

1148
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,770
that's Chris Smith.

1149
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:07,650
The director loved that film noire
effect and I can do the sexy thing,

1150
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:08,970
but the cigarette obviously,

1151
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:09,960
you know what I'm saying?

1152
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,800
It gets more doom and gloom.

1153
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,270
If you got it work at,

1154
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,780
you know,

1155
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,351
well you know,

1156
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,410
if the end world's coming,

1157
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:16,510
why not get cancer too?

1158
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,150
And you go American spirits,

1159
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:20,080
is that actually healthier,

1160
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,460
much healthier.

1161
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,870
There's no additives to that at all.

1162
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,870
For folks who don't know
enjoy your cigarettes,

1163
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,460
there's 599 different fucking things
that are added to cigarettes at our

1164
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,020
government said we're cool with that.

1165
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,591
Oh yeah,

1166
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,460
you want to have more?

1167
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,120
We'll see.

1168
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,920
Well we have cigarettes and cigarettes
are pretty addictive but you know we came

1169
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:41,050
out with some way to really fuck with
your neurotransmitters and make it like

1170
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:45,310
super addictive and said okay we just
throw that in there from the gulf is safe

1171
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:46,040
to eat too.

1172
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,873
Let me,

1173
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,290
yeah,

1174
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,630
I saw commercials like the
Gulf's coming back and they're,

1175
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,150
they're serving shrimp and I'm
looking at them like they're bombs.

1176
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,160
Those sliding a shrimp bomb your way.

1177
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:54,710
Like what is,

1178
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,650
what the fuck is that man?

1179
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,940
I hope it's okay.

1180
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:58,890
But Jesus Christ,

1181
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,820
how did they fix that all wheel problem?

1182
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,860
Cause I heard they didn't,

1183
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,310
I heard there's a new slick,

1184
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,320
I heard that people
have seen other slicks,

1185
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:05,891
you know,

1186
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:06,221
did they,

1187
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,840
I don't think it's completely capped off,

1188
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,061
right.

1189
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:08,440
Yeah,

1190
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,531
no,

1191
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:08,771
no.

1192
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:08,980
My,

1193
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,291
my,

1194
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:09,390
uh,

1195
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,031
I had a good friend,

1196
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,470
Matthew seven scary,

1197
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,030
a colleague who was a,

1198
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,451
had been,

1199
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,910
he had been the world's largest energy
investment banker and he was a colleague

1200
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,920
of mine in the peak oil
movement for many years.

1201
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:18,754
He died,

1202
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,223
I think,

1203
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,820
I won't say that yet,

1204
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,683
but he,

1205
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,760
he died under mysterious
circumstances to me.

1206
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,600
Uh,

1207
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,040
but he knew all about the golf and,

1208
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,640
and it was a total blowout.

1209
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,290
Know the seabed is destroyed.

1210
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,550
He was telling the truth there.

1211
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,690
There's the shaft from deep
water rise and it went down.

1212
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:37,030
And,

1213
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,200
and what's happened is,

1214
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:38,411
is it,

1215
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:40,490
the whole bed is now fractured

1216
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,140
all around it and it's,

1217
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,360
the oil is seeping up and there's no way,

1218
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
there's no way to control it.

1219
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,820
Oh my God.

1220
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,790
So terrifying.

1221
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,031
You know,

1222
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:53,600
I was in New Orleans for the
first time recently and I really,

1223
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,740
really enjoyed it.

1224
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,030
Like what an unusual,

1225
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:56,421
shitty,

1226
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,550
what an amazing city really is.

1227
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:02,930
One of the last few places
that has its own true identity.

1228
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,681
You know,

1229
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,680
when we're hanging around,

1230
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,740
it was like what a great place it is.

1231
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,050
And that's where I saw CIA
bringing drugs into the country.

1232
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,300
That's,

1233
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,900
that's why I where I became
an eyeball wit to it.

1234
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,883
Jesus,

1235
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,970
you northern.

1236
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,750
Yeah,

1237
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,020
New Orleans got some Mojo in
New Orleans and fun place,

1238
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:18,854
man.

1239
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,060
That's a fun place.

1240
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:21,530
It's almost like it's another country.

1241
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,480
Like you should have to have
a passport to get there.

1242
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:23,901
It's like you're,

1243
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,040
you're going to another country.

1244
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,450
It's very strange or affected those
poor people get hit by that man,

1245
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:29,870
you know,

1246
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,890
after Katrina,

1247
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,650
then they get hit by that and then,

1248
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,440
you know,

1249
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,820
wha how is the ocean now?

1250
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,990
I mean so much ocean.

1251
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,240
How long does it take
the sea bed is the issue,

1252
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:38,421
right?

1253
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,254
Is that what it is?

1254
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,610
It'll destroy the food
chain because you're,

1255
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,090
you know,

1256
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,720
as if they had just stopped
what would got into the ocean,

1257
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,220
the ocean would probably absorb it all.

1258
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,360
Cause it's so enormous.

1259
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,310
Well of course they were
lying about the quantity.

1260
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:49,550
So,

1261
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:49,911
I mean,

1262
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:50,744
you know,

1263
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,570
I had known it was over a hundred
thousand barrels a day early on and,

1264
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,463
uh,

1265
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,761
oh,

1266
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:56,121
it was,

1267
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:57,260
it was much higher than that one,

1268
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,830
but a couple of points and
that's never been really fixed.

1269
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,980
That's the problem with this
whole paradigm at that Fukushima.

1270
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,731
Okay.

1271
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,860
Japan is mortally wounded with radiation,

1272
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,130
uh,

1273
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,020
collapsed that my side,

1274
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,410
we have been documenting,

1275
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,071
you know,

1276
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:11,570
tens,

1277
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,021
hundreds of thousands of times,

1278
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:15,080
greater levels of radiation
released over broader distances.

1279
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,040
Cesium,

1280
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,550
uh,

1281
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,180
there's been a spike in mortality
in the U S as a result of Fukushima,

1282
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,420
the 35% spike in a neonatal mortality,

1283
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,240
uh,

1284
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,420
right after Fukushima in Japan here,

1285
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,830
Pacific northwest,

1286
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,880
San Francisco,

1287
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,714
north.

1288
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,733
Um,

1289
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,320
and,

1290
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,661
and,

1291
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:34,941
and,

1292
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:39,200
and Japan is mortally wounded
with radiation and the
global food supply is now

1293
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,090
contaminated as a result of the cesium,

1294
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,080
uh,

1295
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,250
the plutonium and,

1296
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,390
uh,

1297
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:43,820
you know,

1298
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,350
baby food was just found detected
the other day with a radiation.

1299
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,910
Yeah.

1300
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,310
Really in Japan or in America?

1301
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:49,761
Japan.

1302
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:52,040
But that could have been
easily sent to America.

1303
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,150
Do we buy their baby food?

1304
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,043
I hope not.

1305
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,083
Wow.

1306
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,720
So how many fix that is it?

1307
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,270
Is it possible to fix that area?

1308
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:00,051
That area is fucked,

1309
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,860
right?

1310
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,470
Um,

1311
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,580
it's going to go through the ground
for the next 30 or 40,000 years.

1312
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,360
That's the half life of cesium.

1313
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,410
So it's okay.

1314
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,160
So yeah,

1315
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,311
no,

1316
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:10,551
that's,

1317
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,960
it's permanently um,

1318
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,890
unusable.

1319
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,320
Uh,

1320
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,680
and,

1321
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,560
and what they're finding is that the
birds have a heavy Eaton radioactive seeds

1322
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:22,220
and they're shitting out radioactive
poop all over New Zealand now.

1323
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,090
Oh my God.

1324
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,900
And so that's a mortal
wound to the global economy.

1325
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,140
That's what we do at collapse collapse,

1326
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,370
that I bring all this stuff all together
so we can get a real picture of how bad

1327
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,210
things really are.

1328
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:38,640
So is it safe to say the collapse
that is the last place you should go?

1329
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,740
If you thinking about getting some sleep,

1330
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,010
it's like 11 o'clock at night.

1331
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:43,220
You're like,

1332
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,410
man,

1333
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,050
gets her shit.

1334
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,680
I check online to see what's going on.

1335
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,880
Let me head over to collapse.

1336
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,380
Now you find yourself sweating and
making coffee at 5:00 AM if you go to his

1337
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,100
website,

1338
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,360
you immediately see this poor,

1339
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,194
sad guy,

1340
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,530
some dubious at the stock market,

1341
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,050
watching his house explore what we become.

1342
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,410
God's Melton is like,

1343
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,560
we're with a place where occupy around
the world goes to find out what the

1344
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:08,394
fuck's going on.

1345
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,510
We're clearing house.

1346
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,800
What really trustworthy,

1347
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,000
useful information.

1348
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:12,211
Right?

1349
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,090
Right now I'm really tight with
the occupy folks and you know,

1350
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:15,271
I'm,

1351
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,051
I'm an occupier,

1352
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:16,950
wasn't Santa Rosa,

1353
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,251
you know,

1354
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,084
and,

1355
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,950
and uh,

1356
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,780
and deeply is that the next civilization?

1357
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,123
Cause you know,

1358
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,050
this is one of the things
that I'm hearing from people,

1359
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:28,650
but lately the occupy folks
is not just the standard.

1360
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,071
You know,

1361
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,910
we want these motherfuckers out there.

1362
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:33,330
They're saying we can
all live together here.

1363
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,160
We could grow our own shit.

1364
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:35,491
We could,

1365
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:35,761
you know,

1366
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,930
we could form a community.

1367
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,160
Just take this somewhere else.

1368
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,550
That's what I keep hearing now
that you never used to hear before.

1369
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,540
It's like everybody wants to
open up their own Waco comp out.

1370
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,010
Everybody's ready to do it on their own.

1371
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,251
Don't,

1372
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,440
I don't mean that in a bad none.

1373
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:49,101
I mean that get,

1374
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:49,531
you know what,

1375
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,370
Waco could have been,

1376
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,090
I don't know,

1377
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,960
how can you even say that?

1378
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:52,371
We'll wake up.

1379
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:52,771
Could have been,

1380
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:57,180
but the idea behind it to have
a community will not wake up.

1381
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,800
Why is it always go bad man?

1382
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:02,040
How come no cult leader could come along
and actually make a bad ass caught and

1383
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,000
everybody's cool with each other.

1384
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,900
You know,

1385
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,250
all those people at Waco murdered yes.

1386
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,020
Out of Delta.

1387
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,853
Yes.

1388
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,910
That was horrendous.

1389
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,241
You know,

1390
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:10,650
was it rules of engagement?

1391
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:11,461
Is that the documentary,

1392
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:12,090
the details,

1393
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,090
it shows you the fucking tanks with flame
throwers shooting into these people's

1394
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,820
houses.

1395
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,740
They crushed people inside their houses,

1396
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:20,880
ran over and with tanks.

1397
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:21,930
Look that place on fire.

1398
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,390
That's a fact.

1399
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:25,740
I mean is you can't avoid that.

1400
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:29,280
We've been watching all of these crimes
taking place right in front of us,

1401
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,481
all our lives.

1402
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,314
Man.

1403
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,010
I mean,

1404
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:37,010
2000 election was stolen right in front
of our eyes and we didn't do anything.

1405
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,131
And that's,

1406
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:38,520
you know,

1407
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,150
that's,

1408
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,840
that's been,

1409
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,010
uh,

1410
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,520
you know,

1411
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,160
uh,

1412
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,280
I carry a lot of rage over the 35
years I've been doing this too.

1413
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,250
But one of my biggest anger is if,

1414
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,800
if you don't only listen to him,

1415
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,470
to me 30 years ago,

1416
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,423
this might not happen.

1417
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,260
If you'd listened to Iran Contra people,

1418
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:53,280
if you'd listen to,

1419
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,150
uh,

1420
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,511
you know,

1421
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:55,830
all of the protest movements,

1422
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,080
it nine 11,

1423
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,830
if you'll listen to two,

1424
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,690
2003 invasion of nobody,

1425
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,780
there's this country never mustered the
will to call the crimes out when they

1426
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:10,980
saw him cause they were
there for everybody to see.

1427
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,180
And now we're all kind of go,

1428
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:13,770
oh well yeah of course of that happened.

1429
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:17,550
And of course that happened and it's
amazing how this is all predicted by the

1430
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,570
founding fathers.

1431
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,931
You know,

1432
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:19,201
they,

1433
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,900
they knew that everything was going to
get slippery and things is going to get

1434
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:22,260
weird.

1435
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,730
The fact that Benjamin Franklin Franklin
was the one who said he who chooses

1436
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:29,190
security over liberty deserves neither.

1437
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,553
They,

1438
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,760
they did understand.

1439
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,440
It's amazing that they figured it out.

1440
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,150
But then if you go back,

1441
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:37,601
especially,

1442
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:37,711
you know,

1443
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:40,030
I'm a big fan of Tom Jefferson who said,

1444
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:40,780
you need a revolution.

1445
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,613
Every generation,

1446
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,020
you're damn right you
to share everything up.

1447
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,710
Start over again and you know,

1448
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,890
can we just Rodney king
this motherfucker is,

1449
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,150
can we just all get along?

1450
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,270
Why can't we all just
get along and how good.

1451
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,690
How about these concert running the world?

1452
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:55,400
Just get their shit together
without us having to know what,

1453
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,440
you don't rise up,

1454
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,400
can't you guys evolve?

1455
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,360
They're going to have to die off.

1456
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:58,540
Right?

1457
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,890
The older ones are going
to have to die off.

1458
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,360
They're just way too set in their ways.

1459
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,200
The people that were willing to call
Waco and actually have that happen,

1460
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,320
they didn't understand the impact of the
media because it hadn't really become

1461
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:08,950
apparent yet.

1462
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,400
No,

1463
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,001
they didn't know.

1464
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,340
They thought they were going to get
away with business as usual because they

1465
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,030
come from a long career of doing that
and that's just how to get shit done.

1466
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,850
They didn't think that there was going
to be a video camera that was going to

1467
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:21,280
take film footage of it and
making it into a documentary,

1468
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,880
explain everything and show it in slow
motion in great detail is that it never

1469
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:25,714
been done before,

1470
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,960
but it's done and you want to see it once.

1471
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:29,320
You know.

1472
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,320
That's actually a good point for the way
media and all this gear has been useful

1473
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,030
in the occupy movement around the world.

1474
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:41,320
I mean the anonymous is out
there kicking ass right now,

1475
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:41,681
you know,

1476
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:42,850
and uh,

1477
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,290
and and so this,

1478
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,920
this is kind of a dimension
which I think is fucking movie.

1479
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,331
It was,

1480
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,000
I was,

1481
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,370
oh yes,

1482
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,961
it's a movie.

1483
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,940
I mean this is a great
action film right now.

1484
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,280
So a lot of crazy shit going down.

1485
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:54,431
I mean,

1486
00:39:54,431 --> 00:39:55,570
this is v for Vendetta

1487
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,440
on the World News Desk.

1488
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:57,630
I,

1489
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,820
I analyze like 200 stories a day.

1490
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,620
150 stories a day.

1491
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,850
And we s that that's how we bring
you the news from all over the world.

1492
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:06,631
He's really good stories.

1493
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:07,440
But you know,

1494
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm,

1495
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,480
I'm watching some of the shit happening.

1496
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,730
I'm going pass the fucking popcorn.

1497
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,860
I mean it's right.

1498
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,380
It's like I can't believe some of
the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.

1499
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,680
Where's it all going to end?

1500
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,101
Does it,

1501
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:19,490
is it,

1502
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,900
is there a real abi,

1503
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,420
you've been really good at
predicting a lot of shit,

1504
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:23,721
man.

1505
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,081
You,

1506
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:29,081
you predicted like pretty much every
single big economic event that's happened.

1507
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:29,750
You,

1508
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,600
you were on that before you
were right with Peter Schiff.

1509
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,741
You were on that,

1510
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,110
you were predicting that stuff
like way back in the day.

1511
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,630
What do you see now when
you looking at it now,

1512
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:38,901
what do you,

1513
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:39,830
where do you see it end?

1514
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,510
What's your prediction for how it ends?

1515
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:41,931
Okay.

1516
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:46,370
We're are rather comes to a
balance again where we are,

1517
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:46,561
right,

1518
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:46,610
right

1519
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,270
now,

1520
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,550
where we are right now is like,

1521
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,330
um,

1522
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,870
the mega and to climax
at the end of act two.

1523
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,883
Okay.

1524
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,203
Um,

1525
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,313
uh,

1526
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,600
the global economy is imploding right now.

1527
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:00,740
Europe is dead,

1528
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,600
and there's 1.4 Quillian quadrillion
dollars in derivatives out there that are

1529
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,970
imploding because money,

1530
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:08,390
like I said,

1531
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,380
like I said in the movie,

1532
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,970
that's exactly what I,

1533
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,470
that's exactly the point I was on it.

1534
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:12,680
This,

1535
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:12,981
Whoa,

1536
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:13,814
this is spooky.

1537
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,870
Anyway,

1538
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,703
money,

1539
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,371
you can't,

1540
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,270
it has no power.

1541
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,020
Money only has power because
of energy and resources.

1542
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,393
Okay?

1543
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,320
And you can print an
infinite amount of money,

1544
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:28,250
but we live on a finite planet and we're
running out of all the stuff that makes

1545
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:28,671
that money,

1546
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:29,481
have any power.

1547
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,250
The money itself has no power.

1548
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,210
And that's the adjustment that's,

1549
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,620
that's civilization is collapsing.

1550
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,830
There are 6 billion
people living here now,

1551
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,780
only because of cheap energy.

1552
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,810
And our population has gone straight
like that since the discovery of oil.

1553
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,180
And it always goes like
that and then crashes.

1554
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,900
And that's,

1555
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,490
we're on the cusp of the crash right now.

1556
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,151
You see,

1557
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,110
you think we're at a cost of,

1558
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:54,620
not of,

1559
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,320
not just of a economical labs,

1560
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:59,810
but a biological disaster thing.

1561
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,190
Um,

1562
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,581
what does,

1563
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:01,940
I mean,

1564
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,620
how are you going to get
rid of that many people?

1565
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,460
Well,

1566
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,090
uh,

1567
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,923
wow.

1568
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,053
Uh,

1569
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,430
Gee,

1570
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,110
you can let,

1571
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,230
let all the radiation,

1572
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,220
how to Focus Shima.

1573
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,080
You can let all the oil out of the,

1574
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,920
the Gulf or you can let a
billions of tons of methane.

1575
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,570
There's now being released from the,

1576
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,380
uh,

1577
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,970
Tundra and Arctic Siberia.

1578
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:20,901
Uh,

1579
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,410
it's a catastrophic event for,

1580
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,650
uh,

1581
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:22,870
uh,

1582
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,210
uh,

1583
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,290
to a tipping point.

1584
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,210
We've destroyed the environment as well.

1585
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,830
That's going to kill a lot of people,

1586
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:31,490
but there are 10 calories of hydrocarbon
energy and every calorie of food

1587
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,260
consumed in the industrialized world,

1588
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,670
the energy's going away.

1589
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,451
And,

1590
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,290
and the,

1591
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,470
the top soil used to grow
food on is nothing but dust.

1592
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,310
It's a sponge on,

1593
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:43,280
on which they pour chemicals
made from oil and natural gas.

1594
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,650
So People gonna Starve to death.

1595
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,660
Holy Shit.

1596
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,530
So it should have never got
this crazy in the first place.

1597
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,090
We got way ahead of ourselves.

1598
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,280
Technology got far enough ahead that we
could support gigantic groups of people

1599
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:00,590
and we sorta like bought a car on credit.

1600
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,390
I'm going to mess with your mind.

1601
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,110
Please do.

1602
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,740
I want to stand by the
people that do this.

1603
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:09,980
The people that run the infinite
growth monetary paradigm system,

1604
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,610
which to identify now I would say would
be the owners of the Federal Reserve,

1605
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,280
the Bank of international
settlements in the city of London.

1606
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,210
Let's start there.

1607
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,920
Uh,

1608
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,860
they've known that this outcome was
coming for a long time and are there at

1609
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,240
their engineering and they
are making money from this.

1610
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,960
Now the sick bastards are
deliberately letting things crash.

1611
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:35,180
So they've engineered it,

1612
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,620
they're profiting from it.

1613
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,210
And then when it crashes,

1614
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,680
what happens then if,

1615
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:39,951
if,

1616
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,420
I mean do,

1617
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:40,850
does,

1618
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,020
does it crash to a point where money is
useless and we start all over again or

1619
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:49,130
it crashes to the point where we have
a thermal nuclear war that we're on the

1620
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:52,850
cusp of right now over an invasion
of Iran for bullshit reasons.

1621
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,010
A regime change in Syria,

1622
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:56,330
which will bring in,

1623
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,510
uh,

1624
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,260
China immediately on a rand side
and a thermo nuclear conflict.

1625
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:01,730
We could blow ourselves to smithereens.

1626
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:02,750
And why are we doing that?

1627
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:04,430
Why are we even thinking about doing that?

1628
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,313
Um,

1629
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,870
the parable of the
Scorpion and the turtle.

1630
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,310
Okay.

1631
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:09,760
Oh,

1632
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,240
Jesus ain't that one.

1633
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,610
I use it all the time.

1634
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:13,941
Oh,

1635
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:14,774
you're not?

1636
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,470
Okay.

1637
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:15,980
Okay.

1638
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,820
There's scorpions.

1639
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,630
They cannot,

1640
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,950
that's all they know how to do,

1641
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,200
make money on the way up,

1642
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,430
make money on the way down.

1643
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:25,880
And this is pure evil because they
know what the outcome of this is.

1644
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:29,390
They know that the outcome of their
actions would be either through climate

1645
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,590
change to kill all life on this planet,

1646
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,040
which is

1647
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,580
well underway.

1648
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,450
We're having a massive,

1649
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:33,750
uh,

1650
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,890
mass extinctions now,

1651
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,090
uh,

1652
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,950
run it economically into the ground,

1653
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:38,784
polluted,

1654
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,510
uh,

1655
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,850
blow everything up
there doing all of that.

1656
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,683
Yeah.

1657
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,810
And for those who weren't aware of the
parable of the Scorpion and the toads,

1658
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,350
the Scorpion asked the toad to
give them right across the water.

1659
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,700
And the toad says,

1660
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:54,391
I can't do that.

1661
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,410
You'll sting me and kill me.

1662
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:55,621
He goes,

1663
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,401
why would I do that?

1664
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:56,611
He goes,

1665
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,061
if I did that,

1666
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:57,930
we would both drown.

1667
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,011
So he goes,

1668
00:44:59,011 --> 00:44:59,780
okay.

1669
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,990
And he gives him a ride,

1670
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,310
and in the middle of the water,

1671
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,670
the Scorpion stings him
and he starts to die.

1672
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:06,070
And he says,

1673
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:06,903
what the fuck?

1674
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,040
And the Scorpion says,

1675
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:08,940
it's in my nature.

1676
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,893
I'm a Scorpion,

1677
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,260
doesn't Scorpion dying that awesome.

1678
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:13,630
Yes,

1679
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,300
yes,

1680
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:14,810
yes.

1681
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,250
And that's the point of this parable.

1682
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,040
You know,

1683
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,880
it's ridiculous,

1684
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,410
but it is what's going down,

1685
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:19,681
right?

1686
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:20,070
I mean,

1687
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,780
no one thinks that this can go on forever.

1688
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:23,900
Do they think that they
could just ride the,

1689
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,271
the,

1690
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:28,830
the asteroid before impact and die like
right before everything falls apart?

1691
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:33,130
They're like 80 90 they're really not
going to make it to 2020 or whenever it is

1692
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,960
there on that backs there.

1693
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,310
Well,

1694
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,070
it's supposed to be 2012
according to the Mayans,

1695
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,410
but they couldn't even predict
their own demise was silly boys,

1696
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,910
those silly people.

1697
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,750
There's a lot of properties that
are winding up coincidentally.

1698
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,290
And I,

1699
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:46,561
you know,

1700
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:48,930
I'm not saying I described
or that I'm a detective.

1701
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,261
Well,

1702
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:49,561
you know,

1703
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:52,650
I think it's really fascinating that
to think that there could have been

1704
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:54,960
alternate paths for intelligence.

1705
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,261
You know,

1706
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:55,471
the,

1707
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:55,681
the,

1708
00:45:55,681 --> 00:46:00,570
the path that Western civilization went
on with our interpretation of reality

1709
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:03,720
and our construction methods and
all the different things that,

1710
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,670
the way that we have expressed our tech,

1711
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,280
our intelligence that
it could very well be.

1712
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:12,180
And it's been proven to be in
Egypt and in the Mayans and the,

1713
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:12,661
there was a,

1714
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:16,650
there was an incredibly brilliant
society that operated very,

1715
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:21,180
very much different than ours and
amazing different way to think while one

1716
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:21,481
group,

1717
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:23,400
part of the world was
thinking about something else.

1718
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,020
They were studying constellations and
building these amazing stone structures

1719
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:29,260
that really are,

1720
00:46:29,261 --> 00:46:30,510
are mind boggling.

1721
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,370
And then when they find out that there's
thousands of them still undiscovered in

1722
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,110
Mexico and South America,

1723
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,240
that they're just the,

1724
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:38,410
the,

1725
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,910
the trees grew over them.

1726
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,730
But there was a,

1727
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,340
a great culture down
there and amazing culture,

1728
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:46,440
completely alien to what exists right now.

1729
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,710
And they operated on
different operating system.

1730
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:50,544
I mean,

1731
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,180
as you were saying that I was
having visions of first nations,

1732
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:54,810
uh,

1733
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:59,810
native Americans having really essentially
perfected their religion in that they

1734
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:01,430
lived in a,

1735
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,020
in a very balanced way
with their environment.

1736
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,183
And,

1737
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,350
but see that's a different
operating system.

1738
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,160
It's like a different
vibration inside completely.

1739
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,160
Um,

1740
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,993
it's,

1741
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,960
I don't know if you've ever done any
psychedelics or anything like that,

1742
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,290
but it's kind of what you're going
to like a DMT trip or something,

1743
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:18,560
right?

1744
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:18,780
You know,

1745
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,780
you see other dimensions and you become
so much more aware of other realities

1746
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:24,714
and other truths.

1747
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,750
And really what I think
what's happening now as,

1748
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:28,500
as the old,

1749
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,130
the infant paradigm is dying.

1750
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:31,300
It's obviously dying.

1751
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:31,721
I mean,

1752
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,680
anybody who can't see the collapse of
human industrial civilization now needs to

1753
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:36,630
be Darwinian late.

1754
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,720
Deselected I mean,

1755
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,100
so how do we get through this?

1756
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,860
Do we get through this without
a die off or it has to be,

1757
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:42,910
there has to be a die off.

1758
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,540
I think that the way we get through this,

1759
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,700
first of all is to realize
that there's no way,

1760
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,510
uh,

1761
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,991
in other words,

1762
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,220
for all 7 billion of us,

1763
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,310
um,

1764
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:52,910
uh,

1765
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,350
uh,

1766
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,960
so we've got to cut off the rest
of the world and build up a fence.

1767
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:56,794
No,

1768
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,640
not,

1769
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,310
not that either.

1770
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,640
What you have to do is form
your own communities of,

1771
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,110
of,

1772
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:01,480
of,

1773
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,861
of,

1774
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:03,880
of people who have the same consciousness.

1775
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,200
And you can do it in a big city.

1776
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,383
Um,

1777
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,020
where I live in western on the county,

1778
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,240
it's just rife with that
or were like one of the,

1779
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,770
one of the test beds for that.

1780
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,920
So there's a Lotta a lot of hippie pussy.

1781
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,060
Yeah,

1782
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,893
yeah,

1783
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:16,923
yeah.

1784
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,310
It's very important.

1785
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,980
If you're going to have
some sort of a cult,

1786
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,250
you got to have hot hippie pussy.

1787
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,090
Yeah.

1788
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:23,430
You know,

1789
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,420
if you're going to start your own
civilization out in the woods,

1790
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,051
can't do it.

1791
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:26,884
We just do

1792
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,780
that.

1793
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,740
Shit's going to get boring.

1794
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:30,380
And,

1795
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,400
and there really is a lot to be
said for being very in touch with,

1796
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:33,550
uh,

1797
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,850
with nature and the rhythms of the
planet because once you become aware of

1798
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,690
themselves,

1799
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,920
they're very essential and,

1800
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:39,910
and they're very,

1801
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:40,300
um,

1802
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,511
you know,

1803
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:44,260
once you really start to plug into and
connect with some of the life that goes

1804
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:44,560
on,

1805
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,960
but most people in the world
don't have any clue about that.

1806
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:47,140
Yeah.

1807
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,070
It would be nice if we could all like
break off into like minded groups of

1808
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:52,180
really nice people.

1809
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:55,900
She would guarantee that your community
would just be really fucking cool.

1810
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:56,510
You know,

1811
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,610
no ego issues.

1812
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,320
Everybody's had a few mushroom trips,

1813
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,310
you know,

1814
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,110
you know people like to do yoga.

1815
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,130
They don't fuck with you.

1816
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:04,870
They don't tell you that your music sucks.

1817
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,610
Right.

1818
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,930
[inaudible] it's so
difficult to get that though.

1819
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,970
We were so many human beings.

1820
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:10,450
Now,

1821
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,650
when you fly over cities,

1822
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:11,881
do you,

1823
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:16,420
do you ever look out in amazement at
what a crazy structure like Los Angeles

1824
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:16,691
really,

1825
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:17,270
truly is?

1826
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,810
You see the lights like when you
flew in here just flying at night?

1827
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,111
No,

1828
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:20,221
I,

1829
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:20,410
I,

1830
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:20,770
we,

1831
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,603
we drove.

1832
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,390
Okay.

1833
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,721
But,

1834
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:22,870
uh,

1835
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,090
I have flown into La.

1836
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:24,730
It's ridiculous.

1837
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,560
100 million times and
you're flying at night.

1838
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,120
Very rarely flying at night,

1839
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,830
but I did recently and flying in,

1840
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:30,371
you see it,

1841
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:31,030
you're like,

1842
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,190
how is this not science fiction?

1843
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,550
How has this not some crazy
blade runner fucking movie?

1844
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:37,720
Just the way it looks,

1845
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,170
you know,

1846
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,110
flying into this giant grid of
artificial light motherboard.

1847
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,203
It's amazing.

1848
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:43,481
Yeah,

1849
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:43,641
it's,

1850
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:44,110
it's uh,

1851
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:44,830
it's so,

1852
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:45,011
it's,

1853
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:45,760
so,

1854
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,440
it's such a thing that
we take for granted.

1855
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,520
You remember my friend Larry,

1856
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,080
Larry had this house in
the Hollywood hills and a,

1857
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,470
you would look out at night
and I never realized like,

1858
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,020
why is it what you want to live in the
Hollywood hills and fucking pollutions up

1859
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:56,291
there.

1860
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:57,124
It's Shitty.

1861
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:02,130
What fucking vision that view is the
view of the Los Angeles skyline at night.

1862
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,970
Like it doesn't look good that day and
the day just looking down at like gray

1863
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:08,260
shit pollution.

1864
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,470
But at nighttime you're seeing
this crazy electronic tron grid.

1865
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:13,930
Yes.

1866
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,420
You know,

1867
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,910
I mean it's really amazing.

1868
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,121
It's,

1869
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:16,720
we don't,

1870
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,150
we don't see it because we're
down in it and a part of it,

1871
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,670
but what a bizarre thing we've created.

1872
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,030
Uh,

1873
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:22,360
well,

1874
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,870
you know,

1875
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,640
part of that is it is also,

1876
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:25,570
it's unnatural.

1877
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,080
Yeah.

1878
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,750
In other words,

1879
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,250
that those collections

1880
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:28,641
of lights,

1881
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:31,940
definitely d shouldn't be here in southern
California because there's no water

1882
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:32,260
here.

1883
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,770
You know,

1884
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,220
we also have a theory that it's bad for
our consciousness to have these things

1885
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:38,410
at night because we not
allowed to see the stars.

1886
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,510
Then we're not able to see the stars.

1887
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,520
I think that's not good for people.

1888
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:43,354
I think people,

1889
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,790
I think a couple stars in the sky,

1890
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,350
those are two abstracts.

1891
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,520
You know the moon like,

1892
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:49,390
oh there's my friend,

1893
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:50,560
the moon I used to him,

1894
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,250
the,

1895
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:51,431
the,

1896
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:54,550
the image of the starry
nights in the BRASSICA.

1897
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,130
When you're driving on the highway and
you just pull over the car and you open

1898
00:50:58,131 --> 00:50:59,140
the door and look up and go,

1899
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,490
Holy Shit,

1900
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,390
get out of the car,

1901
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,710
get out of the car and look at this.

1902
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,950
And you lie on the hood of your fucking
car for hours just staring up at the

1903
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:08,770
Goddamn Milky Way.

1904
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,030
But we don't get to see that.

1905
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,760
We don't get to see that because we
want to keep everything lit up at night.

1906
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,990
And because of that,

1907
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,281
you,

1908
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:14,591
you,

1909
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:16,540
you don't get that humility,

1910
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,470
that realization that you
are in front of the infinite,

1911
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:24,790
but you're experiencing and impossible
vision can have incredible beauty

1912
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:25,624
connected.

1913
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,861
And we've started,

1914
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:28,500
we're feist it for streetlights,

1915
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,770
for street lights.

1916
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:33,340
We've sacrificed the most
incredible thing you could ever see.

1917
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,020
And very few people ever get to see it.

1918
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:36,220
And it's right above your head.

1919
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,300
You don't get to see it.

1920
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,080
You just don't,

1921
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,700
you don't get to see it
for what it really is.

1922
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,491
Story.

1923
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,120
Uh,

1924
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,940
uh,

1925
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,320
it's amazing from John Dunn,

1926
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:43,621
it was,

1927
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:45,090
it was some early Christian Mancha,

1928
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,740
uh,

1929
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,390
a story about a guy who
was riding around on,

1930
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,050
on,

1931
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,070
on an ass all day,

1932
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:51,840
a donkey looking for a donkey.

1933
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,890
In other words,

1934
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,540
it's like I'm trying to find God,

1935
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:56,820
I'm trying to find God
and you're swimming in it,

1936
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,350
but you're just not aware of it.

1937
00:51:59,050 --> 00:51:59,330
Um,

1938
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,960
and it's that shift in consciousness.

1939
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,060
We know we've got 7 billion
people on the planet now,

1940
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,220
so not everybody's gonna get to do this.

1941
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,870
This is where stuff gets really hairy.

1942
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:09,440
This isn't every,

1943
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,820
someone says something like that.

1944
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,031
Yeah,

1945
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:11,950
we're going to have to kill him,

1946
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,823
you know,

1947
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,910
and they want to die.

1948
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:14,380
You know,

1949
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,460
I don't want to kill anybody,

1950
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,050
but death is inevitable.

1951
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,023
Right.

1952
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,450
But that's a lot.

1953
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:20,460
That's a big number though.

1954
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:20,961
I'm so,

1955
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:21,940
it's so many people.

1956
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,330
Do you believe in the Georgia Guidestones
is you believe that she was willing to

1957
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:25,990
be like 500 million on the whole planet?

1958
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,980
I believe that there is a
balance that can be achieved.

1959
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,780
That's probably much greater than that.

1960
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,170
If,

1961
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,480
if mankind were live with permaculture,

1962
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,980
we need more than $500 million
to fight off the animals.

1963
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:40,840
I don't think we're going to get
to choose what the number's gonna.

1964
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,170
Yeah,

1965
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,480
I think the way we are
right now with the animals,

1966
00:52:43,481 --> 00:52:45,490
and it's very rare that
an animal attacks you.

1967
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:47,110
I think this is the perfect place to be.

1968
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,370
They can suck my deck.

1969
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:49,571
All right.

1970
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:50,231
They're all animals.

1971
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:51,160
I'm on team people.

1972
00:52:51,161 --> 00:52:54,580
If we're just out there dominated to
the point where we don't have to worry

1973
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:55,810
about them eating our children,

1974
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,950
you know right there.

1975
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:59,800
I think that's good because
this is a rare point in history.

1976
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,290
People have sort of forgotten
that at one point in time,

1977
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,700
just 50,000 years ago,

1978
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:04,600
fucking blink of the eye.

1979
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,411
Everywhere you went,

1980
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:06,250
you could have gotten eaten.

1981
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,031
You know,

1982
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:07,864
everywhere you went,

1983
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,910
you just animal wild animals everywhere.

1984
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,040
50,000 years ago there
was fucking saber tooth.

1985
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:12,874
Tigers are still there,

1986
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,210
but there's,

1987
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,590
there was always a balanced
humans rose to a population of,

1988
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,870
uh,

1989
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,320
two or 3 million stayed there
for a long estimated 5 million.

1990
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,010
But it was stable more than,

1991
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:26,251
well,

1992
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:28,800
more than a thousand years at like
a billion people on the planet.

1993
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:29,370
Wow.

1994
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:29,790
It was,

1995
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,360
you know,

1996
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,290
but even this,

1997
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,510
we were still overusing resources.

1998
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,300
We were still chopping down all the
forests in Europe because all of the sea,

1999
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:36,750
all of these,

2000
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,960
all the colonial expansion was to
find more resources to consume.

2001
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,120
We've reached the end of the planet,

2002
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,481
you know,

2003
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:45,000
there's no more places to go
discover to get more stuff.

2004
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,280
So how do you stop people from breeding?

2005
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:48,930
Because kids are awesome.

2006
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,730
I love having kids.

2007
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,220
It's like one of my
favorite things in life.

2008
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,150
Is that the part of the problem?

2009
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,620
I mean it can't be,

2010
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:57,210
it can't be a one or two people.

2011
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,650
I mean that you make the real
problem is a lack of resources.

2012
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:02,484
Right?

2013
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,353
The real problem.

2014
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,410
Isn't it possible that there could be
some sort of a scientific discovery,

2015
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,580
some something,

2016
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,910
something that changes the
game as far as the way we can,

2017
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,511
you know,

2018
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:16,290
we can harness energy that
could possibly pull us in a,

2019
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,200
in a more positive direction than
a complete and total collapse.

2020
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,501
No.

2021
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,210
Like some sort of a skin.

2022
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,421
No,

2023
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:21,930
nothing.

2024
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,763
It's impossible

2025
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:23,450
Dan.

2026
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,283
No,

2027
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,490
we're fucked.

2028
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:25,910
Period.

2029
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,743
Well,

2030
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,860
there they are now.

2031
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,400
Um,

2032
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,080
you should have a tee shirt and
sell it on your website though,

2033
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:30,700
by the way.

2034
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,380
Since we're far.

2035
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,570
Fuck yeah,

2036
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,733
that would be great.

2037
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,690
I have to think about what
to put on the backside.

2038
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,350
There are upsides.

2039
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,710
1 billion internal combustion
powered vehicles on the planet today.

2040
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,490
1 billion.

2041
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,323
Oh my God.

2042
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,860
They all run on oil.

2043
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,813
Okay.

2044
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:51,850
And it took untold tens of thousands
of gallons of oil to make the vehicle.

2045
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,090
You got to mind your,

2046
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:54,891
you got to melt it.

2047
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,510
You got a formula that paints oil,

2048
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,160
plastic is oil,

2049
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:58,471
blah,

2050
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:58,611
blah,

2051
00:54:58,611 --> 00:54:58,761
blah,

2052
00:54:58,761 --> 00:54:59,120
blah.

2053
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,650
So it took all the oil to make that.

2054
00:55:00,651 --> 00:55:02,600
So even if some new
technology appeared today,

2055
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:05,900
you couldn't plug it into any internal
combustion powered vehicle and make it

2056
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:06,734
work.

2057
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,540
There's seven gallons
of oil and every tire.

2058
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:08,961
Yeah.

2059
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:09,351
How much,

2060
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,750
how many gallons of oil
are there an electric cars?

2061
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:13,580
Uh,

2062
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,100
it depends on how big the car is.

2063
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:16,431
I mean,

2064
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:16,641
you know,

2065
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:16,970
there's,

2066
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,570
there's,

2067
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:17,900
you know,

2068
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,800
must be a lot though,

2069
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:18,951
right?

2070
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:19,190
Yeah.

2071
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,023
I mean

2072
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,140
is it's impossible to make
a car without using oil.

2073
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,423
Yeah.

2074
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:25,443
Impossible.

2075
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:26,590
And even an electric car,

2076
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,511
an electric car,

2077
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,880
all you also have to worry about
conflict minerals that are powering your

2078
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:31,714
batteries.

2079
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,020
Electricity is not an energy source.

2080
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:35,670
Electricity has to be generated.

2081
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:36,510
How do you generate it?

2082
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,231
By burning oil,

2083
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:38,100
by burning coal,

2084
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,150
by burning natural gas
or a nuclear reactor.

2085
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,410
Jesus Christ.

2086
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:43,951
Okay,

2087
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:45,960
so electricity is no ads.

2088
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:49,830
It still has to be generated and most
of our electricity in the U S is natural

2089
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:53,820
gas and coal dictated to electricity and
once we got addicted to electricity and

2090
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:55,020
then we multiplied like rats,

2091
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:57,750
electricity is the lifeblood of
human industrial civilization.

2092
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,580
The refrigerator on it
keeps the TV running.

2093
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:00,990
It keeps credit card circulating.

2094
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,400
It keeps you charged.

2095
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,290
No electricity,

2096
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:04,920
no economy.

2097
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,430
Yeah.

2098
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,120
That's amazing.

2099
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,540
Yeah,

2100
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,201
it's amazing.

2101
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:07,450
What a,

2102
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,160
what a mess.

2103
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,480
I mean it had that big blackout down
down here down to San Diego and Whoa,

2104
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:12,810
whoa.

2105
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,600
That was a bucket of cold water in
the face because that was real panic.

2106
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:16,830
That was a multistate.

2107
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,840
Those are going to do in the summer,

2108
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:19,170
right?

2109
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:19,530
Yeah.

2110
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,410
Those are going to be coming and
eventually they're going to be permanent.

2111
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,330
The power won't be coming back on again.

2112
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,280
Isn't there a way to keep the power on,

2113
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,130
dude,

2114
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:30,520
come on.

2115
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,040
I like refrigerated food.

2116
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,490
I like TV.

2117
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Has gotta be a way out of that now help
us help those that want to be helped and

2118
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,271
in the movie,

2119
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,380
I'll have to live in the woods.

2120
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,100
No,

2121
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,400
no.

2122
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,233
Well good.

2123
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,400
Stay out of the woods.

2124
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,561
In the movie,

2125
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:50,890
I told the story about campers
being attacked by a bear.

2126
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,580
Yes.

2127
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay.

2128
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,420
Now,

2129
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,800
if,

2130
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,140
if you're in a camp and a
big bear attacks to camp,

2131
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:58,330
you do not have to be
faster than the bear.

2132
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,770
You only have to be faster
than the slowest camper period.

2133
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,460
That's the lesson for everybody
here who becomes aware of collapse.

2134
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,630
The slow campers,

2135
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:08,231
the zombies,

2136
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:08,921
as we call them,

2137
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:11,170
are going to be out there
zombies until the last minute.

2138
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,221
You know when,

2139
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,950
when nothing is working anymore and
people are starving to death and they're

2140
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:15,784
going to go and say,

2141
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:15,971
well,

2142
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:16,241
Gee,

2143
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,021
I don't understand.

2144
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,370
This is going to come back any second.

2145
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,170
The faster campers,

2146
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,660
the ones worthy of Darwinian selection.

2147
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,190
Ha.

2148
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,930
There are tens of millions of us around
the world already moving local food

2149
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,720
production first and foremost,

2150
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:35,770
start growing food wherever you are
right now and at and then building

2151
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:38,800
communities and disengaging
from that paradigm.

2152
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,020
So those are the people
who are going to make it,

2153
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:42,340
you know,

2154
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:42,881
uh,

2155
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:43,750
and,

2156
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,820
and some areas in some regions won't.

2157
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:46,151
But let's see,

2158
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:48,880
I get to see this all over the
world as a result of collapse.

2159
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:51,940
I got do you have to be somewhere
where you're not going to need a car?

2160
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,670
Does that an issue?

2161
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,230
And eventually we're going to run an oil,

2162
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:57,220
right?

2163
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,680
Yeah.

2164
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,513
Close.

2165
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,800
Well,

2166
00:57:59,800 --> 00:57:59,981
no,

2167
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:01,240
there'll always be oil in the ground.

2168
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:01,781
I mean,

2169
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:02,261
gasoline.

2170
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:02,500
No,

2171
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,530
I mean like when you think,

2172
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,980
when do you think it will be an issue
where you won't be able to get gas?

2173
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,431
Is that,

2174
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:07,480
is that something you foresee?

2175
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,130
It's an issue in this country right now.

2176
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:10,690
We've had massive fuel shortages,

2177
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,640
diesel shortages that have paralyzed us.

2178
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:14,950
He's on the upper Midwest.

2179
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:15,784
Canada.

2180
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,690
Yeah.

2181
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,640
And it's happening all
over the world right now.

2182
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:19,181
You don't see it.

2183
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:19,481
We have,

2184
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,190
we're bringing out the
stories on collapse net,

2185
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,181
Johannesburg,

2186
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:22,901
South Africa,

2187
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:24,030
gas station shutdown,

2188
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:24,491
India,

2189
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:27,610
Pakistan falling apart because
they can't get the oil.

2190
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,240
Um,

2191
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,440
so that's a problem.

2192
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:30,730
It's going to get worse
and worse and worse.

2193
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:31,900
It won't be like turning a switch.

2194
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:33,940
You have oil one day and your gas one day,

2195
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:34,240
Dan,

2196
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,691
no gas.

2197
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,640
The next day it becomes harder to get,

2198
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:37,061
et Cetera,

2199
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:37,420
et cetera.

2200
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,870
Why is gas cheaper though right now
than it was like say three years ago?

2201
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,760
That's a result also of the fact
that the economy is much slower.

2202
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:50,740
It's 96% correlation between
greenhouse gas emission and GDP growth.

2203
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,330
You don't grow the economy without
burning oil and natural gas.

2204
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:56,650
Wow.

2205
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,400
So,

2206
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,930
so there's less demand now.

2207
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,390
So,

2208
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,230
but when,

2209
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,910
when Bush was leaving office though,

2210
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:04,430
how'd they get away with jacking
the gas through the fucking roof?

2211
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,140
Because it was almost like it was,

2212
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:08,520
I almost heard like the
rolling stones plane,

2213
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:08,951
who,

2214
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:11,270
who like playing in the back
or why they were doing it.

2215
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,560
It seemed like,

2216
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:12,921
like,

2217
00:59:12,921 --> 00:59:13,131
you know,

2218
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:13,421
they were,

2219
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:14,990
they were going out in a blaze of glory.

2220
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,300
He's the chief Francis Ford Coppola movie.

2221
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,131
You know what I mean?

2222
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:18,964
I mean,

2223
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:19,881
at the end of it,

2224
00:59:19,881 --> 00:59:23,120
it was like they jacked it up to
$5 a gallon and everybody's like,

2225
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,110
what the fuck?

2226
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:24,560
Well,

2227
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,130
people were like,

2228
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,840
couldn't drive themselves to work.

2229
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,040
You get to be a real panic.

2230
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,480
That was a direct product there,

2231
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,300
but I mean it wasn't George Bush,

2232
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:35,020
Dick Cheney or a Hank Paulson or somebody
like that flipping a switch saying,

2233
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:35,231
okay,

2234
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:36,730
we're going to put gas at five bucks.

2235
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:37,564
No,

2236
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,520
it was a super heated economy.

2237
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:44,521
We were growing then at the end of 2007
we were at and so the faster you grow,

2238
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,680
the more energy you consume again,

2239
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:52,930
but you reach a point as a result of peak
oil where you need more cheap oil than

2240
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:53,764
you can find.

2241
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,600
You've eaten all the low hanging fruit,

2242
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,860
you found all the chief oil.

2243
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,240
It's not inexhaustible.

2244
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,660
Deep water horizons a result of us
being desperate to go out and get oil.

2245
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:03,190
It's more and more expensive to get.

2246
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:08,790
So the economy got so hot that the oil
prices spike because that was what demand

2247
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,360
was doing at the time.

2248
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,650
There was some minor stuff,

2249
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,040
what Spec,

2250
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,790
but it's fundamentally peak
oil and one 47 a barrel oils.

2251
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:16,390
What shut,

2252
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,180
shut us down in 2008 and we're,

2253
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:22,240
we're just about to hit another place
right now with oil at a hundred,

2254
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,750
hundred and five that's going to shut
everything down because people are so much

2255
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,610
more broke than they were in 2008.

2256
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,331
Uh,

2257
01:00:28,331 --> 01:00:31,390
and we're looking at a
possible attack on Iran.

2258
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:32,740
We're looking at Saudi Arabia,

2259
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:35,080
possibly collapsing a
racks now in civil war.

2260
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,030
Just a week after we
pulled our troops out.

2261
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,011
Isn't that insane?

2262
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:38,770
Yeah.

2263
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:39,460
Yeah.

2264
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:39,671
Oh,

2265
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:41,740
do you s is getting bitch slapped
around the world right now?

2266
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,220
The a thing is insane.

2267
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:44,881
I mean,

2268
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:45,011
they,

2269
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:45,360
they,

2270
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:45,720
they,

2271
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,710
they took a day,

2272
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:47,663
they fell apart

2273
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,643
immediately.

2274
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,180
Like from the get go.

2275
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,920
Actually on the same day that
the last the US troops left Iraq,

2276
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:55,650
uh,

2277
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:56,820
nor ya'll Maliki had a,

2278
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,390
had a,

2279
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:57,800
uh,

2280
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,800
delegation fly to Syria to Damascus
to meet with a resident Al Assad,

2281
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:06,320
because the US is trying to overthrow
Assad cause he's an ally of Iran.

2282
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,663
And,

2283
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,533
and uh,

2284
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,990
I'll moloka who was a Shiite
was starting to side with Syria.

2285
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:16,970
So the u s and Israel had been
very intent on attacking Iran,

2286
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,940
which is a stupid suicidal move.

2287
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:19,221
I mean,

2288
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:19,371
it'll,

2289
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:22,310
it'll kill all of us because
the world can't do without oil.

2290
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,410
And that'll shut down
in the Gulf in China.

2291
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:24,830
We'll bag.

2292
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:25,663
It's ugly.

2293
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,240
So what's the motivation for this?

2294
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,420
What's the motivation to invade Iran oil?

2295
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,920
To control the oil

2296
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:33,930
and,

2297
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,590
and because Iran is
truly a regional power,

2298
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,440
uh,

2299
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,850
that can threaten us western
control of the region.

2300
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,060
But what's happening now as
the Western economies fail,

2301
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:44,480
right?

2302
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,370
Europe is toast and,

2303
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:45,661
and,

2304
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:46,011
and,

2305
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:46,880
and our,

2306
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:49,520
our economy is in the shitter and
getting much worse all the time.

2307
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,330
China and a w has been growing faster,

2308
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:55,280
but China's now starting to fall apart.

2309
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:56,240
But China is,

2310
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:56,571
is,

2311
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:57,390
is more of a,

2312
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:57,530
uh,

2313
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,570
an economic powerhouse than we are now.

2314
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:03,140
So the people that have the oil will
go to those who can pay more for it.

2315
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,423
China,

2316
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,131
see,

2317
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:07,720
when I look at us invading Iran,

2318
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,410
it w w what freaks me out is it,

2319
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:13,030
that seems like that's a real country.

2320
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,890
Not that Iraq isn't a real country,

2321
01:02:14,891 --> 01:02:16,180
but it was run by a dictator.

2322
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:20,040
It was run by a guy who was in
arguably completely up and we put them

2323
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,551
in power.

2324
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:21,540
He was an evil man.

2325
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,590
He had evil children.

2326
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:23,060
He just,

2327
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,030
it was a fucking mass.

2328
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,020
And then you,

2329
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,261
okay,

2330
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:26,280
we're in Afghanistan.

2331
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:26,660
Well,

2332
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,650
sort of a crazy situation in Afghanistan,

2333
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:31,590
but there's a bunch of warlords running
the country and there's really only one

2334
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:32,310
city.

2335
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,091
It's cobble.

2336
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,370
And it's a really unusual place.

2337
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:35,671
You know,

2338
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:36,120
it's like,

2339
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,010
it's almost like there
is no government anywhere

2340
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:41,680
and 80 80 or 90% of the world's opium.

2341
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,940
And then all of a sudden
you talk about Iran,

2342
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:45,250
you're like,

2343
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:45,521
okay,

2344
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:46,660
I ran as a real country.

2345
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,111
Okay,

2346
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:47,761
now you're,

2347
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,400
you're dealing with a spirit of power.

2348
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,381
You hit it right on the head.

2349
01:02:50,381 --> 01:02:50,750
Yeah.

2350
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,231
This is a,

2351
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:53,480
this is like we've stepped out of the,

2352
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:53,781
okay,

2353
01:02:53,781 --> 01:02:54,980
we're just going after,

2354
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:55,340
you know,

2355
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:00,080
Banana Republic fucked up countries
that are run by crazy dudes and uh,

2356
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:00,380
you know,

2357
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,370
who have no power,

2358
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:05,270
who are obviously humiliated
by us just a decade earlier.

2359
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,570
You want to know the biggest
difference between Iran and Iraq.

2360
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,130
Iran has had those same
borders since the time of,

2361
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:11,650
of,

2362
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:12,520
of Xerxes.

2363
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,040
2000 years BC.

2364
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:15,903
Okay.

2365
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,680
That's been around its borders.

2366
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,270
The borders of Iraq were drawn by Winston
Churchill with a pen or a pencil in

2367
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:26,620
1921 after the end of
World War One and Iraq was,

2368
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,350
was Iran is all Shia Muslim.

2369
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,060
It's all homogeneous people.

2370
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,950
Iraq is Sony's,

2371
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,510
she is Kurds.

2372
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,260
Uh,

2373
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:35,591
you know,

2374
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:40,591
they've got some Hashimite d and so
Iraq really shouldn't be a country.

2375
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,640
Nature wouldn't have made it a country.

2376
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:44,080
It was politically drawn that way.

2377
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:47,050
And that's a big weakness for a
rock and a big strength for Iran.

2378
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,310
And I think people sort of felt

2379
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,690
something in,

2380
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,750
in that way.

2381
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,410
Like when we entered our rockets,

2382
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,581
like,

2383
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:53,851
yeah,

2384
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:54,630
it's,

2385
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,610
it's a fucked up place already.

2386
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:58,590
It's really a good idea
to get rid of this guy.

2387
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,450
No matter what you think about going Iraq.

2388
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,430
It's like we know that this guy is crazy.

2389
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:04,680
We know that if he really
does have a nuclear power,

2390
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:05,550
we are fucked.

2391
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,710
And of course,

2392
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:11,940
Saddam Hussein had absolutely nothing
to do with nine 11 he had no weapons of

2393
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:12,810
mass destruction.

2394
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,610
He had no chemical agents.

2395
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,990
And yet that's the same shit bloody
Barack Obama's trying to stuff down our

2396
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:20,790
throats right now with Emeran.

2397
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,773
Exactly.

2398
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,530
And that's the button that Ron Paul
hits and that's the bullshit button.

2399
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,480
I have a friend Dmitri Orloff,

2400
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:28,201
he's Russian.

2401
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:29,940
He survived the collapsed
and he's a writer.

2402
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:30,570
Brilliant guy,

2403
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,201
good friend.

2404
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,610
He calls it the Aha moment.

2405
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,180
It's the moment when in in
the old Soviet Union went,

2406
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:37,014
everybody went,

2407
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,273
Aha,

2408
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,660
it's collapsed.

2409
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,641
It's not working.

2410
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:42,450
It's not credible.

2411
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,560
Nobody believes it.

2412
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:45,960
And Ron Paul is bringing that Aha moment,

2413
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:46,801
you know,

2414
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:48,120
like the emperor's new clothes.

2415
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:49,510
When everybody in this country real,

2416
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,900
it looks at every other sane
person in this country and says,

2417
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:52,951
Jesus Christ,

2418
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:53,910
this is all corrupt,

2419
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:54,241
crooked.

2420
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:55,150
We're not an,

2421
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,520
all of a sudden we all see it.

2422
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:00,480
Do you think another country is going
to get some sort of a nuclear power and

2423
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:01,410
it's going to become an issue?

2424
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,210
Do you think that's what's
going to happen to us?

2425
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,260
No.

2426
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,970
I mean that is the only
argument whatsoever about
suppressing other nations.

2427
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,470
The only argument that it's like,

2428
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:10,880
yeah,

2429
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,060
yeah we got nuclear power,

2430
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,040
but nobody else can have
it cause it's fucked up.

2431
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:14,821
We used it once.

2432
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:15,990
We feel real bad about it,

2433
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:17,010
but we don't trust you with it.

2434
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,220
I mean the idea

2435
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,640
that you would want to stop all these
bad guys from creating nuclear power and

2436
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:22,090
nuclear,

2437
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,080
not nuclear power rather,

2438
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:25,900
but nuclear weapons is something,

2439
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,490
it's a consideration if you,

2440
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,920
you're dealing with a really
volatile country in the first place.

2441
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,440
I think our biggest concern now is not
some other nation getting cause it,

2442
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:39,430
it's enormously expensive and energy
intensive to enrich uranium and,

2443
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:40,660
and to make the warheads.

2444
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:41,441
Believe me,

2445
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:42,560
that's what I come from.

2446
01:05:42,561 --> 01:05:44,710
It's a background that I come
from when I had the clearance,

2447
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:46,150
when I was living with my parents.

2448
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,290
Um,

2449
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,500
so I don't think we need to worry about
anybody learning how to do it or making

2450
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:50,681
new.

2451
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:52,540
What we've got is,

2452
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:52,990
uh,

2453
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,370
is hundreds of thousands of nuclear
that are already out that it's already

2454
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:57,611
there.

2455
01:05:57,611 --> 01:05:58,390
We've got an,

2456
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,070
there's a,

2457
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,460
so we shouldn't be worried about Iran.

2458
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,430
We should be worried about the shit
that was missing in the Soviet Union.

2459
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,343
We just had,

2460
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,990
we just put up a story on collapsed
that it was from a Japanese paper,

2461
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:08,903
a

2462
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,051
maximally remember,

2463
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:15,640
but it was a good Japanese paper that
there's like 700 pounds of enriched

2464
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:18,310
uranium that are missing from Fukushima.

2465
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,263
Wow.

2466
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,200
This stuff is swimming all
over the world right now.

2467
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,870
So enriched uranium,

2468
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,300
if you refresh my memory,

2469
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:28,990
it is a,

2470
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:31,750
was it enriched your eye product anyway?

2471
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,950
Enriched uranium is like,

2472
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:33,940
that's the stuff that they,

2473
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:34,231
the,

2474
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:34,780
the,

2475
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,990
the issues with a weapons
and Gulf War syndrome,

2476
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:38,824
right?

2477
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:39,281
No,

2478
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:40,114
that's the same.

2479
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:40,800
Pleated,

2480
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,740
you're depleted uranium.

2481
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,980
That's different and enriched uranium is,

2482
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:44,171
is,

2483
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:44,501
is,

2484
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:48,190
is uranium nuclear weapons
grade that you process with,

2485
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:53,191
with heavy water was centrifuges with
in various ways to concentrate the atoms

2486
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,520
of a,

2487
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,420
it's either you to 35 or two
to 38 that give you the energy,

2488
01:06:58,421 --> 01:06:58,741
but it's,

2489
01:06:58,741 --> 01:07:01,720
it's like packing the punch to enrich it,

2490
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:02,320
uh,

2491
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,410
to make it fissile so that in a reactor,

2492
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,310
when you pull the radio,

2493
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:09,710
it'll create the heat because
all a nuclear reactor really is,

2494
01:07:09,711 --> 01:07:10,930
is a boiling water pot.

2495
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,230
Albert Einstein,

2496
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:13,430
look,

2497
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,070
look at the first nuclear reactor.

2498
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,660
He said it's a hell of
a way to boil water.

2499
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:20,080
And that's where all the energy comes
from out of every nuclear plant.

2500
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:21,670
It's just boiling water and steam.

2501
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,840
Wow.

2502
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,673
Yeah.

2503
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:23,801
Yeah.

2504
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:24,820
Most people don't even know.

2505
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,790
They just know that there's a nuclear
reactor and they figure somehow or another

2506
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,070
they get that into an
electricity line or something.

2507
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:30,821
You know what I mean?

2508
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:31,330
I mean,

2509
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,270
the idea behind it is when
you look at it that way,

2510
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,571
it's like,

2511
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:34,811
wow,

2512
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:35,561
that's pretty crazy.

2513
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:36,310
Primitive.

2514
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,143
Yeah.

2515
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:37,571
What,

2516
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:37,780
uh,

2517
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,640
what a nutty fucking animal.

2518
01:07:39,641 --> 01:07:43,390
Human beings splitting
atoms for our own power.

2519
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,380
And when the,

2520
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,190
you know,

2521
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,570
when they shut off or they,

2522
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,230
you know,

2523
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,310
get hit by a tsunami,

2524
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:48,910
well,

2525
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:49,900
here's the catch.

2526
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,630
As collapse proceeds,

2527
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,030
as,

2528
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:53,270
as,

2529
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,550
as it gets worse as nations,

2530
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:54,701
you know,

2531
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:55,810
we're seeing sovereign debt.

2532
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,190
Government's going bankrupt.

2533
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,230
Tepco is going bankrupt.

2534
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:00,370
Japan's going to nationalize it,

2535
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:02,740
but Japan's got a bigger
debt than anybody else,

2536
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:03,151
et Cetera,

2537
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:03,970
et cetera.

2538
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:08,410
I as collapse proceeds are our
ability to deal with Fukushima,

2539
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:13,411
like events is going to diminish their
450 nuclear reactors in the world that

2540
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:15,020
are running.

2541
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,140
And if we don't shut them
down and collapse proceeds,

2542
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,490
they're going to kill everything anyway.

2543
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,310
How the fuck did we get
this screwed up so quickly?

2544
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:22,911
Pretty Stupid,

2545
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,300
Huh?

2546
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,133
It's amazing.

2547
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,700
It's amazing what an impact.

2548
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,790
Just the last few hundred years
humans have had on the earth.

2549
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:29,930
You know,

2550
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:33,740
think about how innocuous we were for
the first million years of our existence

2551
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,540
and the last couple of hundred years.

2552
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:40,250
We just like a firecracker with a long
fuse that that last couple hundred years

2553
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,113
was energy.

2554
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,190
That's when we discovered the
energy's amazing coal oil is,

2555
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,470
well,

2556
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,170
why can't we see what we're doing?

2557
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:48,441
I mean,

2558
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:48,770
what,

2559
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:48,980
what?

2560
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,840
What kind of a weird thing are people
where they have such an amazing ability to

2561
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:58,820
control their environment and to
influence their environment and we can't,

2562
01:08:58,821 --> 01:08:59,870
for whatever reason,

2563
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:02,780
we can't feel what we're
doing bad to the environment.

2564
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:07,930
It's almost like we have much more power
and much more ability than we have the

2565
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:12,260
natural ability to perceive
the impact of this power.

2566
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:12,610
That's the,

2567
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,220
it's almost like,

2568
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,521
yeah,

2569
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:14,190
the disconnect.

2570
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:14,871
That's that's,

2571
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:15,920
that's what happened.

2572
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:16,701
It's what it is.

2573
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:16,881
Right.

2574
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:21,860
When when the devil or whoever it was
wrote that into genesis one saying God

2575
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:22,130
saying,

2576
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,110
I give you dominion over this earth.

2577
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:25,640
No,

2578
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,260
see we are not,

2579
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:31,010
God is in a mad scramble to figure it out.

2580
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,873
Is that what it is?

2581
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:32,211
I mean,

2582
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:37,040
do you think that the way humans have to
evolve at an incredibly rapid pace like

2583
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,500
sociologically or consciously to test it,

2584
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:43,340
try to catch up with the technology
that's evolving around us?

2585
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:47,000
It's almost like this
mad scramble is in place.

2586
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,560
It almost has to be in place.

2587
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:50,350
Just to keep up with where we are.

2588
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,860
Technology is going.

2589
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,480
I call that I gave a speech in a grass
valley that's up on the collapse,

2590
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:57,314
that website,

2591
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,630
the speech was called the
birth of post petroleum human.

2592
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,460
And I coined a line in that,

2593
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:02,100
uh,

2594
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,720
I said,

2595
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:02,970
we,

2596
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,711
we,

2597
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:08,630
the people of the posts of
the new consciousness will
live in the spaces between

2598
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:11,630
the ones and the Zeros
of Cartesian tyranny.

2599
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,333
Oh,

2600
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,470
that's pretty bad ass
where they can't get us.

2601
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,610
That should be on a hallmark card,

2602
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,100
you know,

2603
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,450
and,

2604
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,770
and,

2605
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,220
and,

2606
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:18,690
but,

2607
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,150
but that's what this is,

2608
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:20,361
you know,

2609
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:21,130
this is,

2610
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,020
this is like Cartesian
tyranny is like somebody's,

2611
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,273
uh,

2612
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,780
somebody's hitting the crack pipe,

2613
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,260
you know,

2614
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,200
just two seconds before they
die and they weigh eight pounds.

2615
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:30,970
You know,

2616
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:31,803
uh,

2617
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:32,330
it's,

2618
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:35,600
it's insane because it's supreme,

2619
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:36,620
supremely arrogant.

2620
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,410
Uh,

2621
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:37,940
in other words,

2622
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,301
one's,

2623
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:40,580
and zero's can't measure heart and soul,

2624
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,110
but music does,

2625
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,270
fighting does.

2626
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,673
And there's no,

2627
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,630
that's not a one in zero thing.

2628
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:47,891
It's,

2629
01:10:47,891 --> 01:10:51,230
it's something that
exists outside of that,

2630
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,300
of those measurements and those controls.

2631
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:54,860
Um,

2632
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,450
and that's really what I think the occupy
movement is really exemplifying really

2633
01:10:59,451 --> 01:10:59,661
well.

2634
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:04,640
So they feel victimized by ones and Zeros
in the manipulation and corruption of

2635
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:08,930
the system that manages the ones and
Zeros and they're screaming out from the

2636
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,350
visceral part of their
there from the mind,

2637
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,340
from the instinct that's telling them this

2638
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,600
is a fucking mess.

2639
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,890
So when that woman says,

2640
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:17,581
or when they say,

2641
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:18,440
what are you occupying?

2642
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,130
She says everything.

2643
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,383
That's it.

2644
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:21,840
Yeah.

2645
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,320
When I was saying that the occupy people
are sorta like white blood cells and

2646
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:28,440
they're just gathering around illness
and they don't even know what they're

2647
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:29,274
going to do with it,

2648
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:29,821
but they're,

2649
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:32,100
they're gathering around
all the six spots.

2650
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,630
There was a reason why.

2651
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,523
And I got,

2652
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:38,320
I got deeply involved in
that when I saw the violence.

2653
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:40,380
And I've been an activist
a long time and I know,

2654
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,740
I know a lot of veterans in the
La Special Forces and seals.

2655
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,420
When I saw Oakland and when I saw
that all the unforgivable violence,

2656
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,520
I was a good scar in the city.

2657
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:51,240
I was,

2658
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,170
I was sick.

2659
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,840
I was as sick as I was when I saw
the Rodney King beating happened.

2660
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,081
You know,

2661
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:56,250
I was just sick to my heart,

2662
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,020
but so were many of us.

2663
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,031
And once you,

2664
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:00,090
Mark Thomas did his thing,

2665
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:01,710
she Mars has been a
guest on my radio show.

2666
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:03,390
I love what he's way cool.

2667
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,040
He's,

2668
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,180
he,

2669
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,000
he's having a hard time
dealing with a celebrity.

2670
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:06,930
I say get used to it,

2671
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:07,764
you know.

2672
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:08,460
Uh,

2673
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,293
uh,

2674
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:14,070
but there were so many of us at so many
levels who stepped up because we were so

2675
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:15,840
totally offended by that.

2676
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:16,950
Um,

2677
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,660
but occupy was threatening and the reason
occupies threatened and there was a

2678
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,590
homeland security coordinated
the shut down of all the cities.

2679
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,610
We had that on collapsing there.

2680
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:28,470
Uh,

2681
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,310
we threatened them.

2682
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:30,750
The tent was so,

2683
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:33,810
it's such a powerful symbol because
you've never seen a fucking mortgage on a

2684
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:34,141
tent,

2685
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:34,974
have you?

2686
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:36,780
Yeah.

2687
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,260
Right.

2688
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,100
It's freedom.

2689
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,810
That's the symbol.

2690
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,540
And in the space that was created in,

2691
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:42,781
in,

2692
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:45,180
in my spirituality is it's very
important to create an hold,

2693
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,110
a sacred space.

2694
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,011
You know,

2695
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:48,660
where the magic can happen.

2696
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:50,070
And the occupy spaces,

2697
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,690
there was such magic happening.

2698
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:56,310
People were connecting and people were
waking up to each other and the learning

2699
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:57,570
curve was going self.

2700
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,141
Yeah.

2701
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:58,411
Okay.

2702
01:12:58,411 --> 01:12:59,244
Listen to me.

2703
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,530
And people were just figuring shit out.

2704
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,030
One of the first things that,

2705
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:03,340
uh,

2706
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,860
Nyp Dee took out a Ducati park was the
library they had to get and they threw

2707
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,940
all the books away and all
of my books were in there.

2708
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:10,750
Yeah.

2709
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,550
They took them right to a dumpster and
disposed of them because people would

2710
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,090
just be in the library the entire
time the light people were coming.

2711
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,490
People were unplugging from the Matrix.

2712
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:21,361
So,

2713
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:23,580
but why would they get rid
of the library just to,

2714
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:24,820
because they were using it.

2715
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,910
They were hanging out there like why
would they close the library and through

2716
01:13:27,911 --> 01:13:28,530
all the books away,

2717
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,620
why did Hitler burned
the books really mean.

2718
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,110
So they're,

2719
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,410
they're,

2720
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,850
they're worried that the,

2721
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:36,280
that's where they're going to get all
their information from this library or

2722
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,020
what their phrase,

2723
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,340
it just a place to hang out.

2724
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,240
They're trying to eliminate,

2725
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:39,570
well,

2726
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,830
what gay sex this is.

2727
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:43,660
You know,

2728
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,800
it's a big science that,

2729
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:45,660
you know,

2730
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,830
in mass psychology,

2731
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:48,510
when you reach a certain
percentage of the people,

2732
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,070
7% solution of whatever it is,

2733
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,660
all of a sudden everybody
starts getting it.

2734
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,550
That's what they were afraid of.

2735
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,050
Um,

2736
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,400
so they close the library,

2737
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,660
they didn't close it.

2738
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:58,190
They,

2739
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:58,520
they,

2740
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:58,930
they,

2741
01:13:58,930 --> 01:13:59,990
they throw the books away.

2742
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,680
They did the equivalent
of burning the books.

2743
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:02,550
They disposed of them.

2744
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,803
Wow.

2745
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,620
That's because there were
a couple thousand bucks and
then anybody could really

2746
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:09,510
rationalize that being a good idea.

2747
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:10,703
That's amazing.

2748
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:11,411
It's amazing.

2749
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:11,980
Like,

2750
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,700
you know,

2751
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,300
and that's the other thing about
this NBA thing drives me crazy.

2752
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:17,050
Yeah.

2753
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:22,050
Or Nda I national defense authorization
act where they're proposing that they

2754
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,350
can just arrest people.

2755
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,970
They don't have to have a warrant.

2756
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,990
They just have to have a,

2757
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:26,190
uh,

2758
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:29,380
an idea that somehow or another you
were a threat to America and they can

2759
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,230
indefinitely suspend you and they
won't do it because they're good guys.

2760
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:32,830
Don't worry.

2761
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,221
It's just,

2762
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:34,054
just in case.

2763
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,391
But no,

2764
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,550
you can't have just in case that's crazy.

2765
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,030
It's crazy that it's gotten to the
point where anybody would even consider

2766
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:40,660
saying yes,

2767
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,140
do you know in Japan they can just arrest
you for 29 days and in those 29 days

2768
01:14:45,141 --> 01:14:46,040
they can torture you.

2769
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:49,880
And most of the time they'll get people
to like say things or write things off

2770
01:14:49,881 --> 01:14:50,714
and then they'll,

2771
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:51,110
uh,

2772
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,430
prosecute them completely.

2773
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,200
Wow.

2774
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,100
It's amazing.

2775
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:58,600
It's written in the u s constitution and
the bill of Rights Congress shall pass

2776
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,800
no law.

2777
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,143
Boom.

2778
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,170
Freedom of speech.

2779
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:02,921
Everything else.

2780
01:15:02,921 --> 01:15:03,280
Okay.

2781
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,280
The bill of Rights Congress
has just passed a law that
violates the constitution

2782
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,210
and the president wants it and he,

2783
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,380
and he hasn't signed it because
we made bloody for rock.

2784
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:19,540
Still hasn't signed as far as I can
tell you today is a huge outcry.

2785
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:19,961
What is today?

2786
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:20,680
The 25th,

2787
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,161
27th,

2788
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:21,994
seventh.

2789
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,361
Yeah.

2790
01:15:22,361 --> 01:15:23,260
I don't even know what date is.

2791
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,790
December 27th.

2792
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:24,960
Yeah.

2793
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,141
Okay.

2794
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:25,960
So,

2795
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,630
so he'd be,

2796
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,720
he probably will.

2797
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:29,650
Um,

2798
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,550
has he expressed,

2799
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,500
do you mean he said he
would veto it initially,

2800
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:32,711
right?

2801
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:33,550
A long time ago,

2802
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:34,720
didn't they?

2803
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,710
Yeah,

2804
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:36,544
I don't think so.

2805
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,080
Not that I've heard.

2806
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:38,251
I,

2807
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:39,550
I'm expecting him to sign it.

2808
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,820
I had read somewhere that when
it was first being proposed to,

2809
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:45,420
people weren't worried if it got through
the Senate because the president said

2810
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:46,254
he would veto it.

2811
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,520
Do you think it's possible
the president lies so,

2812
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:51,670
so shocking.

2813
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:54,640
It's just so shocking that they would
literally change what America is.

2814
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:59,670
The whole idea of America is land of the
free home of the brave with liberty and

2815
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:01,300
justice for all.

2816
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:05,410
That was like the founding
principles of this great experiment,

2817
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,750
liberty and justice,

2818
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:12,130
and those words are so fucking important
because people don't understand this.

2819
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:12,550
They are.

2820
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:16,690
This idea of security being more important
is absolutely fucking crazy because

2821
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:17,410
guess what?

2822
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,240
You're were pretty God damn secure.

2823
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:19,601
You have,

2824
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:20,350
you feel like,

2825
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,190
do you feel bad?

2826
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:24,400
Do you feel like they're the enemies all
around you and terrorism is everywhere

2827
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:24,731
you look,

2828
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:25,390
it's not.

2829
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:29,440
It's not just a few isolated examples
and they're using those isolated examples

2830
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:31,840
to fuck you and to control.

2831
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:33,010
You complete that down.

2832
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:36,670
Seven year old girls in the airport make
you stand where you're weenies hanging

2833
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:37,820
in the x ray machine.

2834
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:38,291
They listen.

2835
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:38,451
I'm,

2836
01:16:38,451 --> 01:16:40,330
I'm all for them doing,

2837
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:40,661
you know,

2838
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,490
airport security the right way.

2839
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,930
I think it's a good idea.

2840
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:44,711
It's a smaller deal.

2841
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:46,090
They've caught some people doing thumbs,

2842
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,550
but have you give people
power over other people?

2843
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,660
I've seen people at the airport and they
may be just had a bad day or maybe they

2844
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:53,740
were tired or whatever,

2845
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:57,880
but I've seen them talk to people and
they're kind of shitty dorm and real short

2846
01:16:57,881 --> 01:16:58,480
to him.

2847
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,530
And I've seen the opposite.

2848
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:02,170
I've seen people at the TSA that
are real friendly and real cool.

2849
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:07,380
And whenever you have that possibility
that a human being's day and emotions and

2850
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,440
that factors into how someone is,

2851
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,010
is a interrogated or someone is a,

2852
01:17:12,011 --> 01:17:14,450
it is handled going through the airport,

2853
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:17,000
that someone could just be in a
bad mood and be short and snippy,

2854
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,720
then I'll send,

2855
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,460
that shouldn't be even in the equation.

2856
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,160
That shouldn't be something that people
have to deal with when it comes to

2857
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:22,940
security.

2858
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,940
None of that stuff should
be in the equation anyway.

2859
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,281
It should.

2860
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:25,450
If,

2861
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:26,450
if at anything,

2862
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:28,610
it should be something nice and simple,

2863
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,470
you know,

2864
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,980
just that's conditioning.

2865
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:31,131
No,

2866
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:31,461
that's,

2867
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:32,001
that's training,

2868
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:35,830
that's getting you used to
being fucked with and so,

2869
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,570
and it's so terrifying to,

2870
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,390
to think that it's possible that there's
people out there that would allow

2871
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:44,810
things to happen just to
tighten down security.

2872
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:48,710
They would allow things that they
knew could possibly be taking place.

2873
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:50,780
Let it happen now way once it does,

2874
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,710
we'll tighten up this and this pass
immediately and then we'll just stick that

2875
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,210
right in the back door and no one's,

2876
01:17:56,211 --> 01:17:57,044
I'm going to say a word,

2877
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,711
you know,

2878
01:17:57,711 --> 01:18:00,920
nice businesses and nice government
contracts for people who are the,

2879
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:01,280
you know,

2880
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,840
the money gets laundered
through all the guys.

2881
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,560
I mean it's,

2882
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,393
it's sick.

2883
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,900
The whole thing is the world
is governed by organized crime.

2884
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:09,980
And if you think about a man,

2885
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:13,970
can you point to any government anywhere
in the world that you think is doing a

2886
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:14,511
good job,

2887
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:15,321
that it's people are going,

2888
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:15,561
yeah,

2889
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:19,520
my government's really taking care of
me now because they're all run by the

2890
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:20,354
banks,

2891
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,213
gangsters,

2892
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,460
Dick Cheney's the most
obvious gangster of all time.

2893
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:26,090
Right?

2894
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,410
We see the most obvious.

2895
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:31,160
Well that's aside from getting
to the owners of the Fed,

2896
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,510
the Bank of international settlements,

2897
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:33,231
city of London,

2898
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:35,090
finding out who those
financial powers that be,

2899
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:35,900
Dick Dick,

2900
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,630
those people at the
top of the food chains.

2901
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,301
That's yeah.

2902
01:18:38,301 --> 01:18:38,681
And,

2903
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:40,250
and as a shadow government,

2904
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:43,640
we're going to find out more and
more about who they are as as things

2905
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:44,661
deteriorate.

2906
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:46,080
But Dick Dick Cheney is,

2907
01:18:46,081 --> 01:18:46,701
is far,

2908
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:50,810
far and away the most evil senior
manager I have ever seen in my life.

2909
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,910
That's kind of what my book
crossing the rubicons about,

2910
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,170
along with a lot of other things.

2911
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:54,800
But yeah,

2912
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,820
he was a gangster.

2913
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:59,570
I mean that guy shot his friend in
the face and his friend apologized,

2914
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:00,620
you know,

2915
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:02,210
that's his gangster as you get.

2916
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:03,530
He was so terrifying.

2917
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:08,531
A guy who made a living as the head of
a company that fixes shit after we blow

2918
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:15,311
it up and then he gets it off and blow
shit up and then makes a fuck load of

2919
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:16,671
money fixing it.

2920
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:18,440
He killed 3,200 Americans.

2921
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:21,650
And I say it in my book crossing the
Rubicon proves that Dick Cheney was the

2922
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,010
mastermind and executed September
11th I'll take it to court,

2923
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:26,480
the books in the Harvard Business Library.

2924
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:31,070
So you believe that he actually engineered
it and it's not that they allowed

2925
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,701
nine hello man,

2926
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:32,060
heaven.

2927
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:35,690
He commanded it and he did this to,

2928
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,890
in order to get people excited about going
to war with Iraq or and have whatever

2929
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:43,100
power we wanted and he is
fully aware of peak oil.

2930
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,280
Iraq has the second largest
oil reserves on the planet.

2931
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,220
So the only way to do that
was to allow planes or no,

2932
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:49,371
he,

2933
01:19:49,371 --> 01:19:49,561
you're,

2934
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:50,900
you're saying that he didn't even know.

2935
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:51,920
He didn't allow it,

2936
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,540
that he was a part of engineering it,

2937
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:54,570
that he was a party.

2938
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:54,981
Like he,

2939
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,450
he literally said,

2940
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:57,320
this is what we're going to do.

2941
01:19:57,321 --> 01:20:00,690
We're going to take some planes and we're
going to fly one of these buildings to

2942
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:00,861
do.

2943
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:02,120
People fly those planes.

2944
01:20:02,121 --> 01:20:03,830
They trust people to fly
those plans where they were,

2945
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,660
those planes were flown by remote control,

2946
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,620
remote control.

2947
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:06,861
Again,

2948
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:08,130
like I come from an air force family

2949
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,150
that the tech,

2950
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,040
what do you think all these
drones are flying around.

2951
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,050
That's okay.

2952
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:14,180
And that technology has been,

2953
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:17,040
has been extent with
commercial airliners and in uh,

2954
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:17,820
uh,

2955
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,310
modern avionics for quite some time now.

2956
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,391
Do you,

2957
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:24,990
are you in the school that believes
that the buildings were also rigged to

2958
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:25,824
implode?

2959
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:26,880
All right.

2960
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,713
Um,

2961
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,480
I'm schizophrenia on that.

2962
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,243
Okay.

2963
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,360
Because I don't believe the planes
because the buildings to crash.

2964
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,070
But what I have said throughout
the course of my career,

2965
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:38,801
I finished right.

2966
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:42,270
And Rubicon and o four was that I wouldn't
touch it because you couldn't prove

2967
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:42,840
it in court.

2968
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,540
The book that I wrote is
legally admissible in court.

2969
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,530
There's a chain of evidence.

2970
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,290
There's no chain of
evidence with the buildings.

2971
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,440
You can't prove it in court.

2972
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,560
And um,

2973
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:50,940
I'm,

2974
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,650
I'm still that good cop on the street.

2975
01:20:52,651 --> 01:20:54,900
I'd like to see somebody
ass go to jail for this.

2976
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,420
So I went,

2977
01:20:56,421 --> 01:20:56,951
when I built,

2978
01:20:56,951 --> 01:20:57,451
in my case,

2979
01:20:57,451 --> 01:21:00,210
I built it from the framework
of can I get this into court?

2980
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,300
You can't get building
collapse into Corcoran's.

2981
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:06,270
There's no chain of custody
on the evidence from the
day of September 11th until

2982
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:06,880
now.

2983
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,061
Well,

2984
01:21:07,061 --> 01:21:10,780
I would wonder how you would possibly
prove it unless you built something just

2985
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:12,610
like it and had the same
thing happened to it.

2986
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,440
How could you really prove it?

2987
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:15,930
That's the mistake initially specked.

2988
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,350
I mean if you,

2989
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,410
if something happened like that,

2990
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:20,860
which is an unexpected event and
it caused the building to collapse,

2991
01:21:20,861 --> 01:21:21,910
it's nobody anticipated.

2992
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:25,540
I mean that obviously there
was some engineering involved
in the construction of

2993
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:26,140
those,

2994
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:26,860
those buildings.

2995
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:27,910
I'm like serious engineering.

2996
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:30,790
Well obviously that
engineering wasn't up to par,

2997
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,350
wasn't what it should've been.

2998
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:35,050
Shouldn't there be some sort of a
lawsuit about that and we shouldn't,

2999
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,370
shouldn't people be freaking out like,

3000
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:36,581
hey,

3001
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:40,270
how come you guys built this thing to
take an airplane hit and it can't take a

3002
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,080
fucking airplane?

3003
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,310
That's assuming that the,

3004
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:42,730
that,

3005
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:46,600
that the court system is honest too,

3006
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,463
which I don't.

3007
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:48,663
Right,

3008
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:49,620
but again,

3009
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,210
bill

3010
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:50,661
dispute,

3011
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:54,330
is there any other way to prove that a
plane hitting a building wouldn't take

3012
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:54,440
it?

3013
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,273
It's,

3014
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,510
that's what's called in
the intelligence business.

3015
01:21:58,511 --> 01:21:58,840
That's,

3016
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,830
that's called a red herring.

3017
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:04,000
That's called an issue of the answer to
which takes you completely away from the

3018
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:08,110
fact that I proved without
arguing building collapse
that the u s government did

3019
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,060
execute the attacks of nine 11

3020
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,500
what was the number one thing,

3021
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:12,160
if you could,

3022
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,090
if you could explain it.

3023
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:16,330
There's a lot of people that would never
believe that anybody in the position of

3024
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,070
government would ever do
any similar like that.

3025
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,450
Anything similar to that,

3026
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:24,690
especially anyone who was at the head of
a position of power in United States of

3027
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:24,701
America,

3028
01:22:24,701 --> 01:22:25,690
the greatest country in the world.

3029
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:26,770
So what does a number of for

3030
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:27,603
one piece of evidence,

3031
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:27,880
right?

3032
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,571
This was a,

3033
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:30,520
this was a piece of work that I did.

3034
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,600
Rubicon is the,

3035
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,880
I think the second or
third largest selling book,

3036
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:35,200
about nine 11 really?

3037
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:40,480
It's been a red all over the US
government can admit that I exist.

3038
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:41,320
That's a separate story.

3039
01:22:41,321 --> 01:22:42,580
We'll get there later,

3040
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:45,760
but my original work led me to,

3041
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,200
I come from an air force family.

3042
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:49,000
My father was a decorated aviator.

3043
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:54,001
He was a in the 74th fighter interceptors
squadron in Maine during the Korean

3044
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:54,041
War.

3045
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,840
Waiting for the Russians
to come over the pole.

3046
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,580
He was a radar intercept officer.

3047
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,200
So I grew up being familiar with
norad and scrambled procedures and,

3048
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:01,510
and,

3049
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:04,030
and how it worked when
the attacks took place.

3050
01:23:04,031 --> 01:23:05,050
I saw the second plane hit,

3051
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,370
said something's totally wrong.

3052
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:07,300
That could never have happened.

3053
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:09,100
That probably would have been
shot down a long time ago.

3054
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,990
That that's what it was set up for.

3055
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:11,830
But on the day,

3056
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,260
how well,

3057
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,390
how much time was,

3058
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:15,820
it wasn't less than an hour
between the two planes,

3059
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,170
a 48 minutes,

3060
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:18,004
something like that.

3061
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,240
Um,

3062
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,040
but on,

3063
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:20,351
on,

3064
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:21,550
on the day of September 11th,

3065
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:21,671
well,

3066
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:22,750
you backtrack a little bit.

3067
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,100
In May of 2001,

3068
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:27,940
George Bush gave control of all war
game exercises in the country to Dick

3069
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:28,773
Cheney.

3070
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,400
Never been heard of before.

3071
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:34,840
He also good norad scrambled procedures
were rewritten before the attacks of

3072
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:35,674
nine 11.

3073
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,120
But on the day of September,

3074
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:37,721
the 11th,

3075
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:38,441
I discovered,

3076
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:39,161
and I have the,

3077
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:39,341
uh,

3078
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:40,270
the evidence in the book,

3079
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:43,990
including an on the record email from an
air force major don areas at first air

3080
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,820
force in Tyndall air force base.

3081
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,261
And,

3082
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:47,560
uh,

3083
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,810
there were war gaming
exercises that were scheduled.

3084
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:52,210
Now normally the northeast
air defense sector,

3085
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:52,580
uh,

3086
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,520
Angie Air National Guard pilots.

3087
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:55,923
Um,

3088
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,040
there's like,

3089
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:57,340
you know,

3090
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,091
50,

3091
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:00,820
60 planes available in
all the states and needs.

3092
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:01,720
Uh,

3093
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:01,990
uh,

3094
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,470
but there were war game exercise is the
Dick Cheney has scheduled that sent like

3095
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:09,370
80% of the fighters from northeast
air defense sector to Alaska,

3096
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,560
Canada and Greenland for war game
exercises on the day of September 11th,

3097
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:16,150
a vigilant Guardian,

3098
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:16,961
vigilant warrior,

3099
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:17,794
northern.

3100
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,990
They're all in the book and I
have the records of all of them.

3101
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,370
Who made that call?

3102
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,180
Dick Cheney.

3103
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,020
Dick Cheney made the,

3104
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:23,321
okay,

3105
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:24,700
so now you have no fighters.

3106
01:24:24,701 --> 01:24:27,520
But then there was one war game exercise,

3107
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,170
uh,

3108
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:30,100
vigilant Guardian,

3109
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:35,101
I believe it was that injected 24 false
radar blips onto the screens of the

3110
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:38,200
northeast air defense sector
as the hijackings took place.

3111
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,370
Now picture you're an air traffic
controller looking at your screen,

3112
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:43,090
right?

3113
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,290
You got to hijack alert,

3114
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:44,621
boom.

3115
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:48,160
And then you got this war game exercise
and you cannot pick the High Jack Out of

3116
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:52,890
the 24 false blips and now you've only
got eight fighters left in the north at

3117
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:54,190
northeast air defense sector.

3118
01:24:54,191 --> 01:24:55,450
They have to fly in pairs.

3119
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,440
You got to have a wing man.

3120
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:57,340
How traumatic.

3121
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:57,760
Distinct.

3122
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,593
So you couldn't,

3123
01:24:59,190 --> 01:24:59,760
I'm sorry.

3124
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,593
Yeah.

3125
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,430
So that's how I piece it together.

3126
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,091
How it was done.

3127
01:25:04,091 --> 01:25:06,560
The planes were easily
flown by remote control.

3128
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:07,810
I believe in New York City,

3129
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:11,200
the remote control was operated out
of WTC seven which is why they had to

3130
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:12,490
destroy WTC seven

3131
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,340
well they had already had remote
control planes in the 60s fifties yeah.

3132
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,160
But how would you explain
like the stewardess,

3133
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:19,570
how would you explain
all the people on it?

3134
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:21,120
Cause I mean I doubt like if,

3135
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,890
if the stewards were like getting the
plane ready and they open up the cockpit

3136
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:25,360
and Teddy Ruxpin was
sitting there to be like,

3137
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:25,571
Hey,

3138
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:29,050
what the way you do it is the pilot's
no longer have control of the plane.

3139
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:29,913
That's right.

3140
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,390
The pilots are in the plane.

3141
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:34,540
They started to take off and then
they switch it off by remote control,

3142
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:37,270
the thing by computer
and then they're fucked.

3143
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,730
That these people are good for uh,

3144
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,510
for a couple of decades were proposing
that was part of operation Northwoods.

3145
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:46,990
They're proposing doing that to blow
up a jet airliner and blame it on the

3146
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:47,824
Cubans.

3147
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:50,140
They were going to say a whole bunch of
people died and they were just going to

3148
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:50,974
relocate people

3149
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,010
and then going back to my family history,

3150
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:55,870
my mother worked in the
most secret section of,

3151
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:57,250
of a army security agency.

3152
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,180
The Japanese codes.

3153
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,930
We had broken the Japanese Coats and
Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to

3154
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:03,320
attack and let it happen.

3155
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:07,200
I was dating a girl who was
working in the White House is a,

3156
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,390
I dated her a long time ago and she,

3157
01:26:09,391 --> 01:26:10,224
she worked,

3158
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,010
she had something to do with a navy
intelligence or something like that.

3159
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:14,844
I forget what it was,

3160
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:17,850
but she entered something into a computer.

3161
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,440
She uses some sort of a code word
that she wasn't supposed to use.

3162
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,870
She brought Chai,

3163
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,640
typed in little green men under
some sort of a data search.

3164
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,773
And uh,

3165
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,640
all these people came to
her and they sat her down.

3166
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,610
They brought her to her room and
asked her what the fuck she was doing.

3167
01:26:30,611 --> 01:26:33,430
And while she was looking into
that and really spoke to her,

3168
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:33,820
you know,

3169
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,810
she did it as a joke.

3170
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,040
I just thought you'd be silly.

3171
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,731
You know,

3172
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:37,151
and you know,

3173
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:38,270
she was a young girl and they,

3174
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:38,740
they're like,

3175
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,970
the fuck do you think you're doing?

3176
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:41,410
What are you looking for?

3177
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,243
Hooker?

3178
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,030
You know?

3179
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,863
Yeah.

3180
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:45,843
Terrifying.

3181
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,700
Listen,

3182
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:47,900
those guys run the world now.

3183
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:48,210
It's,

3184
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:49,670
it's amazing that it happened.

3185
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,241
I mean it's,

3186
01:26:50,241 --> 01:26:51,230
it's amazing that,

3187
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:51,681
you know,

3188
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:54,110
you look back and Teddy Roosevelt,

3189
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:55,880
you look back and Eisenhower and you know,

3190
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:56,041
you,

3191
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:58,310
you feel like that's a
real goddamn president.

3192
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,450
That's the president.

3193
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:04,451
That's the commander in chief looking
at the people with leadership and trying

3194
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:05,720
to move us forward.

3195
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,890
And that that was a guy.

3196
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:07,160
I mean,

3197
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:07,570
look when,

3198
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:07,791
when,

3199
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:08,091
when,

3200
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:11,990
when he left and he started talking
about the military industrial complex and

3201
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:13,970
warning people about the dangers.

3202
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:14,360
We,

3203
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,400
could you imagine a
speech like that today?

3204
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:16,730
No.

3205
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,140
Everyone's bought and paid for.

3206
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,130
No one would ever do that.

3207
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:23,620
Did the United States of
America was mortally wounded on,

3208
01:27:23,621 --> 01:27:25,870
on November 22nd,

3209
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:26,350
1963.

3210
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:30,310
But the coup de Gras was administered
with the assassination of Martin Luther

3211
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,800
King and Bobby Kennedy in
1968 and I was alive then.

3212
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:34,051
And I have some,

3213
01:27:34,051 --> 01:27:34,884
uh,

3214
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:38,890
some connections to Bobby Kennedy
as a result of my CIA stuff.

3215
01:27:38,891 --> 01:27:40,180
I was only a sophomore in high school,

3216
01:27:40,181 --> 01:27:42,130
but LAPD handled that.

3217
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:45,430
And I was groomed by the same people
in Lapd who had done the Bobby Kennedy

3218
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:45,611
thing.

3219
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:47,680
And Sirhan Sirhan did
not shoot Bobby Kennedy.

3220
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:48,161
I'm sorry.

3221
01:27:48,161 --> 01:27:48,730
He didn't,

3222
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,470
that was a CIA hit from start to finish.

3223
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:51,700
Jesus Christ.

3224
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:55,150
So Sirhan Sirhan was just
what a set up a patsy.

3225
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:56,680
He was over stones.

3226
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:58,130
He was hip,

3227
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:58,973
no program.

3228
01:27:59,320 --> 01:27:59,940
Uh,

3229
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,320
they were very heavy into,

3230
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,510
into research with LSD and,

3231
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:04,390
and hypnosis,

3232
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,230
uh,

3233
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,160
to produce.

3234
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,910
Uh,

3235
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:09,370
so they talked him into it
somehow or another it was LSD.

3236
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,413
Well,

3237
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,550
there were that good at that.

3238
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:11,980
Well,

3239
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:12,181
not,

3240
01:28:12,181 --> 01:28:12,301
no,

3241
01:28:12,301 --> 01:28:14,470
he wasn't blow a fuse and
just stuck shooting everyday.

3242
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,810
It's true psychological butchery,

3243
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:17,410
you know,

3244
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:17,850
uh,

3245
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:20,740
there are records still
existing from the LAPD files.

3246
01:28:20,741 --> 01:28:21,574
I have some,

3247
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:22,913
uh,

3248
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:25,560
showing the kind of stuff.

3249
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,620
He had lots of drawings and script,

3250
01:28:27,621 --> 01:28:28,780
so they planted ideas,

3251
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:32,160
but they planted in him a hypnotic
trigger and that was a one.

3252
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:33,610
What's the Manchurian candidate?

3253
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,240
Exactly.

3254
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:34,810
That's real.

3255
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,420
They can really do.

3256
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,253
Absolutely.

3257
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:38,410
It's super effective.

3258
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,960
They can just count on it and go
kill a guy was running for president,

3259
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:43,000
you would think you wouldn't
want some more on that.

3260
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,090
They murdered,

3261
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,600
they murdered Paul Wellstone,

3262
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,270
Senator Paul Wellstone,

3263
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:49,820
and I did get a big thing on
that are from the wilderness.

3264
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:50,241
Yeah.

3265
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,890
They kill people all the time.

3266
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,900
This train's death of Vince
foster is a great one.

3267
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,430
Yeah.

3268
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,330
So many of them.

3269
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah.

3270
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,770
I read that book a long time ago.

3271
01:28:58,771 --> 01:29:00,180
I don't remember too much of it,

3272
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,310
but I do like having my jaw

3273
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,140
halfway hanging off my face or half of it.

3274
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:06,870
Like what the fuck they find this guy,

3275
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:11,130
all his bloods missing got shot somewhere
else brought to this one spot guns

3276
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:11,911
still in his hand,

3277
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:15,570
which you never find when someone's self
administered gunshot wound that fucking

3278
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,051
their hands.

3279
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:17,370
Your hands go flying and the gun goes.

3280
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,300
Yeah.

3281
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,720
You don't have a fucking gun in your hand.

3282
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,050
Yeah,

3283
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:22,771
I'm sure he did.

3284
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:23,370
Right.

3285
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:23,761
Was that uh,

3286
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:23,970
when,

3287
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,500
when you saw that the Vince foster thing,

3288
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:27,570
was that like a huge absolute bullshit?

3289
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:28,140
Yeah.

3290
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,910
But then again,

3291
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,800
so many of us,

3292
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,750
I don't want to think that
the Clinton administration,

3293
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:36,000
we capable of something like that though.

3294
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:39,030
We want to think that it's only the
evil Bush administration or both.

3295
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,313
Dick Cheney,

3296
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,080
he could do it.

3297
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:41,311
Oh,

3298
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:42,144
lot bill,

3299
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,570
once you get his dick sucked.

3300
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:44,563
I was,

3301
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:45,460
I was,

3302
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,160
I was burned on bill forever.

3303
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,200
He's a drug dealer and
murder and son of a bitch.

3304
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:49,441
Oh,

3305
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:50,190
that's so scary.

3306
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:53,400
Arkansas is the only state ever in
the history of the United States.

3307
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:53,790
That was,

3308
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:57,750
that had bearer bonds cause it was
laundering so much cocaine money.

3309
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,920
Wow.

3310
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,080
What is a bearer bonds bearer bonds.

3311
01:30:01,081 --> 01:30:01,531
In other words,

3312
01:30:01,531 --> 01:30:01,980
bonds.

3313
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:05,610
They're bonds that you can walk into
any large bank in the world and redeem

3314
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,690
right there for cash.

3315
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:07,883
Whoa.

3316
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,211
Oh my God.

3317
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:09,830
So they just submit,

3318
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:12,510
they let that be legals because they were
trying to get rid of all the cocaine.

3319
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,690
Everybody was on the same side.

3320
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,210
That's an amazing story for folks who,

3321
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,270
there was a documentary on it.

3322
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:19,051
Forget the documentary,

3323
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:21,510
I believe it was an a and one of
those a and e shows Barry seal's,

3324
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,560
Mena Arkansas.

3325
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,550
Amazing story.

3326
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:26,610
And that guy became the president and
we think he's like one of the best ones

3327
01:30:26,611 --> 01:30:27,000
ever.

3328
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,833
You know,

3329
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,340
everybody wants to bring them back.

3330
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:30,480
This is a really funny story.

3331
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:30,781
One of the,

3332
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:31,561
one of the first stories,

3333
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:32,970
I broke it from the wilderness and I,

3334
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,310
and that was a newsletter I
had for eight and a half years.

3335
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:35,540
We've,

3336
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,000
uh,

3337
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,570
our final coup was a breaking
the Pat Tillman cover up.

3338
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:40,350
Uh,

3339
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,360
my computer's got smashed
for that and I got poisoned.

3340
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:44,100
But one of the early stories we broke,

3341
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:49,070
Barry seal used to own a Beechcraft king
air 200 so really cool play turbocharge

3342
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:49,831
two engines,

3343
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:50,071
you know,

3344
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:51,780
high t tail pressurized.

3345
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:51,911
It's,

3346
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:52,091
it's,

3347
01:30:52,091 --> 01:30:52,320
it's,

3348
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,340
it's a Rolls Royce plan and,

3349
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:59,400
and so I got a tip and the same plane
that Barry seal owned was George W.

3350
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:03,570
Bush has playing Texas state
plane when he was governor.

3351
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:07,140
He was using as governor
Barry Seal's airplane.

3352
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:08,580
And I broke the story in AP,

3353
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:09,780
came and picked it up from me.

3354
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,580
Holy shaders pick it up.

3355
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,630
Well,

3356
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:14,820
didn't that happen
really recently as well?

3357
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:19,821
Like a CIA jet that had been to Guantanamo
Bay at least twice crashed in Mexico

3358
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:22,920
with four tons of cocaine in it.

3359
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:23,590
We had a story.

3360
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:24,423
Yes.

3361
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:25,381
That was a true story,

3362
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:25,670
right?

3363
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:27,870
That that goes back to
Air America back to,

3364
01:31:27,871 --> 01:31:28,410
uh,

3365
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:31,210
the old flying tigers in the
Chenaults and the Coleman Tang.

3366
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:32,490
Nobody wants to believe this.

3367
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,130
What you're saying right now.

3368
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,430
Now anybody who believes it now,

3369
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,181
everybody now,

3370
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:37,650
but there's a lot of people out there,

3371
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:41,280
especially folks that I'm like maybe in
their 50s that have had like a normal

3372
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:42,570
job and you know,

3373
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:45,000
go to barbecues on the weekends
and they'd go to church.

3374
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:47,340
They don't ever want to like
think too far outside the box.

3375
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,460
What you're saying is so
fucking far outside the box,

3376
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,810
but there's a lot of
people that are going,

3377
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,500
no,

3378
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:52,921
no,

3379
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:53,161
no,

3380
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:53,401
no,

3381
01:31:53,401 --> 01:31:53,600
no.

3382
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,840
You're taking it too far.

3383
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:55,591
He didn't,

3384
01:31:55,591 --> 01:31:56,730
they didn't cause nine one,

3385
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:57,870
one proofs all there.

3386
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:58,950
What do you think is the,

3387
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,980
what's the number one

3388
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,830
piece of proof to you that Dick
Cheney caused that to happen?

3389
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,060
So the organs,

3390
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:07,000
they were all under his control
because the fact it couldn't have been

3391
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:07,631
coincidental,

3392
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:08,464
it couldn't have been,

3393
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,960
that may be someone knew that
he was doing these war games.

3394
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:14,020
So they figured that's a time to attack
because you know when they had some

3395
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:17,260
inside people in the army that he
knew of this and then they leaked the

3396
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:18,430
information and they said,

3397
01:32:18,431 --> 01:32:19,660
well we'll get you another week.

3398
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,040
Do you read against possible?

3399
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:24,340
Did you just listen to what you were
explaining and how like not credible?

3400
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:25,000
That sounded.

3401
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,780
It sounds ridiculous,

3402
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,081
but yeah,

3403
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:26,531
I agree.

3404
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:26,861
I agree.

3405
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:30,120
But I'm just giving you a what f because
I watch mission impossible five the

3406
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,750
other night.

3407
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:31,301
Oh my God.

3408
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:32,800
Pretty bad ass up to the end,

3409
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,080
but I'm willing to suspend disbelief,

3410
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:35,650
you know what I'm saying?

3411
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:35,841
Yeah.

3412
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:36,310
But I mean,

3413
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,721
is it,

3414
01:32:36,721 --> 01:32:37,810
is it possible that,

3415
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:38,980
that that happened or no,

3416
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,170
no,

3417
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:40,740
no way.

3418
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,573
No.

3419
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:42,180
Come on.

3420
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,610
You had of the 19 hijackers,

3421
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,473
uh,

3422
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,670
I think we know that five had,

3423
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:47,880
had,

3424
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,490
had received training
at US military basis.

3425
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,330
Uh,

3426
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:54,570
Mohammed Odd Dot Gunter Annex
to Maxwell Air Force Base.

3427
01:32:54,571 --> 01:32:56,070
And I have all of that in there.

3428
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,381
But hold on a second.

3429
01:32:57,381 --> 01:33:00,980
If you think that the planes
were taken over remote control,

3430
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,260
do you think that people were,

3431
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:06,920
the hijackers were actually
really on the planes and attack,

3432
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:07,680
right?

3433
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,420
The hijackers were on the planes,

3434
01:33:09,421 --> 01:33:10,230
but they weren't,

3435
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,920
they didn't know or they didn't know.

3436
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:16,500
There were 12 I call Patsy's who
were like sacrificial hijackers.

3437
01:33:16,501 --> 01:33:17,880
They were never meant to live anyway.

3438
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:18,870
They were on the plains,

3439
01:33:18,871 --> 01:33:21,540
definitely planes were flown
by remote control because,

3440
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,411
uh,

3441
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:22,681
you know,

3442
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:23,251
pilots like,

3443
01:33:23,251 --> 01:33:24,084
uh,

3444
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:24,520
I'll,

3445
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:24,991
how's me?

3446
01:33:24,991 --> 01:33:25,801
Or I'll meet our,

3447
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:27,690
whoever was supposedly flying the,

3448
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:28,460
the,

3449
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:28,700
uh,

3450
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,990
the plane of the seven into the Pentagon,

3451
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:32,460
you know,

3452
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:32,860
that's a,

3453
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,750
that's a maneuver.

3454
01:33:33,751 --> 01:33:36,180
Like one of the most experienced
pilots in the world couldn't make,

3455
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:38,920
and this was a guy who couldn't
get a multi-engine license.

3456
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:40,290
He couldn't get an instrument rating.

3457
01:33:40,291 --> 01:33:41,190
He had no hours.

3458
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,840
It's not possibly be,

3459
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:46,530
none of those maneuvers could have
been performed by any of those people.

3460
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,540
So,

3461
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,240
uh,

3462
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:48,791
and,

3463
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:52,950
and I hold some question as to whether
Mohammed auto and several of the ones

3464
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:55,020
that I and Michelle,

3465
01:33:55,021 --> 01:33:57,900
Chelsea Dusky and some
great work was done,

3466
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:58,651
uh,

3467
01:33:58,651 --> 01:33:59,640
on the flight training,

3468
01:33:59,670 --> 01:33:59,850
uh,

3469
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:01,500
by Daniel hop sicker.

3470
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:03,180
I've seen early stuff hop sick,

3471
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:08,420
did amazing work about the Venice Flying
School and Mohammed autos flying circus

3472
01:34:09,091 --> 01:34:11,640
and all real hard documentation.

3473
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:14,580
So I wasn't alone with me
and Michelle Chester Dusky,

3474
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,570
uh,

3475
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,220
Dan hop sicker and Paul Thompson,

3476
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:18,211
Thompson,

3477
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:18,391
we,

3478
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:21,540
we were the four guys who
really did 90% of the nine 11.

3479
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:25,830
Enlighten me about the argument when
it comes to the physics of actually

3480
01:34:25,831 --> 01:34:26,700
following a plane.

3481
01:34:26,701 --> 01:34:30,660
That what I had read that it's
much more difficult to do,

3482
01:34:30,661 --> 01:34:34,410
like physically difficult to do what
they're doing by steering it than it is to

3483
01:34:34,411 --> 01:34:34,981
do it by remote.

3484
01:34:34,981 --> 01:34:35,814
Well control

3485
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:36,701
what they were doing.

3486
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:40,210
It's physically hard to do because of
the g force of the turn and everything.

3487
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:40,601
Well,

3488
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:44,900
and it's also the calculation that you
have to understand it when you're flying

3489
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:45,791
a seven,

3490
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:46,001
five,

3491
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:46,271
seven,

3492
01:34:46,271 --> 01:34:46,381
six,

3493
01:34:46,381 --> 01:34:46,601
seven,

3494
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:46,841
six,

3495
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:47,221
seven,

3496
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:51,580
eight and you're coming out of
a turn on onto the north tower,

3497
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:51,940
right?

3498
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,560
You got to know what
the fuck you're doing.

3499
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:55,570
You gotta be good at that Shit.

3500
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:59,780
That's like a formula race
driver driving through a chicane,

3501
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,100
holding the perfect line.

3502
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:01,491
Yeah.

3503
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:02,271
I was thinking that too.

3504
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:02,691
Like what's the,

3505
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:04,760
keep that fucking plane
from spinning upside down.

3506
01:35:04,761 --> 01:35:07,820
Now this asshole is spinning it
around in a circle like that.

3507
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:09,140
Well he knows how to do that with a jet.

3508
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:09,620
No,

3509
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,000
a giant jumbo jet.

3510
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,440
These guys couldn't fly.

3511
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:14,900
They weren't licensed to
fly a regular old Cessna.

3512
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,730
So how many people know about it?

3513
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:17,211
All together.

3514
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,260
If you had to guess,

3515
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:18,681
if you said,

3516
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:18,951
okay,

3517
01:35:18,951 --> 01:35:20,390
there's Dick Cheney and he's,

3518
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:24,140
he's the guy that you perceive as being
the mastermind and then there's a bunch

3519
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:28,250
of people also have to be in on it
because they have to rig these planes with

3520
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:30,450
remote control capability
and they have to,

3521
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,303
that's already there.

3522
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:33,380
Order NATO to stand down.

3523
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:33,591
You know,

3524
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:34,041
they have to,

3525
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:36,050
they have to do all these different
things that they did that day.

3526
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:36,520
How many,

3527
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,353
well,

3528
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:39,310
it's compartmentalized intelligence.

3529
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,260
Now remember I come from a spoke family.

3530
01:35:41,261 --> 01:35:43,750
So let's say you're making an atom bomb,

3531
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,170
right?

3532
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:45,850
So some guy in Oak Ridge,

3533
01:35:45,851 --> 01:35:48,400
Tennessee might be doing
something to enrich uranium.

3534
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:53,670
Some guy someplace else might be making
part of a super hard steel casing to

3535
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,980
contain the blast for one of the bombs.

3536
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:58,480
Somebody else may be working on it.

3537
01:35:58,690 --> 01:36:00,970
Nobody knows what the
finished product looks like,

3538
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:01,953
right?

3539
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,090
That has to be a few at the top.

3540
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,140
How many people do you think?

3541
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:05,983
No,

3542
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:11,320
I'm guessing a 30 40 50

3543
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,910
that's terrifying.

3544
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:16,900
It's terrifying that 40 or 50 people
would be willing to do that and that they

3545
01:36:16,901 --> 01:36:19,720
could all find each other
and form a gang and you know,

3546
01:36:19,721 --> 01:36:19,821
and,

3547
01:36:19,821 --> 01:36:23,290
and actually make something like this
happen and they just hang out at NASA all

3548
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:24,124
the time.

3549
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,680
Not Nasa or,

3550
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:26,380
uh,

3551
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:28,510
some Army Pentagon type place.

3552
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,730
Now I'm soundstage.

3553
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,810
Do you think that the thing that hit
the Pentagon was a jet or are you okay?

3554
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,880
Was it a missile?

3555
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:36,110
No,

3556
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:36,450
it was,

3557
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:37,283
it was an airplane.

3558
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:38,200
It was an airport.

3559
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:38,530
Okay.

3560
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,300
Again,

3561
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:40,000
I was a cop.

3562
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,220
Right,

3563
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:40,510
right.

3564
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:43,480
And so what I was another
remote control airplane,

3565
01:36:43,481 --> 01:36:43,830
you believe?

3566
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:44,440
No.

3567
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:44,850
Yes,

3568
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:45,250
yes,

3569
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,083
definitely.

3570
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,100
That's why I was able to
do something so crazy.

3571
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:52,390
That was a 270 degree loop turn coming in.

3572
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:55,900
What the engine cowlings
probably five feet off the deck.

3573
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:57,790
A human pilot can't do that.

3574
01:36:57,970 --> 01:36:59,470
Really remote control can,

3575
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:00,540
but here's

3576
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,341
because they've had to be,

3577
01:37:01,341 --> 01:37:01,671
I'm sorry,

3578
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:04,280
but they've had people actually
try to attempt that in uh,

3579
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:04,660
uh,

3580
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:07,450
in an aviation simulator and
they weren't able to do well.

3581
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:12,130
Is it a physical issue on
understand what it is skilled?

3582
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:15,770
You'd have to be just some bad
ass fucking race car driver,

3583
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,613
motherfucker,

3584
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:20,330
who knows how to get around
the Norberg ring in seven 19.

3585
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:20,690
Right?

3586
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,231
Is that what it is,

3587
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:21,640
Liz?

3588
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,473
Yes.

3589
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:22,950
Uh,

3590
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:26,040
and you must've practiced
that one turn 10,000 times,

3591
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:26,883
right?

3592
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,170
You practice moves and
Marshall Your sleep.

3593
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,050
How often do you work a cotton before you,

3594
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:31,690
you know?

3595
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:32,050
Okay,

3596
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:36,100
so the Pentagon sits in a bowl
when I was born in Washington DC.

3597
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:36,610
I know it.

3598
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:37,210
Okay.

3599
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:42,160
And three 95 runs around the Pentagon
and you can look right down and you see

3600
01:37:42,161 --> 01:37:43,510
the whole Pentagon sitting down there.

3601
01:37:43,511 --> 01:37:43,871
It's like,

3602
01:37:43,871 --> 01:37:44,091
it's,

3603
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:44,480
it's like,

3604
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:44,980
uh,

3605
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:45,820
sitting in the Roosevelt.

3606
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:46,863
Okay.

3607
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:47,530
Now,

3608
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:47,890
um,

3609
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:52,890
there were more than 400 witnesses
on I three 95 truck drivers,

3610
01:37:53,651 --> 01:37:54,610
cab drivers,

3611
01:37:54,611 --> 01:37:55,920
soccer moms,

3612
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,053
you name it.

3613
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,560
They all saw an airplane hit the
Pentagon and they would testify in court.

3614
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:02,530
That's,

3615
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:03,510
that's what they saw.

3616
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,240
So regardless of what anybody thinks,

3617
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:07,170
I'm not going to argue.

3618
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:08,004
The point is,

3619
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,180
the fact is,

3620
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:11,490
is to try the case in court
and to Hang Dick Cheney,

3621
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:14,940
which I can do without
going down that side alley.

3622
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:15,990
It's not important to me.

3623
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:16,620
Uh,

3624
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,330
but I do think,

3625
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:18,010
uh,

3626
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:18,540
uh,

3627
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,950
a jet plane hit the Pentagon.

3628
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,191
Well,

3629
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:21,500
they released that footage,

3630
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:25,460
but it was like stop action was only a
few frames and you can't really clearly

3631
01:38:25,461 --> 01:38:26,710
make out what the hell it is.

3632
01:38:26,711 --> 01:38:27,200
Yeah.

3633
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,250
Why do you think they did that?

3634
01:38:28,251 --> 01:38:31,140
Why don't they release like
some clear footage in the,

3635
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,960
you don't want people
using it for propaganda?

3636
01:38:32,961 --> 01:38:33,260
I mean,

3637
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,910
in the intelligence business,

3638
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:35,690
um,

3639
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:38,630
there's a program called
cointelpro and many other,

3640
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:39,920
uh,

3641
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,850
programs that,

3642
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:41,690
uh,

3643
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:46,690
have been used and developed by CIA in
Army intelligence on the creation of

3644
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:50,060
false legends and false stories.

3645
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,320
And um,

3646
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:54,500
one of the biggest deals in
the intelligence trade is to,

3647
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:54,860
uh,

3648
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,940
do a dangle dangle a in,

3649
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,270
let's say I'm a spy.

3650
01:38:59,570 --> 01:39:04,570
A dangle would be like a five foot 10
woman right out of my ultimate sexual

3651
01:39:04,581 --> 01:39:05,181
fantasy,

3652
01:39:05,181 --> 01:39:05,451
you know,

3653
01:39:05,451 --> 01:39:05,631
blah,

3654
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:05,840
blah.

3655
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,673
That's a dangle.

3656
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:09,380
But sometimes a dangled comes
in the form of information.

3657
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,620
Sometimes a dangle comes in the form of
attempting lead that looks like it's got

3658
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:14,720
to really take you somewhere.

3659
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:15,381
Now,

3660
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:16,430
disinformation,

3661
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:19,100
in order to be effective
has to be 90% true.

3662
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,350
Otherwise you won't swallow it.

3663
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:23,120
You won't buy it.

3664
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,490
So there's a poison pill that they put in,

3665
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,950
you swallow the 10% poison pill,

3666
01:39:27,951 --> 01:39:30,020
and then if you ever get enough traction,

3667
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,840
they activate the poison and kill you.

3668
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,290
So I do believe a plane
hit the Pentagon and,

3669
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,221
and I,

3670
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,510
and what we saw,

3671
01:39:38,511 --> 01:39:41,750
we never saw a jetliner
hit in any of those films.

3672
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:42,501
Okay.

3673
01:39:42,501 --> 01:39:43,920
I think that was bait to,

3674
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:44,220
you know,

3675
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,520
to see if that action got enough traction.

3676
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,180
Then at some point they would come up
and actually show you the video of a

3677
01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:53,570
jetliner hitting and all of a sudden
everything else you've bought into as a

3678
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,760
result is discredited.

3679
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:57,050
He looks preposterous.

3680
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:57,973
Exactly.

3681
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:58,431
Yeah.

3682
01:39:58,431 --> 01:39:59,690
I've always thought that was fascinating.

3683
01:39:59,691 --> 01:40:01,880
Like when you read someone's
stories and you know,

3684
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,130
you read something like that guy,

3685
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:05,870
a behold a pale horse guy,

3686
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:07,940
William Cooper's Braille Cooper.

3687
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:08,510
Well,

3688
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,590
what was that guy's deal?

3689
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,030
Um,

3690
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:11,540
because he would,

3691
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,380
he was one of those guys,

3692
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:13,730
let me just say before you even tell me,

3693
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:16,400
he was one of those guys that I
would read his stuff and I'll go,

3694
01:40:16,401 --> 01:40:17,121
well that makes sense.

3695
01:40:17,121 --> 01:40:17,954
That makes sense.

3696
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:18,411
Oh,

3697
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:19,460
he's fucking crazy.

3698
01:40:19,461 --> 01:40:20,294
Exactly.

3699
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,300
It was like that was the,

3700
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:21,501
the,

3701
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:21,740
the,

3702
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,700
the exact progression.

3703
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:23,840
And so that made me think,

3704
01:40:23,841 --> 01:40:25,730
well what if this guy is
like working for them?

3705
01:40:25,731 --> 01:40:29,270
Like making everything else look retarded
by coming up with this one idea that

3706
01:40:29,271 --> 01:40:33,440
he tosses in about bases on the moon
where they're processing fucking compound

3707
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:35,060
race tires for the corvette team.

3708
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:35,721
You know what I mean?

3709
01:40:35,721 --> 01:40:36,170
To me it's like,

3710
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:36,311
yeah,

3711
01:40:36,311 --> 01:40:36,711
he was three.

3712
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:38,150
He would say something
like that and you're like,

3713
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,860
the fuck is this guy talking about,

3714
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,853
you know,

3715
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,280
there are lots of people like that and
this is why I've walked a completely

3716
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:47,580
different path because I had to walk
a path of complete credibility for 35

3717
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:48,414
years.

3718
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,220
So

3719
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:53,980
you think there's people that are embedded
in that path that are there just to

3720
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,990
say stupid shit like this credit things?

3721
01:40:55,991 --> 01:40:56,351
Yes.

3722
01:40:56,351 --> 01:41:01,351
But I also think there are some people
who who are feel moved to tell the truth

3723
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:02,860
cause they're outraged.

3724
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,723
That's you.

3725
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,450
Yes.

3726
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:05,820
But those people would,

3727
01:41:05,821 --> 01:41:06,654
would all say,

3728
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:11,500
I'll also say something that they
know tells to the powers that be,

3729
01:41:11,501 --> 01:41:12,550
that they aren't a threat.

3730
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,200
Well what's really funny is,

3731
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:15,460
oh the lot of you guys,

3732
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:18,600
and I don't want to lump anybody
into a category and then I'm,

3733
01:41:18,601 --> 01:41:22,660
I'm certainly not putting you in with
anybody else because I love your work,

3734
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:26,500
but a lot of you guys
think that it's not you,

3735
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:26,891
not you,

3736
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:29,410
but people along those lines
or calling out the government.

3737
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:33,400
They think that there are people out
there that are shills like other guys that

3738
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:34,031
are successful,

3739
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,050
like their competition.

3740
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,030
Oh that motherfucker.

3741
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:36,431
He's a,

3742
01:41:36,431 --> 01:41:37,570
he's a CIA.

3743
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:38,591
He's an operative.

3744
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:39,700
Well I wouldn't say CIA,

3745
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:42,460
but there are definite
people out here for sure.

3746
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,800
Absolutely right.

3747
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:44,350
How many,

3748
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:47,440
when you see like a guy on
TV and you see him talking,

3749
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:48,081
like how,

3750
01:41:48,081 --> 01:41:50,980
how much time do you give
him before you start?

3751
01:41:50,981 --> 01:41:55,570
Like wondering if this guy is a plant
while and you see any sort of a leader in

3752
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:55,721
any,

3753
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:57,220
any sort of a movement,

3754
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,660
how much time when you watch them,

3755
01:41:58,661 --> 01:41:59,650
how much time do you like?

3756
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:00,490
Well,

3757
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,440
my rule of thumb is,

3758
01:42:01,441 --> 01:42:04,690
is that they wouldn't be on TV
unless they were already controlled.

3759
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:05,081
Anyway,

3760
01:42:05,081 --> 01:42:07,090
that's just the real
simple way to look at it.

3761
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:07,480
You don't,

3762
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:08,830
you don't get the airtime.

3763
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:09,251
See,

3764
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:10,500
I'm invisible to,

3765
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,334
to the,

3766
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,550
to the u s government.

3767
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,480
I made it,

3768
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:14,290
uh,

3769
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:14,790
uh,

3770
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:17,290
the video that's had some good
play called say my fucking name.

3771
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:17,900
It's up on you.

3772
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:18,733
I saw that.

3773
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:19,530
That's crazy.

3774
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:19,900
You know,

3775
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:20,711
and it's fascinating.

3776
01:42:20,711 --> 01:42:21,730
I've done all his shit.

3777
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,270
Right.

3778
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:23,890
And it sounded a bit like a jilted lover.

3779
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:24,430
Thank you.

3780
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:25,263
But if,

3781
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:25,961
you know what I mean?

3782
01:42:25,961 --> 01:42:27,210
Like it was a check that,

3783
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,990
but I was also everybody
in the rolling stones,

3784
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:29,830
we are pissed off.

3785
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,710
Yeah,

3786
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,330
I'm sure.

3787
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:31,601
Yeah.

3788
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:31,790
I mean,

3789
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:34,230
it makes sense because I've
been saying all this shit and,

3790
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:38,230
and like the US government spent a
State Department has spent $3 million

3791
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:41,350
refuting every other
nine 11 theory out there,

3792
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,041
but not yours.

3793
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:43,300
She couldn't mention my name.

3794
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:47,800
So does it feel like they don't have to
address you because you don't have as

3795
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:51,960
much mainstream exposure is say you
know any of these other guys that you,

3796
01:42:51,961 --> 01:42:52,181
you know,

3797
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:52,900
you know what I mean?

3798
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,800
Is that what it is?

3799
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:54,280
Wait a minute.

3800
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:54,760
No,

3801
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,570
no.

3802
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:55,990
Uh,

3803
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:58,600
I was in this really successful
movie called collapse.

3804
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:00,220
It's been seen all over the world.

3805
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,300
That's obviously [inaudible]
copies of that APP.

3806
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:06,850
But you're obviously not on
the cspan shows or CNN shows.

3807
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:08,410
You're not being interviewed all the time.

3808
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:09,270
I've been blacklisted.

3809
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:09,550
Right.

3810
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:10,480
But why is that?

3811
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:15,110
If all is he just cause they can't
control you just say 100% true.

3812
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,630
They can't shut me down.

3813
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:19,290
I've left a record of 3 million words in,

3814
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:20,021
in Rubicon,

3815
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:21,520
there's a thousand footnotes.

3816
01:43:21,521 --> 01:43:22,780
So no matter how many books,

3817
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:23,441
this cells,

3818
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:25,090
no matter how many people watch,

3819
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:25,924
collapse,

3820
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,520
they'll keep you off those other shows.

3821
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:28,643
So there's absolutely,

3822
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:32,650
and that plays out real well with
native American spirituality,

3823
01:43:32,651 --> 01:43:33,520
which was something that,

3824
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:33,971
that,

3825
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:34,150
uh,

3826
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:36,220
that I've come to understand
and really appreciate it.

3827
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:37,143
I'm deeper into it.

3828
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:37,871
And,

3829
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:38,320
uh,

3830
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,470
there's different kinds of medicine
attributed to different kinds of animals.

3831
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:42,581
Bear medicine.

3832
01:43:42,581 --> 01:43:44,800
Fox medicine has been
very powerful for me.

3833
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:47,260
Is that what is one that
makes your penis hard?

3834
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:49,010
Is that tiger medicine that could,

3835
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,860
didn't know that's a squab medicine.

3836
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,883
Squamish.

3837
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:57,130
So what do you mean by like
bear medicine and Fox medicine?

3838
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:58,071
It's very important.

3839
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:00,620
I've had a couple of very
powerful encounters with foxes,

3840
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:04,160
Fox medicine in native American
spirituality and makes you invisible.

3841
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:05,331
In other words,

3842
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:07,290
I am invisible to the powers that

3843
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:08,560
do you work for the government?

3844
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:09,940
Because this is what's going on here.

3845
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,330
No,

3846
01:44:10,330 --> 01:44:10,511
no,

3847
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:10,961
I'm just kidding.

3848
01:44:10,961 --> 01:44:11,131
Yeah,

3849
01:44:11,131 --> 01:44:11,964
I know.

3850
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:15,210
But you're saying crazy stuff now you're
saying crazy stuffs about Fox being

3851
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:15,840
invisible.

3852
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:16,360
And so if Pete,

3853
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,970
if somebody thought that you
were a disinformation agent,

3854
01:44:18,971 --> 01:44:19,301
they would say,

3855
01:44:19,301 --> 01:44:19,511
oh,

3856
01:44:19,511 --> 01:44:20,470
here's the evidence.

3857
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,770
He says all this brilliant shit.

3858
01:44:21,771 --> 01:44:23,590
And then he starts talking
about foxes being invisible.

3859
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:23,771
No,

3860
01:44:23,771 --> 01:44:24,910
I didn't say Fox is invisible.

3861
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:27,003
I'm invisible.

3862
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:27,401
Oh.

3863
01:44:27,401 --> 01:44:28,390
And I'm invisible

3864
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:30,590
to mainstream media.

3865
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:31,220
Right.

3866
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,470
They all read me that they've all read.

3867
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,400
They all know who I am.

3868
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:35,480
They just can't say my name.

3869
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:37,820
And that made me mad.

3870
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:42,080
ButW I made that tape it because I was
so pissed off that everything was falling

3871
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:46,940
apart and nobody was talking about
how criminal and how fucked up.

3872
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:50,060
This wasn't a whole generation of
people are talking about it though,

3873
01:44:50,061 --> 01:44:50,661
don't you think?

3874
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:52,580
I mean at this point a lot
of people were talking,

3875
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:53,900
but if they say my name,

3876
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,740
it's game over because then they
have to see the body of work.

3877
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:58,660
But,

3878
01:44:58,660 --> 01:44:59,071
but what you,

3879
01:44:59,071 --> 01:45:03,550
so you saying that all these people that
are in any position of power that are,

3880
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:03,911
you know,

3881
01:45:03,911 --> 01:45:05,380
saying the sky is falling,

3882
01:45:05,381 --> 01:45:06,131
it's all falling apart,

3883
01:45:06,131 --> 01:45:07,600
but whatever you do don't
talk about like a rubric.

3884
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,070
Don't give him the mic.

3885
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:11,371
Why did they,

3886
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:11,511
why,

3887
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:11,680
why?

3888
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,511
It doesn't make any sense.

3889
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:14,580
You seem like the perfect
person to talk about this stuff,

3890
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,210
but someone has to be an expert.

3891
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:16,830
I'm good at.

3892
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:17,650
But then I'm gonna

3893
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:19,180
proved that CNN,

3894
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,810
that ABC,

3895
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:25,450
that all the corporate owned media
is absolutely criminally corrupt and

3896
01:45:25,451 --> 01:45:29,730
complicit and all the economic criminality
that's been taking place and covering

3897
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,150
up all these other crimes.

3898
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:35,560
Every major media outlet in this country
trades it's shares on Wall Street and

3899
01:45:35,561 --> 01:45:37,810
they're all part of the
same economic paradigm.

3900
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,180
And they can't afford to see me.

3901
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:41,620
And it's not just me.

3902
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:43,570
I mean all the people who did peak oil,

3903
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:43,741
who'd,

3904
01:45:43,741 --> 01:45:43,920
who'd,

3905
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,890
who've done the work on,

3906
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:45,993
you know,

3907
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:49,030
they see me because I give
credit to everybody else.

3908
01:45:49,031 --> 01:45:51,790
They got to see all this other
body of work that they've ignored.

3909
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:52,720
But

3910
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,000
so if the cop talked to you
about any of this stuff,

3911
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:56,590
then it opens up the flood gates,

3912
01:45:56,591 --> 01:45:58,330
the CIA selling drugs and all this.

3913
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:58,751
So they're like,

3914
01:45:58,751 --> 01:45:59,531
shut the fuck up.

3915
01:45:59,531 --> 01:46:00,710
Michael Roberts not coming on the show.

3916
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,140
Exactly.

3917
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:01,360
You know,

3918
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,710
someone intern comes up again.

3919
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:03,171
There's a kind,

3920
01:46:03,171 --> 01:46:04,070
he's name's Michael Rupert.

3921
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:04,451
He's ringing,

3922
01:46:04,451 --> 01:46:05,051
articulate.

3923
01:46:05,051 --> 01:46:05,440
He's like,

3924
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,280
he's The star of that movie.

3925
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:06,581
Collapse.

3926
01:46:06,581 --> 01:46:07,391
Get the fuck out of here.

3927
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:08,224
Get Out of my office.

3928
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:08,590
No,

3929
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:08,741
no,

3930
01:46:08,741 --> 01:46:09,820
he can't get on the tonight show.

3931
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:10,391
Well,

3932
01:46:10,391 --> 01:46:11,560
when at what shows have you been on?

3933
01:46:11,561 --> 01:46:13,600
Who has let you on Bill
Maher ever had yon?

3934
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,420
No,

3935
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:14,860
no.

3936
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:15,700
You gotta be on that Shit.

3937
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:17,020
You know,

3938
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:18,490
I would love it if he had the balls.

3939
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,600
I don't think he has the ball.

3940
01:46:19,601 --> 01:46:20,710
He has the balls.

3941
01:46:20,711 --> 01:46:21,491
That's crazy.

3942
01:46:21,491 --> 01:46:22,420
You don't think Bill Maher,

3943
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,101
he didn't build.

3944
01:46:23,101 --> 01:46:24,040
Marta's can give a fuck.

3945
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,460
He's got the balls.

3946
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,141
Hbo Rice.

3947
01:46:26,141 --> 01:46:26,974
Just pay checks.

3948
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:27,671
Yeah,

3949
01:46:27,671 --> 01:46:29,200
but you think that
they're going to really,

3950
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:29,910
he says,

3951
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:32,770
well as feature versus more
shit on that show time.

3952
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,150
Yeah.

3953
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:34,990
And,

3954
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:36,370
and that's like a,

3955
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:37,470
one of my other [inaudible] their favorite

3956
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:38,011
whips out there.

3957
01:46:38,011 --> 01:46:38,844
Amy Goodman,

3958
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,020
democracy too late.

3959
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:40,211
She,

3960
01:46:40,211 --> 01:46:40,370
she,

3961
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,780
she talks about all
these great issues that,

3962
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:43,141
that,

3963
01:46:43,141 --> 01:46:44,520
that don't change anything.

3964
01:46:44,521 --> 01:46:45,540
She's like a gatekeeper.

3965
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:47,730
And she syndicated by Rupert Murdoch.

3966
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,050
Do you think she works for the government?

3967
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:49,610
Well,

3968
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,443
I,

3969
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:50,821
let's,

3970
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:51,900
let's rephrase that.

3971
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,090
I think she knows who butters their bread.

3972
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:56,763
So it's fucked.

3973
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,600
But the Internet is the only hope.

3974
01:46:58,601 --> 01:46:59,170
Right.

3975
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:01,930
But now that there's
stuff like Sopa right.

3976
01:47:01,931 --> 01:47:04,180
Is it is the stop online piracy act.

3977
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:08,770
A lot of people who are paranoid
about this see this as a back door to

3978
01:47:08,771 --> 01:47:09,491
passively,

3979
01:47:09,491 --> 01:47:09,701
you know,

3980
01:47:09,701 --> 01:47:12,190
this is the beginning of
the regulating the internet.

3981
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:13,501
Trust me,

3982
01:47:13,501 --> 01:47:15,210
I got a chapter called on promise,

3983
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,560
Piero Mis software,

3984
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:17,070
uh,

3985
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:17,481
in,

3986
01:47:17,481 --> 01:47:18,170
in that book,

3987
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:20,700
which talks about some of the
stuff that government can do.

3988
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:24,090
The government can now anything
that they want to do right now.

3989
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:28,880
Sopa doesn't scare me enough cause sopas
just kind of legalizing something that

3990
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:29,160
I are,

3991
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,260
that we know they're already doing anyway.

3992
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:31,740
Right.

3993
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:33,930
I mean we've been under severe hacking,

3994
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:34,230
uh,

3995
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:34,580
at,

3996
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:38,550
at collapsed net and we got a great
team of it specialists and we're,

3997
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:41,390
we're talking coordinated d dos,

3998
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:41,730
you know,

3999
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:42,511
new servers,

4000
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:42,781
bloom,

4001
01:47:42,781 --> 01:47:42,961
boom,

4002
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:43,320
boom.

4003
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,400
Getting into our emails,

4004
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:45,600
shutting us out of this shutting down.

4005
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:50,250
They even go so far as to change like
the number of visitors we have on the

4006
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:53,010
website to make it look like
nobody's looking at our website.

4007
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:54,290
They can go backwards.

4008
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:55,523
It's stupid.

4009
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,610
Um,

4010
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:57,720
they're doing all that now.

4011
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:58,750
They've done it to occupy me.

4012
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,810
And of course we see
anonymous doing that back.

4013
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:01,950
So that happens.

4014
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:06,180
But so I'm not so much worried about Sopa
because I know the bathrooms are going

4015
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:06,810
to do that.

4016
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,930
So that to you is just like sort of
confirming something that has already been

4017
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:10,471
in play.

4018
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:11,400
It means nothing.

4019
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,300
Nothing's changed.

4020
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:12,661
Well,

4021
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:13,950
it was already bought and sold.

4022
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:19,050
They're going to go to another degree
of difficulty or another level of

4023
01:48:19,151 --> 01:48:20,140
intensity with that.

4024
01:48:20,141 --> 01:48:20,440
But,

4025
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,180
but the detention,

4026
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:22,960
uh,

4027
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,160
provisions in the NDA totally
violate habeas corpus.

4028
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:28,143
Magna Carta,

4029
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,470
US Constitution.

4030
01:48:29,471 --> 01:48:30,790
That's fundamental.

4031
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:31,841
And,

4032
01:48:31,841 --> 01:48:33,610
and if that bill gets signed,

4033
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:36,070
the United States of
America no longer exists.

4034
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,421
Nicholas a thing to,

4035
01:48:37,421 --> 01:48:40,770
things have gotten so bad that they
think they need to pass that look.

4036
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:40,961
Right.

4037
01:48:40,961 --> 01:48:41,800
It's not that bad.

4038
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:43,330
So you've got a few people protesting.

4039
01:48:43,331 --> 01:48:44,020
Yeah.

4040
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:44,711
It's really,

4041
01:48:44,711 --> 01:48:46,960
you don't need to have the
military and the fucking streets.

4042
01:48:46,961 --> 01:48:47,320
All right.

4043
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:47,771
It's really,

4044
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,910
it's not that big a deal.

4045
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:50,310
But what the problem is,

4046
01:48:50,311 --> 01:48:51,580
is they're looking at the next step.

4047
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:53,140
They're saying this is unpredicted.

4048
01:48:53,141 --> 01:48:54,580
They never thought that
they would see this.

4049
01:48:54,581 --> 01:48:57,250
They never thought they would see
hundreds of thousands of people,

4050
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,143
you know,

4051
01:48:58,450 --> 01:49:00,010
ranting in the streets,

4052
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,210
chanting in the streets,

4053
01:49:01,211 --> 01:49:01,930
holding signs,

4054
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,650
wandering around,

4055
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:05,470
and then camping out like
what the fuck is going on?

4056
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:08,200
So this is why they showed their hand.

4057
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:10,570
But they have also been very aware,

4058
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:10,881
Joe,

4059
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:13,370
that there are,

4060
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,583
uh,

4061
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:16,881
50,

4062
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:21,440
60 million hardcore unemployed homeless
people and the number is growing.

4063
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:23,150
They're aware that,

4064
01:49:23,151 --> 01:49:23,570
uh,

4065
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:24,250
now,

4066
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:24,350
uh,

4067
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:28,820
it's a one in two of the people in this
country can be classified under the

4068
01:49:28,821 --> 01:49:29,600
poverty line.

4069
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,190
Half of the population,

4070
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:34,580
one in every six Americans
is on food stamps.

4071
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:36,350
People are starving,

4072
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,191
they're freezing,

4073
01:49:37,191 --> 01:49:38,210
they've lost their jobs,

4074
01:49:38,211 --> 01:49:39,110
they've lost their money.

4075
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:41,150
They've known this was
going to be coming too.

4076
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:43,430
But I think there's
another reason for this,

4077
01:49:43,431 --> 01:49:43,551
uh,

4078
01:49:43,551 --> 01:49:47,410
with the planned attack on Iran is,

4079
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,010
is so that

4080
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,670
they can do a round up of Arab Americans
like they did with the Japanese right

4081
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:53,650
after World War II and put them in camps.

4082
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,810
Jesus Christ.

4083
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,030
So you think that the ultimate goal is
to start locking giant groups of people

4084
01:50:01,031 --> 01:50:01,960
up in Fema camps?

4085
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:02,770
No.

4086
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:06,880
And this is where I did I disagree
strongly with some people.

4087
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:07,790
Alex Jones.

4088
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:08,060
Oh,

4089
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:08,760
absolutely.

4090
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:09,310
Yeah.

4091
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:10,143
Uh,

4092
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:14,140
it takes money to feed people.

4093
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,880
You have to pay the guards,

4094
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:17,530
you have to build the camps,

4095
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:18,940
you have to put gasoline,

4096
01:50:18,941 --> 01:50:20,410
you have to heat for the people.

4097
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:25,770
And human industrial civilization is
collapsing if you think to what the powers

4098
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:26,471
that be,

4099
01:50:26,471 --> 01:50:28,720
the money people did during
the Great Depression,

4100
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:30,790
they didn't put all the homeless,

4101
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:31,690
starving and camps.

4102
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:32,320
No,

4103
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,520
they let them drag themselves across
the country from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl,

4104
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:37,351
the California.

4105
01:50:37,351 --> 01:50:38,800
And if they starved along the way,

4106
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,660
the government wasn't paying a penny.

4107
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:41,530
It costs nothing.

4108
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:45,370
It weeded out the population
and the strongest made it
to California to work for

4109
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:46,204
slave wages.

4110
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,150
That's the evil of the beast.

4111
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:50,050
They will have camps,

4112
01:50:50,051 --> 01:50:50,291
you know,

4113
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:54,430
for people like me or if there's major
civil unrest in some cities or something

4114
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:54,821
like that,

4115
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:55,960
but no longterm,

4116
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,420
because the resources
don't exist to do that.

4117
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,890
So the idea is this,

4118
01:50:59,891 --> 01:51:00,611
kill everybody.

4119
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:02,200
Then let them starve.

4120
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:03,071
Let Them Starve,

4121
01:51:03,071 --> 01:51:03,970
starve to death.

4122
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:08,950
Let him catch disease or so in
turn them and then make them sick.

4123
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,040
I wouldn't go that far.

4124
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,371
No,

4125
01:51:12,371 --> 01:51:12,840
I mean,

4126
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,580
uh,

4127
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:15,910
I mean ultimately if they know
that that's what's got to go down,

4128
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:16,930
why not just,

4129
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:17,500
and everybody,

4130
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,820
well that was Diana,

4131
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:19,421
Jim Jones,

4132
01:51:19,421 --> 01:51:19,871
everybody.

4133
01:51:19,871 --> 01:51:20,081
Yeah,

4134
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:20,321
no,

4135
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:20,680
that,

4136
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,001
that,

4137
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:23,730
that was a Nazi plan and that didn't work.

4138
01:51:23,731 --> 01:51:26,410
The fascism has become much
more sophisticated since then.

4139
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:27,531
So what,

4140
01:51:27,531 --> 01:51:27,711
what,

4141
01:51:27,711 --> 01:51:30,460
what are the other options when
it's completely hit the fan?

4142
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:33,010
What are the other options to get
rid of a giant group of people?

4143
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,113
You let,

4144
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:36,190
you let the cities go,

4145
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:37,600
uh,

4146
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,350
you let the people,

4147
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:40,300
it's happening all over
the world right now.

4148
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:42,490
And you think that's
unquestionably a plan.

4149
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,780
Sure.

4150
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,140
Who,

4151
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,350
who,

4152
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,540
who's planning to have all
these cities fall apart?

4153
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:46,670
No.

4154
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:47,020
Well,

4155
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:47,853
the bankers,

4156
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:48,640
again,

4157
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:53,640
nobody plans for city x or citywide a
fall apart that way on a day just engineer

4158
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:56,420
corruption into the systems
to the point where they,

4159
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,930
and you believe it's engineered well,

4160
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,580
is it just greed and it is a,

4161
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:02,080
uh,

4162
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,250
I mean that's what I'm confused about.

4163
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,590
It collapses a fait accompli.

4164
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:07,930
That's a simple matter
of what does that mean?

4165
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,833
Well,

4166
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:10,510
it's a done deal.

4167
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,810
Au fait accompli limit of
what language is that French?

4168
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:16,580
Why is it so cool when he's quote
something and we could just say,

4169
01:52:16,581 --> 01:52:19,060
well faith it is right.

4170
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:20,110
That's a good way to get laid.

4171
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:20,720
Sorry.

4172
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,190
Um,

4173
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:24,580
so the resource limitations govern.

4174
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,300
Collapse,

4175
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:25,471
right.

4176
01:52:25,471 --> 01:52:26,170
Okay.

4177
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:27,250
6 billion people.

4178
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,750
So because of the way society is set up,

4179
01:52:28,751 --> 01:52:31,110
there's no way all going to
collapse and wear out anyway.

4180
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,680
We need a resource based society.

4181
01:52:32,681 --> 01:52:33,760
We can't have the derivatives,

4182
01:52:33,761 --> 01:52:36,640
we can't have this nonsense economy
and we can't have infinite growth.

4183
01:52:36,641 --> 01:52:40,030
But all the powers that be want to do
is make money on the way up and maximize

4184
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:41,200
profit on the way down.

4185
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:45,230
So they're just trying to money grab
right now and just as much as possible is

4186
01:52:45,231 --> 01:52:50,231
more profitable to destroy things now
than it is to save them in the NBA is

4187
01:52:50,361 --> 01:52:51,860
basically just like what we need.

4188
01:52:51,861 --> 01:52:56,210
We need to keep fucking peace in the
streets where were stealing money or scare

4189
01:52:56,211 --> 01:52:56,980
the people in the,

4190
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:57,813
yes,

4191
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,030
they have crazy laws.

4192
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:00,500
We can just lock people up.

4193
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,480
You know who's lagging me blow up though.

4194
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:03,740
That's where it gets really ridiculous.

4195
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:08,450
It at one point in time someone has
to realize that the structure of this,

4196
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:08,691
uh,

4197
01:53:08,691 --> 01:53:09,650
this monarchy,

4198
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:10,130
this,

4199
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:10,401
this,

4200
01:53:10,401 --> 01:53:10,671
this,

4201
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:11,090
uh,

4202
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:14,480
this fucking king ship
that's taken over the world.

4203
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:18,380
It only works if people were willing
to take up guns and only works if the

4204
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:20,840
common folk are willing to
push around everybody else.

4205
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:21,441
I mean,

4206
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:24,110
that's the only way it
works out really work.

4207
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:25,220
If everybody goes,

4208
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:25,570
wait,

4209
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:26,030
where's it?

4210
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:26,780
Fuck you.

4211
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:27,111
You know,

4212
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:27,291
I mean,

4213
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:28,101
you need the cops.

4214
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:28,934
He knew me like a guy,

4215
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:31,160
like a guy like you who
steps out and you know,

4216
01:53:31,161 --> 01:53:34,730
when you were a cop and you saw this
corruption and you step to what you were a

4217
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:37,910
regular person instead of identifying
yourself with this organization that was

4218
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:38,900
obviously sick,

4219
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:42,350
you identified yourself with your morals
and your character and your upbringing

4220
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,861
and you said,

4221
01:53:42,861 --> 01:53:43,700
fuck you.

4222
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,380
The CIA selling trucks,

4223
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:45,981
you know,

4224
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:47,510
at some point in time doesn't,

4225
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:47,970
I mean,

4226
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:49,640
isn't that the real solution?

4227
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:51,900
Is it everybody sort of
realizes that they can't do it?

4228
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,251
No,

4229
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:55,070
but this is like one of the coolest
things that's happened to me in,

4230
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:55,790
in,

4231
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:56,990
in 30 years.

4232
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:58,670
That was cooler than Fox magic.

4233
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,193
Yeah.

4234
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:01,163
Yeah.

4235
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:03,560
You know who killed Tupac,

4236
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:04,394
don't you?

4237
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:04,761
Yeah,

4238
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:05,600
the cops did.

4239
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:05,901
Yeah.

4240
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:06,541
There's a you ever,

4241
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:07,540
you ever see that man?

4242
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:08,650
Do you want to talk about corruption?

4243
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:09,990
Terrifying story.

4244
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:10,983
Even joke around.

4245
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,140
We can do that all night,

4246
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:12,974
but yeah,

4247
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:13,220
man,

4248
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:14,540
part the Rampart division.

4249
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,440
I was going to say this
is better than Fox magic.

4250
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,800
I was like,

4251
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,100
oh,

4252
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:19,641
it's impossible.

4253
01:54:19,641 --> 01:54:20,450
Okay.

4254
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:22,010
Fox Mask makes you invisible.

4255
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,940
What could be better than that?

4256
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:23,580
Yeah.

4257
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:24,500
It's like one of the key.

4258
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:25,760
If you could have a superpower,

4259
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,680
what would you take?

4260
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,040
If it sees two POCs needed?

4261
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,860
Native American wisdom has
taught me that if I am the wind,

4262
01:54:30,861 --> 01:54:32,540
it does not matter if people see me.

4263
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:33,900
It only matters that the Pete,

4264
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,880
that the leaves blow.

4265
01:54:34,881 --> 01:54:35,714
When I,

4266
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:36,893
when I go by,

4267
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:38,263
oh,

4268
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:39,170
that sounds tripping.

4269
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,910
That sounds like again more shit.

4270
01:54:40,911 --> 01:54:41,990
You would tell the hippie chicks.

4271
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:43,773
So anyway,

4272
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:45,070
God,

4273
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:47,410
you guys are going to beat me up bro.

4274
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:51,680
He's quoted a bet Midler song on my
pocket the whole time he's been quoting to

4275
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:52,610
bet Midler song.

4276
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,111
Oh my God,

4277
01:54:53,111 --> 01:54:53,241
it's,

4278
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:54,140
this has a big joke.

4279
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:54,651
Well,

4280
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:56,750
you remember when Herman
Cain started quoting Pokemon?

4281
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:58,040
I was like this,

4282
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,180
this might be it fake.

4283
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:00,440
This guy might not be real.

4284
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:01,790
Do you think Herman Cain was really,

4285
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,950
was he just in a position as a spoiler?

4286
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:06,650
I mean it was Herman Cain
was a hired sideshow.

4287
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:07,693
Really?

4288
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:09,590
I swear to God.

4289
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:10,940
I know that sounds ridiculous.

4290
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,200
I know it sounds ridiculous,

4291
01:55:12,201 --> 01:55:15,620
but when he started quoting Pokemon and
using the fucking grand theft auto tax

4292
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,790
tax program,

4293
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,080
I was like,

4294
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:18,351
wait,

4295
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:21,500
a may have to create all this drama
to make you believe that there is a

4296
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:22,940
democracy at work out there.

4297
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:25,730
So what do you think that was where
some due to just a super successful

4298
01:55:25,731 --> 01:55:27,410
businessman and they cooperate him.

4299
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:28,730
They got ahold of him to the lecture.

4300
01:55:28,731 --> 01:55:30,860
He got some great business
deals to go through.

4301
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:33,080
Everything he went through
and he's going to walk away.

4302
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:34,880
He was never going to be
president to begin with.

4303
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,100
It seems like he was
just fucking everybody.

4304
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:37,760
Huh?

4305
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:38,540
Anyway.

4306
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,351
Can I tell you this thing?

4307
01:55:39,351 --> 01:55:40,430
And it's better than Fox magic.

4308
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:40,641
Yes,

4309
01:55:40,641 --> 01:55:41,120
please.

4310
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:41,910
Sorry,

4311
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:42,420
fucking with me.

4312
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,010
Here is a great podcast,

4313
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,161
man.

4314
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:44,791
I'm gonna join us.

4315
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:45,624
Thank you very much.

4316
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:48,060
The core of the coolest things
that happened to me was,

4317
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,953
um,

4318
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:53,910
after Oakland when Scott Olson got
shot in the head with a flight,

4319
01:55:53,911 --> 01:55:54,590
right.

4320
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:55,200
Uh,

4321
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,980
army veteran and I'm really close.

4322
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,510
Don't know,

4323
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:58,550
elaborate on that story.

4324
01:55:58,551 --> 01:55:59,384
It's a horrible story.

4325
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,800
During the occupy Oakland,

4326
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:02,010
uh,

4327
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:02,970
demonstrations,

4328
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,530
uh,

4329
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:05,330
late at night,

4330
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,163
um,

4331
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,040
Scott Olson was one of several
guys that were out front and he's,

4332
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:14,460
he was military veteran and the cops
were firing 40 millimeter flight,

4333
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:15,090
right?

4334
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:17,040
Projectiles out [inaudible] 79 bloopers.

4335
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:17,371
I've shot.

4336
01:56:17,371 --> 01:56:18,460
Those are little grenade launchers.

4337
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,313
They're kind of fun.

4338
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,101
Uh,

4339
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:20,521
and,

4340
01:56:20,521 --> 01:56:21,060
and uh,

4341
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:21,811
somebody shot him in the head.

4342
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:22,644
It was accidental.

4343
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:23,131
Okay.

4344
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:26,010
But after his skull was fractured
and he was on the ground,

4345
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:29,580
you see the cops lobbying a cs canisters,

4346
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:30,000
uh,

4347
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,340
gas canisters right into
the group of people.

4348
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,530
And there was so much brutality.

4349
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:36,960
And this was after watching
the white shirts in New York,

4350
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:37,950
you know,

4351
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:38,341
and,

4352
01:56:38,341 --> 01:56:40,200
and Shamar Thomas hadn't come up yet.

4353
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:41,460
I don't think he had yet.

4354
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:42,570
Uh,

4355
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:45,240
but we went to occupy
Santa Rosa and it was like,

4356
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:46,050
uh,

4357
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:48,900
which is the town close to where
I lived in a town of about,

4358
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:49,530
uh,

4359
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:51,420
we had the highest per capita
turnout in the country.

4360
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:52,261
Uh,

4361
01:56:52,261 --> 01:56:54,120
so we had like 3000 people turn out,

4362
01:56:54,121 --> 01:56:56,700
but we were going to put up camps
and the chief of police had said,

4363
01:56:56,701 --> 01:56:59,340
we will use any means necessary
to tear down the camp.

4364
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:00,810
Now what happened was I
went there and I said,

4365
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:02,070
they're going to fuck these people.

4366
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:03,630
I'm putting my body in front of them.

4367
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:06,510
I took an oath and when I got there,

4368
01:57:06,511 --> 01:57:07,950
there were all these veterans,

4369
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:13,260
there were Vietnam veterans and there
were Gulf one veterans and there was one

4370
01:57:13,261 --> 01:57:15,210
active duty guy and it was an army ranger,

4371
01:57:15,211 --> 01:57:16,350
special forces medic.

4372
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,330
And we had all showed up there with all,

4373
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,430
we all had the same idea.

4374
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:25,530
We are going to get in front of the cops
so that when they start shooting the

4375
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:25,980
gas,

4376
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,000
they're going to hit us.

4377
01:57:27,001 --> 01:57:28,560
And if they want a beat on somebody,

4378
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:33,180
let them beat on us because we know that
we can take that without throwing back

4379
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:36,120
to Jesus Christ.

4380
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:39,700
And this groundswell from
the veterans community,

4381
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,920
Honorable Warriors,

4382
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:45,921
the Shamar Thomas's you know what is
so sad and I've had a really close

4383
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:49,560
connection over the years from
doing investigating murders,

4384
01:57:49,561 --> 01:57:50,730
have a lot of uh,

4385
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,440
army special forces,

4386
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:53,580
special OPS personnel.

4387
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:54,960
Um,

4388
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,960
for all these years we have had really
good men go off to war and never in my

4389
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:03,810
war has lifetime has there
been an honorable war.

4390
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,710
Vietnam wasn't,

4391
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:05,580
none of it was honored.

4392
01:58:05,581 --> 01:58:06,720
It was all crooked bullshit.

4393
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:09,660
But there are guys who went
out there who did the deed,

4394
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:11,280
who put their lives on the line,

4395
01:58:11,281 --> 01:58:12,570
got their combat infantry badge,

4396
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:13,433
whatever,

4397
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,560
and didn't commit atrocities in really
horrible wars and came home and they've

4398
01:58:19,441 --> 01:58:21,480
never been able to shine like that.

4399
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:26,400
And when Shamar Thomas did that Shamar
Thomas was speaking for everybody who'd

4400
01:58:26,401 --> 01:58:28,890
been to war in this country's military,

4401
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:30,090
who served honorably,

4402
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:33,240
who didn't commit atrocities
in wars that we all know,

4403
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:34,500
we're totally fucked up,

4404
01:58:34,501 --> 01:58:35,730
fraudulent and light.

4405
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:36,940
The,

4406
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:37,773
the,

4407
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:39,210
the best teacher,

4408
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,890
the most powerful teacher I've ever had.

4409
01:58:40,891 --> 01:58:42,220
I gave a talk

4410
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,970
at Portland State University right after
nine 11 became my video truth and lies

4411
01:58:45,971 --> 01:58:46,804
of nine 11.

4412
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:48,040
And,

4413
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,870
uh,

4414
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,030
uh,

4415
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:50,080
native Americans showed up,

4416
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:55,060
knocked on my hotel room doors about
five foot four and his name was skip May,

4417
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:55,360
hawk.

4418
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:55,691
And,

4419
01:58:55,691 --> 01:58:56,524
uh,

4420
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,610
what a presence,

4421
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,210
you know,

4422
01:58:58,210 --> 01:58:59,800
have you ever looked a fighter in the eye?

4423
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:01,660
And there's just some guys
got to look in the eye.

4424
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:02,380
Sure.

4425
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,670
Fuck most of them.

4426
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:04,510
Yeah.

4427
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:04,781
And,

4428
01:59:04,781 --> 01:59:05,950
and so here's this guy.

4429
01:59:05,951 --> 01:59:07,960
I look down here,

4430
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:08,530
you know.

4431
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:08,731
Hi,

4432
01:59:08,731 --> 01:59:09,401
I'm Scott May Huck,

4433
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:10,730
I'm here to be your cameraman.

4434
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,800
Second camera man tonight.

4435
01:59:11,801 --> 01:59:12,910
I didn't know he volunteered.

4436
01:59:12,911 --> 01:59:13,744
He showed up.

4437
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:17,000
It turns out skip had served with a
hundred and first airborne and the

4438
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,800
[inaudible] valley in 1968 some of
the bloodiest battles of the war,

4439
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:21,640
uh,

4440
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:22,900
the Asha was legendary.

4441
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:23,783
Uh,

4442
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,080
and skip was awarded the
Congressional Medal of honor,

4443
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:27,063
the medal of honor.

4444
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:27,510
Uh,

4445
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:31,360
and he refused it because he
was fighting in an unjust war.

4446
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:33,483
Wow.

4447
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:36,520
And he fought beside Russell
means at wounded knee

4448
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:39,580
and he showed up to be my camera man.

4449
01:59:39,581 --> 01:59:41,470
And he became a teacher for me.

4450
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:42,830
And he was one of the,

4451
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:43,200
the,

4452
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:46,360
the Great Warrior teachers that I've had
who taught me about the power of honor

4453
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:49,000
and why it's important to
fight in an honorable war,

4454
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:49,901
not going to die.

4455
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:50,830
You're honorable death or,

4456
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:51,280
or you know,

4457
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,330
to fight honorably,

4458
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:54,370
but to fight in an honorable war.

4459
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:56,050
That's what a warrior needs.

4460
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,150
And,

4461
01:59:57,150 --> 02:00:00,220
and I think Shamar Thomas
really embodies that.

4462
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:01,090
Um,

4463
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:02,230
and he was just a snapshot.

4464
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:03,190
He's not a fluke.

4465
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:05,450
There's lots of Shamar
Thomas is out there.

4466
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:08,600
Shamar Thomas is the guy who
yelled at in New York apartment.

4467
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:11,240
There's no honors or you sleep at night.

4468
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:11,490
Yeah.

4469
02:00:11,490 --> 02:00:11,791
Mara.

4470
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,220
People probably don't know
what you're talking about,

4471
02:00:13,221 --> 02:00:15,030
but there's a video out
there of this guy who said,

4472
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:15,221
well,

4473
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:16,070
big dude,

4474
02:00:16,071 --> 02:00:18,740
and he's got all these metals on and
he's like pointing to the metals.

4475
02:00:18,741 --> 02:00:18,950
Like,

4476
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:20,150
these are lies,

4477
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:20,811
you know?

4478
02:00:20,811 --> 02:00:23,480
And he was like explaining to all the
shit that he been through and he was like,

4479
02:00:23,481 --> 02:00:24,680
this is not a war zone.

4480
02:00:24,681 --> 02:00:26,300
These are your people and how you sleep.

4481
02:00:26,301 --> 02:00:26,780
And I,

4482
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:28,010
and it's really powerful.

4483
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,540
There is no honor in this.

4484
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,980
There is no honor in this.

4485
02:00:30,981 --> 02:00:32,270
And they can't say nothing.

4486
02:00:32,271 --> 02:00:33,380
They just sit there and eat it.

4487
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:33,800
Yeah.

4488
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:34,101
You know,

4489
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:34,330
and it's,

4490
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,420
it's a crazy moment.

4491
02:00:35,421 --> 02:00:35,930
That's,

4492
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,450
that's

4493
02:00:36,450 --> 02:00:37,380
the power of honor.

4494
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:38,830
And that's been Mike,

4495
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:39,150
Mike,

4496
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:39,540
and again,

4497
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,370
I'm not the only one who's done this.

4498
02:00:41,371 --> 02:00:42,204
There's a lot of us,

4499
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:46,740
we're all standing up now because the
criminality and the bullshit in Washington

4500
02:00:46,741 --> 02:00:49,530
and Wall Street is just so out of control.

4501
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:51,460
Is there a way to turn it around?

4502
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:54,750
Is there a way to somehow under
the steer this back to the light,

4503
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:59,780
is there a way to make this culture wake
up and snap itself out of it before we

4504
02:01:00,451 --> 02:01:01,284
hit the wall?

4505
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:02,213
Well,

4506
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:07,380
a lot of people are snapping out and
stepping out or waking up right now.

4507
02:01:07,650 --> 02:01:08,700
A lot of people are,

4508
02:01:08,701 --> 02:01:10,920
and it's happening in very big numbers.

4509
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:12,413
Um,

4510
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:13,240
I,

4511
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,090
in terms of saving the system,

4512
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:16,040
no,

4513
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:17,240
we got to get Obama high.

4514
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,600
That's what we got to do.

4515
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:20,390
Got a kidnap him higher,

4516
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:21,493
higher.

4517
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:22,161
Can't say that.

4518
02:01:22,161 --> 02:01:23,600
You can't even say that
there's a guy yelling.

4519
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:24,050
I was,

4520
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:25,130
that was a total joke.

4521
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:27,270
Here's the guy who's got tomorrow.

4522
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,080
That's tomorrow.

4523
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:28,500
Yeah.

4524
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,670
He was a guest on my radio show.

4525
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:30,960
Really cool dude.

4526
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,970
If you get she choose to
get high with one person,

4527
02:01:32,971 --> 02:01:33,180
it wouldn't,

4528
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:34,170
it would be Barack Obama.

4529
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,940
You wouldn't want to sit down with that
guy and find out what the fuck is going

4530
02:01:37,941 --> 02:01:38,150
on.

4531
02:01:38,150 --> 02:01:38,391
I mean,

4532
02:01:38,391 --> 02:01:38,601
when you,

4533
02:01:38,601 --> 02:01:39,950
when you get really blasted

4534
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:43,500
where you can't lie and just
start asking him questions like,

4535
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:46,310
I don't think I'd want to know
what would come out really.

4536
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,810
I think I'd be fascinated.

4537
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,541
I would want to,

4538
02:01:48,541 --> 02:01:49,700
I wouldn't want to say first.

4539
02:01:50,060 --> 02:01:50,480
What's that?

4540
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,440
You would choose him first.

4541
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:51,830
Yeah.

4542
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:52,011
Oh,

4543
02:01:52,011 --> 02:01:52,760
hush man.

4544
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,593
For sure.

4545
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:55,440
He's like so close to my age.

4546
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:55,790
I,

4547
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:56,051
I'm,

4548
02:01:56,051 --> 02:01:56,884
I'm fascinated.

4549
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:57,170
You know,

4550
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,600
I always looked at Lexi's
president guys as being these,

4551
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,970
any of these old evil men with hearts of,

4552
02:02:01,971 --> 02:02:02,361
you know,

4553
02:02:02,361 --> 02:02:02,571
of,

4554
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:03,410
of diamonds.

4555
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:03,780
And you know,

4556
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:05,160
they fucking of blood.

4557
02:02:05,161 --> 02:02:06,020
That's coal,

4558
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:06,471
you know,

4559
02:02:06,471 --> 02:02:06,861
I mean just,

4560
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:08,330
just evil and nasty,

4561
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:12,050
evil people who have gotten to a position
where they can choose to start these

4562
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:12,560
wars.

4563
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,280
But then I look at a
guy like Barack Obama.

4564
02:02:14,281 --> 02:02:14,481
I was like,

4565
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:14,571
well,

4566
02:02:14,571 --> 02:02:18,320
he was probably like close to my age
when I was 10 he was probably like 14 or

4567
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:19,190
something like,

4568
02:02:19,191 --> 02:02:19,551
that's like,

4569
02:02:19,551 --> 02:02:20,570
that's real close.

4570
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:22,610
Like that guy grew up really recently.

4571
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:23,750
He grew up with the Internet.

4572
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:24,141
He grabbed me,

4573
02:02:24,141 --> 02:02:25,190
know what's going on with him.

4574
02:02:25,191 --> 02:02:25,500
How was,

4575
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,020
how were they able to do this to him?

4576
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,741
You know,

4577
02:02:27,741 --> 02:02:28,290
how did I,

4578
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:28,630
that's it.

4579
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:29,463
That's incredible.

4580
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:30,463
One of us.

4581
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:32,320
Well he know he ain't me.

4582
02:02:32,321 --> 02:02:32,841
You know what I'm saying?

4583
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:35,000
In my perception as a fool,

4584
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,320
he's not one of us.

4585
02:02:36,321 --> 02:02:37,154
He's a,

4586
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:42,470
this is a government of the banks by
the banks and for the banks and Barack

4587
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:43,610
Obama's presidential decisions,

4588
02:02:43,611 --> 02:02:48,611
especially since 2008 all of the sea has
done was to make us pay for all of the

4589
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:50,960
Wall Street crime he's,

4590
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,890
they have,

4591
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:53,450
they have taken all of that debt,

4592
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:54,231
all the money.

4593
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:58,520
They printed the derivatives and the bail
out shit and they put it on our backs.

4594
02:02:58,521 --> 02:03:01,670
And that's what's happening
around the world in Greece.

4595
02:03:01,671 --> 02:03:03,230
The banks now run the code.

4596
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:04,670
There's a banker in charge of Greece,

4597
02:03:04,671 --> 02:03:09,110
there's a banker in charge of Italy and
Barack Obama has done the same thing to

4598
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:09,321
us.

4599
02:03:09,321 --> 02:03:12,350
And all that debt that belonged to
Wall Street is now on our backs.

4600
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:15,920
Have you seen the video where Barack Obama
says that he believes he's the fourth

4601
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:16,790
best president?

4602
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:19,460
Have you seen it?

4603
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:19,911
Oh God,

4604
02:03:19,911 --> 02:03:20,140
no.

4605
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:20,973
You see it in Brian.

4606
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:23,930
Brian find it on Youtube and
watch it cause it's hilarious.

4607
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:24,771
He talks about,

4608
02:03:24,771 --> 02:03:25,191
you know,

4609
02:03:25,191 --> 02:03:29,360
different presidents that
have accomplished more and
the only lists like three

4610
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:31,520
that he thinks of accomplish
more than they have.

4611
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:33,610
There was a guy named
Alexander soldier needs,

4612
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,480
who was a Russian writer,

4613
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:37,460
very great Russian writer.

4614
02:03:37,461 --> 02:03:39,740
He lived 30 years in a Gulag prison camp.

4615
02:03:39,741 --> 02:03:40,574
Right.

4616
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:40,930
And,

4617
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:42,650
and he came up with a great line.

4618
02:03:42,651 --> 02:03:42,891
He said,

4619
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:43,221
men,

4620
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:46,910
in order to do evil must first believe
that what they are doing is good.

4621
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,870
Wow,

4622
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:48,740
that's incredible.

4623
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:53,770
So you convince yourself
that we're the elite,

4624
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:58,220
where the rich we have the only way to
manage things we have to do to that and

4625
02:03:58,221 --> 02:03:59,870
they delude themselves.

4626
02:03:59,871 --> 02:04:00,560
That's,

4627
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,670
that's the Fed,

4628
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:02,570
uh,

4629
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:07,310
stale nature of a democracy that has not
been ventilated and breathe and air it

4630
02:04:07,311 --> 02:04:08,570
out for a long time,

4631
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:09,800
you know,

4632
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:11,900
and die.

4633
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:14,480
I don't want to save this system
at all as far as I'm concerned.

4634
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:17,900
And especially what the
end of energy with W.

4635
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:17,901
Dot.

4636
02:04:17,901 --> 02:04:20,090
The endo w with peak oil and collapsed,

4637
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:22,430
the United States can't
possibly hold together anyway.

4638
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:27,850
So when peak oil happens in gas becomes
extremely expensive and probably

4639
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,630
impossible to get,

4640
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,830
then what happens?

4641
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:35,450
We often branch off into
little communities and make
our own medicine was solar

4642
02:04:35,451 --> 02:04:35,811
power.

4643
02:04:35,811 --> 02:04:35,991
I mean,

4644
02:04:35,991 --> 02:04:38,160
what are we gonna do with
those of us who were smart

4645
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,410
enough to start moving in
that direction ahead of time?

4646
02:04:40,411 --> 02:04:41,244
Yes.

4647
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:46,340
But peak oil has already happened and
there are in this country with all of the

4648
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:48,750
tens and hundreds of millions of people
who are unemployed or below the poverty

4649
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:48,961
line,

4650
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:51,330
people who can't afford
gas at any price right now.

4651
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:54,780
So it's going to slowly keep creeping.

4652
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:55,800
Yeah.

4653
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,251
And that really,

4654
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:57,001
when we think about it,

4655
02:04:57,001 --> 02:04:59,850
the real big jump was the end
of the Bush administration,

4656
02:04:59,851 --> 02:05:01,110
which was only a few years ago.

4657
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:02,760
That's nothing a blink of the eye,

4658
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:03,860
you know?

4659
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:04,020
Well,

4660
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,890
they knew it was coming to think of how
bad it could be three years from now.

4661
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:09,810
Thank you.

4662
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:12,420
Well that's good because again,

4663
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:14,970
we all wind claim here is
progress rather than perfection.

4664
02:05:14,971 --> 02:05:16,800
There's not not ready and then ready.

4665
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,101
You know,

4666
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:18,330
you're not in a binary state.

4667
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,191
Do you subscribe?

4668
02:05:19,191 --> 02:05:19,311
No.

4669
02:05:19,311 --> 02:05:20,150
We talked about earlier,

4670
02:05:20,151 --> 02:05:21,440
but do you subscribe to the,

4671
02:05:21,441 --> 02:05:23,630
the Mayans ideas you think
they were on to something?

4672
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,230
I'm amazed at the coincidence.

4673
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:25,690
Yeah.

4674
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:26,131
Amazing.

4675
02:05:26,131 --> 02:05:26,311
Right?

4676
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:27,210
I think there is,

4677
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:28,044
I mean,

4678
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,540
everything else in this world
we look at now is a lie.

4679
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,260
Okay,

4680
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:31,590
come on.

4681
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:32,423
It's a lie.

4682
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,050
There's a recovery.

4683
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:35,073
It's a lie.

4684
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:35,430
Uh,

4685
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:36,840
we killed the Osama bin.

4686
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:39,510
Ladin it's a lie around
was behind nine 11.

4687
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:40,403
It's a lie,

4688
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,041
you know,

4689
02:05:41,041 --> 02:05:41,611
Wall Street,

4690
02:05:41,611 --> 02:05:42,151
it's a lie.

4691
02:05:42,151 --> 02:05:42,900
Your pension fund,

4692
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:44,130
it's a lie that,

4693
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:44,521
okay,

4694
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:45,540
so you know,

4695
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:50,100
all that stuff just needs to be seen
what it is and disengage from it.

4696
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,010
It's kinds of mass destruction.

4697
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:57,210
It's codependent to want to
go in and fix that system.

4698
02:05:57,211 --> 02:05:59,500
It's picture somebody wanting to go to uh,

4699
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:02,730
the Nazis in 1938 and saying,

4700
02:06:02,731 --> 02:06:03,031
okay,

4701
02:06:03,031 --> 02:06:06,330
let's have a campaign to organize the
teach the Nazis that the Jews are really

4702
02:06:06,331 --> 02:06:07,164
good people,

4703
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:07,951
the smart people.

4704
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:08,491
We're just saying,

4705
02:06:08,491 --> 02:06:09,720
I'm getting the fuck out of Europe.

4706
02:06:10,290 --> 02:06:10,860
The Jews,

4707
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:11,730
smart Jews were getting,

4708
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:11,941
you know,

4709
02:06:11,941 --> 02:06:15,780
getting out of the way the world knew
what was coming with that and it's,

4710
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:18,960
and it's not mentally sound
to try and fix this system.

4711
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:19,110
This,

4712
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:21,000
this system needs to be redone.

4713
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,470
Ron Paul's got a good end and the Fed
you got until you change the way money

4714
02:06:25,471 --> 02:06:25,741
works,

4715
02:06:25,741 --> 02:06:26,520
you change nothing.

4716
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,540
That's the big start.

4717
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:31,080
Then you gotta and fractional reserve
banking compound interest in Fiat

4718
02:06:31,081 --> 02:06:31,914
currency.

4719
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:32,940
What is the,

4720
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:36,000
what's the solution when you have to
do something to put something else in

4721
02:06:36,001 --> 02:06:36,834
place?

4722
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:37,560
What are you doing bro?

4723
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,690
Here's the,

4724
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:39,120
uh,

4725
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:39,680
Obama,

4726
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:39,871
oh,

4727
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:40,704
am I ready for that?

4728
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:41,810
Where do I look here?

4729
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:42,430
I have right,

4730
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:42,650
right.

4731
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:43,483
Straight ahead.

4732
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:44,290
Well,

4733
02:06:44,290 --> 02:06:45,123
there is,

4734
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:48,910
I'm not going to be a list of
accomplishments as you said yourself,

4735
02:06:48,911 --> 02:06:49,744
Steve.

4736
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:50,410
Yeah.

4737
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:54,940
I would put our legislative and foreign
policy accomplishments in our first two

4738
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:56,260
years against any president,

4739
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:57,573
uh,

4740
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:00,730
with the possible exceptions or Johnson,

4741
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:02,320
FDR and Lincoln.

4742
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:02,711
But,

4743
02:07:02,711 --> 02:07:03,544
uh,

4744
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,140
uh,

4745
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:04,511
you know,

4746
02:07:04,511 --> 02:07:07,420
just in terms of what we've
gotten done in modern history.

4747
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:07,921
Yeah.

4748
02:07:07,921 --> 02:07:08,730
You raped the world.

4749
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:09,563
Congratulations.

4750
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:10,763
Good job.

4751
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,131
Way To go,

4752
02:07:11,131 --> 02:07:11,880
dude.

4753
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:14,940
He got the Nobel prize after these and
then you sent 30,000 more people out to

4754
02:07:14,941 --> 02:07:16,260
Afghanistan with,

4755
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:16,850
with,

4756
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:17,641
with guns.

4757
02:07:17,641 --> 02:07:17,891
He's,

4758
02:07:17,891 --> 02:07:18,661
he's Hanks.

4759
02:07:18,661 --> 02:07:20,360
He's bloodier than chain Bush.

4760
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,911
It's amazing.

4761
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:22,670
It's amazing that he could
actually say that though.

4762
02:07:22,710 --> 02:07:22,931
What,

4763
02:07:22,931 --> 02:07:23,151
what,

4764
02:07:23,151 --> 02:07:24,210
what legislation?

4765
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:24,391
Oh,

4766
02:07:24,391 --> 02:07:26,010
you mean you know the,

4767
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:29,140
the ability to just start arresting
people for no fucking reason would it?

4768
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:30,780
What is it exactly that got accomplished?

4769
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:31,643
Did I miss something?

4770
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:32,450
Yeah.

4771
02:07:32,450 --> 02:07:32,670
What,

4772
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:35,470
what are these great
legislation of achievements?

4773
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,500
Do you know what he's talking about and
know what the fuck could he be talking

4774
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:38,800
about?

4775
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:42,510
That's the Orwellian nature of
this absolute crap we see on the,

4776
02:07:42,511 --> 02:07:45,070
on the mainstream airways
horseshoe this whole time.

4777
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:46,330
It's like some precedent thing like,

4778
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:47,164
oh yeah,

4779
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:47,740
what?

4780
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:50,500
Nevermind what I'll tell you dude.

4781
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:51,100
I don't know.

4782
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,450
I don't know what the
fuck you just said Brian.

4783
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,980
Nevermind.

4784
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,550
That's okay.

4785
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:55,120
Yeah,

4786
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:55,953
he's a silly boy.

4787
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:56,560
Um,

4788
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,050
so you know all that stuff.

4789
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:00,970
It just needs to stop.

4790
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,580
So like I said,

4791
02:08:03,581 --> 02:08:05,260
you predicted a lot of shit.

4792
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:05,501
You,

4793
02:08:05,501 --> 02:08:05,801
you,

4794
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:06,280
you,

4795
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,100
you been at the firm,

4796
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:08,530
I mean,

4797
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:09,880
I forget when it was,

4798
02:08:09,881 --> 02:08:10,714
when you,

4799
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:14,610
when you started predicting that our
society was slowly going to collapse.

4800
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:16,740
It was like way before anybody
else was ever doing it.

4801
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:18,190
That was in one was when I first started.

4802
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:20,680
What do you think is going to be 99 point?

4803
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:22,180
The end point is going to be,

4804
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:22,811
is it going to be,

4805
02:08:22,811 --> 02:08:26,200
we find groups of people and we
hang out together and grow food?

4806
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:26,680
No,

4807
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:27,510
that does.

4808
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,841
You know,

4809
02:08:27,841 --> 02:08:31,440
I'm probably more grateful for that
question Joe than any other one because

4810
02:08:31,441 --> 02:08:34,350
that's what we're fighting about now.

4811
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:36,180
When we want to get Ron Paul elected,

4812
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:37,560
that's what we're fighting about.

4813
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:41,760
It stops when the people wake
up to the point and says,

4814
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:43,050
this has got to stop.

4815
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:45,620
Because if you can get a
guy like Ron Paul in office,

4816
02:08:45,621 --> 02:08:48,650
you think we can kind of smooth
everything out and still have cars.

4817
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:49,220
He uh,

4818
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:50,053
well,

4819
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:51,290
oh,

4820
02:08:51,290 --> 02:08:52,400
we will still have cars.

4821
02:08:52,401 --> 02:08:54,770
Even if we have bio diesel run on,

4822
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:55,770
or even if we have,

4823
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:56,663
you know,

4824
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:59,670
some of the criminal in the White House,

4825
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,573
uh,

4826
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:01,580
you know,

4827
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,400
they're,

4828
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:03,740
they're,

4829
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,310
they're going to become harder to find,

4830
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:11,180
but we're fighting to determine how far
this system is going to run everything

4831
02:09:12,601 --> 02:09:15,330
down before we put our foot down and say,

4832
02:09:15,331 --> 02:09:16,500
this has got to change.

4833
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:19,710
That's what's gonna make the
difference because this system,

4834
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:23,850
I wrote an essay called
Global Court some years ago,

4835
02:09:23,851 --> 02:09:24,720
and in it I said,

4836
02:09:24,721 --> 02:09:25,620
the way the system works,

4837
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,191
infinite growth,

4838
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:26,851
mergers and everything.

4839
02:09:26,851 --> 02:09:27,684
Now,

4840
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:31,260
the last CFO of the last
corporation in the world,

4841
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,280
Global Corp,

4842
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,020
when the world is in total ruins,

4843
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:34,980
when four or five,

4844
02:09:34,981 --> 02:09:36,570
6 billion people are dead,

4845
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:41,190
when one guy has acquired all the ones
and Zeros of wealth and that company goes

4846
02:09:41,191 --> 02:09:41,731
bankrupt,

4847
02:09:41,731 --> 02:09:42,271
he's going to say,

4848
02:09:42,271 --> 02:09:42,661
hooray,

4849
02:09:42,661 --> 02:09:43,494
we did it.

4850
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,460
That's where that ends
until and unless we stop it,

4851
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,890
human beings stop it.

4852
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:54,570
And the consciousness is
here that understands that
the infinite growth economic

4853
02:09:54,571 --> 02:09:57,750
paradigm will kill us in
order to make a profit.

4854
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,430
How much time do we have?

4855
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:00,901
Well,

4856
02:10:00,901 --> 02:10:01,530
if,

4857
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:01,861
uh,

4858
02:10:01,861 --> 02:10:02,580
if there,

4859
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:06,390
if there's an attack launched on Iran
within the next week or two B or before

4860
02:10:06,391 --> 02:10:07,270
the Iowa third,

4861
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:08,200
excuse me,

4862
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,001
the January 3rd,

4863
02:10:09,001 --> 02:10:13,650
I will caucuses and China
comes into backup Iran and
the Russians have said they

4864
02:10:13,651 --> 02:10:14,450
will back up a,

4865
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:15,810
a nuclear weapons or exchange.

4866
02:10:15,811 --> 02:10:17,130
It could be over in two weeks.

4867
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:18,670
Jesus fucking Christ.

4868
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,511
I got shit to do.

4869
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:19,751
Dude.

4870
02:10:19,751 --> 02:10:21,130
I have a new special to make,

4871
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:24,940
I'm going to release
it like Louis C k look,

4872
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:25,803
um,

4873
02:10:25,930 --> 02:10:27,400
this is very frightening stuff.

4874
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:28,750
You think this is unavoidable?

4875
02:10:28,751 --> 02:10:31,150
You think that a nuclear
war with Iran is just,

4876
02:10:31,151 --> 02:10:31,984
no,

4877
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:32,771
I don't.

4878
02:10:32,771 --> 02:10:33,980
And seeing very strong

4879
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,460
signs that,

4880
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:34,921
that uh,

4881
02:10:34,921 --> 02:10:37,220
the United States is getting bitch
slapped around the world right now.

4882
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:38,150
Um,

4883
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:38,690
since we,

4884
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:40,610
since we killed 24 Pakistani troops,

4885
02:10:40,611 --> 02:10:44,150
I sat hilos killed 24 packs soldiers,

4886
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:45,583
uh,

4887
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:49,160
all of the supplies going into the NATO
forces in Afghanistan had been cut off

4888
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:49,994
through Pakistan.

4889
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:52,940
How ridiculous was the asking
for the drone back from my Iran?

4890
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:56,560
Did that make you feel like it's a
work of fiction when you saw that?

4891
02:10:57,390 --> 02:11:00,220
Fubar it's just foobar it's just nuts.

4892
02:11:00,221 --> 02:11:03,700
Save and asked him to go on TV
and say that we asked for it back.

4893
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:04,900
They told Obama to do that.

4894
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:08,290
It's almost like they're making him out
to be a buffoon and towards his last

4895
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:08,590
couple of years,

4896
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:09,490
this is your script.

4897
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:10,271
This is what I want you to do.

4898
02:11:10,271 --> 02:11:13,120
I want you to go out there and
when they say about the the drone,

4899
02:11:13,121 --> 02:11:14,230
just say we asked for it back.

4900
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:15,461
He's probably like,

4901
02:11:15,461 --> 02:11:16,630
what the fuck am I going to say?

4902
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:18,640
It's like a sitcom actor.

4903
02:11:18,641 --> 02:11:19,840
It doesn't want to be humiliated.

4904
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:21,100
Some shit line.

4905
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:22,360
This is a bullshit line.

4906
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:27,080
Expect it to be a lot more nonsensical
all the way from here on out.

4907
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:30,160
And the only way to avoid this is to
have a guy like Ron Paul and office.

4908
02:11:30,161 --> 02:11:31,930
It's the only to avoid
going to war with Iran.

4909
02:11:31,931 --> 02:11:32,950
Know How do we avoid it?

4910
02:11:33,010 --> 02:11:37,660
Because the occupy movement
is demonstrating that you've
had 100,000 people out

4911
02:11:37,661 --> 02:11:38,770
in the streets of Moscow.

4912
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:42,910
There's an occupy related occupy inspired
revolt in the village of Uconn in

4913
02:11:42,911 --> 02:11:43,744
southern China,

4914
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:44,650
which has made,

4915
02:11:44,650 --> 02:11:47,620
made the Chinese communist
government backed down.

4916
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:48,490
And it's,

4917
02:11:48,490 --> 02:11:48,821
again,

4918
02:11:48,821 --> 02:11:50,320
it's not communist versus capitalist.

4919
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:52,510
It's all money in banks and
growth and all that stuff.

4920
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,161
And,

4921
02:11:53,161 --> 02:11:56,770
and this is a growing wave of
consciousness that's magic.

4922
02:11:57,190 --> 02:12:01,030
And that's why there's a lot of days
when I walk around and lately and I see

4923
02:12:01,031 --> 02:12:02,470
things happen and I'm just giggling.

4924
02:12:02,670 --> 02:12:03,570
So you love this.

4925
02:12:03,571 --> 02:12:04,440
This is fun for you.

4926
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:04,980
You,

4927
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:05,161
well,

4928
02:12:05,161 --> 02:12:05,521
first of all,

4929
02:12:05,521 --> 02:12:06,450
you've been first.

4930
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,171
First of all,

4931
02:12:07,171 --> 02:12:09,300
you've been predicting it for a long time.

4932
02:12:09,301 --> 02:12:11,040
So while it's happening you like,

4933
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,250
see I fucking told you
there's a lot of that,

4934
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,113
right?

4935
02:12:15,150 --> 02:12:15,811
But there's also,

4936
02:12:15,811 --> 02:12:17,670
you're happy to see the system fall apart.

4937
02:12:17,671 --> 02:12:18,990
Not because you want people to die,

4938
02:12:18,991 --> 02:12:22,010
but because it's a fucked up system that
doesn't work and it needs to dialing

4939
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:22,920
anything that doesn't work.

4940
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:23,400
Let me make it

4941
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:23,851
very clear.

4942
02:12:23,851 --> 02:12:27,120
I'm doing everything I possibly
can to accelerate the breakdown.

4943
02:12:27,121 --> 02:12:28,760
If the United States government and and,

4944
02:12:28,761 --> 02:12:29,130
and the,

4945
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:31,500
and the economy and the banking
system and everything else.

4946
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:31,711
No,

4947
02:12:31,711 --> 02:12:32,461
under the Patriot Act,

4948
02:12:32,461 --> 02:12:33,780
are you allowed to say shit like that?

4949
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:35,490
Like getting can't that could be,

4950
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:38,220
could that be interpreted
as you're a threat?

4951
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:41,930
Only God determines what I'm allowed to
say and nobody else has the right to do

4952
02:12:41,931 --> 02:12:42,570
that.

4953
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:44,040
And isn't it supposed to be enemies?

4954
02:12:44,041 --> 02:12:45,480
Both foreign and domestic?

4955
02:12:45,690 --> 02:12:46,320
Yes.

4956
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,310
Who forgot that?

4957
02:12:47,311 --> 02:12:48,480
How come everybody forgot that?

4958
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:49,020
Well,

4959
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:50,130
the foreign and domestic,

4960
02:12:50,230 --> 02:12:51,210
that's the beauty of,

4961
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,620
of what Aki and all these
veterans showing up.

4962
02:12:53,621 --> 02:12:54,431
Captain Ray Lewis,

4963
02:12:54,431 --> 02:12:58,930
the Philadelphia police captain who showed
up in his uniform and got arrested at

4964
02:12:58,931 --> 02:12:59,764
Ducati.

4965
02:13:00,090 --> 02:13:05,090
There's W W we're stepping up by the
thousands all over the country and we're

4966
02:13:05,201 --> 02:13:07,360
making ourselves known
throughout the movement.

4967
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:11,740
And what we're discovering is there's
lots of us out here and we are not going

4968
02:13:11,741 --> 02:13:12,700
to let this go down.

4969
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:13,960
And if the,

4970
02:13:13,961 --> 02:13:14,500
uh,

4971
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:18,010
detention provisions are passed
at NDA and they're employed,

4972
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:19,000
you're going to see,

4973
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:22,180
you're going to see massive breakdowns
because there's got to be soldiers in

4974
02:13:22,181 --> 02:13:23,080
this country that won't fight.

4975
02:13:23,081 --> 02:13:25,600
There's got to be cops that
will stand with the people.

4976
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:29,770
Five county sheriffs in
northern California have
United and county sheriffs are

4977
02:13:29,771 --> 02:13:31,000
the most powerful dudes in the,

4978
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:32,040
they can

4979
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,550
tell the president to stay out of the
county legally and the president can't say

4980
02:13:35,551 --> 02:13:36,384
Jack about it.

4981
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:37,170
Um,

4982
02:13:37,170 --> 02:13:38,330
isn't that changed as you,

4983
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:40,260
they probably just
changed that with the NDA.

4984
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:42,210
They probably just changed
that with something,

4985
02:13:42,211 --> 02:13:45,630
some sneaky bill they stuck
through and yet it doesn't matter.

4986
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:48,360
Once they bring the military
and it's illegal to grow food.

4987
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:49,860
You guys said to plant your own food.

4988
02:13:49,861 --> 02:13:53,300
Did you note that that one bill passed
that that makes it illegal to Predix?

4989
02:13:53,380 --> 02:13:54,213
Why isn't food?

4990
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:54,541
Well,

4991
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:54,880
no,

4992
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,880
there are some laws that that restricts
some people's ability in some places to

4993
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:01,790
grow food.

4994
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:01,970
Yeah.

4995
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:02,830
If a dude farts a lot,

4996
02:14:02,831 --> 02:14:05,220
you can't be grown
broccoli in your backyard,

4997
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:09,300
but the real base or the FDA and so forth
to come in and say you can't drink raw

4998
02:14:09,301 --> 02:14:09,571
milk,

4999
02:14:09,571 --> 02:14:10,291
which is awesome.

5000
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,750
I love raw mill Roman cause
delicious and they stopped that.

5001
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:14,070
They used to get it at whole foods.

5002
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:14,904
They don't have it anymore.

5003
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:16,140
It's,

5004
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:17,580
it's spotty around the country.

5005
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:18,840
I'll have to go to the farm.

5006
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,153
Um,

5007
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,320
Senate bill s five 10 Sanibel.

5008
02:14:22,321 --> 02:14:22,990
That's five 10.

5009
02:14:22,990 --> 02:14:24,060
And what does it actually say?

5010
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,440
What does the actual language,

5011
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:26,820
it's pretty long.

5012
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:28,830
It was not enacted.

5013
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,090
It was not passed.

5014
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:34,890
It wasn't know that there was a senator
from Montana who introduced an amendment

5015
02:14:34,891 --> 02:14:37,410
to that bill that removed
that clause from there.

5016
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:38,633
Isn't that crazy?

5017
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:39,881
Yeah.

5018
02:14:39,881 --> 02:14:41,840
What kind of an asshole
do you have to be seated?

5019
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:43,020
I love to go out tomatoes.

5020
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:44,910
I think we were just not enough.

5021
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:45,330
You know,

5022
02:14:45,330 --> 02:14:47,280
we've already fixed all
the problems in the world.

5023
02:14:47,281 --> 02:14:48,900
It's concentrate on people growing food.

5024
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:49,380
Yeah.

5025
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:52,080
Think about all the shit that
we have problems with prison,

5026
02:14:52,081 --> 02:14:53,190
overpopulation,

5027
02:14:53,191 --> 02:14:53,970
war on drugs,

5028
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:55,770
all the different issues
that we have to deal with.

5029
02:14:55,770 --> 02:14:56,820
Pollution of the environment.

5030
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:59,430
And someone shows the contrary
on people grow fucking food.

5031
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:03,790
But our whole civilization now is
predicated with the corporate control to

5032
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:06,930
banking control on us
not being independent,

5033
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:11,730
not being able to function outside of a
system that they control that the giant

5034
02:15:11,731 --> 02:15:13,050
agribusiness corporations,

5035
02:15:13,051 --> 02:15:14,880
Monsanto and Cargill control.

5036
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:16,770
How scary is Monsanto Santos?

5037
02:15:16,771 --> 02:15:17,480
Crazy.

5038
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,270
Terrifying.

5039
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:21,810
Did you know that Monsanto was one of the
companies that was looking into buying

5040
02:15:21,811 --> 02:15:24,300
black water and black
water was believe that?

5041
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,283
Do you believe that?

5042
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:25,930
Yeah.

5043
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:29,160
They can't tell like who
bought a controlling stake
and they couldn't tell if it

5044
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:31,650
was like one of the people
that owns Monsanto cause it's,

5045
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,191
you know,

5046
02:15:32,191 --> 02:15:34,290
there's a lot of crazy paperwork
you've got to go through.

5047
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:37,520
But the idea that that was even thought
of that the country that could Jorg

5048
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:38,730
accompany rather the controls,

5049
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:42,360
food growth in hundreds of
countries and not hundreds,

5050
02:15:42,361 --> 02:15:43,470
but a lot of countries,

5051
02:15:43,471 --> 02:15:44,580
but not only does that,

5052
02:15:44,581 --> 02:15:49,581
but it's been shown that politically
they forced their GMO foods on these

5053
02:15:49,621 --> 02:15:51,270
countries that don't want it,

5054
02:15:51,271 --> 02:15:52,200
can't afford it.

5055
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:55,260
They have suicides all over the
world where people can't keep up.

5056
02:15:55,261 --> 02:15:56,640
Farmers are committing suicide,

5057
02:15:56,641 --> 02:15:59,190
can't grow their own food again.

5058
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,870
They can't reuse seeds.

5059
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:02,470
They can't make their own seeds.

5060
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:02,710
Okay,

5061
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:05,310
so what's difficult to
get about the concept?

5062
02:16:05,311 --> 02:16:07,650
It's something like that
is just pure fucking evil.

5063
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:08,850
That's what it is.

5064
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:09,630
Exactly.

5065
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:11,430
The fact that that's not stopped.

5066
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:11,850
You know,

5067
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:12,511
it's amazing.

5068
02:16:12,511 --> 02:16:15,150
They didn't want to talk about gay
marriage and a time like this and that.

5069
02:16:15,151 --> 02:16:16,620
It's even discussed.

5070
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:18,580
You know that any of
this nonsense it gets,

5071
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:18,961
well,

5072
02:16:18,961 --> 02:16:19,331
you know what?

5073
02:16:19,331 --> 02:16:20,190
What about the debt?

5074
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:21,330
We got to push the debt back.

5075
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:22,770
What the fuck about this?

5076
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:23,790
What about everything?

5077
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:23,931
Well,

5078
02:16:23,931 --> 02:16:25,170
what about the whole pile of it?

5079
02:16:25,171 --> 02:16:26,640
It's Goddamn ridiculous.

5080
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:29,860
If design seeds to suicide
itself after one season,

5081
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,010
I

5082
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,000
was so scared.

5083
02:16:31,001 --> 02:16:34,240
But we've had some stories on collapsing
that recently that shows that the

5084
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:37,700
Monsanto supposedly bulletproof
seeds are producing mutations,

5085
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:39,400
which Monsanto can't control.

5086
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:43,540
There was like one that
was just released on us.

5087
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:43,990
Some,

5088
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:48,070
some major news source was talking about
the connection between animals having

5089
02:16:48,071 --> 02:16:49,270
tumors and their meaning.

5090
02:16:49,271 --> 02:16:51,580
Some corn that Monsanto
genetically modified corn.

5091
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:52,960
It's not for human consumption,

5092
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:56,200
but it doesn't matter because you're
fucking feeding it to animals.

5093
02:16:56,201 --> 02:16:58,420
Those animals might get
eaten by people and you know,

5094
02:16:58,421 --> 02:16:59,830
you don't know what the fuck goes through.

5095
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:00,190
You don't,

5096
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:01,023
they don't know.

5097
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:02,980
They don't know what the reaction is.

5098
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:07,330
A human body eating 20 years
of genetically modified
beef because we haven't

5099
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:07,950
done it yet,

5100
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:10,470
but now get that around the world.

5101
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:15,500
There are tens and hundreds of millions
of people moving to re localize to grow

5102
02:17:15,781 --> 02:17:16,740
organic food.

5103
02:17:16,741 --> 02:17:17,574
That's what I'm doing.

5104
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:18,773
Um,

5105
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:21,390
and to take control where we can.

5106
02:17:21,391 --> 02:17:22,830
And those are the faster campers.

5107
02:17:22,831 --> 02:17:24,660
Those are the ones who aren't
going to get eaten by the bear.

5108
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:29,750
What is going to be the big difference
between after the collapse and now what

5109
02:17:31,141 --> 02:17:34,590
is going to be more most inconvenient
about after the collapse?

5110
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:36,480
Are we going to have like crime issues?

5111
02:17:36,481 --> 02:17:38,010
We're going to have like roaming gangs.

5112
02:17:38,011 --> 02:17:39,790
That's going to be during
the collapse during the,

5113
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:40,930
that's all.

5114
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:42,100
That's all what's coming.

5115
02:17:42,130 --> 02:17:44,100
That's what's here now and
that's happening all over.

5116
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:46,630
We had the bloody Reiland
riots all over England.

5117
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:48,610
We had our MacArthur set on fire in Rome,

5118
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:50,050
the Arab spring,

5119
02:17:50,051 --> 02:17:50,261
you know?

5120
02:17:50,261 --> 02:17:50,351
Right,

5121
02:17:50,351 --> 02:17:50,480
right.

5122
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:51,860
But in general there's like,

5123
02:17:51,890 --> 02:17:54,110
you have a few things
that the like blipping up,

5124
02:17:54,111 --> 02:17:57,170
but if you look at the overall harmony
of the earth at any given moment,

5125
02:17:57,350 --> 02:17:59,630
most places are not in conflict,

5126
02:17:59,690 --> 02:18:00,230
right?

5127
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:02,630
Most places are just people
going about their business,

5128
02:18:02,631 --> 02:18:03,470
trying to live their life.

5129
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:06,440
What these spotted atrocities
popping up here and there.

5130
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:06,980
You know,

5131
02:18:06,980 --> 02:18:08,180
if you look at it on a,

5132
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:08,601
you know,

5133
02:18:08,601 --> 02:18:08,871
as a,

5134
02:18:08,871 --> 02:18:10,520
as an organism in conflict,

5135
02:18:10,521 --> 02:18:11,720
it's not in as much.

5136
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,760
It's not like a hundred percent conflict,

5137
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:15,263
eh,

5138
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:18,230
direct correlation between
that and population density.

5139
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:19,760
Big cities are not sustainable.

5140
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:22,760
And when you see things like Egypt,

5141
02:18:22,761 --> 02:18:23,151
like the,

5142
02:18:23,151 --> 02:18:23,350
these,

5143
02:18:23,350 --> 02:18:27,260
these crazy beatings or they're doing
the protesters in Egypt now and you see

5144
02:18:27,261 --> 02:18:27,701
like this,

5145
02:18:27,701 --> 02:18:29,600
this battle to control Iraq,

5146
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:33,520
do you think that that was engineered
that they knew that in a vacuum that you

5147
02:18:33,521 --> 02:18:33,651
know,

5148
02:18:33,651 --> 02:18:36,680
these puppet governments they put
in place would quickly fall apart?

5149
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:37,260
No.

5150
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:37,630
Well,

5151
02:18:37,630 --> 02:18:42,140
I really think the US government was a
cocky phlegm Boozell old cocky because we

5152
02:18:42,141 --> 02:18:42,800
built,

5153
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:47,360
and I have this in Rubicon three mega
basis there that were meant to be

5154
02:18:47,361 --> 02:18:48,710
permanent installations.

5155
02:18:48,711 --> 02:18:49,820
And I mean some of the largest,

5156
02:18:49,821 --> 02:18:51,830
most expensive military basis ever built.

5157
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,170
We built a,

5158
02:18:53,170 --> 02:18:53,450
uh,

5159
02:18:53,450 --> 02:18:56,240
an embassy compound
larger than Vatican City.

5160
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:57,080
You know,

5161
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:59,180
we're going to house like 8,000 people.

5162
02:18:59,181 --> 02:19:00,860
We plan to be there forever.

5163
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:03,020
So is why we get now it's just too crazy.

5164
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,640
This is the Roman Empire.

5165
02:19:04,641 --> 02:19:05,390
It's crumbling.

5166
02:19:05,390 --> 02:19:06,380
Jesus Christ.

5167
02:19:06,710 --> 02:19:07,850
This is the Roman Empire.

5168
02:19:07,851 --> 02:19:11,660
It's fall and the whole world can see
that the world starting to move much more

5169
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:16,550
closely into alignment with China
and China is imploding also.

5170
02:19:16,551 --> 02:19:17,990
That's the other catch to this.

5171
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:19,420
Uh,

5172
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:23,000
and the same thing is
happening with money as,

5173
02:19:23,001 --> 02:19:23,780
as it is with,

5174
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:27,290
with life and everything else is that
people are jumping to the next safest and

5175
02:19:27,291 --> 02:19:28,130
all they're doing is moving

5176
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,480
up one deck on the titanic

5177
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:32,960
to a deck that hasn't gone underwater yet

5178
02:19:33,310 --> 02:19:36,070
and hoping that their kids live to be,

5179
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:41,370
to miss the next big wave that they get
to stay alive and die before it all the

5180
02:19:42,131 --> 02:19:43,240
shit hits the fan again.

5181
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:43,880
I mean,

5182
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:44,950
can it be held back?

5183
02:19:44,951 --> 02:19:45,731
Is it a wave?

5184
02:19:45,731 --> 02:19:46,890
There's a come and go there.

5185
02:19:46,891 --> 02:19:49,240
I just have to completely
flat line and then rebuild.

5186
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:51,900
It won't be flat line across the board.

5187
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:53,970
When the Roman empire collapsed,

5188
02:19:53,971 --> 02:19:56,370
there were some small towns
that survived as pockets,

5189
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:57,091
you know,

5190
02:19:57,091 --> 02:19:58,260
of wisdom and you know,

5191
02:19:58,261 --> 02:19:58,460
we're,

5192
02:19:58,460 --> 02:20:00,390
some civilization was held for a while.

5193
02:20:00,510 --> 02:20:02,070
That's the way this is going to play.

5194
02:20:02,071 --> 02:20:05,340
There are going to be places
around the world that,

5195
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:05,521
uh,

5196
02:20:05,521 --> 02:20:06,770
that by virtue of,

5197
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:11,730
of climate there a orientation to
permaculture sustainable economies and the

5198
02:20:11,731 --> 02:20:14,790
skill sets they have that will
fare better than other regions.

5199
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:16,193
Um,

5200
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:19,830
I think basically the people in the cities
are fucked and if you stay in the big

5201
02:20:19,831 --> 02:20:20,101
city,

5202
02:20:20,101 --> 02:20:20,934
you're going to be fucked.

5203
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:22,070
No one,

5204
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:22,903
no food here.

5205
02:20:22,950 --> 02:20:24,750
It's only a three day food
supply in Los Angeles.

5206
02:20:24,751 --> 02:20:26,040
I graduated from Venice High School.

5207
02:20:26,041 --> 02:20:26,940
I went to Ucla,

5208
02:20:26,941 --> 02:20:27,650
you know,

5209
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:28,770
and uh,

5210
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,590
there's only a three day food supply in
the city and there's not enough fresh

5211
02:20:31,591 --> 02:20:32,041
water here.

5212
02:20:32,041 --> 02:20:33,750
We steal the water from
northern California.

5213
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:37,080
Las Vegas shouldn't even exist
and Phoenix is going to go under,

5214
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:38,250
I mean those cities,

5215
02:20:38,251 --> 02:20:38,430
right.

5216
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:40,020
Love the story of the salt and sea.

5217
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:41,250
This is one of my favorites.

5218
02:20:41,251 --> 02:20:41,701
I,

5219
02:20:41,701 --> 02:20:43,650
I've watched several documentaries,

5220
02:20:43,651 --> 02:20:47,100
read a bunch of things on and I've got
a whole coffee table book at home of

5221
02:20:47,101 --> 02:20:48,330
photos from the salt and sea.

5222
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:50,190
That's an amazing story in and of itself.

5223
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:55,170
And we just decided to get crazy and
create a civilization out there in the

5224
02:20:55,171 --> 02:20:57,450
middle of the desert where
they happened to Vegas easily.

5225
02:20:57,480 --> 02:20:57,690
Yeah.

5226
02:20:57,690 --> 02:20:58,523
Thanks sir.

5227
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:58,920
Wow.

5228
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:01,530
They're going to keep Vegas alive as long
as they can because this weekend it's

5229
02:21:01,531 --> 02:21:04,050
Brock Lesnar vs Alistair Overeem bitch.

5230
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,130
Oh,

5231
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:08,460
I mean you could live on stripper
milk for a couple of days extra,

5232
02:21:08,461 --> 02:21:09,294
I guess.

5233
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:15,240
And you could kill small animals
with their heels and if you know,

5234
02:21:15,241 --> 02:21:17,160
use their heels off projectiles.

5235
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:17,791
Listen,

5236
02:21:17,791 --> 02:21:18,900
there's all the squirrels.

5237
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:23,370
There's going to be some bizarre Darwinian
evolution and adaptations is this

5238
02:21:23,371 --> 02:21:24,204
thing falls apart.

5239
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:26,220
You're going to make it through how much,

5240
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:29,130
how much longer do you think it's going
to be before everything it was easy is a

5241
02:21:29,131 --> 02:21:31,710
50 year processes at a hundred
year probably we going to see this,

5242
02:21:31,711 --> 02:21:34,710
am I going to be alive to see
this new of same has happened

5243
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:35,021
much,

5244
02:21:35,021 --> 02:21:36,610
much faster than I thought it would.

5245
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:40,910
Especially with the deterioration
in the quality of US government and,

5246
02:21:40,911 --> 02:21:45,911
and the legality or honorable
nature of the u s government and,

5247
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:47,350
and the economic situation.

5248
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:48,993
Um,

5249
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:52,920
does it disturb you when you see Obama
and looking confident and talking about

5250
02:21:52,921 --> 02:21:57,080
his legacy as a president and disturb
you to see like this unaware mother

5251
02:21:57,081 --> 02:21:57,421
fucker?

5252
02:21:57,421 --> 02:21:58,350
Like what are you doing?

5253
02:21:58,351 --> 02:22:00,290
Why are you sitting there calm and,

5254
02:22:00,291 --> 02:22:01,620
and congratulatory,

5255
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:04,830
you know about your administration and
the accomplishments that you've achieved?

5256
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:07,980
Do you not see that the
fucking sky is falling?

5257
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:08,910
Do you not see it?

5258
02:22:08,910 --> 02:22:09,840
Look at you sitting there.

5259
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:11,880
You sit in there like a demure gentlemen.

5260
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:16,710
I've been so calm and so accustomed
to being in front of the camera

5261
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:17,490
was president.

5262
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:17,881
I mean,

5263
02:22:17,881 --> 02:22:21,240
it's like everybody in
Washington does the same thing.

5264
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:22,891
It's ridiculous.

5265
02:22:22,891 --> 02:22:24,060
You know those people.

5266
02:22:24,210 --> 02:22:24,811
That's why we're,

5267
02:22:24,811 --> 02:22:25,290
again,

5268
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:25,531
Ron.

5269
02:22:25,531 --> 02:22:26,580
Paul is so important.

5270
02:22:26,890 --> 02:22:27,481
Solar power,

5271
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:28,200
yes or no,

5272
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,070
should we get solar power?

5273
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:31,080
So if you can get it,

5274
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:36,130
it won't solve all the world's problems
and we need to stop buying that trap

5275
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:40,200
that we have to solve the problem for
the whole world before we take care of

5276
02:22:40,201 --> 02:22:41,034
ourselves.

5277
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,380
We need to take care of ourselves.

5278
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:43,240
Take our ourselves.

5279
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:45,040
Put Your own oxygen mask on first.

5280
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,431
Yeah.

5281
02:22:45,431 --> 02:22:47,890
It's not like we were
rushing out to fix Liberia.

5282
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:48,340
Right.

5283
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:48,820
You know,

5284
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:50,260
we know how bad it is over there.

5285
02:22:50,261 --> 02:22:51,910
I know now about it is in Somalia.

5286
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:52,390
We're not,

5287
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:53,800
we're not running over there to fix that.

5288
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:54,673
No.

5289
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:56,410
We take care of ourselves here first.

5290
02:22:56,411 --> 02:22:56,540
And,

5291
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:59,140
and those of us who
work to build community,

5292
02:22:59,141 --> 02:23:00,690
there's a great movement transition us.

5293
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:04,390
There's transition into Su
and initiatives about 111,

5294
02:23:04,391 --> 02:23:08,350
I think all over the country now in
cities all over the country where where

5295
02:23:08,351 --> 02:23:10,510
people are forming communities,

5296
02:23:10,511 --> 02:23:11,800
they're growing food locally,

5297
02:23:11,801 --> 02:23:13,000
they're networking with each other,

5298
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:15,220
they're working outside
of the economic system.

5299
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:18,790
They're learning skills that they're
going to need and we're all going to need

5300
02:23:18,791 --> 02:23:21,430
at some point learn how to live with
less power and things like that.

5301
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:22,890
And this movement is at,

5302
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:23,790
we have a uh,

5303
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:26,740
a directory on collapsed
at the light director,

5304
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:27,603
absolutely free.

5305
02:23:27,610 --> 02:23:32,610
1600 hand picked entries and you go in
and you look around this directory and

5306
02:23:32,711 --> 02:23:37,600
you realize that all over the world
there's all kinds of people working really

5307
02:23:37,601 --> 02:23:40,780
hard and have been for quite
some time to prepare to transit,

5308
02:23:40,781 --> 02:23:44,900
to live outside of the infinite
growth paradigm after peak oil and,

5309
02:23:44,901 --> 02:23:45,470
and,

5310
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:46,370
and it can be done,

5311
02:23:46,371 --> 02:23:48,050
but you have to do it in small groups.

5312
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:52,460
But then you have to be worried about
being raided by a mad hordes of fucking

5313
02:23:52,461 --> 02:23:54,350
scoundrels and zombies.

5314
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:56,030
Depends on the apocalypse.

5315
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,490
Zombie Apocalypse Thrill,

5316
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:58,270
right?

5317
02:23:58,270 --> 02:23:59,290
Most of the zombies,

5318
02:23:59,291 --> 02:24:02,320
I don't think we'll ever get out of the
big cities because so many people are so

5319
02:24:02,321 --> 02:24:03,080
out of touch.

5320
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:05,540
So the big cities or
just be like die offs,

5321
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:06,560
giant die offs.

5322
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:08,090
Just like there were for the Mayans.

5323
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:08,541
Right.

5324
02:24:08,541 --> 02:24:12,800
The Mayans left the giant temple's behind
and when they discovered him hundreds

5325
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:12,801
of years later,

5326
02:24:12,801 --> 02:24:13,670
they are covered in trees

5327
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:15,160
and there are people who are,

5328
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:18,850
have been putting a lot of
time into thinking about
how to defend what they have

5329
02:24:18,851 --> 02:24:20,200
if people come and try to take it.

5330
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:22,090
So what do you think about the,

5331
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:26,920
I guess it was the ATF saying that they
were going to stop people with medical

5332
02:24:26,921 --> 02:24:29,560
marijuana prescriptions
from buying new guns.

5333
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:33,160
They weren't going to allow you if you
get a prescription for medical marijuana

5334
02:24:33,161 --> 02:24:33,821
to own a gun,

5335
02:24:33,821 --> 02:24:35,840
which is whole areas.

5336
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:36,050
Yeah,

5337
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:38,080
I mean I live in Sonoma county where,

5338
02:24:38,090 --> 02:24:38,870
which is a,

5339
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:39,180
uh,

5340
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:41,260
illegal grow county and I handle that.

5341
02:24:41,290 --> 02:24:41,991
Have to get a,

5342
02:24:41,991 --> 02:24:42,460
uh,

5343
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:44,600
I have a letter because I had really bad,

5344
02:24:44,601 --> 02:24:45,434
I just,

5345
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,180
my thumb socket was shattered.

5346
02:24:47,210 --> 02:24:50,030
I mean that the socket was an eight
pieces and that's where all the nerves in

5347
02:24:50,031 --> 02:24:50,960
the hand come together.

5348
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:51,620
Oh Wow.

5349
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:52,700
And that happened.

5350
02:24:52,701 --> 02:24:54,980
And a horse horseback riding accident.

5351
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:56,330
And uh,

5352
02:24:56,330 --> 02:24:57,121
and I'm a horse one.

5353
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:58,010
I've been a horseman a long time,

5354
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,100
but uh,

5355
02:24:59,100 --> 02:24:59,580
so,

5356
02:24:59,580 --> 02:24:59,881
and,

5357
02:24:59,881 --> 02:25:00,860
and that works for me,

5358
02:25:00,890 --> 02:25:05,890
but I don't grow because I owned guns
and see that's a federal issue as opposed

5359
02:25:07,791 --> 02:25:08,810
to the state issue.

5360
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,513
Um,

5361
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,473
but you know,

5362
02:25:11,570 --> 02:25:12,470
all that stuff.

5363
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:13,780
I think it's a matter of growing.

5364
02:25:13,781 --> 02:25:15,790
I think you're not even allowed
to have a license for it.

5365
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:16,210
No,

5366
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:16,780
no.

5367
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:17,380
Is that what it is?

5368
02:25:17,380 --> 02:25:18,040
Okay.

5369
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:18,873
They don't care.

5370
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:19,631
So you can have a license.

5371
02:25:19,631 --> 02:25:20,464
You just can't grow.

5372
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:21,500
Is that what it is?

5373
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:22,010
Well,

5374
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,843
or you know,

5375
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:25,330
or feds wouldn't know that if
I was growing and owned guns,

5376
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:26,410
which I obviously do,

5377
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:27,320
you know,

5378
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:30,090
then they would come on
some federal pretext,

5379
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:30,460
you know?

5380
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:30,910
But

5381
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:33,490
how crazy is that that you could
have a prescription for Oxycontin,

5382
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:34,600
which he can't grow a plant.

5383
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:36,341
That's amazing.

5384
02:25:36,341 --> 02:25:36,701
You could,

5385
02:25:36,701 --> 02:25:38,590
you could have a gun and have
a prescription for oxies.

5386
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:42,760
How absurd is it to make a plant that
God created illegal to begin with?

5387
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:43,450
It's amazing.

5388
02:25:43,450 --> 02:25:44,860
Not only that one's killed nobody.

5389
02:25:45,150 --> 02:25:45,491
Yeah.

5390
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:46,390
You know nobody,

5391
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:49,060
I mean maybe some people who have had a
few wacky ideas while they were high and

5392
02:25:49,061 --> 02:25:50,110
it caused a few deaths.

5393
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:50,950
But listen,

5394
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:52,440
that's just people with wacky ideas.

5395
02:25:52,460 --> 02:25:53,710
You can't blame pot for that.

5396
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:56,080
So it's like Bill Hicks joke about a guy,

5397
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:57,610
young man and acid thought he could fly,

5398
02:25:57,611 --> 02:25:58,570
jumped off a building.

5399
02:25:58,571 --> 02:25:59,260
What a tragedy.

5400
02:25:59,260 --> 02:25:59,830
He goes,

5401
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:00,521
what an idiot.

5402
02:26:00,521 --> 02:26:01,331
If he thought he could fly,

5403
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:03,250
what did he test it off
on the ground first?

5404
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:04,240
You know,

5405
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,110
no one told him to jump
off the fucking Bruno.

5406
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:07,100
I was

5407
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:08,000
work and and and and,

5408
02:26:08,001 --> 02:26:09,370
and I've seen bad drugs,

5409
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:11,300
but the worst drug or that
has ever been out there is,

5410
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:12,460
is a angel dust.

5411
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:15,910
I had to fight people on Angel Dust
and it was the most ridiculous.

5412
02:26:15,911 --> 02:26:16,720
It was stupid.

5413
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:19,120
Buddy of mine got his finger bit
and often it was on angel dust.

5414
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:20,980
He didn't even realize it
until the next morning.

5415
02:26:21,330 --> 02:26:23,170
They have special purpose fucking finger.

5416
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:24,040
Yeah.

5417
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:26,620
I'm the only guy in the history of
LAPD to have been bitten in the left

5418
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:27,280
testicle.

5419
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:28,450
Oh,

5420
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:29,740
snap son.

5421
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:30,921
Was it from the sham?

5422
02:26:30,921 --> 02:26:31,481
Wow Guy.

5423
02:26:31,481 --> 02:26:32,470
Did it burst it?

5424
02:26:32,650 --> 02:26:33,483
No.

5425
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:36,100
Imagine if it was so,

5426
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:37,270
it just really hurt real bad.

5427
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:37,661
It was,

5428
02:26:37,661 --> 02:26:37,871
yeah,

5429
02:26:37,871 --> 02:26:38,291
it was a,

5430
02:26:38,291 --> 02:26:42,220
it was a little bitty five foot eight
guy on angel dust and I met him like God

5431
02:26:42,221 --> 02:26:43,054
on Angel Dusting.

5432
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:47,470
Went for the balls and while
he was holding a 35 inch
color console TV set above

5433
02:26:47,471 --> 02:26:47,980
his head,

5434
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:48,860
oh my God.

5435
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:50,110
Five of us controlled him.

5436
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:51,730
And we was strapped on a Gurney,

5437
02:26:51,731 --> 02:26:52,300
you know,

5438
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:53,710
thick canvas wraps on a Gurney.

5439
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:55,960
He broke the canvas strap over his leg,

5440
02:26:55,961 --> 02:26:58,060
gave himself a compound
fracture on my God,

5441
02:26:58,061 --> 02:27:01,210
and everybody went back to his leg and
I was at the head and he just went,

5442
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:02,231
oh.

5443
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:03,280
And he spit your balls.

5444
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:03,980
Holy Shit.

5445
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:04,451
You stop.

5446
02:27:04,451 --> 02:27:06,100
'Em Out is your ball okay?

5447
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:07,110
That's fine.

5448
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:07,943
Good for you.

5449
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:08,390
Yeah.

5450
02:27:08,390 --> 02:27:09,011
You got to stop.

5451
02:27:09,011 --> 02:27:11,920
That tore down all these years
since I bite in your balls,

5452
02:27:11,921 --> 02:27:12,754
you got to stop.

5453
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,360
My nickname was inspector clues.

5454
02:27:14,361 --> 02:27:14,481
Oh,

5455
02:27:14,481 --> 02:27:17,290
so you gotta go pride rules on that dude.

5456
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,431
Holy Shit.

5457
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:20,530
What's the most fucked up thing you
ever saw while you were working?

5458
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:21,383
It was a cop

5459
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,330
probably,

5460
02:27:24,330 --> 02:27:25,163
uh,

5461
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:26,280
a homicide.

5462
02:27:26,281 --> 02:27:27,114
Uh,

5463
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,200
I was a training officer.

5464
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:30,330
I was two striper,

5465
02:27:30,331 --> 02:27:31,530
Pete p three here in La,

5466
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:34,680
and I was at working in El car on a
Sunday and the south end of Wilshire,

5467
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:35,580
I worked in the jungle.

5468
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:36,210
Uh,

5469
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:40,980
that's where I came up as a cop and it
was a homocide and the Ra unit had gone

5470
02:27:40,981 --> 02:27:41,850
there and opened the door.

5471
02:27:41,851 --> 02:27:43,650
And this guy had been dead for three days.

5472
02:27:43,651 --> 02:27:46,680
Every window in the house
closed to the heat was on to 90.

5473
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,470
Oh my God.

5474
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:50,610
And the inside of the windows
were covered with maggots and,

5475
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:51,140
uh,

5476
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:51,490
and,

5477
02:27:51,490 --> 02:27:56,160
and I was the first officer on the scene
and it was a Sunday and I had to sit

5478
02:27:56,161 --> 02:27:58,320
with this stinker for five hours.

5479
02:27:59,320 --> 02:27:59,621
Yeah,

5480
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:00,640
I was the crime scene.

5481
02:28:00,641 --> 02:28:02,110
I had to protect the crime scene.

5482
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:02,441
Okay.

5483
02:28:02,441 --> 02:28:03,580
So when you protect the crime scene,

5484
02:28:03,581 --> 02:28:04,650
do you have to be on top of the body?

5485
02:28:04,651 --> 02:28:06,600
But how close do you see it?

5486
02:28:06,990 --> 02:28:07,520
No,

5487
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:08,040
I,

5488
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:09,720
I had control of the premises.

5489
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:11,910
I was standing right at the front door,

5490
02:28:11,911 --> 02:28:16,911
but the house was in and I had to keep
the door open and I was stuck with that

5491
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:18,150
for about five hours.

5492
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:18,250
It

5493
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:19,210
was only three days.

5494
02:28:19,211 --> 02:28:21,500
And he got that bad in
three days with heat.

5495
02:28:21,501 --> 02:28:21,711
Yeah.

5496
02:28:21,711 --> 02:28:21,941
And,

5497
02:28:21,941 --> 02:28:22,160
and

5498
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:22,390
what,

5499
02:28:22,390 --> 02:28:23,223
what was the summer?

5500
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:24,050
Yeah,

5501
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:27,860
so somebody just decided to do that to
accelerate the deterioration process.

5502
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:28,931
Who knows?

5503
02:28:28,931 --> 02:28:29,380
Uh,

5504
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:32,540
the guy was dead on the floor and he
had a marble lamp base embedded in his

5505
02:28:32,541 --> 02:28:32,960
skull.

5506
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:33,950
Oh Shit.

5507
02:28:33,951 --> 02:28:34,910
So he's on the floor,

5508
02:28:35,010 --> 02:28:35,271
flatten.

5509
02:28:35,271 --> 02:28:37,700
The lamp is sticking up
like this and Oh my God,

5510
02:28:37,701 --> 02:28:38,481
I'm stuck with sky.

5511
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:41,870
And I was talking to him for three or
four hours until the embedded in his

5512
02:28:41,871 --> 02:28:42,560
skull.

5513
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:43,490
Who killed him?

5514
02:28:43,650 --> 02:28:44,900
A lover.

5515
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:48,050
It was a homosexual killing Holla.

5516
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:48,920
Yeah.

5517
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:49,753
Look at that.

5518
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:53,240
It's a safety and gayness.

5519
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:54,103
No,

5520
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:55,033
dude,

5521
02:28:55,450 --> 02:28:55,851
dude,

5522
02:28:55,851 --> 02:28:58,010
we're looking to kill you
if you fuck other dudes.

5523
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,180
Um,

5524
02:28:59,180 --> 02:28:59,511
yeah.

5525
02:28:59,511 --> 02:29:00,140
So that,

5526
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:00,530
that's,

5527
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:01,820
that's one that really stands out.

5528
02:29:01,821 --> 02:29:05,870
I was in two shootings and a lot
of fights and a two shootings.

5529
02:29:05,871 --> 02:29:06,740
Where you got shot at?

5530
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:07,851
No,

5531
02:29:07,851 --> 02:29:09,740
a first shooting was a
guy trying to run me down,

5532
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:12,590
chasing me across the street with a car.

5533
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:17,591
I mean she wrong side of the street and
we were using a Smith and Wesson 38 one

5534
02:29:18,981 --> 02:29:20,420
58 grain lead ball ammo.

5535
02:29:20,421 --> 02:29:20,710
My,

5536
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:22,370
it's terrible bullet.

5537
02:29:22,430 --> 02:29:23,280
It's soft leaded.

5538
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:25,370
It ricocheted and bounced
off the guy's windshield.

5539
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:26,320
Oh my God.

5540
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:28,340
A second shooting was a drug dealer.

5541
02:29:28,341 --> 02:29:31,000
Sick to attack dogs on my
partner and I and I and,

5542
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:32,760
and I killed the dogs she needs,

5543
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:33,741
I didn't hesitate.

5544
02:29:33,741 --> 02:29:35,510
I just shot the shit out of the dogs.

5545
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:37,610
My partner was grateful.

5546
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:39,113
Yeah.

5547
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,330
You've had a crazy life too.

5548
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:41,871
Oh yeah,

5549
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:42,081
man.

5550
02:29:42,081 --> 02:29:42,291
I've,

5551
02:29:42,291 --> 02:29:43,124
I've done,

5552
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:46,190
you never finished telling us
about why you went to Venezuela.

5553
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:48,410
Was that about the Pat Tillman story?

5554
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:48,770
Yeah,

5555
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:49,341
that was,

5556
02:29:49,341 --> 02:29:50,174
um,

5557
02:29:50,610 --> 02:29:50,810
well,

5558
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,860
not only Pat Tillman,

5559
02:29:51,861 --> 02:29:52,641
but I was,

5560
02:29:52,641 --> 02:29:53,120
uh,

5561
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:57,050
you were one of the first people to
break the fact that Pat Tillman was not

5562
02:29:57,051 --> 02:30:00,140
killed in combat was in fact
killed by friendly fire.

5563
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:01,950
Pat Tillman's mom,

5564
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:02,800
Danny.

5565
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:03,121
Uh,

5566
02:30:03,121 --> 02:30:04,140
is what she goes by.

5567
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:04,800
Uh,

5568
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,633
Mary Tillman,

5569
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:06,470
uh,

5570
02:30:06,470 --> 02:30:07,650
sent me an email,

5571
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,460

my military affairs editor,

5572
02:30:11,490 --> 02:30:12,181

02:30:21,241 --> 02:30:22,074
I love the guy.

5578
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,380
And she was trying to get in touch
with Stan through from the wilderness.

5579
02:30:25,381 --> 02:30:26,910
And we had done a lot of expos ace.

5580
02:30:26,911 --> 02:30:31,911
And I went down to San Jose and I'm met
with Danny and she gave me like 2000

5581
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:35,910
plus pages of army records redacted,

5582
02:30:35,911 --> 02:30:36,100
you know,

5583
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:36,990
how black spots.

5584
02:30:37,770 --> 02:30:40,110
And so I spent the night copying those,

5585
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:40,800
um,

5586
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,630
every one of them in perfect order

5587
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:45,750
and I thousand,

5588
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,630
how long did that take?

5589
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,270
You do what you gotta do.

5590
02:30:50,050 --> 02:30:50,681
And uh,

5591
02:30:50,681 --> 02:30:51,514
so I copied him,

5592
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:53,140
took them back to our offices in Ashland,

5593
02:30:53,141 --> 02:30:53,531
Oregon.

5594
02:30:53,531 --> 02:30:55,960
And I flew Stan golf out and a standard,

5595
02:30:55,961 --> 02:30:56,471
most of the work,

5596
02:30:56,471 --> 02:30:58,360
but we totally broke down the army story.

5597
02:30:58,510 --> 02:31:00,880
And we published a seven part series,

5598
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:04,240
which was the basis of Henry
Waxman's hearings in the House,

5599
02:31:04,241 --> 02:31:06,010
governmental affairs committee over,

5600
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:06,580
uh,

5601
02:31:06,580 --> 02:31:06,851
the,

5602
02:31:06,851 --> 02:31:07,121
the,

5603
02:31:07,121 --> 02:31:09,110
the cover up and we brought,

5604
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:10,870
we got to six senior officers,

5605
02:31:10,871 --> 02:31:14,860
three general officer's a disciplined
and we forced on Roosevelt to resign.

5606
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:16,091
Well we were,

5607
02:31:16,091 --> 02:31:16,481
we were,

5608
02:31:16,481 --> 02:31:17,920
that's why Donald Ross summer resigned.

5609
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,003
Oh yeah,

5610
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:23,130
he resigned right when he was about to
be called before the Tillman hearings.

5611
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:24,353
Very suddenly.

5612
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:27,540
So then he can't be called
because he resigned.

5613
02:31:27,570 --> 02:31:28,620
And is that how you avoided it?

5614
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:29,230
I'm sorry.

5615
02:31:29,230 --> 02:31:31,350
Is it an amazing when they
have weird rules like that,

5616
02:31:31,351 --> 02:31:32,041
like Congress,

5617
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,720
like they can insider trade.

5618
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:37,950
It's not illegal for Congress to be inside
of trading is his resignation was the

5619
02:31:37,951 --> 02:31:38,940
quid pro quo.

5620
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:39,780
You know,

5621
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,850
he fell on his sword
because it went to Bush.

5622
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,740
He had went to Chaney and Bush,

5623
02:31:44,490 --> 02:31:44,970
um,

5624
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:45,360
and uh,

5625
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:47,190
a lot of crimes were covered with that.

5626
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:48,820
That was just a horrendous miscarriage.

5627
02:31:48,821 --> 02:31:51,390
And you believe that it was an accident
or do you believe that they killed him

5628
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:54,060
on purpose because he was
being very outspoken about his?

5629
02:31:54,061 --> 02:31:54,560
No,

5630
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:56,370
I what I believe is,

5631
02:31:56,371 --> 02:31:58,530
and I think enough time has
passed where I can say this.

5632
02:31:59,030 --> 02:31:59,240
Uh,

5633
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:00,150
and again,

5634
02:32:00,151 --> 02:32:03,060
I know a great many people in the
service and I know special forces.

5635
02:32:03,061 --> 02:32:05,280
I know rangers and I know a lot of guys.

5636
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:07,200
Pat Tillman had a very large ego.

5637
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,300
He was very outspoken.

5638
02:32:09,350 --> 02:32:10,590
He had all the right ideas.

5639
02:32:10,591 --> 02:32:11,850
He knew the war was bullshit.

5640
02:32:11,851 --> 02:32:13,290
He was talking out about it,

5641
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:15,660
but he was saying they fracked them.

5642
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:20,940
I think that Pat Tillman became a
ranger before he became a soldier.

5643
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:23,520
If that means anything to you,

5644
02:32:23,521 --> 02:32:25,740
it's like putting on a black
belt before you earn the green,

5645
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:26,950
you know?

5646
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:27,690
Uh,

5647
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:28,523
uh,

5648
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:33,000
and it was definitely a
really fubar situation.

5649
02:32:33,001 --> 02:32:35,460
I don't think it was a
planned premeditated murder.

5650
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:37,393
Uh,

5651
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,390
but I do kind of suspect that,

5652
02:32:39,391 --> 02:32:39,690
uh,

5653
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:39,991
his,

5654
02:32:39,991 --> 02:32:40,980
his last words were,

5655
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:45,420
I'm Pat fucking Tillman and that's one
of three round burst hit him in the head,

5656
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:47,550
you know,

5657
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:49,290
and so very sad,

5658
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:50,220
very tragic.

5659
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:52,440
And the people shooting
had this communication.

5660
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:57,720
The guy that shot him was a
sergeant in his own cereal,

5661
02:32:57,730 --> 02:32:58,770
a shooting,

5662
02:32:58,771 --> 02:33:01,380
a three round burst out of assault squad,

5663
02:33:01,381 --> 02:33:02,214
automatic weapon,

5664
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:03,743
30 yards.

5665
02:33:03,960 --> 02:33:05,340
Of course he knew what was going on.

5666
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:06,450
So you think he killed them?

5667
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:07,260
Yeah.

5668
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:08,093
Wow.

5669
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,150
Holy Shit.

5670
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:10,081
And you think he killed him?

5671
02:33:10,081 --> 02:33:11,490
Just because he was too outspoken,

5672
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:11,730
too.

5673
02:33:11,730 --> 02:33:13,500
Cocky didn't want it and
they didn't like him.

5674
02:33:13,501 --> 02:33:14,090
Fuck you.

5675
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:15,720
That's too much speculation.

5676
02:33:15,721 --> 02:33:16,141
Who knows?

5677
02:33:16,141 --> 02:33:16,470
Right.

5678
02:33:16,470 --> 02:33:17,071
But they using,

5679
02:33:17,071 --> 02:33:17,580
they killed them.

5680
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:18,413
Yeah,

5681
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:20,840
but not premeditated murder in,

5682
02:33:20,841 --> 02:33:20,971
in,

5683
02:33:20,971 --> 02:33:21,141
in,

5684
02:33:21,141 --> 02:33:21,371
in,

5685
02:33:21,371 --> 02:33:22,141
in that sense.

5686
02:33:22,141 --> 02:33:25,500
But what we do know is that
what the army did after that,

5687
02:33:25,501 --> 02:33:27,030
they destroyed evidence.

5688
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:28,170
They burned his clothing.

5689
02:33:28,171 --> 02:33:32,400
They immediately started the write
up for a silver star and all of that

5690
02:33:32,401 --> 02:33:33,960
criminality that followed,

5691
02:33:33,961 --> 02:33:37,140
rather than admit that he was killed
in a friendly fire accident by his own

5692
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:37,560
people.

5693
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:41,310
So were you the catalyst that forced
them to admit that it was friendly fire?

5694
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:42,593
Well,

5695
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:43,730
stand.

5696
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:45,680
Let's give the credit where
it's due to stand Goff.

5697
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:47,220
I was the publisher and the editor.

5698
02:33:47,221 --> 02:33:47,701
In other words,

5699
02:33:47,701 --> 02:33:52,380
I put my money in my balls on the line
and gave Stan golf everything he needed

5700
02:33:52,381 --> 02:33:53,880
to write a seven part series,

5701
02:33:53,881 --> 02:33:54,310
the tour,

5702
02:33:54,310 --> 02:33:56,610
the U S Army and Donald Rumsfeld,

5703
02:33:56,611 --> 02:33:57,450
new assholes.

5704
02:33:57,690 --> 02:33:58,091
So you,

5705
02:33:58,091 --> 02:34:00,170
you publish it in from the Wilderness.

5706
02:34:00,530 --> 02:34:00,810
It's,

5707
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:02,310
it's still on the website to this day.

5708
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:03,031
All seven parts.

5709
02:34:03,031 --> 02:34:04,600
And when we were in the Er,

5710
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,150
just ready to publish part five,

5711
02:34:06,151 --> 02:34:08,130
my offices were burglarized.

5712
02:34:08,131 --> 02:34:10,050
All seven of my computers were smashed.

5713
02:34:10,051 --> 02:34:10,740
Uh,

5714
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,480
one of my employees turned out of woman,

5715
02:34:12,481 --> 02:34:15,330
turned out to be trying to set me
up on a sexual harassment charge.

5716
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:16,920
There was a forge police report.

5717
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:19,010
Falsified police report connected to you.

5718
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:20,920
You weren't trying to show her your both?

5719
02:34:21,150 --> 02:34:21,540
No.

5720
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:22,380
So the girl,

5721
02:34:22,381 --> 02:34:22,860
um,

5722
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:23,190
when,

5723
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:25,820
when do you think that they came
to her and offered her something?

5724
02:34:25,870 --> 02:34:26,703
I think she,

5725
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:27,390
I think she,

5726
02:34:27,390 --> 02:34:28,111
she was a plant.

5727
02:34:28,111 --> 02:34:28,620
Yeah.

5728
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:28,771
Well,

5729
02:34:28,771 --> 02:34:29,020
you know,

5730
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:30,030
they have plants,

5731
02:34:30,031 --> 02:34:30,301
man.

5732
02:34:30,301 --> 02:34:31,081
It sounds ridiculous.

5733
02:34:31,081 --> 02:34:33,600
But there was a bunch of growers
in northern California and,

5734
02:34:33,601 --> 02:34:33,670
uh,

5735
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:36,660
they had a guy who would like
sit in on their meetings,

5736
02:34:36,661 --> 02:34:36,811
you know,

5737
02:34:36,811 --> 02:34:37,680
they would talk about like,

5738
02:34:37,681 --> 02:34:38,150
you know,

5739
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:39,300
you gotta have grown for the community.

5740
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:42,060
It's found out that guy was a cop
because he died in a motorcycle accident.

5741
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:43,231
The guy died.

5742
02:34:43,231 --> 02:34:43,861
And then they said,

5743
02:34:43,861 --> 02:34:45,880
that's our buddy at the fuck.

5744
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:49,040
And then sergeant fuck face
and spying on the whole time.

5745
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:49,390
Yeah.

5746
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:51,480
We'll use embedded in
a bunch of pot growers

5747
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:52,381
like,

5748
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:53,214
you know,

5749
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:57,570
talk about a waste of resources back to
back to Venezuela when computers were

5750
02:34:57,571 --> 02:34:58,050
smashed.

5751
02:34:58,050 --> 02:34:58,540
Um,

5752
02:34:58,540 --> 02:34:58,800
uh,

5753
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,350
my life was in danger and it was
obvious the only thing that could have

5754
02:35:01,351 --> 02:35:04,260
prevented us from finishing the Tillman
series would have been my death.

5755
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:06,593
Okay.

5756
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:07,470
So,

5757
02:35:07,470 --> 02:35:07,890
uh,

5758
02:35:07,890 --> 02:35:09,870
and I knew that they
were coming after me and,

5759
02:35:09,871 --> 02:35:10,340
and uh,

5760
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:12,150
and so I went to
Venezuela because Hugo go,

5761
02:35:12,151 --> 02:35:15,330
Chavez had spent like the last four
years going like that to George Bush and

5762
02:35:15,331 --> 02:35:17,430
Dick Cheney and tissue
actually hang out with,

5763
02:35:17,431 --> 02:35:18,290
you know,

5764
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:19,050
I,

5765
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:19,920
I never met him.

5766
02:35:19,921 --> 02:35:20,760
That was a really,

5767
02:35:20,761 --> 02:35:21,410
really hard,

5768
02:35:21,410 --> 02:35:22,680
a difficult time.

5769
02:35:22,681 --> 02:35:23,550
I was poisoned down.

5770
02:35:23,551 --> 02:35:25,980
Their foreign ministry
knew I was in the country.

5771
02:35:25,981 --> 02:35:26,701
I asked for help,

5772
02:35:26,701 --> 02:35:27,660
but they wouldn't touch me.

5773
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:29,820
They didn't want to contaminate me.

5774
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:32,220
They being poisoned with him.

5775
02:35:32,750 --> 02:35:33,240
Um,

5776
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:35,300
once was a drug called Buhloone Donga,

5777
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:37,830
which is the root drug was
cupola mean you could look it up.

5778
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:38,693
Uh,

5779
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:39,533
there was another,

5780
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:40,170
uh,

5781
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:41,060
unknown etiology.

5782
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:42,030
The Cuban doctors help,

5783
02:35:42,031 --> 02:35:42,910
but it was shutting down all,

5784
02:35:42,911 --> 02:35:44,450
all of my plans was systems.

5785
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:45,690
My adrenals were shutting down.

5786
02:35:45,691 --> 02:35:47,670
My Lips were shutting down to die.

5787
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:48,420
Yeah.

5788
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:48,661
Yeah.

5789
02:35:48,661 --> 02:35:49,530
So I came back,

5790
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:53,190
I came back to the u s in a,

5791
02:35:53,250 --> 02:35:54,083
actually to Canada

5792
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:54,400
first.

5793
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:55,690
It was so hoping you to say Fox,

5794
02:35:55,691 --> 02:35:56,524
Madison,

5795
02:35:56,870 --> 02:36:00,010
that's a badge of,

5796
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:00,650
that's who was,

5797
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:02,230
I'm going to hear Fox medicine forever.

5798
02:36:02,231 --> 02:36:02,890
I know.

5799
02:36:02,890 --> 02:36:03,260
That's a,

5800
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:04,210
that's a meme right now,

5801
02:36:04,211 --> 02:36:04,700
son.

5802
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:05,140
Okay.

5803
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,250
That's right up there with Giorgio.

5804
02:36:06,251 --> 02:36:07,210
Sucralose is hair.

5805
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:08,280
So,

5806
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:08,890
and uh,

5807
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:09,241
but I,

5808
02:36:09,241 --> 02:36:10,074
I got it.

5809
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,850
I was sick for probably
a full year after I came.

5810
02:36:12,851 --> 02:36:13,684
Holy Shit.

5811
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:16,540
And I did holistic and as much as I could,

5812
02:36:16,541 --> 02:36:16,991
but I was hot.

5813
02:36:16,991 --> 02:36:17,620
So you get,

5814
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:19,540
you got to death's door essentially,

5815
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:21,300
and there was nothing
they could do to save you,

5816
02:36:21,390 --> 02:36:23,680
then nobody knew what the
fuck are the Cuban doctors is.

5817
02:36:23,681 --> 02:36:24,790
We don't know what's causing this.

5818
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:25,330
Wow.

5819
02:36:25,330 --> 02:36:26,170
That's incredible.

5820
02:36:26,550 --> 02:36:27,730
That's so terrifying.

5821
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:31,720
But we got Tillman out and Tillman was
published and right after Donald Rumsfeld

5822
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:32,081
resigned,

5823
02:36:32,081 --> 02:36:33,070
I flew back to Canada.

5824
02:36:33,071 --> 02:36:37,660
Then I came back to New York and stayed
in Brooklyn for 14 months before I came

5825
02:36:37,661 --> 02:36:38,494
back out to,

5826
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:39,783
to venison.

5827
02:36:39,950 --> 02:36:43,460
So will you just moving around just
because you were worried about someone

5828
02:36:43,461 --> 02:36:44,330
finding where you were?

5829
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:44,810
Uh,

5830
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:45,261
no,

5831
02:36:45,261 --> 02:36:45,441
I,

5832
02:36:45,441 --> 02:36:45,890
I,

5833
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:46,723
you know,

5834
02:36:46,790 --> 02:36:49,550
Venezuela was a very
specific purpose because,

5835
02:36:49,551 --> 02:36:50,384
you know,

5836
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:51,350
I was,

5837
02:36:51,350 --> 02:36:53,440
we had something huge with Tillman and,

5838
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:53,651
and,

5839
02:36:53,651 --> 02:36:55,010
and I was sort of like an events.

5840
02:36:55,011 --> 02:36:55,820
They were going to kill me.

5841
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:57,080
How long did you stay in Vat as well?

5842
02:36:57,110 --> 02:36:57,830
Four months.

5843
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:58,663
Four months.

5844
02:36:59,240 --> 02:36:59,990
Uh,

5845
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:01,790
and then I was basically out of it.

5846
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,040
Uh,

5847
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:02,421
you know,

5848
02:37:02,421 --> 02:37:03,170
I was done,

5849
02:37:03,170 --> 02:37:03,740
uh,

5850
02:37:03,740 --> 02:37:04,340
food.

5851
02:37:04,340 --> 02:37:07,430
I came into an inheritance from my father
or that I had to fight for for three

5852
02:37:07,431 --> 02:37:07,641
years,

5853
02:37:07,641 --> 02:37:09,080
but in 2008 and I,

5854
02:37:09,081 --> 02:37:10,160
and I had this time,

5855
02:37:10,190 --> 02:37:14,540
this first time in like 30 fucking years
of fighting to breathe and catch my

5856
02:37:14,541 --> 02:37:14,841
breath.

5857
02:37:14,841 --> 02:37:16,070
I have to worry about shit.

5858
02:37:16,071 --> 02:37:18,020
And so I kind of caught up with myself,

5859
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:18,531
you know,

5860
02:37:18,531 --> 02:37:21,140
it's like you stop long enough and then
all your shit you did for like the last

5861
02:37:21,141 --> 02:37:23,450
three catches up and you absorb it.

5862
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:25,040
Um,

5863
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:25,910
and then,

5864
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:26,810
uh,

5865
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:28,280
was right about then that,

5866
02:37:28,281 --> 02:37:29,114
uh,

5867
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:30,380
Cynthia McKinney,

5868
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:31,273
my friend,

5869
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:32,541
black,

5870
02:37:32,541 --> 02:37:34,550
former black congresswoman from Georgia,

5871
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:35,503
Atlanta,

5872
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:36,493
very dear friend,

5873
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:38,630
she was the Green party nominee in,

5874
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:41,630
and she mentioned that she might like
to have me be a running mate in 2008.

5875
02:37:41,670 --> 02:37:41,871
I said,

5876
02:37:41,871 --> 02:37:42,890
are you out of your mind?

5877
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:44,510
But that's when I decided,

5878
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:44,960
well,

5879
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:47,450
we need a presidential energy policy.

5880
02:37:47,451 --> 02:37:50,630
This needs to get put into the peak
oil and all the issues about this.

5881
02:37:50,631 --> 02:37:52,670
And that became my book
confronting collapse.

5882
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:56,810
But then Chris Smith showed up from
blue mark films also in February of

5883
02:37:56,811 --> 02:37:57,644
[inaudible] nine,

5884
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:58,440
uh,

5885
02:37:58,440 --> 02:37:59,001
and said,

5886
02:37:59,001 --> 02:37:59,151
hey,

5887
02:37:59,151 --> 02:38:01,440
we'd Kinda like to make a
movie what's going on in it,

5888
02:38:01,441 --> 02:38:01,630
right.

5889
02:38:01,630 --> 02:38:02,451
Compelling movie.

5890
02:38:02,451 --> 02:38:03,580
And you think about a man who,

5891
02:38:03,581 --> 02:38:07,300
when the last time you saw a movie
where a dude just talks for 90 minutes,

5892
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:08,810
pretty fucking amazing.

5893
02:38:08,811 --> 02:38:11,250
And you can carry a movie
like that and not just carry,

5894
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:14,770
but it was really entertaining
as well as fucking terrifying.

5895
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:15,550
You know,

5896
02:38:15,550 --> 02:38:17,740
there were five shoots.

5897
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:20,140
Each shoot was about
12 to 14 hours on set.

5898
02:38:20,141 --> 02:38:21,300
It was a full Hollywood shoe.

5899
02:38:21,450 --> 02:38:23,860
So you would just drink coffee
and smoke cigarettes and rant.

5900
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:24,740
Yeah.

5901
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:27,530
And they were feeding me the
energy drinks and they'd have him.

5902
02:38:27,531 --> 02:38:29,600
It was so cold when we
first started shooting,

5903
02:38:29,601 --> 02:38:29,711
you know,

5904
02:38:29,711 --> 02:38:30,650
I'm in that blue suit,

5905
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:31,260
right.

5906
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:33,620
I would be sitting there and I cut.

5907
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:34,790
They bring in a blanket,

5908
02:38:34,791 --> 02:38:36,980
put two butane heaters
next to me until the color

5909
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:40,570
came back and then pull it out and then
start shooting again once when I was,

5910
02:38:40,571 --> 02:38:40,690
uh,

5911
02:38:40,690 --> 02:38:42,590
working for a Dave Chappelle.

5912
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:46,570
Did the Dave Chappelle show was filmed
this a fear factor of parody with Tyrone.

5913
02:38:46,571 --> 02:38:50,470
Big Ums is the crack head that he used
to do the character and he was on fear

5914
02:38:50,471 --> 02:38:53,530
factor and we were doing this in a
warehouse in Brooklyn and it was fucking

5915
02:38:53,531 --> 02:38:54,550
freezing man.

5916
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:57,640
And we all like huddled in front of these
blast furnaces and then I would have

5917
02:38:57,641 --> 02:38:59,770
to get out there in a short
sleeve shirt and you know,

5918
02:38:59,771 --> 02:39:01,930
or whatever the fuck I was
wearing at the time and be like,

5919
02:39:01,931 --> 02:39:04,200
I was on fear factor and
we were phrasing mad.

5920
02:39:04,210 --> 02:39:04,670
I mean,

5921
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:05,503
yeah,

5922
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:07,480
that's not good Brian.

5923
02:39:07,481 --> 02:39:08,740
That's a bad impression.

5924
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:09,820
Um,

5925
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:10,450
that's uh,

5926
02:39:10,450 --> 02:39:11,410
that's incredible man.

5927
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:12,363
So you,

5928
02:39:12,370 --> 02:39:13,091
you've really,

5929
02:39:13,091 --> 02:39:13,690
uh,

5930
02:39:13,690 --> 02:39:16,210
you've seen a lot of crazy
shit in your life from,

5931
02:39:16,211 --> 02:39:21,070
from the La police time to now to having
a movie made about you just sitting

5932
02:39:21,071 --> 02:39:22,870
there talking like,

5933
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:24,030
what a,

5934
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:27,400
what a crazy ride it's been
from being a cop to this.

5935
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:28,010
How that,

5936
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:28,843
how the fuck,

5937
02:39:29,050 --> 02:39:30,430
how did you get to this point,

5938
02:39:30,431 --> 02:39:30,670
man?

5939
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:31,600
Is this your destiny?

5940
02:39:31,990 --> 02:39:35,230
You do you feel it at certain point
in time obligated to disseminate this

5941
02:39:35,231 --> 02:39:36,064
information?

5942
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:36,501
Oh,

5943
02:39:36,501 --> 02:39:39,030
well this is the three stooges,

5944
02:39:39,031 --> 02:39:40,800
school of spiritual level ocean.

5945
02:39:40,830 --> 02:39:45,830
I mean it's like I have no doubt that
something larger than me tapped me and,

5946
02:39:47,821 --> 02:39:48,300
and,

5947
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:49,440
and gave you the ball.

5948
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:50,610
Yeah.

5949
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:51,001
And,

5950
02:39:51,001 --> 02:39:54,780
and has kept me and sustain me and really
kind of made jokes of any other plans

5951
02:39:54,781 --> 02:39:57,240
that I had along the way for what I
thought I wanted to do with my life.

5952
02:39:58,040 --> 02:39:58,440
Um,

5953
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:00,870
and I'm really aware of that
now and I'm living that,

5954
02:40:00,871 --> 02:40:01,111
you know,

5955
02:40:01,111 --> 02:40:03,210
spiritually connected to the fact that,

5956
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:04,080
you know,

5957
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:06,360
there is something really good out here.

5958
02:40:06,361 --> 02:40:11,361
There is something that's showing itself
on this planet now that's just in that

5959
02:40:11,701 --> 02:40:12,960
it's fair and that it's loving.

5960
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,100
It does have power,

5961
02:40:14,101 --> 02:40:14,581
I'm seeing.

5962
02:40:14,581 --> 02:40:15,060
Correct.

5963
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:16,650
It's like watching the matrix,

5964
02:40:16,651 --> 02:40:16,831
you know,

5965
02:40:16,831 --> 02:40:17,370
when the,

5966
02:40:17,370 --> 02:40:20,730
when the Matrix start on that little
bits of light start coming through and,

5967
02:40:20,731 --> 02:40:20,881
and,

5968
02:40:20,881 --> 02:40:21,960
and you know,

5969
02:40:21,961 --> 02:40:24,600
and all these people out
here in the world right now,

5970
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:28,260
they're living in a matrix that's
falling apart exactly like it did in the

5971
02:40:28,261 --> 02:40:28,621
movie.

5972
02:40:28,621 --> 02:40:29,040
It's like,

5973
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:29,131
oh,

5974
02:40:29,131 --> 02:40:29,540
wait a minute,

5975
02:40:29,540 --> 02:40:31,200
that there's a big hole in
that building over there.

5976
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:32,010
And there's this,

5977
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:34,800
that's metaphorically what we're
seeing happen all around us.

5978
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:39,210
And there's a lot of people who really
get that they're in a matrix and are

5979
02:40:39,211 --> 02:40:40,110
starting to move out.

5980
02:40:40,111 --> 02:40:43,800
And there's others who are equally moved
to try and go back and reinforce it.

5981
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:46,350
And those are people
making their own choices.

5982
02:40:46,351 --> 02:40:47,700
I think about which way
they're going to go.

5983
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:50,420
So you're not pessimistic,

5984
02:40:50,421 --> 02:40:51,440
you're optimistic.

5985
02:40:51,441 --> 02:40:53,960
A lot of people might think that
you're a doom and gloom guy,

5986
02:40:54,230 --> 02:40:55,550
but you're now you're know you're,

5987
02:40:55,551 --> 02:40:55,881
you're,

5988
02:40:55,881 --> 02:40:56,631
let's be happy.

5989
02:40:56,631 --> 02:40:58,190
We're going to get rid of the bad system.

5990
02:40:58,220 --> 02:40:59,420
We're going to get rid of the bad guy.

5991
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:01,890
There is a balancing that is taking place.

5992
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:03,540
It's long overdue.

5993
02:41:03,810 --> 02:41:04,643
It's a,

5994
02:41:04,700 --> 02:41:06,420
it's as a doc holiday would say.

5995
02:41:06,421 --> 02:41:07,254
It's a reckoning.

5996
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:08,810
What an amazing time to be alive.

5997
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:09,531
You know,

5998
02:41:09,531 --> 02:41:10,310
it really is.

5999
02:41:10,310 --> 02:41:12,110
It's an amazing time to be,

6000
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:12,500
uh,

6001
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:16,040
at the point in human history and the
history of this planet and the history of,

6002
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,903
you know,

6003
02:41:17,690 --> 02:41:18,021
it just,

6004
02:41:18,021 --> 02:41:21,320
it's all very strange that it's all
taking place in our lifetime right now.

6005
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:23,000
And this is a really,

6006
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:24,170
it's an amazing moment.

6007
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:25,033
You know,

6008
02:41:25,070 --> 02:41:25,821
I hope we get through it.

6009
02:41:25,821 --> 02:41:26,654
Cool.

6010
02:41:26,690 --> 02:41:29,270
I hope we all keep our eyes open because,

6011
02:41:29,271 --> 02:41:30,020
uh,

6012
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:30,380
uh,

6013
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:32,090
even though these are
the darkest of times,

6014
02:41:32,091 --> 02:41:35,600
this is also an age of miracles and we
need to just keep ourselves open to the

6015
02:41:35,601 --> 02:41:39,020
expectation that good things can
happen without our permission.

6016
02:41:39,021 --> 02:41:39,890
And there's wisdoms.

6017
02:41:39,950 --> 02:41:40,310
Uh,

6018
02:41:40,310 --> 02:41:40,551
you know,

6019
02:41:40,551 --> 02:41:42,470
there's a lot of other
wisdom out here in this.

6020
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:45,530
There's a lot of light shone through and
that's one of the reasons why occupied.

6021
02:41:45,550 --> 02:41:46,280
Just just,

6022
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:46,670
you know,

6023
02:41:46,670 --> 02:41:47,720
makes my toes wiggle.

6024
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:50,840
There's never been a time in human
history where the access to information is

6025
02:41:50,841 --> 02:41:51,261
easier.

6026
02:41:51,261 --> 02:41:53,030
And when the access to
information is easy,

6027
02:41:53,031 --> 02:41:54,140
people can get the truth out.

6028
02:41:54,141 --> 02:41:57,980
When people can get the truth out and
they can get ideas out and they can get an

6029
02:41:57,981 --> 02:42:01,250
ideology of happiness
and of sustaining your,

6030
02:42:01,251 --> 02:42:01,521
your,

6031
02:42:01,521 --> 02:42:01,790
you know,

6032
02:42:01,790 --> 02:42:03,140
your environment and of,

6033
02:42:03,141 --> 02:42:03,440
of,

6034
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:07,820
of subsistence and of a community
and of love and friendship,

6035
02:42:08,060 --> 02:42:09,740
it's very possible to
foster that and grow.

6036
02:42:09,770 --> 02:42:09,951
You know,

6037
02:42:09,951 --> 02:42:11,420
we don't have to all be conquerors.

6038
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:14,060
We don't have to be all
caught raping the world.

6039
02:42:14,090 --> 02:42:15,110
It doesn't have to be that way.

6040
02:42:15,111 --> 02:42:15,400
That's right.

6041
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:15,890
Right.

6042
02:42:15,890 --> 02:42:19,040
We can just be human beings and enjoy
our time here because it is in fact

6043
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:24,020
temporary and like all sorts of patterns
of behavior that people get stuck in,

6044
02:42:24,021 --> 02:42:28,370
whether it's fucking gambling or excessive
masturbation or whatever the fuck you

6045
02:42:28,371 --> 02:42:29,204
get hooked on.

6046
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:30,980
You can also get hooked
on running the world.

6047
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,080
You can also get hooked
on fucking over the world.

6048
02:42:33,081 --> 02:42:34,070
So these people are sick.

6049
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:35,180
They're sick,

6050
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:36,190
and they need to wake up,

6051
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:40,700
need to pay attention to Michael Ruper
bitches because he just dropped some

6052
02:42:40,701 --> 02:42:41,534
science.

6053
02:42:41,630 --> 02:42:41,901
Thank you,

6054
02:42:41,901 --> 02:42:42,141
sir.

6055
02:42:42,141 --> 02:42:42,800
That was awesome.

6056
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:44,000
That was great time,

6057
02:42:44,001 --> 02:42:44,271
man.

6058
02:42:44,271 --> 02:42:45,800
There was one of my
favorite podcasts ever.

6059
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:47,450
He said some awesome shit.

6060
02:42:47,451 --> 02:42:48,284
And we do pleasure.

6061
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:49,160
I,

6062
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:49,341
man,

6063
02:42:49,341 --> 02:42:51,230
we've been doing it for
two hours and 40 minutes.

6064
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:51,590
She,

6065
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:52,100
I just,

6066
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:52,400
you know,

6067
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:52,521
I,

6068
02:42:52,521 --> 02:42:56,540
I just got so you could sit for 16 hours

02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:57,101
Do you have a Twitter?

6107
02:43:57,101 --> 02:43:57,731
You don't have a Twitter,

6108
02:43:57,731 --> 02:43:58,270
do you?

6109
02:43:58,270 --> 02:43:58,961
We got everything.

6110
02:43:58,961 --> 02:43:59,111
Yeah.

6111
02:43:59,111 --> 02:44:01,610
But you can find
everything@collapsenet.com [inaudible]

6112
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,890
collapsed net.com.

6113
02:44:02,891 --> 02:44:03,461
What is your Twitter?

6114
02:44:03,461 --> 02:44:06,580
I want to follow you on Twitter
Max is my Twitter collapse.

6115
02:44:06,830 --> 02:44:07,810
Net collapse net.

6116
02:44:07,930 --> 02:44:08,790
What about Michael Rubric?

6117
02:44:08,791 --> 02:44:10,690
Was that taken Michael?

6118
02:44:10,691 --> 02:44:11,800
See Rupert on Twitter.

6119
02:44:11,801 --> 02:44:12,190
Would that be

6120
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:13,320
better than collapse net?

6121
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:15,340
So that way people could
look you up tiny late.

6122
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:19,480
Somebody just jacked it right now as
we said that some little hacks or kid.

6123
02:44:19,481 --> 02:44:19,991
I got it.

6124
02:44:19,991 --> 02:44:20,824
Huh?

6125
02:44:20,830 --> 02:44:21,400
Well there's an,

6126
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:23,390

Michael Rupert and yeah,

6127
02:44:23,410 --> 02:44:25,960
it was a photog named Mike Michael Rupert.

6128
02:44:25,961 --> 02:44:27,790
That's why I use the seat
because they just didn't get it.

6129
02:44:27,791 --> 02:44:28,480
You know,

6130
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:30,460
people calling them up saying
you're crazy conspiracy

6131
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:33,020
Harlow conspiracy theory and it's a scene.

6132
02:44:33,170 --> 02:44:34,003
What are the odds?

6133
02:44:34,130 --> 02:44:37,620
I got a show this Friday at
the icehouse here with uh,

6134
02:44:37,730 --> 02:44:39,080
some people I can't talk about,

6135
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:40,760
but tickets are on sale right now.

6136
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:42,080
How can we keep talking about the people?

6137
02:44:42,110 --> 02:44:42,620
Yeah.

6138
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:42,800
Oh,

6139
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:44,000
cause it's a surprise.

6140
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,710
Oh,

6141
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:46,020
you don't know who the
fuck's on me on the show?

6142
02:44:46,050 --> 02:44:46,161
No,

6143
02:44:46,161 --> 02:44:46,580
I do.

6144
02:44:46,580 --> 02:44:48,830
You gotta wait you to say that's
how you advertise your fuck.

6145
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:49,221
Well,

6146
02:44:49,221 --> 02:44:52,560
I'll be announcing a few of them on
Twitter in the next couple of days.

6147
02:44:52,730 --> 02:44:53,940
Trying to get people
to follow your Twitter.

6148
02:44:53,941 --> 02:44:54,580
Is that what you're doing?

6149
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:54,760
No,

6150
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:54,881
no,

6151
02:44:54,881 --> 02:44:55,070
no.

6152
02:44:55,070 --> 02:44:55,430
Rick.

6153
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:56,660
Now there's other people who was on the,

6154
02:44:56,661 --> 02:44:57,111
God damn sure.

6155
02:44:57,111 --> 02:44:57,550
I can't,

6156
02:44:57,550 --> 02:44:59,230
I cannot because there's
a reason why I came.

6157
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:01,010
The reason sucks.

6158
02:45:01,010 --> 02:45:01,371
I know.

6159
02:45:01,371 --> 02:45:02,960
Can you explain the reason?

6160
02:45:03,170 --> 02:45:04,003
Um,

6161
02:45:04,010 --> 02:45:07,600
because there's other bigger
shows around the same day.

6162
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:09,470
Can't advertise and they
don't want to be like,

6163
02:45:09,500 --> 02:45:09,660
oh,

6164
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:10,820
you could see me 50 bucks.

6165
02:45:10,821 --> 02:45:11,820
Here it be a good show.

6166
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:13,730
That's why I just do it.

6167
02:45:13,731 --> 02:45:14,091
I mean,

6168
02:45:14,091 --> 02:45:14,811
I have those shows.

6169
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:15,890
I just do them anyway here.

6170
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,190
Yeah.

6171
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:17,420
Tell people to stop being pussies.

6172
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:19,100
Tell people where the
fuck are you going to be.

6173
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:19,550
Right.

6174
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:20,383

6175
02:45:20,510 --> 02:45:23,030
But goddammit icehouse

6177
02:45:24,261 --> 02:45:25,440
We're going to try to
get him in this week.

6178
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:25,700
Shit.

6179
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:26,070

6182
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,381
And uh,

6183
02:45:27,381 --> 02:45:27,621
we'll,

6184
02:45:27,621 --> 02:45:29,660
we'll do at least two podcasts this week.

6185
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:30,051
All right.

6186
02:45:30,051 --> 02:45:30,710
I love you freaks.

6187
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:31,430
See you soon.

6188
02:45:31,430 --> 02:45:31,730
