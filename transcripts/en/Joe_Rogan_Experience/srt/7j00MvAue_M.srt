1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,470
Freak bitches,
what?

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,700
Whatever it is.
Somebody who has thinks they have the

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,880
truth with a capital t,
which is called a fundamentalist.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,880
We're all fundamentalists.
You know,

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,920
we all have aspects of our personalities
and our belief systems that are

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,660
fundamentalist.
If you asked me about sugar,

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,020
I'll wax poetic.
I'll tell you all about the evils of

8
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,150
sugar and I really believe I'm right
now.

9
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,220
I have a lot of data and science behind
me,

10
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:24,870
but I,
I,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,270
you know,
I have all kinds of ideas about why

12
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,220
sugar is bad and fat and proteins.
Good for you because you know,

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,060
I've lived in and I've done it.
I'm sure you have your own point of

14
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,680
view.
I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

15
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,920
today and it was damn good and it was
damn good and you didn't hurt anybody

16
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,570
including you probably didn't hurt
yourself.

17
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,690
So sometimes because you're not a
fundamentalist because every now and

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,110
then.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,820
Thank you.
Thank glass of milk.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,673
Ooh,
was good.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,650
But the little glass of milk I hope is
raw milk,

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,360
but I love raw milk.
Raw milk is the shit.

23
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,760
I get the raw cope milk from Erewhon and
go deep,

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,760
you know,
you can get to hold,

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,470
hold on your horses and I think it's
about $35.

26
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,420
I've never bought it,
but you can get camel milk.

27
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,650
Whoa.
Oh yeah.

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,060
What?
Talk about the Middle East.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,070
The Bedouin famed for their sexual
prowess lived on camel milk.

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,730
You mean milk?
Like as in titty milk or something?

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,520
Cox.
No,

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,851
no,
no.

33
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm talking about content.
No,

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,470
I mean teddy milk milk,
right?

35
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,770
Wink wearing.
No Man.

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm not talking about Dick Milk.
I'm talking about.

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,930
I'm not talking about guide cream.
You're fucking talking about fucking

38
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,270
camel milk from their auditors.
Now.

39
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,470
These Russian cats.
Yeah.

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,830
So you were hanging out with in the
Ukraine.

41
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,250
We climbed up on the tower.
There's a lot of those guys.

42
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,060
So a lot of videos.
Yeah.

44
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,060
Like what is it about Russians and
climbing on what,

45
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,400
what is it about these crazy kids and
why they're so nutty?

46
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,580
I don't know.
That's something I've been trying to

47
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,340
figure out.
Like I've,

48
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,180
I've only been to Ukraine.
I haven't been to Russia,

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,090
but there's not much.
Like there's not much going on that,

50
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,050
you know,
there's not much to live for in Russia

51
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:58,060
or Ukraine.
I don't want to sound mean,

52
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,160
but I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,620
Yeah.
And there's so much that just familiar

54
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:05,650
with death and violence and stuff like
that.

55
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,080
Like Mustang,
he goes out,

56
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,750
I don't know,
every week and goes like organized

57
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,910
fights,
just like street fights and just beats

58
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:16,440
the hell out of brandon people.
That to me is like,

59
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,270
so he owned me.

60
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,250
He does those English boy,
those organized treat fights where they

61
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,560
like five guys take on five guys like
big groups.

62
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,700
I've seen those.
Yeah,

63
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,870
he's,
he does that.

64
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,280
And I was like,
what?

65
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,710
So he just does everything crazy.
Yeah.

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,370
Wow.
Yeah.

67
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,950
Whoa.
And he just.

68
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,840
Does it offer the thrill?
Yeah,

69
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,550
I think so.
Damn.

70
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,000
What a weird way to live.
I know.

71
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,620
It's a weird way to have your brain
wired.

72
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,770
It was such an interesting kind of
insight when I was there and it'd be

73
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:45,191
like,
Hey,

74
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,580
take a piss in front of me.
You know how weird that is?

75
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,050
Real weird.
They gotta look at Your Dick,

76
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,940
right?
The other issue I have a rubber Dick.

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,420
No,
for real.

78
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,540
So many people have been caught with
those wizard Nader's.

79
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,080
Now what you do is you put bleach under
your finger now or the special.

80
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,110
That's like no advanced.
That's what Joey Diaz says.

81
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,730
Yeah.
She said he put it.

82
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,020
He put clorox under the skin of his
Dick.

83
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,550
He was talking about it.
I one time said he put Draino there too

84
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,403
much.

85
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,250
I used to put coffee on my balls when I
went to court,

86
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,740
the coffee,
I put it in a plastic bag in a rubber

87
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,040
band and wrap it around my school and go
to court.

88
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,530
But he looked like a pimp because it's
going to court every month.

89
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,470
Urine like 50 people in a jail cell.
Right.

90
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,040
And you're just right there and nothing
to do.

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I want some coffee on me.
It's like that.

92
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:42,340
And then everyone was shooting it and
it's like when you're in there,

93
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,620
you want it to be just like this.
Hey man,

94
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,610
there's no responsibility but just to be
cool and be strong and fucking let's

95
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,540
have fun.
Dog.

96
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,170
Wow.
So you knew to keep coffee on your ball

97
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,950
so that you could have it once you'd be
in prison?

98
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,800
No,
this is when I

99
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,210
know that I'm already in prison.
Sometimes you've got to go to court.

100
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,340
So I was going to court to get my
license back because you have the right

101
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,830
to get your license back.
Even though you're in prison,

102
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,210
you still have the right.
So they're like,

103
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,691
all right,
fuck it.

104
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:17,170
We'll send you.
So I tied it because knowing like eight

105
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,820
or there's not going to be no coffee for
us,

106
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:22,300
but when I pull up to this and the home
is going to be like because you don't

107
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:27,220
get in trouble for sneaking coffee.
They'll just like a stupid ass talk shit

108
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,240
to you.
But it was,

109
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,160
it was just like bragging,
having fun.

110
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,970
Right.
Sorry.

111
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:32,804
That was weird.
Huh?

112
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,990
That's funny though.
That's hilarious.

113
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,940
Thinking about balls and coffee together
and no one's even like,

114
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,420
oh watch out is no one gives a phone
spoon.

115
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,650
Spoon,
spoon.

116
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,160
Home wise there's,
there's hot water in the restroom at

117
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,870
there.
We'd get it from the sink.

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,020
Pretty Weird.
Strange.

119
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,570
When you think about it or does it.
