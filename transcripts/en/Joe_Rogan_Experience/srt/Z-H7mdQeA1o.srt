1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
Nodoz

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,490
motherfucker,
my voice is froggy to like get them.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,560
Thank you for.
I gotta go tenor.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,723
Okay,
good tenor.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Thank you for having me.
We were talking about opera before we

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,190
started the podcast and that I was
saying that those people are like

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,350
aliens,
like what they can do with their voice

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,730
is so far beyond.
I kinda like I could look at someone

9
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,890
doing a backhand spring and I was like,
okay,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,340
I bet if I practiced for a long time I'd
figured out how to do that.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,730
I would need some help but it takes some
time but that doesn't seem

12
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,400
insurmountable,
but what I hear,

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,430
yeah,

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,890
I hear these fucking dudes or

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,410
I can't imagine it.
That has to start with some kind of

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,590
natural gift.
I guess it's maybe it's just like

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,020
getting them when they're really young
and then developing those muscle ups

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,300
talking totally out of my ass.
But you know who used to opera saying

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,070
Jim Jefferies did really.
Jim Jefferies was like a legit opera

20
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,010
singer apparently that crazy.
I know Jim very well.

21
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm surprised I didn't know that at all.
I didn't either thing he told me on the

22
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,290
podcast,
I thought it was coke guy.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,630
Got a family?
No,

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,560
he's a general.
He used to sing opera and uh,

25
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:29,120
apparently he had like,
what was it,

26
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,850
like nodes on his throat that he had
gift cert polyps.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,390
Polyps.
So you had to get surgery on his throat.

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,250
A gym.
If I'm fucking this up,

29
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,730
I apologize.
But uh,

30
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,080
he had to get surgery in his throne and
killed his singing short is opera

31
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,650
career.

32
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,120
Well,
I don't know if he really wanted a

33
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,680
career in it and who's doing some acting
stuff and shit too.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,420
I mean he's a guy like,
you know,

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,720
he's like this,
he's,

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
he's at his best doing stand up.
Everybody wants to chase other shit on

37
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,860
top of the stand up.
Sure.

38
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,940
But when it comes down to it,
like the standup is the most fun,

39
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,710
it's always going to be the most fun,
you know that.

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,470
And I do think radio in a capacity as.
Oh yeah,

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,120
there were similar,
like a similar beast.

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,410
Well,
what this is cool is like it allows

43
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,220
someone who's not near us to have a good
time talking to a guy like,

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,530
you know what I mean?
It's like,

45
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,060
no,
absolutely it does.

46
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,930
It brings people in.
You know,

47
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,050
your is great.
I think.

48
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,190
I think it feeds the same beast as
comedy.

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,210
It's also when you're live it's like
immediate reactions to like as soon as

50
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,780
you're done you check social media or
anything and people like the feedback is

51
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,190
immediate.
Just like when you're on stage,

52
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,000
you know?
Yeah,

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,670
there's definitely that.
Definitely that aspect of it.

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,840
But it's also cool aspect because it
allows people to kind of work out ideas,

55
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,400
workout ideas in the sort of open forum,
you know,

56
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,580
talk about stuff and it's.
So.

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,990
There's so many different places that
people don't do that though.

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,560
They really just stick to the 25 minutes
they were so on and just do forever.

59
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah.
Well as far as standups.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,590
Yeah,
that's brutal.

61
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,290
I mean that used to go across the board.
I was such a fan of comedy growing up,

62
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,520
but I remember like you'd see people in
like five,

63
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,750
six TV shows and you're like,
Holy Shit.

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,980
Like I know their act.

65
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,530
Yeah.
That was a problem in the early days,

66
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,940
right before the early to mid.
Like I guess like all through the

67
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,880
eighties.
I think in a weird way,

68
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,900
def jam really did like make comedy,
have to step his game up across the

69
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,000
board,
not as a comedy on that was always that

70
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,400
great.
But I mean like it brought it back until

71
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,050
like,
you can't just be like,

72
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,610
you know,
standing there with your blazer sleeves

73
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,660
rolled up and,
you know what I mean.

74
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,180
You might have to like just show a
different version of comedy act.

75
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,450
Really attacking the people with it,
doing comedy at people.

76
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,610
Yeah.
There's a few examples of that,

77
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:42,941
right?
Like,

78
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,740
Kennison was definitely an example of
that.

79
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,320
Kennison came out.
I remember,

80
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,330
um,
I've probably have told this story.

81
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:51,760
I apologize.
Have you heard anybody listening?

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,540
But,
uh,

83
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,760
I found out about Kennison through a
girl that worked with.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,550
I was 19.
I was working at the Boston athletic

85
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,650
clubs,
like this little health club and that

86
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,140
was a teaching people how to lift
weights and shit.

87
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,360
And uh,
this girl who worked at the front desk

88
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,490
was hilarious.
She was just like big volleyball check.

89
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,300
She was like six feet tall but fucking
hilarious.

90
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,510
She was like,
she had gotten into standup.

91
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,080
This girl was really funny and she was a
fan of standup and she knew that I was a

92
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,500
fan of standup too.
So she told me about this guy who was

93
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,840
doing this bit about these dead people
getting fucked in the ass.

94
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,160
She said,
she said his name is Sam kinison and how

95
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,240
she did the bit she laid on the Sam
candidate had an all time classic bit

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,800
and it was about a homosexual.
Necrophilia acts was about gay guys are

97
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,330
paying to fuck dead bodies and she did
the bit in the parking lot of the

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,310
athletic club.
She got down on her stomach and she was

99
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,620
like,

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,980
oh,
life keeps fucking in the ass even after

101
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,780
you're dead.
It never ends.

102
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,600
And she made me laugh so hard that I
couldn't imagine what this guy was like.

103
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,010
So he was like a mythical creature by
the time I saw him on a vhs tape,

104
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,130
I got a hold of a vhs tape.
He wasn't even like,

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,460
I don't even think blockbuster was
around then it was like this little mom

106
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,490
and pop places or places that had a name
that I don't even remember.

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,370
I got a vhs tape of Sam Kennison and I
remember going,

108
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,230
Holy Shit.
Like,

109
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,330
this is comedy too.
Yeah.

110
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,320
Whoa.
Yeah.

111
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,170
He was.
So yeah,

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,670
for me that that person was dice.
I always say he was the guy where I was

113
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:18,941
like,
oh,

114
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,770
this is.
I loved stand up comedy and like this is

115
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,930
a different thing.
It's funny,

116
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,380
my dice is,
you got to watch him age from like a

117
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,550
young guy to like where he is now.

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,510
We lost Sam Kinison so young,
but he always looked 40.

119
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,840
Like Sam kinison never looked here.
You always have like a 40 year old,

120
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:38,170
like your uncle who will come over.
But his star appearances were like

121
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,190
legendary.
Well he was.

122
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,790
He just went for a man who was such a
pioneer.

123
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,740
It's,
it's hard to imagine,

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,770
but all guys like us,
like those guys,

125
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,170
if it wasn't for them,
we will be so far behind as far as like

126
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,990
what we can and can't say what we can
and can't get away with what,

127
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,010
what is and isn't taboo and what,

128
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,560
what and also the,
the,

129
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,960
the recognition that when someone's
saying something fucked up like that,

130
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,300
he's,
he's doing it for humor.

131
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,360
That's it.
It's no different than someone making a

132
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,840
movie about someone shooting people.
They're not actually killing people.

133
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,710
Like it's not like the intent behind it.
Intent behind it is humor and

134
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,260
entertainment,
which people do have to get a grip on

135
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,150
better.
But I also think that like,

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,860
even like that def jam version of comedy
should pay more homage,

137
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,420
I think to like Sam kinison dice very
much because that was like,

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,810
to my knowledge,
we're the first braggadocious comedy.

139
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,880
Most comedies brooded in such like self
deprecation with dice,

140
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,470
but Sam kinison till was never a belly.
He never talked about being like a big

141
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,550
fat guy or it was always outward.
Yeah,

142
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,190
I know,
I know the answers and you idiots got to

143
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,270
listen to me and dice was more of like,
you know,

144
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,960
how great he is and everything,
but that is like,

145
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,700
that's the,
I think the main difference between like

146
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,740
that black circuit comedy and like the
mainstream circuit because the

147
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,790
mainstream circuit is not white comedy,
but the black circuit comedy is its own

148
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,500
kind of beast and that still has all
the,

149
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,930
you know,
I got a big old Dick and I'd be choking

150
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,970
the bitches with it because one bitch
last night and you're like,

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,580
wow,
who are you relating to?

152
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,110
All these black people in the room.
Well it was also the rap culture,

153
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,080
which is very braggadocious as well,
you know?

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,680
Sure,
yeah.

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,110
There's like a bunch of things going on,
a bunch of different elements,

156
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,111
but for sure just as the art form for
the art form as a whole dice is super

157
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,480
important and kinison and super
important.

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,730
Yeah.
Because both those guys came out with

159
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:37,820
like really controversial acts.
There was a lot of blowback,

160
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,640
there was a lot of like a.
and if you could listen to some of the

161
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:43,070
stuff like that era,
like some of the stuff in the eighties,

162
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,580
it's really homophobic.
Oh yeah.

163
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,960
Yeah.
Like in a mean,

164
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,360
nasty way,
which is where I always seen it for

165
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,050
sure.
Yeah.

166
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,180
But we don't do gay jokes like that
anymore.

167
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,340
Like gay jokes today or like it's kind
of a geek.

168
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,900
It's,
it's sort of wrapped around the idea

169
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,970
that you could completely accept someone
being gay,

170
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,270
but it doesn't make it not funny if a
dude is sucking the dude's Dick.

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,770
No.
Yeah,

172
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,370
exactly.
Funny Concept.

173
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:07,661
Yeah.
No,

174
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,830
without a doubt.
I think people are coming.

175
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:14,180
I think we're actually leveling out
where now the pc police are running

176
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:17,300
rampant of course funding.
But they are funny.

177
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,350
But they really,
uh,

178
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,090
the best point is like the person.
You're joking,

179
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,410
supposedly offending rarely offended
that person.

180
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,270
Right.
It's always a white college girl who

181
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,490
wants to like write a blog.
Yeah.

182
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,020
Well that,
it's also the choosing to be offended

183
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,130
recreationally.
You know,

184
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,440
that this is something that's a hot
topic.

185
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,250
So you know,
this big Jay Oakerson guy eats.

186
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm going to take him down a peg.
I keep after him.

187
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,570
I can't fucking believe.
I've never had blowback at all.

188
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,010
I'm just probably.
My name's not out there enough,

189
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:48,620
I guess,
but there's comics like a little lower

190
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,110
down the totem pole than me.
They just happened to be performing at a

191
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:54,500
night where there was a blog writer and
that goes viral and that becomes a whole

192
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,393
thing.

193
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:55,921
But,
um,

194
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,100
I've never,
I've had some like viciously offensive

195
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,590
jokes,
but I think that,

196
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,910
um,
again,

197
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:06,750
there is,
there is a weird x factor to comedy.

198
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,820
I've talked about this recently too.
It really is.

199
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,960
I've got on stage and said horribly
heinous things,

200
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,880
right?
There's somebody who just got oozing.

201
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:18,150
All is like the most benign jokes,
like the crowds too much.

202
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,130
I've said terrible things and those same
people are laughing.

203
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,080
It's just like,
it's a lot of that is a process.

204
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,190
Not even talent.
I'm talking about very talented guys

205
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,330
getting a weird reaction for something
not dirty or offensive at all.

206
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,720
It's just,
there's a,

207
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,980
some people when you get on stage,
there is an organic thing where you

208
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,600
don't like Kurt Metzger,
who's brilliant,

209
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,980
brilliant comic.
Like I honor his jokes are the testament

210
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,030
to how good his jokes are is that he
kills because they don't like him when

211
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,700
he gets on stage,
like right away he just like,

212
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,010
whatever it is,
they just don't want to like um,

213
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,590
a Mike Vecchio is on the great comic but
looks like a state trooper,

214
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:52,860
you know?

215
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,470
So when he gets on stage,
I think people are kind of like,

216
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,110
who's this asshole?
For some reason I think when I get on

217
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,100
stage people are like,
oh,

218
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,860
I want to like this guy.
I think it's like my game to lose

219
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,530
almost.
Well that's an intangible.

220
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,440
It's something you could learn going.
You're an easy going looking guy.

221
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,860
He looks like you're a guy that be fun
to hang around with,

222
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,870
you know?
Yeah.

223
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,330
People actually think I'm much more
liberal than I even am with certain

224
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,470
things.
Oh really?

225
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,840
I mean I'm liberal overall,
but I mean like,

226
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not like I think people will be
like,

227
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,460
I've had a lot of people might just pull
out coke in front of you start doing

228
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:25,860
coke and I still get like a man that's
drugs.

229
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,130
That's why we get a reaction like that.
That's not a liberal thing though.

230
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,030
Right.
That's just A.

231
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,250
I'm just saying,
I think people just think that I'm much

232
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,084
more like,
you know,

233
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,240
that I am and I'm really like a,
well you wouldn't be getting anything

234
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,070
done.
Yeah.

235
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,090
You know,
that's the problem when you're doing as

236
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:45,450
many gigs as you're doing and then
you're doing legion of skanks and you

237
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,920
know,
you just recorded a comedy central

238
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,470
special.
If you were really just doing blow all

239
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,030
the time,
none of that shit would get done.

240
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,520
But so many people have done blow all
through.

241
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,710
I mean I don't think Kennison ever
stopped and he's got a couple of

242
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:56,580
specials.
Well,

243
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:01,581
he supposedly did for a while and then
they tested him when he was dead and he

244
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:06,630
had coconut system and they'd said he'd
done some coke when he got married

245
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,850
because he had apparently just got
married.

246
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,560
Yeah,
I think that's the story,

247
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,430
but the story was they tested him and he
had.

248
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,650
He had done some.
Dice is super straight always right?

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,550
Yup.
Pretty much.

250
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,670
He likes edible marijuana now.
Helps them go to sleep.

251
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,391
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

252
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:21,790
No,
I know.

253
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,290
I know.
Yeah,

254
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,650
I know he's like a weed guy,
but I local guy dices a new dice though

255
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,400
that's almost like now.
I mean when he was like the height of

256
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:28,740
like,
you know,

257
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,350
the John Travolta hair and the whole
thing like that was a,

258
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,370
I think it was super straight.
Yep.

259
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,040
Just smoke cigarettes.
That's it.

260
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,050
Yeah.
And then for awhile he used to take a

261
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,030
cigarette on stage with them and not
smoke it,

262
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,980
you.
And then he said fuck it.

263
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,880
And went right back on stage.
At one point he just let it one day.

264
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,930
I think so,
yeah.

265
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,000
I think it happened at the store.
Ms Dot [inaudible].

266
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,720
I still oddly just have never met him.
Oh really?

267
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,010
Yeah.
That if

268
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,240
I just say that's like my comedy hero in
so many ways.

269
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,490
Oh Man.
I had just assumed that you knew him

270
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,840
because you were at the store all the
time.

271
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,190
Dude.
Fuck,

272
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,380
you're leaving tonight.
Yeah.

273
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,170
Uh,
well I would love.

274
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,370
I would love to set that meeting.

275
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,350
It was funny when a Ari was at my house,
here's my house for Thanksgiving,

276
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,460
like maybes last Thanksgiving and made a
bunch of people were smoking weed in my

277
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,710
bedroom and including him.
Everyone that was there was like eight

278
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,790
people in a circle and he gets a phone
call and everyone's kind of in their own

279
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,060
conversations,
you know,

280
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,550
two people at a time and he answers his
phone and he goes,

281
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:30,911
oh,
hey,

282
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,540
dice and I ever.
No one is paying attention,

283
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,374
but I'm like,
wow,

284
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,390
that's crazy.
He's like,

285
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,140
yeah,
dice.

286
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,910
Okay.
Like almost like annoyed by it,

287
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,290
right?
Or whatever it is.

288
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,610
So I start just doing a dice impressions
like about Thanksgiving.

289
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,310
Oh Hey,
are you having enough fucking Turkey?

290
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,230
He'll con and a good goddamn do it all
day.

291
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,780
That's really good.
Um,

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,700
Gary
and uh,

293
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,040
no one's laughing.
I keep doing it.

294
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:04,690
Then people start making weird faces at
me and then hours later we're just kinda

295
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,610
sitting around and I go,
that's so crazy.

296
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,980
That dice just calls you already.
And so everyone was like,

297
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,040
dice called you and I'm like,
did you guys just think I was just doing

298
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,320
weird dyson pray?
That's what I was looking at me.

299
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:15,160
Weird.
They just didn't know that.

300
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,980
Always on the phone with them.
So they started broke into like loud,

301
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,710
obnoxious,
like interrupting conversations.

302
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,190
Do your act.
Hey everyone.

303
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,080
Troy a Turducken you'll fuck.
Have you ever done them on stage?

304
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,273
Dice?
You do.

305
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,660
You should do dice on.
Um,

306
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,980
I think,
but maybe I can pass it,

307
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,170
but I fuck it up.
Yeah.

308
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,540
I love the easiest thing to do.
It was,

309
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,990
it was the bonding of me and my
stepfather when I was like 12 years old.

310
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,030
He let me watch,
uh,

311
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,100
the one he did the Tla dice man cometh.
Wow.

312
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,210
And I just thought it was like I went to
school the next day and I was so much

313
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,020
funnier because I was just regurgitating
like his shit,

314
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,940
like saying what he said.
I just thought it was the greatest thing

315
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,320
ever.
Then we just had tapes made its way

316
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,190
around all my friends

317
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,800
of his first cassette and I listened to
it in the car with this girl I was

318
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:04,130
dating and we were fucking howling,
howling,

319
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,440
laughing.
I couldn't believe how funny it was.

320
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,260
And so like to be friends with them now
and hang out.

321
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:10,640
So surreal

322
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,610
still knows the uh,
he so good.

323
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:15,030
There's so many different levels of
standup,

324
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,300
you know,
like have the skill of it.

325
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:20,600
I mean,
and he's so good at the comedy of words.

326
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,950
That's what I've tried to learn from
him.

327
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,460
Just picking the right word.
Like the one who got me on this last

328
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,550
thing was just like,
I heard a lot of the jokes already that

329
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,301
he did,
but like,

330
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,260
and then he just goes in,
this chick's down their club or in your

331
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,203
balls.

332
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,760
Clobbering such a great word to pick
their.

333
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,760
Well he is also,
he's deiced too,

334
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,210
so it's like you come to the show
wanting that.

335
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,190
Yeah,
I mean it's its own thing.

336
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,130
It becomes a,
like Mitch Hedberg was sort of like

337
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,980
Mitch Hedberg had a special thing like
you would,

338
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,160
you would hear his jokes and coming

339
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,030
from him like you couldn't imagine them
coming from anybody else coming from

340
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:57,470
him.
They were hilarious and that's sort of

341
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,020
the same with dice.
Like anybody else that would say that

342
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,860
you'd be like,
what?

343
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,270
When he says that it's just,
he's just got that thing down and you

344
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,950
know what that thing is when you go to
see him.

345
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,650
I think every special starts with the
formula of like,

346
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,520
so I'm doing this thing with some chick
in a place where it shouldn't be

347
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,960
happening at a time.
That's weird.

348
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,420
So everything starts off.
It goes,

349
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:21,050
you know?
So I cut the throat fucking this broad

350
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,100
because you know what it's like when
you're a board in Anaheim at Burger King

351
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,840
on Valentine's Day.
A tag on like another like,

352
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,730
but it's just like I want to hear every
one of them.

353
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,170
Yeah.
And you look forward to it like it's a.

354
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,620
and here's the thing about Ford.
Fairlane was great.

355
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
I loved Ford Fairlane.
I don't remember it honestly.

356
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,140
But here's the thing about dice that's
like about his act as opposed to

357
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,180
everybody else's act.
You want to know the jokes and you

358
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:53,210
repeat them like with those nursery
rhymes.

359
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,940
He Ha.
He tapped into some weird rock and roll

360
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,950
thing where people would come to the
show.

361
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,910
What's in the
fucking place?

362
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,210
Inter rubbed.
It was like killing the harder.

363
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,100
You couldn't kill any harder and it,
it,

364
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,770
uh,
it gives you the thing where it's like

365
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,760
where you say it's rock and roll was in
Rockford.

366
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,570
Nobody wants to go hear the band.
You love through the new songs.

367
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,840
They want him to do the jokes.
They know.

368
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,890
Yeah,
exactly.

369
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,800
If a band has a new science,
the trust sneaking in between hits

370
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:22,890
people like,
Oh,

371
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,470
what is this?

372
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,400
I still get excited when I listened to
dice rules ever because that was the

373
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:32,660
second big specialty garden.
And he goes,

374
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,970
you guys studied and learned the poems?
He was.

375
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,990
But I wrote some new poems and it's
like,

376
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,690
it's like 20 years ago now,
you know what I mean?

377
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,040
So it's like,
here's the new poems.

378
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,830
It's like,
I thought these are still the old poems,

379
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,390
but they're so.
They're so bad day.

380
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,250
The laughter died is so brilliant.
Oh,

381
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,500
the data left who died,
if you've never heard it,

382
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,930
folks,
one of the best comedy cds ever,

383
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,380
and one of the most like revealing of
what a real comedy show can be like.

384
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,120
It's so great.
It just has to go on spotify and listen

385
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,630
to the track and our back.
That's one of the funniest things I've

386
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,490
ever fucking heard in my life.
He,

387
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:11,960
um,
he went to,

388
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,050
I actually had a cool opportunity to
speak to Tony,

389
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,320
who's the owner of danger fields.

390
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,770
It was rod these partner and that's
where he did it.

391
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,060
He said dice came in on a Tuesday at the
sun or the older Tony?

392
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,850
Older Tony.
Oh yeah.

393
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:29,270
He told me that.
I'm totally cool with Andy Kaufman story

394
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,770
too.
That was never a fan of his.

395
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,650
But it's pretty funny story.
But uh,

396
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,490
he said dice wanted to come in on a
Tuesday,

397
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,550
no announcement,
whoever's there,

398
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,700
like late night on a Tuesday and just
recorded an album.

399
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,991
And they said,
yeah,

400
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,670
they didn't make any announcement.
He came and he said it was like,

401
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,510
I think the biggest,
he said it was like 20 some and the

402
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,990
lowest it was 18 people and he

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,390
just went in there and started like
talking shit to them and they were not

404
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,870
interested.
They didn't know he was coming.

405
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,520
He just bullied

406
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,171
crowd.
He just,

407
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:04,160
and he just makes up a phrase an hour
back.

408
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,260
He goes,
I'll give you an hour,

409
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,750
an hour back.
And then he just keeps going,

410
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,130
get it.
He says,

411
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,310
get it like 50 times the thing.
And then he goes,

412
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,220
you don't even know what you laughing
at.

413
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,290
He says to them,
they're stupid for laughing at like,

414
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,500
you know,
they're not laughing all those jokes.

415
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,170
And he just keeps borrowing this thing
into their head and they start laughing.

416
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,900
Well,
you should point out to the,

417
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,740
at the time he was selling out arenas.
Oh yeah,

418
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,350
yeah,
yeah.

419
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,040
So dice is such a maniac.
He makes this album when he's selling

420
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,940
out Madison Square Garden,
he's selling out the Nassau Coliseum.

421
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,090
He's selling out gi and places like I
think to this day it's like Kevin Hart

422
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:45,230
and him.
I like the biggest.

423
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,730
As far as like the most successful John
Kevin Hart's done like 60,000 seat

424
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,590
places and say yet.
I mean he's,

425
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,130
he's,
well,

426
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,680
what's the new trailer?
Philly?

427
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,560
It was like $60,000 of travel

428
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,940
now.
What's next?

429
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,320
It's insane.
I mean,

430
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,540
he's a insane.
Literally.

431
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,470
And I said I think I toys for his phone
bill or electric bill.

432
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,540
One point was in my name because he was
so like he asked me if I could put it my

433
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,710
name.
They we're going to turn the electricity

434
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,610
off.
Wow.

435
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:10,020
Back in Philly.
That's crazy.

436
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,750
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

437
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,980
Like nuts where he's at now.
Wow,

438
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,600
that's crazy.
It's great.

439
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,360
My Mom's still has no scope of that at
all.

440
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,980
Sugar out in La.
She goes,

441
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,200
tell Kevin we said how I'm like,
I'm probably going to see him.

442
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,910
He's probably in Bulgaria doing a
fucking covered by bodyguards via riding

443
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,760
a wave of diamonds,
wearing his own sneakers.

444
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,760
I had a genuine a bum out,
like I felt bad about it too,

445
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,310
and it was before I was having a rough
go.

446
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,830
I was headlining the Sacramento Improv
or punchlines Sacramento punchline,

447
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,860
which I love that club and I was
headlining it and I felt pretty good

448
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:47,770
about headlining it.

449
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,840
I'm like,
you know,

450
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,360
seven show week or whatever it is,
but I'm like,

451
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,040
this is great.
I'm headlining the punchline.

452
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,610
Sacramento.
Kevin was in town doing the Arco arena

453
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,820
where the Sacramento Kings play.
Oh my God.

454
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:00,421
He goes,
hey man,

455
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,670
come to the hotel and hang out.
I go,

456
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:07,400
absolutely,
and I go to the hotel were outside for

457
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,170
30 seconds,
but I get the hotel.

458
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,770
He's coming out of like the hotel gym.
It's like around the corner and I meet

459
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:18,390
him and we're walking to the hotel and
this 100 foot walk car stopped.

460
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,270
People pour out of buildings.
People start yelling and screaming.

461
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,150
He turns around and gives him one way.
If we go into the hotel,

462
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,910
we go up to his suite.
That is amazing.

463
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,370
It's got a whole bunch of his boys
there.

464
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,820
They're playing a xbox three 60 time it
was,

465
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,400
and he goes,
you want to watch the,

466
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,610
um,
used to watch the intro for my special,

467
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:38,980
right.

468
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,160
It was not.
This one's out now,

469
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,560
the one before where he's got the
pyrotechnics going off.

470
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,161
He's like,
yeah,

471
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,290
we got pyro and it's going off.
He's showing me this crazy,

472
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,090
like insane trailer for it that's just
like mind blowing.

473
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,030
And I was feeling so good
about,

474
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,110
oh,
I'm sorry.

475
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,510
I should preface this story by saying,
um,

476
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,760
when I was talking to the cab driver
bringing me to calves hotel,

477
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,030
he was like,
what are you going from a hotel to a

478
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,160
hotel for?
And I go out,

479
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,580
you want to hear the story is pretty.
I said Kevin Hart's here and um,

480
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:11,170
uh,
he's all buddy of mine,

481
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,500
so I'm gonna go hang out with him.
He's a gaggle.

482
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,151
Yeah,
I'm in town.

483
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,750
I'm a comedian too.
I'm playing the punchline.

484
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,110
And he goes,
oh,

485
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,970
that's amazing man,
because can I get tickets?

486
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,220
And I was like,
yeah,

487
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:24,520
I could like put you on the list for
some tickets if you want to show you

488
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:29,190
when it comes to shows and there's
somebody goes to shows at the argo

489
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,740
arena.

490
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,390
And I was like,
oh no.

491
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:31,781
He goes,
Oh,

492
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:34,810
I'm sorry man.
I thought he said I want to take it to

493
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,920
Kevin Hart show.
I was like,

494
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,050
okay.
He asking you for Kevin Hart's tickets.

495
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,030
So that's how that starts.
That's how this thing starts.

496
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,680
And he gives me his card,
this cab driver,

497
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:46,360
he goes,
call me when you're done because I'll be

498
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:48,070
right in the area.
Okay.

499
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,310
I go up.
So kept showing me the pyrotechnics.

500
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,520
Yeah.
Do you want lobster?

501
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,380
We're all getting lobsters and shit and
I'm not even exaggerating.

502
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,160
It's like this Kinda hang and I'm like,
this is fucking crazy.

503
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,640
And uh,
and his buddies are all playing the xbox

504
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:07,840
and I said try to find some sign of like
old Kevin there,

505
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:08,550
you know what I mean?
Not,

506
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,383
not that he's,
he hasn't,

507
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,560
just personalities,
not shitty or anything,

508
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,670
just like,
you know,

509
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,520
connect on some level of what our
friendship is.

510
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,250
I'm like,
you still bring your xbox everywhere

511
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,330
highs.
I still do that too.

512
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,290
I pack it up in a like Schlep it with me
everywhere I go so I could do something

513
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,560
during the day and he goes,
oh no man,

514
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,130
because every time we land we sent a guy
out to buy an xbox for the day and then

515
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,590
we leave it for the maids.
And I was like,

516
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,910
I gotta go.
I left like in a weird short amount of

517
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:41,911
time and the guy picked me up in the cab
and we're driving back to my hotel and

518
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,600
he's me this question like,
how was it man?

519
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,580
How was it was fine.
I'm like,

520
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,370
I,
I wasn't that in when like a contest to

521
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:48,911
meet.
I'm like,

522
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:49,744
I know.
He's like,

523
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,120
Oh man,
he's so funny.

524
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,290
That's great by the way,
because I feel like a dick.

525
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,270
I'm,
I'd love to.

526
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,330
If the offers still up,
I'd love to come to one year shows this

527
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:59,164
weekend.
I go,

528
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,340
yeah man,
absolutely.

529
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,600
Let me know.
He's like,

530
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,980
my wife would love it,
man.

531
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,510
He goes,
I'll bring her out because I looked

532
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,201
really cool.
I'll be like,

533
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,700
hey,
I know the comedian stuff and I'll be

534
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:07,600
like,
yeah man,

535
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,450
whatever you want.
So it's just a before get out of the

536
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,640
car,
just tell me what show would show you

537
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,641
want to go to and we pull up to the
hotel but you know,

538
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:21,040
it's kind of a quiet 15 minutes ride and
I'm getting ready to go.

539
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,240
So hey buddy,
what's your name?

540
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,530
So I'll put you in for tickets.
He goes,

541
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,280
honestly man,
I'm not going to come.

542
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,350
Why do you keep building me up to hurt
my feelings?

543
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,690
Let them fuck them going out of his way.
Yeah.

544
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:35,780
That was the saddest.
Like,

545
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,830
and I was headlining the punchline.
I was excited and I was.

546
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,520
And then all of a sudden I was like,
Jesus man,

547
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,830
I either call like I've made phone calls
back home,

548
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:45,920
like why am I so like just fucking
awfully green with envy.

549
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:46,040
I

550
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,160
just showed it all over my ass in that
room.

551
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,900
You just,
first of all that cab driver wasn't

552
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,090
helping anything that kind of put you in
a weird state of mind.

553
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,220
He was an idiot.
So you went,

554
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,550
you went to Kevin's place,
you were driven around by an idiot and

555
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,160
you're going to see the most successful
comedian of all time.

556
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,300
Who is your friend who you helped with?
His electrical bill and you get in there

557
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:10,301
and they're thrown away x box.
I got to assume you're a high as fuck,

558
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,460
right?
Will you hide when you went over there?

559
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,890
I maybe had to be there.
Those guys aren't really doing anything

560
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,690
like that.
But you probably did before you went

561
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,620
over there for sure.
Right?

562
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:19,740
I know I would.
Yeah.

563
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,440
That scared the fuck out of me to ranch.
I got to get away from him.

564
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,360
So I just had a meltdown.
I'm like,

565
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,423
hi.
They go,

566
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,873
well,
you know,

567
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,010
he's.
I don't understand how a guy like that

568
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,920
couldn't work as much as he does.
Being meaning,

569
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,690
I don't know.
Not that I don't understand that these,

570
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,270
that ambitious.
I don't understand where the time comes

571
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:41,180
from.
Several is several movies I think still

572
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:42,180
coming out.
Well it's a,

573
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:46,290
it's also stand up and it's also.
I mean he's just on top of it.

574
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,700
Social media is social media is like a
business to him.

575
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,920
It's a really interesting guy,
man.

576
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,250
Like super,
super awesome.

577
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,331
Well,
the new,

578
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:55,600
uh,
the new trailer for the,

579
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,870
for the new special says he goes,
uh,

580
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,630
comedies first ever.
Mogul gas sort of.

581
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,790
I guess so.
I mean for sure.

582
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,780
Well,
whatever.

583
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
Who gives a fuck about first ever this
or that he's about to say.

584
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,040
But what other comedian was a mogul you
think was a real,

585
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,690
like Jerry Seinfeld running a bit.
The,

586
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,750
the branch.
I mean,

587
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,580
Kim's got sneakers.
Does he?

588
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,890
He's got Nike sneakers.
Yeah.

589
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,761
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

590
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:26,280
I would assume.
I would say he's the first.

591
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,300
Well,
he's first of all the quickest ascent of

592
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,270
stardom.
If you look at him like to where he's

593
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:35,520
at,
where he's at.

594
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,140
I mean there's.
So it's me and him,

595
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:40,080
it's almost 18 years.
How long has he been famous for?

596
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,240
Ten years.
Household.

597
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,100
He's been known from about,
without exaggeration,

598
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,310
five years in [inaudible].
He was working like a lot,

599
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
but he didn't even,
he didn't even move to New York.

600
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,840
Me and him and Keith Robinson would go
up to New York every day and uh,

601
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,640
he never had to move to New York.
He jumped right.

602
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,350
He got the Montreal festival,
got a pilot with Judd apatow and moved

603
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:09,210
to La.
It was like overnight where he was in

604
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,770
the business working,
making money,

605
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:11,790
you know,
surviving.

606
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,370
Well,
I'm sure there were peaks and valleys in

607
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:15,000
that,
but I mean,

608
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,260
I remember I did a show he hosted like
beatty's one mic stands,

609
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,930
like a comic view season.
He hosted that,

610
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,000
you know,
at that point I'd say he was still like

611
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,040
famous,
like in the black community.

612
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:26,874
He did,
um,

613
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,930
soul plane and all that stuff.
But I'd say like a household name maybe

614
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,640
like six or seven years now.
But I mean,

615
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,150
so think about that international world,
famous gun from,

616
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,350
but six or seven years to like these
50,000,

617
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,660
60,000 seat arena.

618
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,960
That's incredible.
Isn't a um,

619
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,840
I wonder if he had any doubt in his mind
that data,

620
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,280
they would fill that fucking room
eagle,

621
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,610
the Eagle stadium,
but he's from philly and everybody knew

622
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,300
it was like a big event.
Yeah.

623
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,180
You know,
I think uh,

624
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,290
I think he knows what he's doing.
Obviously it worked,

625
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,610
right.
But I mean he's got,

626
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,480
he's got the production things where he
produces specials for other people.

627
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,210
That's great and all that shit.
So I don't know where a guy like that

628
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,360
has that kind of time.
So it seems,

629
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,650
seems like I know how much I work and
I'm like,

630
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,720
God,
this guy works like twice as much as me.

631
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,910
How's it going know where you find the
time to do this podcast?

632
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,460
I mean really it's like,
it feels like you're running around for

633
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,830
UFC a ton and then it would have up.

634
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,300
Yeah.
But the standup,

635
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:28,260
is it night podcasts during the day?
I don't have a real job.

636
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,390
The UFC stuff like the stuff in studio
where I do like countdown shows and

637
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,070
stuff like that.
That's the only like once a month,

638
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,380
the events,
they're not that often,

639
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,230
twice a month,
three times a month at the maximum.

640
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,600
Then there's stand up in between.
So it's not that hard.

641
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,110
It's just appears harder than it is.
It appears like there's more going on in

642
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:49,280
there,
but you know.

643
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,740
But if you're doing a television show or
even more so if you're doing a movie,

644
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,940
you're fucking gone for 16 hours a day
here.

645
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,080
Committed,
you know that that is the big.

646
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,500
The big trap is the movie trap.
I mean it's awesome if you want to make

647
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:05,850
a shit ton of money,
but it is not nearly as fun as doing

648
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,990
standup.
There's,

649
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,180
I mean I think it be fun.

650
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,911
Yeah.
I think.

651
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,740
I think in general,
I don't know,

652
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,070
it was never a reason why I got into
comedy,

653
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,140
which just takes too much time.
But the hold I did a scene a,

654
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,790
me and Doug Benson and Louis j Gomez did
a scene together for Jim Gaffigan show

655
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,600
we,
it was a 15 second dream sequence he

656
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:33,570
has.
And if we were there,

657
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:38,571
I mean just the 15 second scenes.
So they shot it even like eight times.

658
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,360
How much filming that is.
We were there for like nine hours,

659
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,350
nine hours that day.
Didn't do a thing.

660
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,340
Got there at like 4:30 in the afternoon,
didn't do a thing until 8:30.

661
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,980
And you're just like,
I don't understand the point of that.

662
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,240
The laziest I ever got with my standup
was when I was doing news radio because

663
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,810
I was,
when we first started out we were um,

664
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,080
there was a lot of struggles in the
beginning and when a show is trying to

665
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,210
find its legs,
you know,

666
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,360
writing wise and story wise and the
networks notes versus the producer's

667
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,340
notes and all that shit has to get
worked out.

668
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,800
We were doing like 12,
13 hour days.

669
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,490
There were long ass days and everybody
was exhausted and I would just do no

670
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,750
stand up or if I did something I would
do like a spot on the weekend and I

671
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,790
wasn't writing at all because I was
never going up.

672
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,410
I did a show for two seasons on IFC
channel and it was so like I was still

673
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,470
no,
not established enough in my mind in the

674
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:38,160
clubs in New York that I would like
really it was a killing myself.

675
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,420
It was bad for her.
Like I was still doing standup and I

676
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,860
wouldn't go onto comedy central tool.
That was back when the show is ran on

677
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,750
the weekdays to like three in the
morning.

678
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,550
So I'd be getting home at like 3:30 in
the morning and like sleeping til 5:30

679
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:55,060
in the morning going right to set.
Oh I didn't do it every night I try to

680
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,160
pace it like to be every other night.

681
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,400
So one that I'd go home and I'd fall
asleep like right after filming which

682
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,080
could be like 7:00 at night,
you know,

683
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,160
and just pass out for the night.
So I try to pace it but I couldn't walk

684
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,980
away from it enough.
I just feel like especially in New York

685
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,320
and they really let you feel like
there's someone waiting to take your

686
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:13,540
spot in a heartbeat.
And there is.

687
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,320
And there are three comics thanked me
for being on the road so much now

688
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,820
because it clears up some of the
weekends.

689
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:19,531
But you know what I mean.
I,

690
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:21,430
I get that.
What was the show that you were doing?

691
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,850
It's called Xerox on the IFC channel.
It was fun.

692
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,133
It was a,
we,

693
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,400
they kind of let me have the reins as
far as like kind of telling them like

694
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,630
what comics,
like stamps,

695
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,370
we should have like guest star on it.

696
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,020
But what was the premise?
It was about a band called [inaudible].

697
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:40,690
They were a real band at the time.
They,

698
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:42,400
um,
it's just their story.

699
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:44,770
They played like they try to become rock
stars at night,

700
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,780
but during the day they would play kid's
parties,

701
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,280
like kids' birthday parties,
which is a.

702
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,110
So it was like a sitcom.
Yeah,

703
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,760
it was a half hour show,
but it was a,

704
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,010
what are they called?
Like the single cameras,

705
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,883
you know,
whatever.

706
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,620
Like Marin.
Yeah.

707
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,960
And it was um,
it was fun because it was curb your

708
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,290
enthusiasm style,
scripted outline only.

709
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,640
Oh,
you can just make up your own lives.

710
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,940
And they had a bunch of Maitland
caplets.

711
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,520
Patrice was on a few episodes.
Geraldo got on a few episodes a why

712
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,363
didn't get them all?
I mean,

713
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:18,390
but he was on a few episodes.
I'm Geoff Ralston and episode Kurt

714
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,100
Metzger rallies.
It was,

715
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,680
it was pretty crazy.

716
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,030
So tell,
uh,

717
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,330
tell.
Acting is fucking so great and I

718
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,150
couldn't make up his own lines to.
Can People Watch those now?

719
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,440
The other one.
Amazon.

720
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,450
What's again?
Xerox.

721
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,370
Xerox.
It was fun show.

722
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,204
It was just,
it was,

723
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,280
it was a little ambitious too.
Like I said before,

724
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,700
these guys were mostly read at the
director of production team is mostly

725
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,440
reality show guys.
He,

726
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,000
you would think that doing a show like
that with a bunch of comics completely

727
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:50,290
ad Lib style curby enthusiasm style is a
great idea.

728
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,970
You know what guys like Joey Diaz or it
did well in the show actually did very

729
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:57,460
well.
It just like it was arguments between

730
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,380
the production and the uh,
network.

731
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,880
Yeah.
See it's always that way,

732
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:04,670
man.
It's everything I've ever done that's on

733
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,000
television.
There's been some arguments between the

734
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:09,870
production and the network and it's
always weird shit later.

735
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,750
Like why can't we have coke cans sitting
facing camera on the show and was like,

736
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,870
when I was on news radio is infuriating
because you would watch these guys come

737
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,890
up with these ideas about like we're
going to bring in a love interest who

738
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:27,520
want to do this and that,
and the writers would get so pissed off

739
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:28,330
to be like,
look,

740
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,370
this is a really good show.
The,

741
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,720
the fucking problem is you guys keep
moving it from time slot to time slot,

742
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,030
but then the network is like,
no,

743
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:39,530
we're going to do this or we're going to
do that and we're going to bring a hot

744
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,870
girl and we're going to bring in a hot
guy and we're going to.

745
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,160
It was just so goofy,
so goofy to watch all these different

746
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:49,490
people battle in a lot of the people
that are putting in the input.

747
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,740
They're not professional creative
people.

748
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,480
They're executives.
Yep.

749
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,030
And then they have to take those notes.
Seriously.

750
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:56,864
I,
uh,

751
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,470
I used to get a note a bunch better,
a pilot that I wrote my stop pitching it

752
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,010
even because it was just getting so
frustrated with my.

753
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,030
We definitely wrote like a funny thing
right here,

754
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,060
me and to me and Lewis and Dave actually
we wrote a funny thing that can be maybe

755
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:16,040
stretched to movie length or a pilot.
I liked it as a pilot.

756
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
It was something to live in a world of
like true stories that I have.

757
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,670
Cause I said I used to do a job ironic
with the xerox story,

758
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,760
but a real job where I drove strippers,
escorts around at night to gigs and then

759
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,420
during the day the same company was I'd
go dressed as like elmo to a kid's

760
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:35,720
birthday party,
so it existed in that world.

761
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,940
We were a really funny thing and then
they just start saying things like

762
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,630
having a strong female lead.
I'm like,

763
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,510
just fucking funny.
I promise you there's women in the show.

764
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,160
What about diversity?
Big J.

765
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,881
just like.
Yeah,

766
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,420
it's like one of the friends black or
something.

767
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,380
The most important thing right now.
Big So ridiculous.

768
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,410
Every body has to be completely and
unique.

769
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,660
Yeah.
If it's a black show,

770
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,220
you have to have a wacky way.
You.

771
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,583
Yeah.
It's.

772
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,010
Those kinds of conversations are very
weird because there's nothing wrong with

773
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,230
having a strong female lead,
if that's what you wrote.

774
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,660
Yeah.
Whoever the person is,

775
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:11,240
it's writing it or the group of people.
You got to leave them to their own

776
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,280
creative visions.
As soon as you start saying,

777
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:15,710
you know,
let's have a black guy do this,

778
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:18,980
so let's make this a Chinese lady like
stop.

779
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,880
If you have a really funny person,
like leading the charge,

780
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,610
like a comic who was like,
you wrote something and they have a

781
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:29,750
picture in their head.
That's kind of the confidence I've tried

782
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:34,751
to build and stand up.
Like I feel like if I say it like I'm

783
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,040
trying.
I'm trying to make myself laugh first

784
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,300
and foremost.
So if I say it,

785
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,700
I think it's funny.
I believe it's funny,

786
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,250
right?
I believe that I just like didn't convey

787
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,510
it to you the right way.
You know,

788
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,180
you didn't get it fully or you're being
tight.

789
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,560
Asked about some other reason.
You know what I mean?

790
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:51,230
So it's like that.
But they don't put that kind of faith

791
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,320
like the networks never put that kind of
faith in the complicated gill.

792
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,690
If you make my vision with how I've seen
this in my head,

793
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,720
if you give me the tools to create it
the way I see my head,

794
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,950
it will be funny.

795
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,220
I think with day worry about is the
consequences of anything that you might

796
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,900
do that could fuck their career up.
Absolutely.

797
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,460
Green light a show and you go off the
deep end with something completely

798
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:17,060
ridiculous.
It makes social justice warrior news,

799
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,680
but you're one.
Yeah,

800
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:19,160
but I mean,
you know,

801
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,180
you like,
you know something's good fast.

802
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:22,520
I'm talking about just someone who's
particularly me out of the picture.

803
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,040
Just if you trust and someone that's
genuinely funny,

804
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,550
right?
If you let Dave attell make,

805
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,610
given the endless funds to make whatever
his vision is,

806
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,620
it's going to be funny.
Well,

807
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,080
that's what Louie did.
Yes.

808
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,010
Right.
That's his show was exactly

809
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,330
that.
That's why he directs it,

810
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,240
produces it and everything.
He was editing it all on his fucking

811
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,790
laptop in the beginning.
I don't know if he kept doing it that

812
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,290
way,
but she's as Christ,

813
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,510
but that's why it was so good.
I mean it's,

814
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,590
it's a single vision.
It's from his mind and so like the dice

815
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,470
thing,
louise got the Louis thing and you know

816
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,600
what to expect when you go into watch
the Louis thing,

817
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:01,080
so it makes it even more funny.
He knows exactly how to do it and when

818
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,200
you watch that show that's like,
it's so clear that that's right out of

819
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:06,690
his mind.
It's his perfect presentation of what

820
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,610
his thing is,
but that's never.

821
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,460
That's such a rare story.
Super Rare.

822
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,030
It's super rare,
but that's why television is not going

823
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:16,110
to make it.
It's just not going to make it.

824
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:19,830
If it keeps going this way,
it's just the only people that are doing

825
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:19,950
it.

826
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,240
Right.
Like comedy central.

827
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,330
Take some crazy fucking chances.
They take crazy chances with their

828
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:27,390
roasts.
I was at a roast battle last night.

829
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,420
They took grazie chances with that.
I mean that is a raw buck wild comedy

830
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:34,870
clubs show.
Yeah.

831
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,020
No Shit.
And comedy central apparently is going

832
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,490
to air it.
I was downstairs last night from that

833
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,590
night,
so I heard all the chaos.

834
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:43,140
It was madness.
It was madness.

835
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,190
Fun though.
Yeah.

836
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,720
Oh yeah.
Earl Skakel crushed when it gets Jesse

837
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,400
Joyce.
Dude,

838
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:53,100
he crushed as hard as a person can
crush.

839
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,110
Really?
A person can't crush any harder.

840
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,750
He hit every note.
It was like it was scripted.

841
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,780
Oh my God.
And then there was adlibs that were

842
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:02,020
perfect to.
It was.

843
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,230
It was madness.
He didn't have a shirt on.

844
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,740
He threw water all over his head and
threw the water under the crowd.

845
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,370
Silver pants on the triple h entrance
was the.

846
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,790
He had a fur coat.
You tell me a fur coat on with no shirt

847
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,610
and a silver pants.
Oh.

848
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,490
And he did it.
He did it.

849
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,010
Uh,
what I judged a few weeks ago,

850
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,350
he came out and did the trip go triple h
entrance.

851
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:30,250
He came out and like ran to the audience
and climate on tables and water and

852
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,270
threw it in the audience.
Madman.

853
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,120
He's a fucking madman.
And so he'd beat up on Jesse Joyce,

854
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:37,980
who has to help me write jokes for at
midnight tonight.

855
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,180
Well,
just joyce is really funny.

856
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:42,390
Jesse crushed him out of the box.
Jesse crushed him out of the box.

857
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:45,720
The first one was brutal.
Who is a joke about him opening up for

858
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,590
Rob Schneider,
but then earl just opened them up and

859
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:51,900
fucked his mouth.
He just,

860
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,840
I'll just,
I'll just smashed him.

861
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,230
It was crazy.
It was so much fun though.

862
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,450
It was Dane Cook,
Bobby Lee,

863
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,990
me and Jimmy Kimmel was there too.

864
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,840
He didn't judge,
but he was like in.

865
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,230
They gave him a microphone and Jeff Ross
running the whole thing and Brian Moses,

866
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:12,650
who the perfect host for that thing.
God Damn,

867
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,660
that's a good show.
So she could show me grow waves.

868
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,860
Hilarious.
Good.

869
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,420
So good.
Everything about that show.

870
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,710
So good.
It's the.

871
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,330
It's the most wild show in all of La
because there's a version of New York

872
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,040
caught a roastmaster is at Lewis hosts
and it's.

873
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,010
It's like sanctions sanctions.
Wrong word,

874
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:34,011
but like Jeff Ross signs off on that one
and they run it in like New York for

875
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:35,304
some reason.

876
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,170
Some great rose,
some great writing,

877
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:43,171
like amazing actual battles talent wise.
But it is missing that thing that like

878
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:45,791
the,
you know,

879
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:46,150
the,
the,

880
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,620
just the insanity,
the noises.

881
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,300
I mean they have a Dj and he does his
thing,

882
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,190
but you know what I mean,
like that room,

883
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,750
it's like,
it's like A.

884
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,570
Yeah,
if you guys know for sure.

885
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,710
But it's also like everyone,
everyone's just so in tune with it.

886
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,630
Like it's not talking about that last
night,

887
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,320
like,
uh,

888
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,010
when was it,
I forget who it was with somebody.

889
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:10,540
Somebody crushed so hard that I was Jeff
Ross and I were clinging to each other.

890
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,390
We're clinging to each other because the
joke was so fucking brutal.

891
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,790
I don't want to butcher the joke.
The suicide job.

892
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,940
It was so goddamn brutal.
We were like hanging on to each other.

893
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,760
Like this is the only sort of
environment where that would be even

894
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,340
justified because everybody's completely
smushed in there.

895
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,750
The belly room at the comedy store is
only supposed to seat 70 people.

896
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,050
They get 100 in their shoes and
everybody's smashed in like this.

897
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,950
And when everybody is smashed in,
like this is.

898
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:39,370
So there's doors,
there's four different ways to get out.

899
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,490
So it's not like a trapped,
because like literally four different

900
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,530
exits to Rome,
it's an easy room to get out of.

901
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:48,460
So it's not dangerous,
but it's so intimate that when people

902
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,260
laugh and they'd go,
oh,

903
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,870
like the people behind you a high,
everyone's high fiving,

904
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:56,230
everybody all squished in together.
People like slapping people in the head

905
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,430
and then when they're doing it in New
York,

906
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,830
it's going to be the grammercy theater,
which is not intimate.

907
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,280
Oh,
he can't do that all.

908
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:06,390
Yeah.
I'm curious to see how that goes.

909
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,190
You can't do that.
That's Jeff's doing that.

910
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,270
Jeff's version of it.

911
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,130
Oh,
why didn't they do know the one in New

912
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,821
York,
the show they do.

913
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:19,660
The biweekly show is actually is at the
stand.

914
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,960
That's actually a good room for that.
So yeah,

915
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,010
it's really small.
But the one and uh,

916
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,360
but the one for tv they're doing at the
gramercy theater and that's.

917
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,100
They always wanted to do.
They always want to take something

918
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:33,040
that's awesome when it's intimate and
move it into a big giant place.

919
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,950
The seller would be great for it.
But uh,

920
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,850
or even like they have the,
a room or in the corner now to village

921
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,960
underground.
Yeah.

922
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,970
Oh,
I saw a video of you from there.

923
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,963
Yeah,
that's great.

924
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,780
That looks like a very cool role and a
good size stage to walk around on.

925
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,010
It's very wide and long and they
basically recreated the cellar down

926
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,390
there,
but it's just a bigger room.

927
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
Wow.
It's like 200 people maybe.

928
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,091
Oh,
that's cool.

929
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:56,860
And that's the same people.
Same.

930
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:58,570
Our new one called the comedy cellar
still.

931
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,820
Oh no shit.
That's awesome man.

932
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,500
I gotta check that.
I don't want to get back there.

933
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,440
That stage looked amazing.
Like the setup of perfect.

934
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,231
Oh,
it tells you.

935
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:10,420
Is it for several things.
Used it for his hotels underground show.

936
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,450
No Shit.
And I think you'd use it now for a new

937
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,740
thing he's doing.
That's awesome.

938
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,930
Bobby Kelly did a special there,
I think.

939
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,700
I think he did.
Yeah,

940
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:19,750
I think you're right.
Yeah,

941
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,000
it gets used.
It's great.

942
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,620
I got to check it out.
Check it out through their live podcasts

943
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,081
there.
Oh,

944
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:26,914
they do?
Yeah.

945
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,070
I didn't know they did it live.
They just did one recently.

946
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,380
It was there,
been so stressed for a show in life.

947
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,730
They had four girl calm.

948
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,450
I don't like turning over control.
I like having control in the comedic

949
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:42,890
situations and uh,
we performed five minutes.

950
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,960
It was like five or six,
six of us.

951
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,930
And then for girl comics,
like just straight off your comedy,

952
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,070
would they fuck you or not?
Like they,

953
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,630
they,
you know,

954
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,860
with,
with comments about it.

955
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:53,000
And I was like,
I hated it.

956
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,401
I was,
I did well.

957
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,570
I did fine,
but it was like A.

958
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm actually hasn't worked out good for
me really.

959
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,070
But like going into it,
I was like,

960
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:03,260
I did not like that.
I haven't felt that in a while where

961
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:04,970
it's at now.
I guess every night we're being judged,

962
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:07,730
but like you do stand behind your wall
of comedy.

963
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:09,650
This just seems like they're going to
tell me if they'd fucked me or not.

964
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:12,140
Like no matter what my comedy was on
pure looks,

965
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,540
you know,
it's interesting.

966
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,490
That wouldn't be something that you
could do with a woman.

967
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,150
Hell No.
That was the joke of it,

968
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:19,920
I think.
Yeah.

969
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,860
No,
you'd be there.

970
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,200
Your blogs would be rolling.

971
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,570
Yeah.
That's acknowledging that there's some

972
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:27,240
sort of an imbalance in their approach.
They.

973
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,530
It's not that they don't want you to
insult them and be sexist.

974
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,050
They just,
they want the exclusive right to do

975
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,490
that.
And when I say they,

976
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:39,030
I mean only people that think that way.
I mean you if you don't think that way,

977
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,770
but a lot of people that think that's so
cool.

978
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,800
It's cool as shit on a guy and and knock
you down by your looks and your five

979
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:47,850
minutes of material.
If a woman did that,

980
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:52,020
like if you had a woman get on stage and
tell a joke and a bunch of guys like you

981
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:54,360
and me,
we're sitting around deciding whether or

982
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:57,140
not we would fuck this girl based on how
funny her jokes were.

983
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,740
There'll be brutal show.

984
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,210
Oh yeah.
Well it's funny that the nerves have a

985
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:06,320
show like that.
Is that like if it got into some kind of

986
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:06,890
like,
you know,

987
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,230
wit battle.
Not that they wouldn't say funny things

988
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,690
are shit on me in a funny way.
I just feel like I could probably be

989
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:15,400
meaner
and probably make them more upset than

990
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,270
they can make me.
Well,

991
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,400
you also have a lot more experience.
More like what would that kind of thing,

992
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:19,830
but just,
you know,

993
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,320
I mean just,
but you should always just kind of like,

994
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,390
you know,
what it gets to the core of like,

995
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,750
uh,
making a woman pretty upset if you want

996
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:26,900
to go for it.
Yeah.

997
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,610
And they with us also,
but I'm just saying for some reason like

998
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,010
were just a little thing.
Not always,

999
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,600
but I feel like just a little thicker
skin.

1000
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,820
So just having the kind of take
whatever.

1001
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,180
And there was the comments like,
but it was a fun show the other day,

1002
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,430
but I don't want to take the show down
at all.

1003
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,770
I love rich and body.
But um,

1004
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,390
there's comments that are like,
you know,

1005
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,680
the backhanded like,
you know,

1006
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,520
and I,
you know,

1007
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,121
I've,
I've,

1008
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:49,060
uh,
I've fucked a few like,

1009
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,240
you know,
fact guys before,

1010
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:51,260
so I could probably,
you know,

1011
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,700
it was like,
that doesn't bother me at all.

1012
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,170
So you're like,
right.

1013
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,310
You know what I mean?
Like that feeling,

1014
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:55,880
you're like,
oh right.

1015
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,730
And it's like if I said anything
remotely like that,

1016
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,110
yeah.
Any of them.

1017
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:02,930
Like they'd actually might be a phone
call later,

1018
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,011
you know what I mean?
Like,

1019
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,880
Hey,
what would you.

1020
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,340
It would be an issue for sure.

1021
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,440
I mean I guess we could take it better.
That's why,

1022
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,270
that's why it's okay.
It's sort of like implied that their

1023
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,080
sensitivity is a bit more delicate.

1024
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,180
Yeah.
Ends.

1025
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,250
So you could take it looked at.
I got four would fuck me.

1026
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:21,084
It's.
Thank God.

1027
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,740
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1028
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,140
That's beautiful.
But um,

1029
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:27,120
but it's weird that pumps me up.
But the thing is if it,

1030
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:29,510
if it goes bad,
like I said,

1031
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:30,344
that's why the,
the,

1032
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,450
the lack of control I meant was that
like almost I have to keep my own

1033
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,870
control myself and you're like I don't
want this to get where I don't have the

1034
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:41,160
crowd that turn because then I'm just
going to be mean to these four girl

1035
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,200
comics,
you know?

1036
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,780
And then it's going to be,
it's just going to get ugly and I think

1037
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,330
are actually fighting.
He actually got a weird,

1038
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,420
was one of the judges,
I mean it wasn't like super bad,

1039
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:54,930
but like she added the gates was going
to say no because like they just had

1040
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,400
such a weird back and forth.

1041
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,600
Oh,
they knew each other already.

1042
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,411
Oh yeah.
We knew all.

1043
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:00,720
I knew all four girls but have been
again,

1044
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:02,430
even though I know them,
it's just a still a thing.

1045
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,460
Like you can't cross a certain line,
you know what I mean?

1046
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:07,140
Like there's certain things you can't
say.

1047
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,790
Yeah.
Well that's one of the weird things

1048
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:12,090
about roast battles in general,
but at least with rose petals are doing

1049
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:14,880
it back and forth to each other.
This seems like you have to do your

1050
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:17,190
standup and then they shit on you.
Right?

1051
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:20,040
You really,
you really can't ship back too much.

1052
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:22,680
That's the problem.
I mean not as bad as you would.

1053
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,570
I guess what I'm saying.
You always have to be like Kinda like

1054
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,780
keep control over yourself.
Made a good point in that it's a

1055
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:29,130
controlled environment.
Like,

1056
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:30,450
so kate,
like what you do,

1057
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,080
they set up these artificial time limits
and rules.

1058
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,390
Right.
The artificial thing being not by

1059
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:37,240
artificial,
but you know,

1060
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,340
they just decided five minutes stand up
and then the girls get to decide and

1061
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:46,320
then they talk like this is the rules
for the game and they set up but well,

1062
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:49,710
what is that then?
Because really what you would do is you

1063
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,910
would just play it out as long as it's
entertaining and if you were just going

1064
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:55,740
to play it out as long as it's
entertaining and give you a microphone

1065
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:57,300
and give her a microphone.
Well they did.

1066
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,160
They did.
I mean I had a microphone for sure.

1067
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:02,280
I had listened to.
There's options there to just haul if,

1068
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,080
if they,
if they shit on you,

1069
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,640
you could definitely haul off on them.
I'm just saying it's a position where

1070
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:12,930
it's like it's almost asking for you to
get made fun of and then you're just

1071
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,070
kinda like,
well alright.

1072
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,950
But I really can't make fun of them back
the way I would make fun of them.

1073
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,890
Yeah.
Well I dunno.

1074
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,980
I guess I could do it,
but I'm just kinda like these four girls

1075
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:23,730
who were like,
you know,

1076
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,730
quote unquote friends for the most,
some of them closer than others,

1077
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,240
but you're like,
I don't want them to be all upset them.

1078
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,030
They'll say whatever they want to be and
I'll let it roll off and who gives a

1079
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:33,864
shit,
you know,

1080
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,400
if it stings for a second,
it stings.

1081
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,370
But like these are phone calls later,
you know what I mean?

1082
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:39,270
Where it's like,
Hey,

1083
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:42,240
well why would you bring that up?
That the thing you know about me?

1084
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:42,751
I'm like,
I don't know.

1085
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:43,920
I thought we were swinging for the
fences.

1086
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,540
Yeah,
man.

1087
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,100
I don't know.
It's just a,

1088
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,820
it's a game.
You know,

1089
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,550
you're playing a game and it's a fun
game,

1090
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,020
you know,
that's what it is.

1091
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:55,890
But it's,
it is,

1092
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,880
it is kind of weird that you could never
do it with a bunch of men judging women.

1093
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,551
No,
no,

1094
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,384
no.
It will be.

1095
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,520
I mean,
you could,

1096
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,020
you probably could do it 50 years ago if
he,

1097
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,600
if he could probably do it today.
You know,

1098
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,780
you know that Mike favor man story,
right?

1099
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,070
If you flip that story around just the
guy girl roles in that one that goes

1100
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,140
like it goes nowhere.
Nobody gives a fuck.

1101
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:17,670
I don't give a shit.
No one gives a fuck.

1102
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,470
Girls could,
you know,

1103
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:21,300
um,
girls can make fun of a lot of things

1104
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:24,240
about a guy and it's totally different
than the guy doing it about a girl.

1105
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:29,540
I've got all my newest.
A few jokes since special are rooted in

1106
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,190
respect.
Like women,

1107
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:33,940
like I said,
I,

1108
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,751
I,
I'm all,

1109
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,690
I'm so pro women as far as the equal
pay.

1110
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,270
And I said everything that they want to
possibly do in the world,

1111
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,910
achieve all your goals.
Just like a dude,

1112
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,750
I don't care.
But like manhood is being stripped down

1113
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,760
big time.
I mean,

1114
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:51,070
like I said,
the example I use,

1115
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,190
it all came up from a speaking to my
girlfriend and my buddy about UFC.

1116
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,020
It was a conversation with the three of
us.

1117
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,660
I never knew.
My chick thought this way.

1118
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,710
She goes,
I'm doing,

1119
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,330
but the UFC guys house together.
They did that whole documentary about

1120
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:11,530
the domestic abuse problems running
through now and my girlfriend goes,

1121
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,000
oh,
I would never want to date a guy like

1122
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,110
that.
Like if he could just like,

1123
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,480
lose control,
like he just beat the shit out of you

1124
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,010
and it's like I could beat the shit out
of you.

1125
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,300
Control.
Do you,

1126
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,160
are you,
do you think that I can't do that?

1127
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,700
Like why would you say that to me in
front of the friendly.

1128
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,720
Of course they can beat the shit out of
you.

1129
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:30,721
I just don't do this.
Like she thinks she's at.

1130
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,590
She would have a shot.
Yeah,

1131
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:33,720
I think there really isn't going to
affect.

1132
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,170
Oh,
just dumb guys.

1133
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,480
You know,
Reagan used to have that great fucking

1134
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,840
joke by the commercials,
you know?

1135
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:41,320
And then the guy's like stuck in the
mini blinds.

1136
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,480
Like how do you work this crazy thing?
It's like,

1137
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,790
my husband's so stupid.
That's why I have pop tarts.

1138
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:52,150
Joker ethic isn't like you really think
that manhood is being torn down though?

1139
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,470
I think uh,
yeah,

1140
00:48:56,471 --> 00:48:58,990
I think masculinity is like attacked
more than anything.

1141
00:48:58,991 --> 00:48:59,440
Probably.

1142
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,990
I think it's attack,
but I don't think it's effective.

1143
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,680
I think that I don't think it's having
an effect on whether or not things are

1144
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:09,190
still masculine.
It's real problematic for two reasons.

1145
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:12,700
One,
because it's okay to be really feminine,

1146
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,540
so if it's okay to be really feminine,
why is it not okay to be masculine?

1147
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,600
Like there's a big difference between
being masculine and being rude,

1148
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,150
being mean,
being homophobic,

1149
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,520
but they are.
They shouldn't be.

1150
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,653
They shouldn't be.
No,

1151
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,440
they shouldn't,
but I'm saying,

1152
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,080
but they are in that regard,
so that's what I'm saying though.

1153
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:33,040
It's like being pretty and feminine
doesn't mean you're a cunt who stuck up.

1154
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,260
Sure.
Those get lumped together too sometimes

1155
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,290
too,
but that's just dummies and it's the

1156
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,560
same dummies that are attacking
masculinity for just being masculine.

1157
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,980
Like here's one of the.
This is this crazy fucking phrase that

1158
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,690
these dummies like to throw around
lately.

1159
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,570
Regressive left.
People like to throw around this phrase,

1160
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,960
toxic masculinity and they're blaming
toxic masculinity on this guy.

1161
00:49:56,081 --> 00:50:01,081
Shooting up that gay crowd in Orlando.
This was this article and they were

1162
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:04,720
using the term toxic masculinity.
That's first of all,

1163
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,790
that's not real.
There's no,

1164
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,360
there's no amount of being masculine
makes you toxic.

1165
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:10,871
Yeah.
Okay.

1166
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,550
And there's nothing.
If you're a shitty,

1167
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,430
nasty person has nothing to do with
masculinity.

1168
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,020
If you're an evil person,
obviously it happens at mass shooters

1169
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,760
are almost exclusively men.
Yeah.

1170
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:27,190
But that's not toxic masculinity.
That's a fucking psychopath.

1171
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,050
That's what that is.
It has nothing to do with masculine or

1172
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:32,410
feminine.
It's not gender determined.

1173
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,380
That guy was already chemically off and
then he was like a,

1174
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,690
you know,
a repressed homosexual by all accounts.

1175
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,360
Yeah.
So it's like you can't.

1176
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:41,840
Yeah,
that's not,

1177
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,160
that's nothing to do with masculinity.

1178
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,970
So was the guy,
they call it la apparently the guy that

1179
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:48,620
they caught in la who had one of his way
to the explosives.

1180
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,420
Yeah,
an arsenal in his car.

1181
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,380
They caught him on his way to the gay
pride parade.

1182
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,920
Apparently he is allegedly bisexual as
well.

1183
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,820
I think there's a pride parade,
crazy fucks out there in this world and

1184
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:05,720
to start breaking it down by gender or
masculinity and femininity,

1185
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:08,330
it smacks to me of like some sort of
ulterior motive.

1186
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,230
And I always feel like the ulterior
motive when you see these guys were

1187
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,790
writing these articles,
they're weak people,

1188
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,660
they're not,
they're not like powerful forces of

1189
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,810
genetics.
They're weak people and I think a lot of

1190
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:25,811
times weak people they want in some way
or another to even the playing field in

1191
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:31,190
one way to do that is by pulling down
examples of masculinity that they can't

1192
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,210
possibly approach.

1193
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:32,901
Well there's,
yeah,

1194
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:36,260
there's a type of guy.
Exactly who stands behind the feminist

1195
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,660
issues,
like really like vehemently like

1196
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,940
bitching at some guy.
Exactly.

1197
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,910
It's called virtue signaling.
Somebody gets that man.

1198
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:45,430
If you like it,
you know,

1199
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,870
a joke or something that you say were
you included were like,

1200
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,290
oh these dinky broads over here.
And they go broads really brilliant.

1201
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,390
Like dude,
like,

1202
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,700
come on,
fuck off.

1203
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,830
Yeah,
just get Outta here.

1204
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,480
I know what you're doing there.
Just the virtue signaling phrase that

1205
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:06,890
Michael Shermer uses is a great one.
He's got this interesting point of view

1206
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:08,330
on.
It is like what they're doing is they're

1207
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,820
just trying to let everybody know that
there are more ethical than you.

1208
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,180
They're more moral than you.
They're a better person than you look at

1209
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:14,781
me.
Look at me.

1210
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:15,800
Yeah,
exactly.

1211
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,410
It turns it on there.
They're just looking for.

1212
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:21,530
Even if they don't even,
they probably don't even know whether or

1213
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:24,680
not it makes sense.
They just know that it's an effective

1214
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:28,280
stance to take to look like a super
progressive person.

1215
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,150
So you just go after it.
You go after the hardest levels of it.

1216
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,460
Yeah.
There's a lot of people like that.

1217
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,400
These days they're doing that.
It's because of social media.

1218
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:41,660
It's given morons and opportunity to
blurt out and to get reactions from

1219
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,880
their blurt outs,
even if they haven't really thought them

1220
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:48,560
through and they're almost always
exclusively insulting and mean and

1221
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:50,630
nasty.
So these people that are trying to

1222
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,910
proclaim their virtue,
they can't even like argue a point while

1223
00:52:55,911 --> 00:53:00,911
being just a decent human being.
You can't even like say what you feel

1224
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:04,700
about something without being some sort
of an insulting,

1225
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,500
like nasty,
condescending,

1226
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,890
defining that.
Define you like big Jay.

1227
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:12,900
You're a sexist piece of shit.
Like Tj,

1228
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,260
I said the same thing where it's like,
you know,

1229
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,700
clap for handicapped people.
Well,

1230
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,100
you know what?
I mean like it's the same like,

1231
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,590
uh,
you're supposed to feel a certain way

1232
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:24,380
about something and it's always attacked
like whatever it is.

1233
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,410
It's what you're saying,
right?

1234
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,244
He's like,

1235
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,680
am I getting that wrong?
No,

1236
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,110
I think we're both too high for this
conversation,

1237
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,170
but I know what I'm saying.
Just it's,

1238
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,860
there's,
there's some sort of like dishonest

1239
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:39,690
communication that's happening with some
of this.

1240
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,150
I think a lot of the outreach is not
real.

1241
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,020
I think what a lot of it is they're
acting outraged because they know they

1242
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:49,650
can.
Of course it's not balanced and it's

1243
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:52,260
also what I'm saying is it's really
shitty and insulting.

1244
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,160
Like when you get to a point of view on
something and there'll be really shitty

1245
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:58,800
and insulting about you and your point
of view,

1246
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:04,010
like an intelligent rational person
that's examining the thoughts and words

1247
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:06,780
of someone that they're not involved in
a conversation where they come to you

1248
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:09,200
and say like only a racist would say
something like that.

1249
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,970
They define you and some sort of a weird
way.

1250
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:16,170
If you have a point of view that they
feel like they can attack or you start

1251
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:19,410
with that one,
I'd say if you say a a bad neighborhood

1252
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,080
or even black people know you're talking
about a black neighborhood,

1253
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,020
that's a racist to say it's like as
black people,

1254
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,150
if that's a racist thing,
it's just kind of a thing,

1255
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:27,984
but it's that.
It's never.

1256
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,510
I've never been called racist or or
massages.

1257
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,260
Massages.
I've been called by a woman before but

1258
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,110
never been called racist by any one of
color of any sort.

1259
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,420
Well,
congratulations on that as well.

1260
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,900
So you've got four flux use.
You're not a racist.

1261
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,370
That's beautiful.
Oh No,

1262
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,040
but I'm saying I've been called.
I've had people get really upset with

1263
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,610
like racist jokes or anything.
They've deemed racist.

1264
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,760
Right.
It's always like a white paper.

1265
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,440
It's like the same point,
dude.

1266
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,650
Yeah,
yeah.

1267
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,513
Or,
or,

1268
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,150
or,
or a woman with a guy behind them going

1269
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:00,750
like,
yeah,

1270
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,340
Kurt Metzger gets into those things all
the time.

1271
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,090
Was a guy behind him,
but backing up some stupid point I,

1272
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,740
I get,
I got a bunch of shit for coming against

1273
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,470
the naked shows.
They do comedy shows.

1274
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,960
What?
Naked shows they do these naked comedy

1275
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:17,980
shows in New York sometimes.
Yeah.

1276
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,800
The whole audience is naked.
No,

1277
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,030
just the comics.

1278
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,490
Uh,
what the fuck I'm doing this.

1279
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,090
We're doing this thing,
this weekend's Skank fest for two days

1280
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,140
for Legion of skanks and at the creek
and the cave in Long Island city and

1281
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,210
we're having a,
a naked roast battle.

1282
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,630
I see the novelty in it.
I argued with a girl comic who's talking

1283
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,340
about like,
this is about getting over things and

1284
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,020
you know,
there's this artistic back to it.

1285
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:44,850
I go,
whatever you say,

1286
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,910
I'm just telling you.
Every guy goes there to see pussy.

1287
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,820
And she's at her argument was just like,
no,

1288
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:52,950
like people want to see like,
you know,

1289
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:54,900
the social experiment of it and see what
I go.

1290
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,430
I'm going to look at Pussy and I'm
telling you that I am Joe average in my

1291
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:01,830
thoughts.
Like I am common guy,

1292
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,100
but she'll run into a guy who argue
against that,

1293
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,290
but I don't go there for personalities.

1294
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:10,320
I like to hear these people talk.
So she came on our podcast with a dude

1295
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,010
who would.
Yeah,

1296
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,840
just say the whole thing goes.
No Man.

1297
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:13,700
It's about like,
you know,

1298
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,860
getting over fears and Cochran like more
just so excited to be with a girl like

1299
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,240
backstage with a girl and everyone's
sitting there with your Dick and pussies

1300
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,083
out.
Yup.

1301
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,370
We used,
me and Kurt used to do a Gig in

1302
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,600
affiliate was where you could do comedy
once in a while at a burlesque place

1303
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,660
called the five spot for less like a
leg.

1304
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,860
They did dancing with their clothes on.
They get down to the pastries and

1305
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:41,380
everything and the and the goofy
outfits.

1306
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:44,320
But me and Kurt would do this once a
month.

1307
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,480
We'd be like,
do comedy on that show.

1308
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,000
In between.
The first time we did it,

1309
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,080
we were bags and we were blown away
because it's.

1310
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,303
You never do it.
Well,

1311
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,370
they go,
don't be weird.

1312
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:56,980
Backstage dogs.
He knows the theater technically.

1313
00:56:56,981 --> 00:57:00,340
So the girls are running around naked
know they're changing so they're just

1314
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:04,450
naked a lot and sometimes they would
just sit around naked smoking cigarettes

1315
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:06,160
back there,
butt naked,

1316
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,240
sitting down and chairs.
Pussy all mashed up and me

1317
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,980
and me and I shouldn't even care throw
curtains under the bus like this.

1318
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:18,760
I'll speak for myself only.
I was just staring at tits and pussies

1319
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:20,410
nonstop.
I just,

1320
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:22,300
I'll speak for Kurt when he was doing as
well.

1321
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,270
I was staring at him and then the next
week and the next time he came in,

1322
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:28,390
the next month it was a.
There was like they put partitions up

1323
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,620
for the girls and I'm like,
yeah,

1324
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,740
but I'm not gonna.
Pretend that I wasn't back there to look

1325
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,910
above what you want me to force myself
to look into your eyes if you're that

1326
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,160
comfortable being naked and be
comfortable with me staring at you.

1327
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,170
Buzzy.
That's what I'm saying.

1328
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,390
Yeah.
That's be a t shirt.

1329
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:44,920
It should.
It should,

1330
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,350
because it's about to go to a nude beach
and look at it as like for me and Jeff

1331
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,770
Ross were in Australia and we were just
staring at the topless girls on the

1332
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,120
beach and they go,
well,

1333
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,040
they go,
that's,

1334
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,330
it's very common here to do that.
So it's not a big deal.

1335
00:57:58,331 --> 00:57:58,721
I'm like,
well,

1336
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:02,020
it's not coming from me and we're going
to stare at this girl's tits for awhile.

1337
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,750
Like I think it's fucking great.
She has them out.

1338
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,350
Who gives a shit?
But you would you stare at someone if

1339
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,760
they had clothes on?
No,

1340
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,510
and I don't stare in a sense the same
way.

1341
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,490
Yes.
If a girl was wearing jeans that a great

1342
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,280
ass and I like moments to take,
you know,

1343
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:19,620
to pick,
to look at her ass shit.

1344
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,040
If she knew that you were staring at,
you know,

1345
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,590
where you avert your gaze.
I never thought that.

1346
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:24,011
Uh,
yeah,

1347
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:25,780
I would.
I've never thought,

1348
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,770
uh,
I was being like the girls who had their

1349
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:32,530
pussies that I think they think like
thought that I was staring at them.

1350
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,450
I was trying to be as tactful as
possible.

1351
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:37,780
You being slick,
but I was constantly looking and enough

1352
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,870
so that like I couldn't be slick enough,
I guess that they figured it out.

1353
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,690
Well,
if you just have like a,

1354
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,280
a quick scan of the room,
that's one thing.

1355
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,890
But if you keep looking in the general
direction of naked people,

1356
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,940
even if you looking over their shoulder,
they're going to know what you're doing.

1357
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,250
Oh yeah.
But I've been that like I was that

1358
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:58,390
little fat John Candy Creep from splash.
Remember when John Candy was a kid,

1359
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:01,570
like dropping the quarters to look up
skirts and shit.

1360
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,150
I don't remember that.
That was his big thing to draw who

1361
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:07,630
dropped by quarters and then go down and
look up scrutinized clash with Tom Hanks

1362
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,250
and what's her name?
Daryl Hannah.

1363
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,540
Damn.
I never,

1364
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,850
uh,
I never did like a obnoxious,

1365
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:15,650
like look up a girl's skirt,
like getting on the ground or pick

1366
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:18,060
something up.
But like if I'd go to like a,

1367
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,290
like a rock concert when I was younger
and there's,

1368
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,700
you know,
on the lawn and there's a girl sitting

1369
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,530
like very purposefully,
like,

1370
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,570
you know,
she's naked or body painted.

1371
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,460
And her pussies out.
Same thing,

1372
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:31,100
like a posture up at a place where I
could check her pussy,

1373
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,250
eating her pussy out.
Like someone opened the door,

1374
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,170
let a cat out
out,

1375
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,130
close the gate,
pushing a out.

1376
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,160
It sounds like it's a trap.
Shit pussies out.

1377
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,080
It's wandered around the neighborhood.
But you have a girl just comes to body

1378
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:48,810
painted naked.

1379
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,480
Like yeah,
I'll get in a position now where I can

1380
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:52,100
check it out.
Of course you should.

1381
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,530
And so you should.
And that's part of the game of being

1382
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:58,330
outside naked.
They want you to see it just part of the

1383
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,950
way you are.
But someones watching you watch that and

1384
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,860
go on like a piece of shit up
objectifying.

1385
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,330
That's what I'm saying.
I'll come to that and you're like,

1386
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,920
no man,
I'm just being honest.

1387
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:12,010
Some girls but some men will do that.
But those men are almost entirely week.

1388
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,480
All of them.
Yeah.

1389
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,420
This wise,
mind wise,

1390
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:18,263
there's just.
Yeah,

1391
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,520
well they're the ones you find out
there's like,

1392
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:21,620
you know,
pedophile porn on their computers at one

1393
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:25,580
point when they die or they're just
socially retarded and they just don't

1394
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,000
know how to communicate with girls and
this is the,

1395
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,490
by being incredibly virtuous,
they've picked up this extra personality

1396
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:35,600
trait that they think's gonna ask them
over the top and whenever you're looking

1397
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,910
to find,
I think the connection to fund with a

1398
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,910
woman when you do that,
you're not going to find,

1399
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,870
you're not going to find it.

1400
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,090
She did not gonna you're not gonna find
that or you're like,

1401
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:46,790
you know,
repressing something yourself because

1402
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,690
there really is like the,
at the end of the day,

1403
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,090
like most women,
I've never speak for all of them.

1404
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,400
Do one a man.
Yeah.

1405
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,740
And most men want a woman.
Yeah.

1406
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,370
But yeah,
I mean,

1407
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:02,180
you know what I mean?
A manly man in whatever way.

1408
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,450
I'm not like a handy guide necessarily,
but like my girlfriend feels like secure

1409
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:08,391
with,
you know what I mean?

1410
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:11,400
Like I'm a guy with a wild run away from
her.

1411
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,590
If we get held up or something,
you know,

1412
01:01:13,591 --> 01:01:18,230
I don't try to fight for myself or like
she feels like secure with me in several

1413
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:20,600
ways.
My manhood is in whatever ways they are.

1414
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,460
Have there been like,
I can't fix cars.

1415
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:23,960
I don't know how to do any of that shit.
You know what I mean?

1416
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,400
The problem isn't that there's men and
then there's weak people and that

1417
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,070
there's inbetween.
There's women and weak women and strong

1418
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,890
women.
The problem is when people lash out

1419
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,920
against one group that has nothing to do
with something that happened in the

1420
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,450
news,
like if you talk about masculinity,

1421
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,270
toxic masculinity in this fucking
assassination,

1422
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,940
that guy was mentally unbalanced,
crazy,

1423
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,260
fuck,
tormented.

1424
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,360
Evil,
sociopath,

1425
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:52,670
psychopath would,
whichever you want you want to call it,

1426
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,240
who did a heinous thing has nothing to
do with masculine or feminine.

1427
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,540
It's just a stupid argument,
and just to start that,

1428
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,760
to start that conversation conversation,
you're like,

1429
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,250
you're separating the teams.
You're making the left and the right.

1430
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,260
You're making the cowboys versus the
raiders.

1431
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,420
You're doing something there.
You're doing something there.

1432
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:09,050
You're,
you're,

1433
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,350
you're establishing boundaries.
It's just people that suck.

1434
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,500
That's the problem.
This world has nothing to do with

1435
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,140
gender,
nothing to do with sexual orientation,

1436
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,040
and as soon as you make it,
those things,

1437
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,580
you confuse the fuck out of the whole
argument because if you can't make fun

1438
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:26,070
of any women or you can't talk shit
about any women,

1439
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,680
well then you're admitting that women
are weaker.

1440
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,860
Just like if I can make fun of men,
but I can't make fun of women.

1441
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,540
If I make fun of women,
I'm going to massage this.

1442
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,220
If I make fun of men too,
I hate myself.

1443
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,310
Like how does that work?
It doesn't work,

1444
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,523
but that's,
you know,

1445
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:42,660
you gotta speak to her old friend Jamie
Kilstein about those subjects.

1446
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:45,540
That's what he means.
Well,

1447
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,250
I do too,
but I'm like,

1448
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,150
he seems like a different human being
than the one that I knew.

1449
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,100
You know,
over a decade ago,

1450
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,320
people change big j.
They sure do.

1451
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,110
They eat a lot of granola.
Alfalfa.

1452
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,880
So bizarre.
Yeah.

1453
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,970
Listen man,
it's exactly what we're talking about.

1454
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,410
It's,
you know,

1455
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:08,410
they just see people go too far,
sometimes the ideas because there's

1456
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,790
nothing wrong with being gay.
There's nothing wrong with being

1457
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:13,230
straight.
There's nothing wrong with being a

1458
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:14,490
woman.
There's nothing wrong with being a man.

1459
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,890
The problem is when people are shitty to
each other,

1460
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,720
that's all it is.
That's the only problem.

1461
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,370
It has nothing to do with anything else.
So the.

1462
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:24,510
There is definitely a problem when it
comes to mass shooters being all men.

1463
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,610
Yeah.
That's probably looking at what the

1464
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:29,710
fuck's going on there,
but don't just jump,

1465
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:35,090
don't just jump and assume and Delta put
it out on the other $150 million men

1466
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,020
that live in the country.
That is the dumbest fucking percentage

1467
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:43,320
point ever.
Mass shooters and the rest of the men

1468
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,000
motherfucker come.
Yeah,

1469
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:47,520
but.
But they'll jump on this thing,

1470
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:51,000
man.
People jump on this gender thing and

1471
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:54,560
they jump on you,
which you got as a religious idea.

1472
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,690
Logically poison psychopath.
That's what you got.

1473
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,090
That's interesting.
Ted Talk Right now.

1474
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:00,924
I did not.

1475
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,000
His Dad says some things where he was
like,

1476
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,740
you know,
was like,

1477
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,090
I'm,
I'm appalled at what my son's done.

1478
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:10,630
Like God will work out the gaze himself.
You see,

1479
01:04:10,631 --> 01:04:13,350
he comes from like,
you know,

1480
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,910
it doesn't always start,
you know?

1481
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,740
Yeah.
With the fucking story.

1482
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:20,840
I wonder when they a autopsy that guy
will ever have.

1483
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:24,330
I'm still waiting to find that.
I always heard Charles Whitman,

1484
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,000
right?
He was the guy who climbed the tower and

1485
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,800
started shooting people in Austin.
Yeah.

1486
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,960
Um,
they said if he was a like all tops,

1487
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,250
if we have the same like science,
like now that we had that back,

1488
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:41,010
if we had the same science then we have
now they would have found out he had a,

1489
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:46,011
a temporal lobe
tumor that was pushing on it.

1490
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,150
So he was,
he woke up,

1491
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,580
he would have been found guilty of
something,

1492
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,660
obviously murdered people.

1493
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:56,460
But like I wonder how that would've gone
legally because he woke up not his

1494
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:57,930
fault.
Pure rage.

1495
01:04:57,931 --> 01:05:00,820
Like he killed his dog.
I think he killed his,

1496
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,270
his own girlfriend or something.
He killed,

1497
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:05,060
I think,
people on the way to the tower,

1498
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,810
just like everyone.
He kind of came across,

1499
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:09,760
he just did something to him killed.
So it's like,

1500
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,400
they're like,
he might not be found guilty,

1501
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,940
sentenced to life in jail anymore,
or something like that.

1502
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:18,040
I would've always wondered for something
like that there because man,

1503
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,670
pulling a trigger on people's.
I mean,

1504
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,610
you're,
you're just at a totally different.

1505
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:26,020
I couldn't even wrap my brain around
what that is that can make you do that,

1506
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,700
you know,
the columbine kids and everything.

1507
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:29,540
You're like,
it's not,

1508
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,320
I don't want to get in the same kind of
Bill Maher trouble where he said,

1509
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:32,950
look,
you know,

1510
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,370
that 9:11 suicide bombers are cowards.
You know,

1511
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,570
you've got a lot of trouble for that.
But I,

1512
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:39,580
I,
I think I got what he was saying where

1513
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:41,230
I'm still kinda like,
man,

1514
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:41,981
that's it.
Fuck it.

1515
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,340
It's really,
I think seeing somebody get shot with

1516
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,540
like affect me for a long,
long couch.

1517
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,750
The wrong wing allowed to fucking coward
is the wrong word.

1518
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:50,990
Being being,
uh,

1519
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:56,010
having the ability to go and just like
spray down a bunch of people,

1520
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:59,410
but it's fucking like,
it's an intense thing to dive in.

1521
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,130
Oh,
it's a foolish thing to call them

1522
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:04,880
cowards because I think when you,
whenever you call a murderer cowards,

1523
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,230
you,
you like set your,

1524
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,190
your looked challenging.
The manhood of other murderers.

1525
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,251
Yeah.
Really.

1526
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:13,580
You know what I mean?
Like you're calling me coward.

1527
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,110
Oh No,
I take five.

1528
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,970
You want to the other one up.
You after you insult them.

1529
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,380
Comic Little Dicks after they do
something.

1530
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,990
Yeah.
You feel better with your little Dick

1531
01:06:23,991 --> 01:06:26,210
now tick thing.
Oh my God.

1532
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,400
You know,
it's just.

1533
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,240
This may be the shooter had a little
Dick.

1534
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:30,074
Like,
whoa.

1535
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,440
Really?
I've read that on twitter.

1536
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:37,580
Men like a little Dick thing.
Yeah.

1537
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,320
Coward.
So psycho.

1538
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,540
Yeah.
Coward is the wrong word.

1539
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,760
They're evil.
That takes a lot of balls to fly a

1540
01:06:43,761 --> 01:06:45,850
fucking plane right into a building.
Like,

1541
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:46,820
you know,
it's over.

1542
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,440
Oh my God.
But you're definitely,

1543
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:54,110
you're going sideways to your banking
hard into the building.

1544
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,560
Oh,
let's watch it.

1545
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,880
Let's watch a real quick video just to
freak me out.

1546
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,610
I'm freaking out right now.
I'm thinking it's going in the building.

1547
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:05,200
I'd say it's too tough.
The beginning of,

1548
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:08,080
uh,
most of most of that footage.

1549
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,460
The underneath one.
Oh,

1550
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,520
you just see the building swallow it.
Yeah.

1551
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,670
It's fucking bonkers.
I remember watching it on tv that

1552
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:16,504
morning

1553
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:20,090
just watching the plane hit the building
over and over and over again.

1554
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:20,880
Just going,
wow,

1555
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,780
how am I even seeing this?
Is this even really?

1556
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,890
Am I seeing this?

1557
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:29,010
The second one was one of the most like
tense moments I've ever had in my life

1558
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,090
where I was just like,
wait,

1559
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,560
because that's when you knew right away
you're like,

1560
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,240
oh shit,
this isn't an accident.

1561
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:34,860
Yeah.
Because the first one they were still

1562
01:07:34,861 --> 01:07:37,950
kinda like,
there must be some kind of radar issues.

1563
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:42,980
There's still a hell of a radar issue.
They flew to fucking planes filled with

1564
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:48,630
people in the buildings.
That is one of the craziest moments in

1565
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,810
human history.
And it happened during our lives and

1566
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:55,410
then after they did it,
we imploded the building with our seven.

1567
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:57,300
Look at this.
Boom.

1568
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,790
That is so crazy.

1569
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,090
Oh my goodness.
Scale,

1570
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,610
scale.
It's like so far away because it's so

1571
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:10,990
high up that you can't like how big that
was.

1572
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:12,650
The people in that bill.
You know what I'm saying?

1573
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:14,850
Like the actual,
like six.

1574
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:16,100
You know what I mean?
The situation that seems

1575
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,521
like it's so,
you know,

1576
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:18,220
just like finger lengths away from him.
He said,

1577
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:22,320
but I mean like it how huge a fucking
jet play on the floor,

1578
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,440
on the floor of a building.
This.

1579
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:29,090
We're looking at the video of the tower.
The second plane crashed the World Trade

1580
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,640
Center from the,
uh,

1581
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,980
from the ground looking up.
It's insane.

1582
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,290
It's still insane.
It's still hard to believe,

1583
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,700
man.
Still hard to believe.

1584
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,140
Yeah.
This 15 years.

1585
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:41,160
It really,
it still is that,

1586
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:44,090
that was in our lifetime in New York
City.

1587
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,740
That the thing about those,
that,

1588
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:46,581
that's,
it's so.

1589
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,380
There's so much scary going on,
right?

1590
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,970
Because there's the scary of someone
that has the conviction of fly a plane

1591
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,800
right into a building that's fucking
scary.

1592
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,510
There's the scary that they will take
hundreds of innocent people with them.

1593
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,640
That's scary.
There's a scared they're going to fly

1594
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:04,640
into a building they know is going to
kill random people with kids,

1595
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,380
with moms,
with Dads,

1596
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:08,620
with best friends with,
you know.

1597
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,820
Yeah.
They don't give a fuck.

1598
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:14,060
They're going to fly right into that and
kill all those people.

1599
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,090
And then the damage to the building of
course was killed.

1600
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,780
Who knows how many people.
But the whole thing is just bananas and

1601
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,100
will never have.
I mean,

1602
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,650
you know,
give them a turn to debone it.

1603
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:25,880
Well,
but I don't know how much that,

1604
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,400
if it could ever happen at gathering,
people will never.

1605
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:32,090
If you jumped up on a plane,
I think now to say,

1606
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,730
hey everyone,
I like to say I'm going to propose to my

1607
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:37,820
wife like,
hey everyone out before someone's going

1608
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:40,250
to fucking mall like the temple you.
I'm taking it out.

1609
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:45,350
Somebody told me to look up
how many pictures there are people like

1610
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,930
hog tied on planes,
a lot of pictures of that because like

1611
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,470
they just freaked out on a plate and get
tied up because people get so nervous

1612
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:52,040
now.

1613
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,170
Yeah.
And rightly so.

1614
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:56,900
My I am,
I am surprised at the amount of people I

1615
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,550
will say who got hurt and killed in
Orlando because I'm surprised there

1616
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:03,860
wasn't like this.
A lot of people in tight quarters may

1617
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:06,140
think he just got swarmed at some point.
Yeah.

1618
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:09,500
I don't know what happened.
I don't know where he was.

1619
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,390
He might've had a vantage point where he
could shoot.

1620
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:13,110
Nobody could get behind them.
Might,

1621
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,800
you know,
he might have scattered some people

1622
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:19,270
really quick and they might have done a
lot of the damage themselves.

1623
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:22,040
I've fallen on top of each other.
You got to realize that a gun like that

1624
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,770
you could squeeze off 50 rounds in
seconds.

1625
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:29,300
So he killed 50 people and wounded 50
more or something along those lines.

1626
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:32,030
I mean like that.
Just go like that with your finger.

1627
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:32,391
Go.
Don't,

1628
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:32,841
don't,
don't,

1629
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:33,231
don't,
don't,

1630
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:33,620
don't,
don't.

1631
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,760
That's what that gun can do.
One,

1632
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:35,001
two,
three,

1633
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:35,331
four,
five,

1634
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:35,661
six,
seven,

1635
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:35,871
eight,
nine,

1636
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:36,231
10,
11,

1637
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,880
12.
You've already shot 12 people.

1638
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,361
Thirty,
40,

1639
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:38,930
50,
60.

1640
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:39,763
You know,
you keep going.

1641
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,390
Twenty one,
22 through to divert.

1642
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,050
Some of them are the ones where it's.
So it's got,

1643
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,070
it's got to be a trigger pull for every
bullet,

1644
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,400
most likely,
unless he made it a automatic.

1645
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,070
I think there's some guns you can alter
that.

1646
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:54,980
You can turn them into a automatics most
likely.

1647
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:56,320
And Ar is one of those.
I don't know,

1648
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,830
I'm not,
I would be speaking out of school,

1649
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:01,460
but I know for sure it has a
semiautomatic function and when you pull

1650
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:03,050
it,
it's just every time you pull your

1651
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,180
finger treats a bullet.
Single Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo

1652
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,650
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo.

1653
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:10,220
I mean you can literally shoot faster
than you can say the numbers.

1654
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:10,611
One,
two,

1655
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:10,881
three,
four,

1656
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:11,181
five,
six,

1657
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:11,421
seven,
eight,

1658
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:11,900
nine,
10.

1659
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,540
You shooting way more than that.
You just fire them off man.

1660
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,820
And you would hear people that cell
phone,

1661
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,590
you could hear it in the background and
it's quick.

1662
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,430
It's terrific.
Terrific that someone would have that in

1663
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:25,440
them.
And so it's like there's no like,

1664
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:27,630
uh,
like Orlando,

1665
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:28,610
Florida.
Yeah.

1666
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:32,730
Well you hear about the alligator that
had a baby yesterday or no in Orlando at

1667
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,980
Disneyland.
No Shit.

1668
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:37,110
Yeah,
alligator ate a fucking baby.

1669
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:41,490
One year old baby snatched them,
drug them into the water and they,

1670
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,740
they,
they won't say killed the baby.

1671
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:47,400
This is how weird the news is.
They want to say it took the baby

1672
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:48,900
underwater.
Yeah,

1673
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:53,040
no immediate ate the baby today.
They feel too.

1674
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,290
That's so rough,
dude.

1675
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,600
You can't go near water and Florida,
man.

1676
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:03,480
You can't go near water.
They are infested.

1677
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,660
I used to live there when I was a kid
and we used to feed them.

1678
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,490
I used to live in Gainesville,
Florida,

1679
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,390
and we used to go to Lake Alice.
There's this little pond and we'd throw

1680
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:15,930
marshmallows in the water and the
alligators would come up and it was like

1681
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,480
they were harmless.
They were always laying around like you

1682
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:22,380
would walk around near alligators.
Really fucking so strange.

1683
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,760
Now that I think about it like I had,
I had a crazy dude on many occasions.

1684
01:12:26,761 --> 01:12:29,040
I was within 20,
30 yards of an alligator.

1685
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,410
They'd never fucked with people.
They never did anything,

1686
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,890
but it was because they were endangered.
They killed a fuck load of them.

1687
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:41,400
So when people first got to Florida,
I guess they just started slaughter and

1688
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:44,880
alligators and they slaughtered them so
much that they became protected.

1689
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,760
So when I lived there,
I guess it was the seventies,

1690
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,080
it was protected.

1691
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,610
He couldn't kill alligators,
but now there's guys who have like tags,

1692
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:57,780
like professional alligator hunters.
They have 500 tags so they can go out

1693
01:12:57,781 --> 01:13:02,310
and shoot 500 alligators and really they
can't put a dent in the population.

1694
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,940
They let these mother fuckers take root
and they're everywhere.

1695
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:08,610
Do you see that 15 foot one that was
walking across the golf course the other

1696
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,140
day because they figured out that was
real.

1697
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:10,831
Yeah,
it's real.

1698
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:12,910
There's two different angles.
Do you see the new angle into.

1699
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,640
I go,
dude.

1700
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,810
I mean it's a dinosaur.
It's a dinosaur to new angle to really

1701
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,300
close to it.
They're like,

1702
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,350
you know,
like less than 30,

1703
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:26,620
40 yards away from it looks depending on
how strong their zoom is on the like

1704
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,640
crazy tall two huge.
It's enormous.

1705
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,290
It's walking.
It's like it's not.

1706
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:33,270
I thought that would kind of dragged on
the ground,

1707
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,920
this things walking because you're
almost like,

1708
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,783
what do you do it?

1709
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:38,700
You just kill that.
So that piece is off the earth.

1710
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,070
Well,
it's going to kill things.

1711
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,410
Whatever.
Whatever it gets a chance to kill.

1712
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:45,060
It's going to kill.
I mean that.

1713
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:47,310
There's not a whole lot that's going to
get away from that thing.

1714
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:51,480
It's not that fast.
They run like about as fast as a person,

1715
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:53,400
maybe a little faster than the average
person.

1716
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,940
Have they tracked it or was it bar?
It's a good question.

1717
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,830
I don't know what if they stayed up with
it at all?

1718
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:03,540
Those things scare the fuck out of me.
Those are heartless lizards and they let

1719
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:07,320
these goddamn things get to a really
high level of population.

1720
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,270
I'm not saying we should make them
extinct,

1721
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,340
but they definitely need to chop them
down.

1722
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,580
There's way too many of them and there's
not a lot of people that are interested

1723
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:19,570
in chopping them down like they used to
be like you'd have to send a lot of

1724
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:20,404
people out into the.

1725
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,050
In the everglades they found Nile
crocodiles.

1726
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:24,521
Really?
Yeah,

1727
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:27,640
they have a kill on site order for Nile
crocodiles.

1728
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,250
They found them all because they're
super aggressive and they found a bunch

1729
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,140
of them so far.
They're huge.

1730
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,540
Those things get to be more than 20 feet
long.

1731
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,300
Just the ones that need water buffaloes
and shit.

1732
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,560
Is there a video,
a video of a world obese get me by.

1733
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,050
Oh Dude.
You never seen.

1734
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,420
No.
Huge abandoned initial attempt go to

1735
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:51,340
Nile crocodile eats willdabeast.
There's like thousands of videos because

1736
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:53,530
these things can go under water for
hours at a time,

1737
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,580
so what they do is they slide into a
pond and they move closer to where the

1738
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:58,480
hubs are.
They,

1739
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:03,000
they hear the sound of the hoods and
they get in the water and then they're

1740
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:06,070
underwater lying in the mud for fucking
hours,

1741
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,000
just waiting for something to come up
and take a drink and when these things

1742
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:12,820
come up and take a drink,
they just get snatched.

1743
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:13,390
No,
five.

1744
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,530
There's some close ups,
man.

1745
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,960
There's some really good close ups.
I don't know if this is a good one.

1746
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,800
I haven't seen it before.
So the crocodiles,

1747
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:27,470
we'll wait for these things and just
decide all right,

1748
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:28,663
time to eat

1749
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,060
and they're all in the water.
They have to make these treks across the

1750
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,680
rivers.
I don't see any crocodiles.

1751
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:38,220
Jeremy [inaudible]
just mother fuckers.

1752
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,960
It was just a racist way.
Better videos is way better videos where

1753
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:47,290
it's like really close up.

1754
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,650
Left
there

1755
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,930
either watch other side.
Jesus.

1756
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,570
Yeah,
just drags it.

1757
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,250
Sorry.
They're sad.

1758
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,133
Yeah.

1759
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:06,650
That's why I go see
Jesus.

1760
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:10,350
Nature stuff never makes me sad,
but I'm always taken back by how

1761
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,600
even when I watched one the other day,
it was just,

1762
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,660
I don't watch a lot of those shows.
The nature shows when you see when it

1763
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:18,880
was like a or.
No,

1764
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:20,440
it was on world star hip hop.
Actually.

1765
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,110
It's why I watched it.
It was like a,

1766
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:27,340
the Emerald Wasp zone Africa,
uh,

1767
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:31,890
how it kills cockroaches.
It's like hit me like a zombifies them,

1768
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,990
like grabs him.
It does a whole process that rips off

1769
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:39,340
the antenna and then sticks it to kind
of paralyze it and it doesn't paralyze

1770
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:40,930
it.
It just makes it woozy.

1771
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,280
And then,
and then genesis,

1772
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,490
second thing into the brain and just
like liquefies the brain than just like,

1773
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,360
it's much smaller than the cockroach.
And then just lowers the cockroach back.

1774
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,780
Wow.
Just take some back.

1775
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,060
And this thing,
it's this big.

1776
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,470
It just sucks.
It's brain out.

1777
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,660
Yeah.
And then it just brings it back and just

1778
01:16:57,661 --> 01:17:00,570
throws it on the ground for the kids.
Holy Fuck.

1779
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,130
There's so many weird bugs,
man.

1780
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,980
When you really pay attention to all the
different kinds of species of bugs,

1781
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,560
it's very scary because we're just so
lucky.

1782
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,390
They're little.
They give bugs.

1783
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:17,090
Were like a cow sized.
We'd be fucked.

1784
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,520
We would be fucked.
Oh yeah.

1785
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:24,310
If we ever fucking VF ESX server,
we're lucky.

1786
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:26,810
We're so lucky.
Their little man,

1787
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:30,260
you know we are,
but we are no match for so much shit in

1788
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:31,760
nature.
Like animals and stuff.

1789
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:34,820
Like we couldn't.
You couldn't fight that and crocodile

1790
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:35,810
for sure.
No,

1791
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,710
there's so many weird bugs to where they
have like weird things that they somehow

1792
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:43,760
or another figure out how to do.
I'd say there's some parasite that takes

1793
01:17:43,761 --> 01:17:48,650
over a grasshopper's body.
It burrows into its body,

1794
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:53,890
takes over its brain and hijack set and
talks this grasshopper into committing

1795
01:17:55,191 --> 01:18:00,191
suicide by jumping into a lake so that
he can spawn out of its body and it

1796
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,060
bursts out of his body like an alien.

1797
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,620
What is this one,
Jamie?

1798
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,970
Oh,
sorry.

1799
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,080
It's going to kill itself.
Okay.

1800
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,650
Well these grasshoppers,
they killed themselves and then this

1801
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:15,980
aquatic worm comes out of their body.
There it is.

1802
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:22,030
It talks the grasshopper and the killing
itself so they can give birth to this

1803
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:23,091
warm.
I mean,

1804
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:26,360
look at this.
It grew in this thing's fucking body and

1805
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:28,640
it's long,
like many,

1806
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:31,610
many,
many times longer than the than the

1807
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,290
grasshopper itself.
How fucking strangers that just.

1808
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,080
It's like it is pure evil.
So there's so many creatures that are

1809
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,250
just like,
it's.

1810
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,250
But it works somehow or another.
There's probably too many grasshoppers

1811
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,250
and nature figured out some sort of a
way to weed it out,

1812
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,080
thin out the herd.
I mean,

1813
01:18:48,081 --> 01:18:51,770
think about all those asshole
willdabeast crossing that stupid river.

1814
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,930
Of course we need crocodiles.
What do you want?

1815
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:56,090
Like an unlimited number of willdabeast.

1816
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:57,800
You can't go anywhere.
You're trying to get on a highway,

1817
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,230
there's willdabeast everywhere,
but is that interestingly sort of like a

1818
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:05,231
parallel between like a
bit of a stretch I guess,

1819
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:07,490
but like the order of the nightclub
shooting thing,

1820
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,330
it really is an emotional creatures like
pack,

1821
01:19:10,331 --> 01:19:12,980
herd creatures like that.
Uh,

1822
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:17,010
just like one of them is just getting
killed by a stone cold killer like that,

1823
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,550
that crocodile.
You said they're,

1824
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:22,760
they're not emotional boy.
You couldn't teach a crocodile to love

1825
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:23,690
somebody.
Yeah,

1826
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:27,500
but that's not an aberration.
That's like standard crocodile behavior.

1827
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:30,200
When a person is doing it,
it's like this crazy aberration.

1828
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,340
Is He,
at least today,

1829
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,330
it's a deviation for sure,
but I'm just saying there is.

1830
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,270
He's coming out of a praying mantis now
and going right into the water so this

1831
01:19:38,271 --> 01:19:41,600
aquatic worm can fuck with everything.
Look at this.

1832
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,130
He killed the praying mantis and he's
escaping through its body into water.

1833
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,260
This is fucking nuts,
man.

1834
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,070
What a strange animal.
Look out.

1835
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,990
Big Pine comes near them and uh,
he yells,

1836
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:56,000
the mountain lion goes away.
And then the mountain lion was like,

1837
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:57,650
fuck this bitch.
And He makes them mad.

1838
01:19:57,651 --> 01:20:01,490
Run out of them and the guy sprays it
right in the face with bear spray and

1839
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:04,040
scares it off,
but it's fucking terrifying.

1840
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:07,590
It's a terrifying video because you
realized that a hundred and 50 monster

1841
01:20:07,591 --> 01:20:10,800
was trying to eat this dude and if you
didn't spray it in his face with some

1842
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:13,230
chemicals,
he would've been donesville this guy.

1843
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,810
We watched a murder.
We watched like a cat murder a guy.

1844
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,100
I mean this is,
this is what happened.

1845
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:18,870
Like Gimme Gimme some volume on this.
Jamie.

1846
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:27,190
I was expecting quite honestly for them
to just stay in the bush and watch me go

1847
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:27,800
by.

1848
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,580
There's a quote here that's okay.
We don't have to watch the news version

1849
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:32,414
of it,
but

1850
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,420
that capital right out.

1851
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,830
I like being an ecstatic to seeing them
too,

1852
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:42,030
being like really scared

1853
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,110
and those things will fuck you.
Fuck you up.

1854
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:49,380
No danger of like when they all go out
to a bunch of the comments [inaudible]

1855
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:52,460
of Joshua tree and shoot a lot of them,
a lot of them.

1856
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:54,840
They're making a lot of noise.
They'll stay away.

1857
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,190
Yeah,
because cat doesn't know if you have

1858
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:59,160
guns or something like that and they're
naturally wary about people.

1859
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,620
They know that people occasionally have
guns,

1860
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,960
so they sort of program to be scared of
people.

1861
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:05,040
Stay away.
Yeah,

1862
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:09,300
but if you're running that's a problem
because running seems like you're trying

1863
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:11,040
to get away,
so it excites them.

1864
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,710
Just like rolling a ball of yarn front
of a cat and excites them.

1865
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,250
Like if you were hiking and that same
person hiking probably wouldn't have as

1866
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:21,240
much of a an attractant to that.
Cat Bikes are bad too.

1867
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:24,270
They see try and take off on a bike and
they realize that's pretty fast.

1868
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,570
Motherfuckers going to get away if I
don't have to just start sprinting

1869
01:21:27,571 --> 01:21:29,130
towards.
You see the video of the guy on the

1870
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:31,020
bike,
he gets to get kicked by,

1871
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,800
its gets kicked.
What's the animal?

1872
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,810
He gets knocked off a bikeway gazelle
maybe.

1873
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,840
Oh,
I have seen that as jumping on me.

1874
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:43,670
It just wasn't.
That guy goes flying so far off the

1875
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:46,410
bike.
The thing just like hit him going 50

1876
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:48,210
miles an hour sideways,
right?

1877
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:49,044
Yeah.
Even the guy,

1878
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,930
it's like a buck or something.
Right?

1879
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,580
What kind of animal is it,
Jimmy?

1880
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:57,210
Oh,
Jesus.

1881
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:59,730
He got fucked up.
It was like you should have went high

1882
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:01,020
fived and other,
uh,

1883
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,340
of what is it a gazelle,
right?

1884
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:03,130
Yeah,
yeah.

1885
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,390
It goes.
He goes now,

1886
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:06,270
like I told you,
motherfucker,

1887
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,580
that was their jackass.
Three video.

1888
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,500
The Gazelle community.
That's their jackets.

1889
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,490
Three.
Oh,

1890
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,940
nailed them.
Oh my God.

1891
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:17,460
Look out and look at the gazelle.
Just sort of bounces off of them and

1892
01:22:17,461 --> 01:22:20,340
runs away.
Easy campaign.

1893
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,230
How,
how powerful animals are over us.

1894
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,780
We'll look at that through the air.
Look,

1895
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:33,230
I mean it's probably 250 300 pounds and
it's throwing itself into the air.

1896
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,050
You know,
that's a big ass animal.

1897
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:41,400
It's pretty impressive that we dominate
the earth to considering that like we

1898
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:44,310
are not even anywhere near the most
powerful.

1899
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,640
Just the smartest technical are so much
smarter than those dummies sit.

1900
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,940
We can shoot them from a distance that
you could make a,

1901
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:50,730
an antelope.

1902
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:53,340
You could turn into a steak,
eat it.

1903
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,340
Exactly.
All you have to do is set up a bi-pod.

1904
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,150
Get a nice clean rest,
relax you breathing,

1905
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,570
squeeze your fingers and boom,
a bullet goes through its body.

1906
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:05,500
You go pick it up,
you it,

1907
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:07,690
you open it up.
Take the organs that are edible,

1908
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,240
chop it down,
throw it on the grill and you're eating

1909
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:14,350
it in like less than an hour.
But if you're in like backed in a corner

1910
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:17,080
against the wall,
you're fucked with any dude in the

1911
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:18,350
world.
You have a,

1912
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,890
you have a puncher's chance of getting
out of that thing.

1913
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:24,910
Okay?
But as a gazelle is just going to murder

1914
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:26,260
you quickly,
you're fucked.

1915
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,580
A fucking ran that aren't even that big.
They'll just fucking pulverize you.

1916
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,800
I liked my chances with Ram,
it's take chess.

1917
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,220
If I got a knife and a Iran wants to get
crazy.

1918
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,190
I know if I'm talking about straight,
oh,

1919
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:40,650
straight,
like just choke him.

1920
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,710
I think I could joke around.

1921
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,610
I didn't take his back.
First of all,

1922
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:47,530
I feel like if I break one of his front
legs,

1923
01:23:47,531 --> 01:23:49,030
he's not going anywhere.
Right.

1924
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,700
So I'll.
I'll just dive on a Kamora.

1925
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:56,290
Are you using using Dalton's theory from
roadhouse man's leg?

1926
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:59,170
I'm going to slide under him,
so when he raises up,

1927
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,030
when he raises up,
I'm going to get that part.

1928
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:03,790
I'm going to push it forward and then
I'm going to get that double wrist lock

1929
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,740
position.
I'm going to crack that fucking leg.

1930
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:08,650
Then I'm going to roll into mountain and
once I get into mount,

1931
01:24:08,651 --> 01:24:10,120
I get ahold of his handlebars,
Bro.

1932
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:16,390
Probably hit me and knocked me 30 feet
into the air.

1933
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,060
Have you ever seen the video of ghost
write a book for you?

1934
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:21,160
Joe Rogan shows you how to defeat
animals,

1935
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,510
feeding wildlife with,
uh,

1936
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,350
just go through each animal.
Obviously.

1937
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,560
Don't try to fight a buffalo,
but um,

1938
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:32,740
there's a video of a ram and a cow
headbutting.

1939
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,410
It's fucking crazy because it's ram as
only like,

1940
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,491
I mean,
I don't know,

1941
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:40,000
it can't be more than like 150 pounds.
So it's not that big an animal.

1942
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:43,840
And the cows a fucking huge cow and they
collide heads.

1943
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:46,150
The cow was trying to get the,
to stay the fuck away from it.

1944
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:51,310
So it charged it and headbutted this ram
and the ram and knocked him the fuck

1945
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,130
out.
Knocked the cow out.

1946
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,220
Yeah,
just on the couch.

1947
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,000
His legs up.
Watch this.

1948
01:24:58,001 --> 01:24:59,770
Watch this.
Watch it right here.

1949
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:00,603
Right here.
Right here.

1950
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:03,460
The ribs coming up.
The cows like,

1951
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,700
oh,
I fucked up the rams woozy.

1952
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,440
But it gets right back up.
Like what I liked.

1953
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,930
I liked that a cow just because of their
build has naturally has a knockout arms.

1954
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,610
Where were.
They're still snoring.

1955
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,190
What was that video?
They're going to show a ram running over

1956
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:20,060
a biker.
There was.

1957
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,910
It was up next.
It was playing up next.

1958
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:26,080
That's my thought was so crazy was
jackass guys like when it got into the

1959
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:29,290
thing with a ram and just let her rams
nails a bunch of crazy.

1960
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,520
Those guys.
Well,

1961
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,020
how about when he,
you johnny?

1962
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:34,890
Knoxville stood blindfolded in front of
a bull for.

1963
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,050
Oh Shit.
It just ran right into his bike.

1964
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:41,170
On the back of the ram.
Yeah.

1965
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:43,780
What is that about?
Why is there a Gopro on the ram?

1966
01:25:43,781 --> 01:25:45,520
This is stupid.
Don't give these people any.

1967
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:49,600
How dare you put a go pro.
People were abusing wildlife,

1968
01:25:49,601 --> 01:25:52,360
but in Gopros on Ram.
That's ridiculous.

1969
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:55,370
Extreme though.
It is an extreme ram because that's what

1970
01:25:55,371 --> 01:25:56,920
I needed to go pro.
And you become extreme.

1971
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,880
Yeah,
no shit.

1972
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:59,350
You put one on your head.
It's extreme.

1973
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:03,010
Did you,
are that mcconkie documentary on?

1974
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,040
No,
what is

1975
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,240
it about the guy who was like,
he was an extreme skier and that he's

1976
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,480
got wait until the wing suits and base
jumping and shit.

1977
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,020
And uh,
they got a guy,

1978
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,420
I don't know if it was him that passed
away like this,

1979
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,540
but I remember in the documentary,
yeah,

1980
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,050
there's a base jump,
uh,

1981
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,910
somebody does illegally,
you know that you can't,

1982
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,820
they're not like,
okay to do anywhere really I guess.

1983
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:33,350
And he does a base jumping like a state
park when he lands the park,

1984
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:37,100
police were ever start chasing him and
while he's running from them trying to

1985
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:41,960
get away,
he dies like in the jumps in the creek

1986
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:44,480
and the water takes some or something
and he ends up drowning or something

1987
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:45,660
like that.
Oh.

1988
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,110
So then they stage is why I stay away
from all this shit.

1989
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,200
Then they stage a,
uh,

1990
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:53,690
like a jumping,
a protest jump because the police should

1991
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:56,860
take some but their fault somehow they
chased the guy,

1992
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,590
he jumped into the creek and uh,
so they staged this jump where

1993
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,920
everyone's going to base,
jump off this mountain and then when

1994
01:27:03,921 --> 01:27:04,840
they land there,
know,

1995
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,720
willingly getting arrested and by the
third person who did it,

1996
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:09,950
you just see the bike just go.

1997
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,820
Pumps,
smacks the ground.

1998
01:27:11,821 --> 01:27:14,930
Like shoe doesn't open because someone
dies again doing it.

1999
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:17,750
It's like idiots.
This is dumb.

2000
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,660
The dumb thing to do,
she's as Christ.

2001
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:22,640
We all,
my radio show we were talking about,

2002
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:24,250
uh,
like run.

2003
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:26,810
I'm all for amusement park rides,
roller coasters and everything.

2004
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:29,930
But you do hear the numbers of people
who have died on ones you've road is

2005
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,570
pretty crazy,
like pretty,

2006
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:34,340
pretty fucking great.
But we still keep getting on it.

2007
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:36,500
But maybe people die every year.
Have you had to guess?

2008
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:38,990
We're going to google it.
I'm going to die every year.

2009
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:42,340
And rollercoasters around the country.
One hundred hundred.

2010
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:46,880
Yeah,
I say less first day that the first day

2011
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:49,130
of one of them because they didn't
realize there had to be a height

2012
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:54,131
regulation for two tall seven people in
the car or something like that.

2013
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:57,830
I'm totally like seven people the first
day.

2014
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,500
Oh my God.
That must've been on one run.

2015
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:03,120
You know what I mean?
Like s seven tall people just got the

2016
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:04,020
cast,
so seven people.

2017
01:28:04,021 --> 01:28:05,930
Then they kept the ride.
I haven't been to an amusement park in a

2018
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:06,764
while,
but yeah,

2019
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,990
I haven't.
I haven't been to an amusement park in

2020
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:12,620
awhile,
but they now have height limits.

2021
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,590
Like you can't be too tall either.
What's up Jim?

2022
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,510
There's not that many.
Actually.

2023
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:19,250
I said 13.
You said 100.

2024
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:22,970
What is the actual number point two?
Seven deaths per year.

2025
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,780
Oh,
that's it.

2026
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:28,160
There's only been 52 since 19.
Between 1990 and carnivals and

2027
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:32,260
everything.
Rollercoaster rollercoaster carnivals

2028
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,270
and the amusement park desk.
Because some of them things aren't

2029
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:37,580
really.
Rollercoasters has all sorts of

2030
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:40,160
different shit.
Like those like drops.

2031
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,200
Let's create.
People have died in those things.

2032
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,570
Oh Man.
We watched her legs and some of those

2033
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:47,120
fucking disasters,
but the willing to go into it,

2034
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:51,260
but I don't know for some reason I think
there's a much lower risk of amusement

2035
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:55,070
park rides than like Scott.
A guy called us in and went skydiving.

2036
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,560
He said they,
they even let him cut corner.

2037
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:00,860
He was like a bigger guy so they didn't
make him wear a certain kind of harness

2038
01:29:00,861 --> 01:29:01,980
and he went into

2039
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,810
street clothes,
you're not really supposed to do that.

2040
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:06,240
And he said he went out.
He says fucking shoot,

2041
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:08,940
like got wound up.
Like it got like he literally,

2042
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:10,590
he hit the ground and they got fucked
up.

2043
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:11,040
But like,
uh,

2044
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,970
but it kind of opened like really late
and so he still hit the ground like

2045
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:15,691
hard,
but like,

2046
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:18,000
you know,
not hard enough to like kill them.

2047
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,570
You know?
What's crazy is that Disney has probably

2048
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:24,210
the safest rides and the safest ride
record.

2049
01:29:24,211 --> 01:29:26,850
They have huge amusement parks with
amazing rides,

2050
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:28,050
wild,
crazy shit,

2051
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:31,050
space mountain tower of terror,
all that stuff.

2052
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:34,770
Yet they let a fucking dinosaur live in
their resort.

2053
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,710
This allegation,
this kid did,

2054
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,640
they had a dinosaur living there like
they didn't check the lake for

2055
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:44,640
dinosaurs.
You know how fucking crazy that is?

2056
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,830
I mean,
imagine if you had a lake behind your

2057
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:51,150
house and you were pretty sure dinosaurs
lived in that lake and you had a kid,

2058
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:54,840
but he kinda came out of a lake so that
it wasn't little upon there.

2059
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,400
Like any body of water,
man,

2060
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:59,130
they'll crawl across the highway and
jump into a swimming pool.

2061
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:01,290
They don't give a fuck.
They find them and people's pools.

2062
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,221
Really?
Dude,

2063
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:04,580
there's so many of them.
There's so many of them.

2064
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,290
Then there's the everglades.
The everglades are infested,

2065
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,830
infested with alligators.
There's so many of them.

2066
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:14,130
People would go fan boat and they have
all kinds of crazy shit in there now

2067
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:16,320
though,
they have pythons and alligators and

2068
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,150
like you said,
Nile crocodiles,

2069
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,760
there's all sorts of ways to place dump
a body.

2070
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,050
Oh,
it's my last con.

2071
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,430
El gives you get it like that.
There was a lot of fucking.

2072
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:29,610
And then they have wild pigs.
There's a lot of shit going on in

2073
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:31,710
Florida.
It's a terrible place.

2074
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,210
Florida,
I was just there last weekend in Miami.

2075
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:37,230
It's like,
and by the way,

2076
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:40,110
I had a great time and fun people place.

2077
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:43,040
The actual place itself is just like
that.

2078
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:45,240
Humidity is the grossest thing I've ever
dealt with.

2079
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,170
Well,
it's also,

2080
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:51,200
there's an echo of the past in that
state and the entire city of Miami's

2081
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:57,390
like almost entirely funded by cocaine.
That's how that city became Miami.

2082
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:01,800
That's why it has more banks per capita,
allegedly probably Google this because

2083
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:04,800
I've said it too many times more banks
per capita.

2084
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,280
I think I found it on.
Um,

2085
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,030
Billy Corbin's movie cocaine cowboys I
think was talking about that.

2086
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,630
Maybe not,
but it was all coke saw people running

2087
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:16,080
coke and that fucking per se,
just like a bunch of clubs and

2088
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,680
restaurants and doing blow shooting
people and all the crime that was

2089
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,680
wrapped around coke and all the murders
and the violence and all the police

2090
01:31:25,681 --> 01:31:27,210
corruption.
Dude.

2091
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,950
Did you ever see cocaine cowboys?
Yeah,

2092
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,860
that was good.
Did you ever see corruption?

2093
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,880
Do you ever see the 75?
I had Michael Dowd in.

2094
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,960
Oh really?
Yeah,

2095
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:38,920
he's great.
He's hilarious.

2096
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,650
Yeah.
You should get them on legion of skanks

2097
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,180
for sure.
He'll do it.

2098
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,830
So you're not a terrible guy.
No.

2099
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,080
Really?
I mean saint.

2100
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:48,000
Yes.
I enjoy his company.

2101
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:52,710
He did some crazy shit for sure.
Everybody was doing blow and he was out

2102
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:56,160
of his fucking mind and went to jail.
He did his time and now he's just trying

2103
01:31:56,161 --> 01:31:58,710
to figure out what he's doing.
He's selling cigars and doing a bunch of

2104
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:00,760
different.
I've always loved the wives when they're

2105
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:02,870
just kinda like.
I thought it was weird when we were

2106
01:32:02,871 --> 01:32:07,170
going to Fiji on a beat cops salary.
They're just like,

2107
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,340
they don't know.
They just want to believe so bad.

2108
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,060
Yeah.
He's driving around a red corvette.

2109
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,360
He's like,
everyone's like,

2110
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,340
what the fuck is.
They were maniacs.

2111
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,740
They're maniacs,
but it's a great movie.

2112
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,800
It's a real a testament though to like
the same personality is extreme

2113
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:26,350
personalities that want to become like,
you know,

2114
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:29,590
just go fucking full blown.
Outlaw is the same.

2115
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,300
God said,
I'm going to protect everyone.

2116
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,220
Yes.
Yeah.

2117
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,110
It's a really isn't.
And one companies be Lord to the other

2118
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:36,640
side in a heartbeat.
Well,

2119
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:40,720
he slowly but surely got chipped away at
and I think also like he was talking

2120
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:45,250
about how his very first days on the job
he experienced like intense corruption

2121
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:49,360
where guys were talking about killing
people that snitched on cops and they

2122
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:53,980
were like kind of openly admitted that a
guy fell off of a roof that snitched on

2123
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:55,420
cops.
And he's like,

2124
01:32:55,421 --> 01:32:56,140
uh,
you know,

2125
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,370
that's what happens.
And he was like,

2126
01:32:57,371 --> 01:32:58,390
okay,
got it.

2127
01:32:58,660 --> 01:32:59,870
We're good,
you know,

2128
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:04,240
and became over time corrupt.
And he's pretty honest about it,

2129
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:04,480
man.

2130
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,860
I mean,
he doesn't hold anything back.

2131
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,590
So it's pretty.
I mean,

2132
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,730
it wasn't good times.
He wasn't a good guy.

2133
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:10,990
No,
no question about it.

2134
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:13,900
But it's a question of,
well,

2135
01:33:13,901 --> 01:33:15,010
yeah,
they were like looking the other way.

2136
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:17,500
What people did get killed.
I want to hear a story,

2137
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:18,610
you know,
I mean,

2138
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:22,450
I think it's an important story.
There's not a lot of cops that have gone

2139
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:24,920
bad that are approachable.
Like Michael Dowd,

2140
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,180
he's the most approachable and
interesting and you know,

2141
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:30,220
and he doesn't get along with the other
guys that he was uh,

2142
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:34,120
involved with the time because I guess
they at each other out or one guy ratted

2143
01:33:34,121 --> 01:33:35,200
him out.
Kenny,

2144
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,290
one of the guys on the show apparently,
or in the movie,

2145
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:43,480
but it's a great fucking movie that,
that guy that he's a talking to in the

2146
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:45,460
movie from where's he from?

2147
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,520
Nicaragua or something like that.
South America,

2148
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:51,700
the Dominican Republic.
Maybe that guy in him or making cigars

2149
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,080
now.
Oh really?

2150
01:33:53,081 --> 01:33:54,940
Yeah.
The Guy who was in the movie talking

2151
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:58,000
about killing people
disappeared.

2152
01:33:58,030 --> 01:33:59,590
Yeah.
It was like the main drug dealer guy.

2153
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:01,450
Yeah.
That was basically his partner.

2154
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:03,570
It was his name again.
Okay.

2155
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,200
But it's kind of funny.
They get,

2156
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:08,980
they get in with them with all those
corruptions stories where they get in,

2157
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,050
like with the drug deal,
but there's,

2158
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:14,380
they're almost like Newbie guys like
this is all kind of scary for us to.

2159
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:15,820
So what are we know?
But we went in,

2160
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:19,000
we'd love to get a part of this money
and then they start getting the money

2161
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,120
and then it says they start coming like
whacking people around and stuff.

2162
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,010
Hey Pablo,
is this your new guy?

2163
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:27,160
Just like drag him across the face.
She'll make me a big.

2164
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,970
Well you jerk off will in this case it's
actually kind of like a,

2165
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:34,680
a,
a happy ending drug dealer story because

2166
01:34:34,681 --> 01:34:38,670
the two guys are still friends.
Like they're older now and the two cops

2167
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:39,543
are still friends.
No,

2168
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,890
the car and the truck dealer.
They're buddies.

2169
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:47,310
Like Michael Dow visited the dude to go
save and put pictures of the two of them

2170
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:51,400
hanging out at his instagram page.
So in that sense they kind of.

2171
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,350
What was the other car?
Him and his partner,

2172
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:56,840
but the partner and him don't get along.
The partner.

2173
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,040
The testified against him.

2174
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,670
Yeah.
The partner wore a wire for him.

2175
01:34:59,671 --> 01:35:00,750
Right.
So yeah,

2176
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,300
the parties,
we set them up to be like,

2177
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:03,860
hey,
we're going to let this lady get killed.

2178
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,110
Yes.
Yeah.

2179
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,070
And then it all fell apart.
It's crazy.

2180
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:09,710
It's imagine being those guys in that
time.

2181
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,340
It's crazy.
I wonder with this length of time to

2182
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:16,130
get,
because you're going to be on edge no

2183
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:17,670
matter what.
Whenever you're starting something that,

2184
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:18,650
you know,
it was like bad,

2185
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,900
like you know,
it's like uh,

2186
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,340
how,
how long from starting it,

2187
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,420
like,
where you're nervous.

2188
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,440
Do you just be like,
this is just life and then one day it

2189
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:31,160
just all fucking gone.
But you do eventually forget that day is

2190
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,230
coming.
I don't think he ever thought it was

2191
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:35,270
coming.
I think he was just a cooked up maniac.

2192
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,770
I think when you do a lot of coke you're
just always.

2193
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:41,120
And then you try and get some sleep and
then you wake up in the morning.

2194
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,590
He not planning your future,
you just,

2195
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,490
just red lining every day.
I've never been to coachella ever.

2196
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:51,290
I don't even know.
He never done it.

2197
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,980
I did two lines ever.
Your two lines ahead of me.

2198
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:57,650
I did both of them.
I was just like,

2199
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,650
I stopped.
It was like immediate guilt of both.

2200
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:02,300
Just being like,
I don't want it.

2201
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:04,500
Like,
this is like so out of my range of like

2202
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:07,400
wanting to get involved in like,
what if it's great.

2203
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,560
Now I've got a whole fucking thing with
this now.

2204
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:11,510
If it's great,
like I don't want to get into that shit.

2205
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,400
Dude.
You're exactly like me in that regard.

2206
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,460
I took us,
I drank some tea once that was made out

2207
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:19,820
of coca leaves and uh,
it's a real pick me up.

2208
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,940
But the problem is for some.
I mean I was on mushrooms at the time as

2209
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:25,100
well,
but I couldn't shut the fuck up.

2210
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,970
I like couldn't shut the.
I was with Stan hope and I was talking

2211
01:36:27,971 --> 01:36:28,311
to him.
I was like,

2212
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:29,720
dude,
I'm really sorry but I can't shut the

2213
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:31,280
fuck up.
I don't know what's going on.

2214
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:33,800
I want to be annoying.
I don't know what it's going out with my

2215
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:34,581
mouth,
my mouth.

2216
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,380
I was just diarrhea.
Just wouldn't stop.

2217
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,270
I haven't,
I haven't taken a whole lot of shit.

2218
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:39,860
That some weird stuff.
I've tried.

2219
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:41,420
I tried adderall.
How is that?

2220
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:45,360
Um,
I was just awake for like,

2221
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,690
that's how it affected me.
A girl out here,

2222
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:49,370
actually,
when I came to visit one time a friend.

2223
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:55,060
This girl kept me awake for three days.
Tell me what you know Rick Shapiro?

2224
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,460
Yes,
it was Rick Shapiro's ex-girlfriend.

2225
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:00,530
Oh,
good Lord.

2226
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,240
Who is a comic also.
It was a friend of mine.

2227
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:05,360
She just let me crash at her apartment.
It was just doing that are all together.

2228
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:07,030
She was just like,
you want to try to add A.

2229
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:08,170
I'm like,
I never have.

2230
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,060
I'm sure I'll give it a whirl and three
days she kept me awake and talking to me

2231
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:14,630
about the genius of Rick Shapiro and
making me watch video clips of him and

2232
01:37:14,631 --> 01:37:15,464
everything.

2233
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,490
Like clockwork orange eyes up my eyes
and she was like,

2234
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,620
just adderall be with that and maybe
watch Rick Shapiro,

2235
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,720
which is not what other.
I mean I love Rick,

2236
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:29,840
but that's not what another comic wants
to do is sit there and watch Rick

2237
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,840
Shapiro mapped doubt check.
She is also an adderall math adderalls

2238
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:36,730
meth visit.
Really?

2239
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:37,880
Oh yeah,
it's math.

2240
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,800
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2241
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:43,100
I mean I don't know how much she was
really gone by the time I saw her.

2242
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,680
She was a,
well that's one of the reasons my gals

2243
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:46,850
like it.
Yeah.

2244
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:49,280
It keeps showing skinny,
but uh,

2245
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:50,390
yeah,
I did adderall.

2246
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:51,283
I've done,
uh,

2247
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:55,070
I did ecstasy once.
I did it once to Jamie.

2248
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,913
Pull that up.

2249
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,090
Whether or not adderall,
like what's the division?

2250
01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:01,080
Adderall in math,
it's like a very minor difference means.

2251
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:02,570
And it depends which one you take.
I'm pretty sure.

2252
01:38:02,571 --> 01:38:04,530
But look it up at there's more than one
kind of adderall,

2253
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:06,870
different kinds of outer or adderall.
Like things.

2254
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,910
Yeah,
because generic form is and it's very

2255
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:13,060
similar things.
It's fucking pill pill head kick in at

2256
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,240
once or twice and I got a different one
each time I took it,

2257
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:18,150
so that's good.
I'd hate to say that I enjoy from time

2258
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:22,260
to time a,
a like a Vicodin or percocet?

2259
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:25,470
Yeah,
like vary from time to time.

2260
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,500
I tried one or the other.
I don't remember which one it was.

2261
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,630
I think it was Vicodin,
but didn't agree with me.

2262
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:31,591
Yeah.
Yeah,

2263
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:34,560
just like just,
I just was really out of it.

2264
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,690
Okay.
Chemically adderalls and mixture of

2265
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:38,760
several amphetamine salts specifically.

2266
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,610
It's a con.
It's composed of equal parts of

2267
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:45,200
amphetamine,
aspartate monohydrate,

2268
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,530
amphetamine sulfate,
Dextro,

2269
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,550
amphetamine sulfate,
and Dextro Amphetamine,

2270
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:57,090
Saturate.
I'm don't know what that means.

2271
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,930
Sounds like,
what's the difference between adderall

2272
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,720
and Meth?
Because,

2273
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:07,410
uh,
just what's the difference?

2274
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:11,360
What's the difference between were so
folks shouldn't be.

2275
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:15,610
You guys want to take adderall?
I guess we're getting is metro.

2276
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,790
Let's organize.
Let's,

2277
01:39:17,810 --> 01:39:20,580
uh,
let's build a fort the.

2278
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:22,980
I have a 13 year old daughter now too,
so that's always the thing,

2279
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:26,400
you know,
got a buy to go try out a bunch of new

2280
01:39:26,401 --> 01:39:28,170
drugs now.
Seems like a bad idea.

2281
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:30,630
Okay.
Chemically the are very closely related.

2282
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:34,470
Adderall contains dextroamphetamine
salts that psychoactive chemical is

2283
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:36,850
amphetamines,
meth is methamphetamine.

2284
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:41,250
The difference between the two is the
molecules is one methyl group.

2285
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:46,140
So they're both amphetamines,
but one is a different kind of

2286
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:47,730
amphetamine,
but they're very close.

2287
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:48,990
Hmm.
Interesting.

2288
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:50,970
Okay.
For taking it for those three days,

2289
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:54,240
I'd never felt like a itch to go back
ever.

2290
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,830
Some people love it,
man.

2291
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:58,110
No,
some people fucking love it.

2292
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:00,720
I absolutely think you got a lot of
energy.

2293
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:01,770
You're,
you're uh,

2294
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:05,030
you're always like a,
like a fucking upbeat sort of a dude.

2295
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,880
Some people I don't think have that kind
of energy and maybe whether it's health

2296
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:12,000
related or not a little pick me up like
an adderall gives you a little

2297
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:19,110
feeling of getting shit done and
apparently it's great for school.

2298
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:21,580
Kids that are in school are cramming,
you know,

2299
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,220
keep you up and stuff like that.
Those things that like,

2300
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,430
you know,
any of the.

2301
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:31,170
But I know it's the like it calms you
down or ramps you up.

2302
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,180
Freaks you out.
Yeah.

2303
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,280
It doesn't make sense to me.
I don't get how that it is like how

2304
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:38,640
different could it with chemical B and
people.

2305
01:40:38,641 --> 01:40:42,970
Obviously you have queer retarded.
Clearly not scientists.

2306
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:48,720
I wasted one of these lab coats.
I'm not convinced it's even,

2307
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:51,870
I mean I know it has some sort of an
effect on people,

2308
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:53,770
but the way it's been distributed

2309
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,140
like that,
when they're giving it to kids,

2310
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,230
like it's one of the most controversial
things of giving these psychoactive

2311
01:40:59,231 --> 01:41:02,080
compounds to kids.
Not Knowing the longterm effects of it.

2312
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:05,410
And so many doctors are just so willing
to jump into it and give them,

2313
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,650
give these kids pills the as long as
their parents are into it,

2314
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:12,070
they'll just fucking order it away to
keep asking about documentaries.

2315
01:41:12,071 --> 01:41:14,080
Did you watch the thalidomide one yet?
No,

2316
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:17,650
that's gotta be terrible.
They gave it to the moms.

2317
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:20,440
Right.
And then they say,

2318
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:24,550
I'll see I see it on Netflix but I keep
getting nervous to watch it because I'm

2319
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:26,350
like it's gonna that's gonna be a bum
out.

2320
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:31,630
There's some crazy drugs that they gave
people that they had an idea of some

2321
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:34,630
risks but they didn't know either.
I don't think they really know until you

2322
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:38,050
give it to like a million people and
then you find out like oh this can

2323
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,670
happen too and this can happen too.

2324
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:44,350
And then by the time it's too late
you're dealing with these horrible birth

2325
01:41:44,351 --> 01:41:49,351
defects with thalidomide.
It's also funny how much like the stuff

2326
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:50,800
like,
you know,

2327
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,700
they just keep adding for legal reasons,
stuff to those warnings on ship.

2328
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:58,900
But they don't really like that.
If you ask like specific things to the

2329
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:02,440
pharmacist,
because I remember like Lexapro the

2330
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:06,940
first time I went on tour with like corn
and Rob Zombie so and like a bunch of

2331
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:07,870
bands,
so I was like,

2332
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:10,180
I wanted to smoke weed,
maybe drink a little bit.

2333
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:14,530
I'm not a big huge drinker but I'll
drink on this a little bit and smoke

2334
01:42:14,531 --> 01:42:16,660
weed.
And I'd asked the pharmacist and I was

2335
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:18,790
like,
it says here do not drink with us at

2336
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:19,624
all.
And they were like,

2337
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,730
no,
it's just because like that's just part

2338
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:22,481
of the thing is like,
you know,

2339
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:24,300
so you don't.
If you're taking some of the

2340
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:29,140
antidepressant of sorts,
like why would you take a depressant to

2341
01:42:29,141 --> 01:42:30,280
bring it back down?
And I was like,

2342
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,350
but I was like,
but it's not for like in my mind I was

2343
01:42:32,351 --> 01:42:35,200
going to be like take a pill,
drink a beer,

2344
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:37,390
like explode like a seagull with an
episode.

2345
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:41,350
But my fear was is that work a seagull
with Alka Seltzer.

2346
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:45,340
I video ever video of that,
but that was the thing when I was

2347
01:42:45,341 --> 01:42:47,020
younger.
If you give Alka Seltzer with seagull,

2348
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:47,854
they'll explode.

2349
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:53,050
I remember vaguely hearing that.
I don't know if it's an actual thing.

2350
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,530
Yeah.
I don't know either.

2351
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,750
Exploding seagulls.
So what we want to know the Lexapro.

2352
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:03,430
Did we talk about this before?
I'm not sure I got super like a physical

2353
01:43:03,431 --> 01:43:06,070
reaction to anxiety that I've never had
before in my life.

2354
01:43:06,071 --> 01:43:08,080
I never,
I never really thought I had anxiety.

2355
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,050
Um,
and then right before I was going on

2356
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:15,190
tour with those bands,
I got very nervous on top of like having

2357
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:20,191
a crazy,
a landlord dispute out of nowhere.

2358
01:43:20,441 --> 01:43:23,320
I think they just read,
they get charged more for our place and

2359
01:43:23,321 --> 01:43:24,430
so they were like,
Hey,

2360
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:25,780
you've been great tenants for a year,
but,

2361
01:43:25,781 --> 01:43:26,740
you know,
get out.

2362
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,830
And um,
my daughter was in school still and we

2363
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:32,560
just kinda like.
So we sent a letter just sort of asking

2364
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:33,394
like,
Hey,

2365
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,290
can we hang in there for,
you know,

2366
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,580
gives like three more months.

2367
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:39,700
Just like she finished the school year
and they just served us with court

2368
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:40,800
papers.
Whoa.

2369
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,150
So we ended up winning that,
which was fine,

2370
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:44,610
but it was very tense.
I mean,

2371
01:43:44,611 --> 01:43:47,170
like they called the cops on us a bunch
just making shit up.

2372
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:50,170
Oh God.
This old Asian lady bit.

2373
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:53,060
My ex wife's.
This was one of the landlords.

2374
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:54,350
Yeah.
Oh Jesus.

2375
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,110
Shake bitter.
It was because she was just like trying

2376
01:43:57,111 --> 01:44:00,710
to film us,
like going into the house or something.

2377
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:04,940
So my ex wife to women's getting shitty
with each other and one doesn't speak

2378
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:06,230
English.
She's filled,

2379
01:44:06,231 --> 01:44:08,450
they're filming each other.
And then the lady I bit her hand while

2380
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:11,480
she was telling it got like that
volatile in one day.

2381
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,890
Uh,
I was on the computer watching something

2382
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,950
and I'm just like,
it popped back on whatever it was,

2383
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:21,260
like my hands went numb and I've never
had it in my life.

2384
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:22,123
And I just,
uh,

2385
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:25,160
wigged out and like try to go to bed.
I'm like,

2386
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:27,230
I'll sleep it off or whatever it is is,
you know,

2387
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,880
I'm sure I'm okay.
Woke up in the morning,

2388
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:31,550
didn't feel better.
And then after like a month or two I

2389
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:33,260
ended up doing on what's going on
Lexapro.

2390
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,290
Wow.
So it was just a combined anxiety thing.

2391
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:37,140
All tests.
Yeah.

2392
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,920
Apart in that.
But I've never been right since that

2393
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,810
day.
Oh no shit.

2394
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:44,180
Yeah,
like anxiety is like a major issue in my

2395
01:44:44,181 --> 01:44:46,150
life.
It wasn't before then now.

2396
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,460
And it always manifests into my new one
now is that I smoke.

2397
01:44:49,461 --> 01:44:51,170
So I know it doesn't help at all,
like cigarettes.

2398
01:44:51,171 --> 01:44:53,890
I mean it doesn't help it at all,
but I feel like,

2399
01:44:53,891 --> 01:44:56,240
uh,
if I pay attention to my breathing,

2400
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:58,500
I have to like extra fill my lungs.
Were they,

2401
01:44:58,501 --> 01:45:00,530
it's all just like,
it's involuntary,

2402
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,240
like mental shit.

2403
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,350
Wow.
Yeah,

2404
01:45:03,351 --> 01:45:04,890
it sucks.
But uh,

2405
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,730
what have you tried to do to get,
get over it?

2406
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,370
And exercise helps always.
Um,

2407
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:14,040
and just trying to like distract,
you know,

2408
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:17,240
it is like,
it kind of all the symptoms that I feel

2409
01:45:17,241 --> 01:45:20,620
the fake whatever they are [inaudible]
the little pings and pangs it.

2410
01:45:20,621 --> 01:45:24,500
It's a,
if they happened long enough and I don't

2411
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:27,410
die from whatever it is I think I have
or whatever thing,

2412
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:31,430
I'm like convincing my body that I have,
it just goes away because I'm like,

2413
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:32,330
well,
it's not a real thing.

2414
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,510
Right?
Like I used to get like at its worst

2415
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:37,970
when I got it really bad then and I was
going to the hospital a bunch.

2416
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:41,600
Like it was like all limbs going,
like tingly,

2417
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:43,760
numb.
It was just scary,

2418
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:45,530
you know what I mean?
And your heart starts beating fast.

2419
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:46,700
Just panic attacks.

2420
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,020
Really?
Wow.

2421
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,150
But I've never,
I've always been someone who would laugh

2422
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:51,430
at somebody would have panic attacks,
I guess.

2423
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,660
Not a real thing like get your shit
together.

2424
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,740
And uh,
and then I had it.

2425
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:58,160
I was asked to make some apologies.
I was like,

2426
01:45:58,161 --> 01:45:59,600
man,
this sucks because,

2427
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,850
you know,
you walk into a hospital knowing you're

2428
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:03,860
like,
just tell me,

2429
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,720
you know,
we have to the machine and tell me that

2430
01:46:05,721 --> 01:46:07,490
I haven't had a heart attack and
everything again.

2431
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,790
I know I haven't,
but like I have to come here like

2432
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:13,130
compulsively I have to come here to make
sure.

2433
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:15,830
Wow.
It's crazy that those things like blew a

2434
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:18,590
fuse almost in your head.
Yeah.

2435
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,770
I asked a,
a psychologist,

2436
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:24,020
that is why I said I go is can someone
just pop one day,

2437
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:25,250
like,
just hit a level and pop.

2438
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:26,300
And he was like,
absolutely.

2439
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:27,680
Yeah.
Wow.

2440
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:29,630
Nobody thinks that.
Yeah,

2441
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,240
I don't usually think that they think
that you can just bring it back down.

2442
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:33,290
You'll be fine.
Get it back.

2443
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:33,831
You'll be fine.
Yeah.

2444
01:46:33,831 --> 01:46:35,300
But it's a,
it's a constant thing.

2445
01:46:35,301 --> 01:46:39,330
Sure.
What kind of exercise you're doing at

2446
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:41,010
the DDP Yoga?
I've been doing a lot.

2447
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:42,410
A fucking great.
Yeah.

2448
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:46,250
A diamond page for like if you don't
like what's DDP?

2449
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:48,890
The double penetration would have
fucking these guys doing.

2450
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:54,290
DDP Yoga is a former pro wrestler.
Dallas diamond page is put together a

2451
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:56,190
yoga program.
Yep.

2452
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:59,970
Fucking really difficult program.
Gets a lot of people in shape,

2453
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,390
man.
Easy.

2454
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,620
It's nice.
Long sessions.

2455
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:05,130
He does and he has a couple of short
ones you can combine,

2456
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:08,610
but it's doable.
It's a good sweat for sure.

2457
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:13,290
I want to start like now it's like warm
again and hopefully I have a few weeks

2458
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:15,360
at home now.
Like I want to like I miss like lifting

2459
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:16,620
any weights of any kind.

2460
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,050
It's good for the body.
It's really good for you.

2461
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:21,600
And as an yeah.
As a man.

2462
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:24,960
Especially as you get older,
you're going to lose muscle tissue,

2463
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:27,780
your bones going to get weaker.
That's the best way to keep that.

2464
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:30,480
One of the only ways.
I mean your body's supposed to be doing

2465
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:31,700
stuff,
you know,

2466
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,030
we have these weird lives we live where
you can just all day long have very

2467
01:47:36,031 --> 01:47:38,430
minimal movement.
It's not natural for a person.

2468
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:40,840
I think we did talk this before by the
crossfit for a little while and that's

2469
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:44,070
just like a lot of injuries,
not an advocate.

2470
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,780
Well,
some people love it.

2471
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:48,090
It's good for them.
Some people push each other and they

2472
01:47:48,091 --> 01:47:49,050
love it.
I get it.

2473
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:50,360
Yeah.
Well I'm going to you.

2474
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,230
You kind of already have to have A.
I don't think it's.

2475
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:58,270
I don't think it's a good idea to jump
into like fat person who has not worked

2476
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:00,660
out at all,
but I'll go try crossfit.

2477
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:05,160
It's Sorta what I did.
It worked in every sense of like I lost

2478
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:07,350
weight.
I lost a bunch of weight and so that was

2479
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:12,351
my major weight loss was like 70 pounds
and I've kind of like always plateaued

2480
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:17,310
around there since then.
But it was like a definitely like dense

2481
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:19,380
muscle growth,
you know what I mean?

2482
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:20,970
Like I felt better.
I looked good,

2483
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:25,680
I felt better about myself,
looks wise when I did that over the yoga

2484
01:48:25,681 --> 01:48:27,780
or anything like that that I do.
So what's the problem?

2485
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:29,550
Speed.
Weightlifting.

2486
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:32,700
Men destroyed.
Like I am just starting to get to a

2487
01:48:32,701 --> 01:48:36,090
point now where I don't wake up and
still if it's cold out or if I sleep

2488
01:48:36,091 --> 01:48:37,560
with air conditioning,
like in the morning,

2489
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:40,560
like my back and just be shut off for
like 15 minutes.

2490
01:48:40,561 --> 01:48:43,240
I have to really work on it to like.
So you hurt your back.

2491
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,320
Wipe my ass.
Yeah.

2492
01:48:44,321 --> 01:48:45,750
I'm just,
you know,

2493
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:46,860
they go,
hey,

2494
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:50,670
for 15 minutes,
let's go over with a pvc pipe.

2495
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:55,410
Had a do proper snatched lifts and then
they go,

2496
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:58,320
all right,
now do it as fast as many as you can in

2497
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:59,490
eight minutes,
you know.

2498
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:01,650
And uh,
and this is the guy who was the fastest

2499
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:03,480
and don't be the slowest,
and then it's like,

2500
01:49:03,481 --> 01:49:04,720
you know,
you're rushing through it.

2501
01:49:04,721 --> 01:49:06,930
You're going to lose form every time.
Yeah.

2502
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:10,740
This has been some pretty unfortunate
accidents because of the.

2503
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:12,440
Oh hell yeah.
I mean,

2504
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:15,210
but it is.
If you are in great shape and you stick

2505
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:18,270
the form and do it,
it's one of the most amazing workouts of

2506
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:19,590
all time either.
Well,

2507
01:49:19,591 --> 01:49:21,030
you could definitely get a good workout
in.

2508
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,390
You're definitely gonna burn off a lot
of energy and things along those lines.

2509
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,700
And some people love it.
I don't do it,

2510
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:30,210
but I do similar exercises.
I understand what they're doing.

2511
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:32,250
Kettlebell stuff.
I love Kettlebells,

2512
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:37,080
but I'm more of the proponent of um,
especially now I've been listening to

2513
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:38,870
this guy,
pavel tattooing,

2514
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,920
you know,
he is,

2515
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,310
he's the guy that brought kettle bells
to America and uh,

2516
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:46,290
between him and I learned a lot from
this guy,

2517
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:48,220
Steve Maxwell's on my podcast

2518
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:53,220
a bunch of times and they are more
proponents of lifting heavy weights for

2519
01:49:54,641 --> 01:49:57,580
lower repetitions.
And then there's this other guy named

2520
01:49:57,581 --> 01:50:00,010
Keith Weber who's got a totally
different approach,

2521
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:03,640
but it's just an endurance workout.
He's got this thing called extreme

2522
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:06,730
kettlebell cardio workout.
You could do that with a 35 pound

2523
01:50:06,731 --> 01:50:08,560
kettlebell man.
A little light kettlebell.

2524
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,110
Yeah.
But it's so much work and there's so

2525
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:13,630
much body weight involved.
You just fall and he does it with you.

2526
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:16,110
And he's a stud.
He's in incredible shape and handling

2527
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,000
other workouts.
There's a bunch of different ones.

2528
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:21,640
Um,
he's got a bunch of different ones that

2529
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:24,550
work your upper body lower body,
if I remember correctly,

2530
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,740
the ones I usually do is off the first
video.

2531
01:50:26,741 --> 01:50:29,680
He's got three videos now.
The ones I usually do off the first

2532
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:33,870
video I think are about 40 minutes.
Someone like your dad by the time that

2533
01:50:33,871 --> 01:50:36,130
was 40 minutes is up 42 minutes maybe.

2534
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,420
Or they can do those in the house.
Yeah.

2535
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:40,480
Yeah.
I just need one kettlebell you need.

2536
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,390
That's a big thing.
So I was like hot potatoes,

2537
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,120
being standing rose,
switch the hands and you just keep going

2538
01:50:46,121 --> 01:50:47,560
and going.
It gives you like little breaks.

2539
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,420
But then you just keep going and so
that,

2540
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:51,460
wait,
that 35 pound weight just feels like an

2541
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:52,600
eternity.
It feels like.

2542
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:55,960
I just fuck it.
It feels like you lifted 75 pounds by

2543
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:57,010
the end.
Yeah,

2544
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:01,510
I got into doing like as much.
So you'll go on the road a lot too.

2545
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:04,150
It's like trying to find out like hotel
room.

2546
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:06,530
I don't like going to the hotel gyms.
Okay.

2547
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,150
I don't know.
It just never enjoyed guys weird.

2548
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:12,970
I don't know.
The equipment is always kind of like

2549
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:14,020
junk.
Anyway,

2550
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,330
Jamie and I were in San Francisco.
They had an equinox.

2551
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,680
It was the shit.

2552
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:19,210
It was great.
Oh my God,

2553
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,510
it was amazing.
So go on the road to the hotel gyms I

2554
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,220
don't like.
So I've found a bunch of like,

2555
01:51:24,221 --> 01:51:28,060
there's some great like just hotel room
workout so you can give yourself a good

2556
01:51:28,061 --> 01:51:29,890
beating for sure.
Oh for sure.

2557
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,020
Yeah,
you can do one that's like the middle of

2558
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:34,480
the workout is 70 burpees.
Oh really?

2559
01:51:34,481 --> 01:51:35,920
That's like,
that's a motherfucker.

2560
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:36,843
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

2561
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,310
I mean,
you definitely get a lot of work done in

2562
01:51:39,311 --> 01:51:42,580
a small space and like you know,
the whole workout,

2563
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:45,700
it's a 100 squats,
90 sit ups,

2564
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:48,190
80 lunges,
70 burpees,

2565
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,860
and for a big guy like you,
100 squats,

2566
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:53,000
bodyweight squats is a lot of work.
Yeah.

2567
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,050
Yeah.
That's jacked.

2568
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:57,620
I'm sure my calves are shredded from
kettering.

2569
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,830
My body,
my whole life has probably kick a hole

2570
01:51:59,831 --> 01:52:03,460
through a wall about how much weight he
carries all the time and he's still,

2571
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,750
you know,
he's got a big ass legs.

2572
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,510
You got to assume that your body has to
carry around that much when he gets a

2573
01:52:07,511 --> 01:52:11,380
certain kind of a fat person because
there's definitely people who get fat

2574
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:16,240
where it's like their limbs or doe,
but I wasn't necessarily that kind of

2575
01:52:16,241 --> 01:52:19,540
fat and I'm not that kind of fat now,
but it's always my legs for some reason.

2576
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:22,660
I've always been like just jack from
just carrying around the body weight of

2577
01:52:22,661 --> 01:52:24,210
course.
But I mean there's obviously just get

2578
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,550
those big crazy legs,
but my legs have always been oddly

2579
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:31,840
muscular can then my body's weird.
The human body's very strange in that

2580
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:34,000
you could change it,
you can move it around,

2581
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,580
you see a rhino,
it's built like a fucking rhino,

2582
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:40,990
but a human being can through
weightlifting and diet and you know,

2583
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:45,991
just concentrating on stuffing your face
with calories and constantly hitting

2584
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,330
like heavy cleans and snatches and dead
lifts.

2585
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,380
You can get way bigger.
Oh yeah.

2586
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:53,480
You just gotTa keep doing it.
You just got to keep doing it.

2587
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:55,790
Going backwards.
This is the hardest thing.

2588
01:52:55,791 --> 01:52:59,750
That's why that a gay pride parade was
Sunday,

2589
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:02,300
right.
That was the day I got here and I went

2590
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,990
over to the comedy store and just
walking when I went to eat dinner at the

2591
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:10,220
rainbow bar and grill and it's right
next to that one oak place which was

2592
01:53:10,221 --> 01:53:15,221
having I guess a big gay blow out and
they were all outside and like cutoff

2593
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:20,380
shorts and shirtless and just fantastic
bodies.

2594
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,580
Every one of them and I was just like at
sucks.

2595
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:27,230
I'm just passed an age and the damage
I've done to my body just from being a

2596
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:29,510
fat kid growing up,
it's just like there's just no,

2597
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:31,100
I'll never look like that ever.

2598
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,650
It's always a bummer.
How come you never looked like that?

2599
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:38,140
I'm just the morning of the body over
the years had

2600
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:44,940
to separate game of thrones.
I've modeled myself the fourth emulate

2601
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:46,960
stretchmarks,
stretchmarks,

2602
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:48,500
uh,
just loose skin.

2603
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:51,080
They would be like,
we keep referencing.

2604
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:52,040
Lewis was funny.
He said,

2605
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,710
I never referenced on the show before.
Now I've said it 50 times.

2606
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:59,300
Louis j Gomez was 300 pounds at one
point.

2607
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:02,900
Low.
Got into a great shape,

2608
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:07,100
like really great.
She a few years ago was like abs and

2609
01:54:07,101 --> 01:54:09,680
everything,
but still like A.

2610
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:12,260
I have a friend rob who,
same thing was a heavyset guy.

2611
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:15,980
Now he's in really good shape.
They put on a bathing suit still on both

2612
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:18,000
of them.
You see like ecological,

2613
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:20,030
just the jiggling the body.
You know what I mean?

2614
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,460
Louis will always have stretchmarks no
matter what.

2615
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:24,650
But here's the thing.
You could,

2616
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:26,840
I could look a thousand times better
than I look,

2617
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:28,400
but I'll never.

2618
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,430
My point just being,
I'm never going to be like this fucking

2619
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,830
these statues that these guys are,
you know what I mean?

2620
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:36,740
Just like jacked fucking Tan ad guys.
I'm like,

2621
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:39,480
I just bummed out that I never knew what
that was like ever or being,

2622
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:42,650
or being a thin kid or a kid in high
school that could,

2623
01:54:42,651 --> 01:54:44,140
uh,
you know,

2624
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:47,330
just where all the clothes that were the
coolest clothes that just having to get

2625
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:50,470
like big and tall ship.
Um,

2626
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:52,550
what do they do?
They cut your skin,

2627
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,290
right?
That's one way they deal with that.

2628
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:55,820
When they do,
you're always going to be.

2629
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,380
I've seen all that stuff,
man.

2630
01:54:57,381 --> 01:54:58,880
And I would get it.
I would get it.

2631
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:03,180
But you're always going to be
frankensteinish [inaudible],

2632
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:05,910
you know what I mean?
You're always gonna have like,

2633
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:09,470
I've never seen that car.
To me that's the decision of fake tits.

2634
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,191
Really.
It has to be.

2635
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:15,191
It's like you are like a part fake and
there is marks to show how fake it is.

2636
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,270
You know what I mean?
There's always going to be like,

2637
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:20,270
the nipples are always weird.
You're just stretching the body and you

2638
01:55:20,271 --> 01:55:23,210
put it into something else.
It's not supposed to be,

2639
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,790
but those don't seem to mind even a
little bit.

2640
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,010
Um,
no,

2641
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,053
not the.
Some.

2642
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:31,100
Some guys hate fake tits.
Yeah.

2643
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,920
Yeah.
I'm not a big fan of those crazy like

2644
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:37,820
softball ones where there's a big split
in the middle and that's all with that

2645
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:38,511
shit.
Yeah,

2646
01:55:38,511 --> 01:55:40,240
that's an awkward look.
It's like the,

2647
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,860
the canyon between titties.
Yeah.

2648
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,300
That's unnecessary.
I just rib cage in between it.

2649
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:48,960
It's weird.
It's a long stretch with one going like

2650
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:53,100
northeast and one going northwest and
they're just like perfect circles.

2651
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:54,750
Yeah,
let's just odd.

2652
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:56,010
Well it's,
they went too hard,

2653
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,440
you know,
like if you try to go to many cup sizes

2654
01:55:58,441 --> 01:56:02,370
over like some of these girls like
really lean and small girls and tits or

2655
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:04,680
just like fat bags golf at.
Yeah,

2656
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:07,500
I mean they're beautiful fat bags.
This doesn't say you have to like,

2657
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:10,080
you know,
forget to put your foot in the middle of

2658
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:13,140
their chest and like stretch their tits
skin health or wrap around this thing.

2659
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:14,640
It's so gross.
Men,

2660
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:18,020
have you ever see an operation when they
go in through the armpit and they got

2661
01:56:18,021 --> 01:56:21,240
like this hook and they're digging
underneath the armpit and they're

2662
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:25,830
creating a cavity and then they have to
stuff that cavity with his bag and then

2663
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:29,610
fill it up with water and they just
squeeze her tit for half hour.

2664
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:31,350
I guess they're hard.
Not Hard,

2665
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:35,310
but solid bags now.
They're not like a bag that they fill up

2666
01:56:35,311 --> 01:56:36,280
with water now.

2667
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:41,300
I guess the more popular one is like a
softer fully formed thing that sits in

2668
01:56:42,091 --> 01:56:45,420
your body and you have to always worry
about your body rejecting it to.

2669
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:47,340
Oh,
and the real issue.

2670
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:51,180
There's a.
We were looking at Dick Enhancement

2671
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:56,040
surgery's not too long ago and they
actually have where they put a fucking

2672
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:59,910
piece of plastic in your Dick.
Like make it like try to actually

2673
01:56:59,911 --> 01:57:01,680
lengthen,
lengthen the hang,

2674
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:04,380
which advised to pick a Dick Surgery.
That's the one I'd pick,

2675
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:07,260
but uh,
it just seems like the risk versus

2676
01:57:07,261 --> 01:57:08,560
reward on that one man.
Well,

2677
01:57:08,561 --> 01:57:10,410
they,
they have to experiment on Dick's in

2678
01:57:10,411 --> 01:57:14,730
order to perfect that surgery.
It's not like there's a lot of donating

2679
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:18,570
their dicks Dick lengthening science.
They've got a practice that shit on live

2680
01:57:18,571 --> 01:57:20,310
people.
I don't know how they get approval.

2681
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:22,680
I've never seen that go like,
uh,

2682
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,620
the only videos to like any kind of
dicks surgery go well.

2683
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,990
It's always fucking crazy looking.
Yeah,

2684
01:57:27,991 --> 01:57:29,610
because nobody wants to admit it.
Nobody wants to hear,

2685
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:30,690
hey,
I had a four inch deck,

2686
01:57:30,691 --> 01:57:32,760
but now I got a six look,
check it out.

2687
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,400
This is what he did,
but it never even ended up being like a

2688
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:37,740
forced it to become six.
That'd be great for people.

2689
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:42,741
I'm just saying it's like you had like a
five inch or four inch like regular Dick

2690
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:45,120
and now it looks like this weird,
like fucking,

2691
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,360
it looks like a wiggly worm or whatever.
He used to grab it and it scored out of

2692
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:49,920
your hands.
That's what it looks like.

2693
01:57:49,921 --> 01:57:52,620
It's just like big fat,
doughy thing.

2694
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:56,970
It doesn't get really hard because it
looks like it looks like it got stung by

2695
01:57:56,971 --> 01:57:59,900
a bee or like,
it's like there's a problem with off

2696
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:03,740
with poison ivy.
The best surgery ever was at bucket

2697
01:58:03,741 --> 01:58:05,880
where they put out that Baba Guy's Dick
back together,

2698
01:58:05,881 --> 01:58:06,630
remember?

2699
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:08,610
Yeah.
And really just had the Frankenstein

2700
01:58:08,611 --> 01:58:09,900
staples across it.
Yeah.

2701
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:15,420
He's making a face like across your for
this doing for people listening.

2702
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:17,910
Yeah.
That guy fucked after that.

2703
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:20,670
Like he got his dick to almost work.
He did porn.

2704
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:22,970
It's so weird looking those still.
Huh?

2705
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:27,120
What a crazy story.
That was that guy recently who just got

2706
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:29,430
a.
He just got Dick Transplant,

2707
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:30,090
right?
Yeah.

2708
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:32,460
First ever effective.
Dick's plant transplant,

2709
01:58:32,461 --> 01:58:34,770
the United States and he worked at the
bone and everything.

2710
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:37,230
That's a good question.
So one question.

2711
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:39,480
No one's followed up.
It's an older fella to.

2712
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,710
Yeah,
he was in his fifties.

2713
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,800
And why do you need.
He just lost his Dick and stepping back.

2714
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:47,590
Why didn't need it?
Why do you need yard as well?

2715
01:58:47,591 --> 01:58:48,240
No,
it wasn't.

2716
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:49,630
No,
that wasn't getting his dick back.

2717
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:50,200
He goes,
oh no,

2718
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,011
he got a new Dick.
Yeah,

2719
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:53,050
it was a transplant,
but what happened to his old Dick,

2720
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,900
I want to say a car accident with his
Dick,

2721
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,100
who's was driving with his foot.

2722
01:58:58,130 --> 01:59:02,410
He had a boner in two cars just because
he was getting his dick sucked while he

2723
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:05,680
was driving.
Hit the brakes and the car accident and

2724
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,810
that has happened and guys before,
you know,

2725
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:10,210
bitten off,
I don't know about bitten off,

2726
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:11,610
but definitely bitten.
Oh yeah.

2727
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:14,010
Because we've gone to the hospital with
their dick all fucked up because the

2728
01:59:14,011 --> 01:59:15,850
girl hit down on it when they were
driving their car.

2729
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:20,200
Where you ever seen those videos when
the dicks like break when the girl is

2730
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:22,930
like riding a dicon and comes down to
hard with tape.

2731
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,630
It's my.
That's what I'm talking about.

2732
01:59:24,631 --> 01:59:28,230
Anxieties I live with.
That one freaks me out when the girls

2733
01:59:28,231 --> 01:59:30,760
rotting your Dick and she's vigorously
going up.

2734
01:59:30,761 --> 01:59:33,640
I literally have to be like,
you are going to hurt me if this goes

2735
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:35,590
haywire,
like please settle down with him.

2736
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:40,610
It's actually a his penises amputated
after he had penile cancer.

2737
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,800
Oh Jesus.
You got.

2738
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:44,780
That's a pretty good reason to get.
You know,

2739
01:59:44,781 --> 01:59:48,710
I think the first guy that ever got it
wasn't an American guy.

2740
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:51,800
That guy may be the one that I was
thinking of that had the car accident.

2741
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:55,400
There was a,
there's one in South Africa to 21 year

2742
01:59:55,401 --> 01:59:57,650
old who had.
I'm seeing this lost it.

2743
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:02,400
It said he had complications after he
had to have his penis for complicated.

2744
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:07,630
Yeah.
Circumcision complications that happens.

2745
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:10,000
People lose their dicks every year from
circumcision,

2746
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,340
probably more than die rollercoaster
rides.

2747
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:14,120
When I was in DC,
uh,

2748
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:17,770
recently we went down by the White House
and there was a big rally.

2749
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,660
Anti circumcision rally.
Yeah.

2750
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:21,880
Yelling out facts and I don't know if
they're facts.

2751
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:25,030
It says circumcision confirmed makes the
penis smaller.

2752
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:27,580
I don't know if that's true.
I don't know if it makes smaller,

2753
02:00:27,581 --> 02:00:30,610
but definitely makes it less sensitive.
It could probably make it smaller.

2754
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,030
Who knows about all that?
Are you circumcised and you wish you

2755
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:35,140
weren't?
Um,

2756
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:35,741
no.
I'm okay.

2757
02:00:35,741 --> 02:00:38,140
And you don't give a shit either way,
but I don't think we should keep doing

2758
02:00:38,141 --> 02:00:39,700
it.
It's definitely barbaric.

2759
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,860
It's pointless.
It doesn't do anything good.

2760
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:44,050
There's nothing healthy about it.
It's.

2761
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:47,920
It's an ancient tribal ritual that
people are trying to justify.

2762
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,010
The only thing that has done for the
aesthetic aesthetic.

2763
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:52,330
Yeah,
but that's ridiculous.

2764
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,440
I've seen porn.
We're dudes of uncircumcised dicks.

2765
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,880
Look Fun.
Just like a dick with some extra skin.

2766
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,140
It looks foreign.
Yeah.

2767
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,750
Did he ever got bombed out of the girl's
pussy with extra skin?

2768
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:03,450
Does that bother you at even?
A little bit?

2769
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,900
No,
but I've definitely talked about those

2770
02:01:04,901 --> 02:01:05,870
more than others.
Like them.

2771
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,020
I'm.
I'm in the Norton camp.

2772
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:10,090
A real beef.
You want like a meaty one?

2773
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:13,000
I don't mind at all.
I don't mind the meeting when I don't

2774
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:14,110
mind it,
but I'm always like.

2775
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,840
It's interesting how it looks like real,
real flappy.

2776
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:20,380
I don't give a fuck.
It doesn't bother me at all,

2777
02:01:20,381 --> 02:01:22,930
but the idea that they trim those is
horrendous.

2778
02:01:22,931 --> 02:01:26,440
Like that's crazy.
Flips trimmed to get them cut off.

2779
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:28,210
It's their lobbyists.
Surgery lab,

2780
02:01:28,211 --> 02:01:30,760
a deck tummy or maybe plasty.
Oh,

2781
02:01:30,761 --> 02:01:32,560
it's awful.
It's terrifying.

2782
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:37,580
At one point started putting like frozen
in whatever plastic and Houston mafia

2783
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:39,610
Houston,
but meanwhile that was her pussy.

2784
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:42,320
Part of her appeal,
that's what a lot of guys liked about

2785
02:01:42,321 --> 02:01:44,930
her shadow a pussy,
like a moose mouth,

2786
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,960
like
probably in the eighties through the

2787
02:01:50,571 --> 02:01:52,700
nineties.
I could tell you five picture.

2788
02:01:52,701 --> 02:01:55,370
Who's porn stars like matched up to the
pussy.

2789
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,710
Really?
I'm pretty sure at a time.

2790
02:01:58,840 --> 02:01:59,990
Tara.
Patrick,

2791
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,010
Jenna Jamison.
Pretty Telltale.

2792
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,100
Pussies,
yeah.

2793
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:06,290
There's.
I guess there's some iconic pussies out

2794
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:08,540
there that that's where the flashlight
came in.

2795
02:02:08,541 --> 02:02:13,541
Remember of Vanessa del Rio had that big
fucking donkey dick have a clit.

2796
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:16,400
Yeah,
I think it was huge.

2797
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:18,440
Yeah.
There was some gals that have a very,

2798
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:21,050
very endowed.
I liked that in porn.

2799
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:22,790
I don't know if I would show a dig that
in person.

2800
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,000
Yeah,
and porn is dirty and real life.

2801
02:02:25,001 --> 02:02:25,701
You'd be like,
Ooh,

2802
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:28,730
I don't know if these are the genetics.
I want my seed to swallow up.

2803
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,120
There's never posted.
You've seen that.

2804
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:33,020
You were like,
ah,

2805
02:02:33,021 --> 02:02:35,690
this one's pretty awful looking.
I'm not saying you don't fuck it,

2806
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:36,680
but you're just like,
that's pretty.

2807
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:38,240
Oh,
in porns I have,

2808
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:40,130
yeah.
I'm going to spend some money.

2809
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:40,731
Whoa,
whoa.

2810
02:02:40,731 --> 02:02:43,760
What's going on down there?
What is that disaster?

2811
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:46,460
What the fuck is that?
Something happening here and it's not

2812
02:02:46,461 --> 02:02:47,294
good.
Well,

2813
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,100
you know,
you've got to think by the time you get

2814
02:02:49,101 --> 02:02:51,800
to do porn,
a lot of things have happened or

2815
02:02:51,801 --> 02:02:54,530
haven't,
but very possibly a lot of things have

2816
02:02:54,531 --> 02:02:56,330
happened to you in this life.
The northern Leslie.

2817
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,940
Yeah.
Those things have an effect on

2818
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,260
everything.
I mean,

2819
02:03:00,261 --> 02:03:03,560
if your face looks all stressed out when
you like had a hard life,

2820
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,120
I bet you push it looks.
Look was stressed out.

2821
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:10,220
I mean it only stands to reason.
Old Miner.

2822
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,380
He's got fucking hands that are made out
of.

2823
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:17,870
It's made out a clay.
He's getting card calluses and furrowed

2824
02:03:17,871 --> 02:03:19,480
brow.
The girls 23 plus.

2825
02:03:19,530 --> 02:03:23,890
He's a hard 52
are pussies.

2826
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:25,370
Yeah,
exactly.

2827
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:29,070
Her Pussy comes up with black lung.
She's smoking cigarettes.

2828
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,730
Get worried about our bills.
I dated a girl one time.

2829
02:03:31,731 --> 02:03:34,310
I had one of her pussy lips,
like ran all the way down there where

2830
02:03:34,311 --> 02:03:37,310
bud hall was weird.
That's definitely weird.

2831
02:03:37,311 --> 02:03:39,070
Not.
It wasn't like Pussy Lips,

2832
02:03:39,071 --> 02:03:41,780
the wrong word for it,
but like the line that her pussy lips

2833
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:46,781
was on where it is geometry fan came
around the hole and then it continued.

2834
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:49,850
The wrinkle continued all the way to
where bud.

2835
02:03:49,851 --> 02:03:50,810
Hold on.
That was weird.

2836
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:52,540
That's definitely weird.
Yeah.

2837
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,530
Otherwise we would all be going,
oh,

2838
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:56,850
I've seen that.
Someone out there.

2839
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:59,520
Someone out there.
It's close up to the butthole.

2840
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:02,000
Yeah.
That's a weird thing,

2841
02:04:02,001 --> 02:04:05,240
huh?
The butthole and the pussy are so close

2842
02:04:05,241 --> 02:04:07,130
together.
Yeah,

2843
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,890
but bizarre design of nature,
nature,

2844
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:14,400
such a bizarre fucking creator.
Who's the total nutrient?

2845
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:16,560
It's the Lord.
Hello.

2846
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:19,730
Could you keep saying nature created?
You won't evidence you have a neutral.

2847
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:24,830
Created
the same proof you have that you know

2848
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:27,380
God created it.
Well,

2849
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:30,890
this is a different type of vagina for
every guy out there.

2850
02:04:31,070 --> 02:04:35,060
I think we could safely say that
testimonies of people leaving a chick

2851
02:04:35,061 --> 02:04:37,260
because I just didn't like to wear
pussy.

2852
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:37,980
Look,
I've definitely

2853
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,340
heard of that before.
Yeah.

2854
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:43,260
I have a friend and her ex boyfriend
told her a story about getting together

2855
02:04:43,261 --> 02:04:47,040
with some girl going down on her,
pulling her panties off and she has a

2856
02:04:47,041 --> 02:04:50,520
clit that's like a pinky.
Any panic had a male.

2857
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:54,360
He panicked and he made up some story
about picking up his brother,

2858
02:04:54,370 --> 02:04:57,180
the airport,
and he ran away and he said that he knew

2859
02:04:57,181 --> 02:05:00,330
that the girl knew that he was
bullshitting and they both just sort of

2860
02:05:00,331 --> 02:05:03,910
agreed to go along with the charade.
She'd probably had seen other guys like

2861
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,240
look at her Dick,
her vagina or whatever.

2862
02:05:06,241 --> 02:05:11,241
Her clit clit Dick Freak out.
She just unfortunately had an enormous.

2863
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:14,580
According to him.
I mean he might've been a baby.

2864
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,350
You.
I might've been like a little tiny

2865
02:05:16,351 --> 02:05:17,760
little baby thumb.
I'm like,

2866
02:05:17,761 --> 02:05:19,410
come on,
get over the baby thumb.

2867
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:24,860
Does it really bother you?
That wouldn't shake me as much as like

2868
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:28,740
really awful tits.
Isn't it funny though that like there's

2869
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:31,890
a line,
the cross as far as like inches wise,

2870
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:33,990
like here like this,
like let's,

2871
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,200
let's go with this finger.
Like this is no big deal.

2872
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,790
Somebody deals with big clip.
Hey,

2873
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:39,624
what's going on there?

2874
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:42,773
Everything.
Okay.

2875
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:47,370
I have to move it like not even a whole
finger joint.

2876
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:50,700
Not a whole lot of like,
this is okay.

2877
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,580
What the fuck is that?
What is this?

2878
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,740
What is that?
And then that's insane.

2879
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:57,540
Yeah.
If you got up to the next knuckle you're

2880
02:05:57,541 --> 02:05:58,980
doing like.
I mean what is that?

2881
02:05:58,981 --> 02:06:01,010
Like an inch.
If it's an inch clit,

2882
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:04,350
fuck that better than she was a runaway
and if it's a whole finger,

2883
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:05,460
you're.
It's a dick.

2884
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:09,060
You got to go look at pictures of huge
cliffs.

2885
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,580
See that's why they show will never be
on a network.

2886
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:18,090
So curious how big they get a of all
things.

2887
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:19,450
I have google.
I've never googled that.

2888
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:21,780
Bodybuilders when girls take
testosterone,

2889
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:25,860
get enormous.
I used to be so Jamie's freaked out.

2890
02:06:25,861 --> 02:06:26,820
I'm not gonna.
Share it on Youtube.

2891
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:29,490
Okay.
Don't know Jesus Christ.

2892
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:31,590
Seed.
Those are dicks or Dick.

2893
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:33,570
Those are dicks.
That one with the girl's tongue on it

2894
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,440
down on the bottom left hand side.
That might as well be a dick.

2895
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:38,603
Yeah.
Well this is.

2896
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:40,320
Oh,
what was the one up top?

2897
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:43,530
Those ones up top are dicks.
That's addicted.

2898
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:46,200
We'll get that one that the girls
spreading it out.

2899
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,453
Okay.
What?

2900
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,070
What?
Okay.

2901
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,930
Now did they say,
is this a bodybuilder?

2902
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:55,380
Because that we're looking at what?
It looks like a two inch Dick,

2903
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:58,530
but I'm talking about a train wreck.
My stepfather.

2904
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:00,510
Jesus Christ.
That's a dick.

2905
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:01,450
Okay.
That's a deck.

2906
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:05,130
That is 100 percent of the Dick Ball's
coming off of it.

2907
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:07,380
Yeah.
What is going on below that monster?

2908
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:09,690
What is that?
Very big clits.

2909
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:11,370
See?
How do we know that this is real?

2910
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:12,480
We just might be.
Well,

2911
02:07:12,481 --> 02:07:14,920
that's fake,
but I mean there's some.

2912
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:18,660
It's fake.
I think there's some genetic

2913
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:20,370
differences.
Dominations.

2914
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,121
Yeah.
What's that one?

2915
02:07:21,121 --> 02:07:23,670
The upper right hand corner where it's a
snail laying on a table.

2916
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:26,880
Go large with that police.
What the fuck is happening?

2917
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:27,960
That is not real,
is it?

2918
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:29,910
She get her pussy eaten by a frog.
Oh,

2919
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:33,940
that's a rubber Dick that's attached to
a table and she's rubbing on her clit.

2920
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:35,910
That's what that is,
but it looks like she's

2921
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:41,070
giving birth to a snail.
That's

2922
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,770
hard to explain.
Yeah,

2923
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:45,900
there's.
Okay.

2924
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:49,240
That's a hermaphrodite fake.
It's a fake picture.

2925
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:51,340
Might not be,
man.

2926
02:07:51,341 --> 02:07:54,420
That's what's weird because some of
these clips are like,

2927
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:54,820
what?
That.

2928
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:55,700
What was that one?
The upper.

2929
02:07:55,701 --> 02:07:58,120
Just feel like we would know who that
person's name is.

2930
02:07:58,121 --> 02:08:03,121
If it was a real thing where you have a.
I wish my Dick had that Kinda hang it's

2931
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:04,850
rod number.
Thigh

2932
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,530
on the upper upper level.
Okay.

2933
02:08:08,531 --> 02:08:09,730
What is that?
Real?

2934
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,050
It's hard to say.
What's real.

2935
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:13,990
The problem is with the Internet,
you just don't know what's real.

2936
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:15,980
Did you?
Did you look up doing.

2937
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,460
Did you google the word real big?
Hey.

2938
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:21,490
No,
just huge.

2939
02:08:21,491 --> 02:08:23,740
Clits.
Real huge clits.

2940
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,060
Oh Jeez.
We're going to hit another.

2941
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:28,750
Oh God.
Those are dicks.

2942
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:30,480
There's a lot of dixon there.
Well,

2943
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:32,860
what you got to wonder how many of these
people are hermaphrodites?

2944
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:33,610
No,
wait,

2945
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:37,090
you said you don't mind med pussy,
but go pick your five on the top row.

2946
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:38,850
Oh,
that's not meaty.

2947
02:08:38,851 --> 02:08:40,960
That's a.
it's like a butcher shop.

2948
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,640
See?
But that again,

2949
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:44,920
is that for real?
Is it 100 percent?

2950
02:08:44,921 --> 02:08:46,280
Couldn't be real.
It's got that,

2951
02:08:46,730 --> 02:08:51,730
that inside Pussy feel to it.
Just that a gritty skin feel like she

2952
02:08:51,971 --> 02:08:55,330
got dragged by a truck on her pussy
postseason on her way here.

2953
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:56,680
You know like tripe.

2954
02:08:59,190 --> 02:09:04,190
It's got a texture.
What is that thing that's got three

2955
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:07,090
levels of Pussy Lips,
like aliens mouth to the movie.

2956
02:09:07,091 --> 02:09:10,000
Aliens with the little mouth comes out.
It's got eyebrows.

2957
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:12,880
Look.
Follow the eyebrows down to the.

2958
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,160
I mean that is like a.
that's an orangutan

2959
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:20,020
orangutan.
It does,

2960
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:22,000
right?
It looks like a duck bill.

2961
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:26,260
It's really a wow.
Pussies can be ugly.

2962
02:09:26,261 --> 02:09:29,040
Huh?
Fuck.

2963
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:31,540
Look at that thing.
We all thought,

2964
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:32,351
man,
there's no pussy.

2965
02:09:32,351 --> 02:09:33,750
I'm running away from.
Listens,

2966
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,220
diseased.
Turns out I could just be misshapen.

2967
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:39,310
Well,
if you look at like WC fields knows and

2968
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:42,580
you fly.
That sort of morphing possibility and

2969
02:09:42,581 --> 02:09:45,670
potential to a vagina.
You got a Lotta of it.

2970
02:09:45,671 --> 02:09:47,350
Could be ugly.
CanNot be our secret code.

2971
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,010
If we had a girl say she had a nice
chat.

2972
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:49,863
Chat,
chat,

2973
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:51,570
chat,
chat,

2974
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:53,810
chat.
That was Jimmy Durante though.

2975
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,340
Same thing.
Yeah.

2976
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:57,880
That's actually better.

2977
02:09:58,030 --> 02:10:01,240
We'll go with Jimmy Durante.
WC fields that a fucked up knows,

2978
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:04,180
but I think Jimmy Duranti probably had a
more fucked up,

2979
02:10:04,181 --> 02:10:07,360
knows what is that knows come from
alcoholism.

2980
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:10,900
Not always.
My Dad's not a drinker at all.

2981
02:10:10,901 --> 02:10:14,110
My Dad started to get a little bit of a
bulb that will get that note.

2982
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:17,110
I mean not like,
oof.

2983
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:20,950
That's a big one at church.
He used to call themselves,

2984
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,490
got a clip.
Like that guy made a career of having a

2985
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:26,830
big giant nose look.
This girls kissing his knows.

2986
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,330
How strange is that?
Like he became a celebrity for having a

2987
02:10:31,331 --> 02:10:33,770
giant.
Well talented comedian as well,

2988
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:35,960
but that was his thing is that he had a
giant.

2989
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:37,970
No,
that's not real,

2990
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,650
is it?
No.

2991
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:40,760
That's added onto it.
Yeah.

2992
02:10:40,761 --> 02:10:44,150
It seems like it wasn't that big.
Do you think he was.

2993
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:46,430
He didn't get famously was like older.

2994
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,330
I don't know.
I'm just not.

2995
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:51,410
Not totally aware of the history because
you always got to wonder what that thing

2996
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:54,000
like that did it.
How much did it affect is like getting

2997
02:10:54,001 --> 02:10:57,440
an ass as a performer.
He was famous.

2998
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:00,170
You probably stuck that right up there
as well.

2999
02:11:00,171 --> 02:11:03,950
He's got a choice 69 and it's going in
your ass in your ass.

3000
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:07,280
He's the person who's really upset.
The pussy is so close to the Esol,

3001
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:09,890
my leg,
it might be one of those guys that likes

3002
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:11,090
it.
When you got to knows that big,

3003
02:11:11,091 --> 02:11:13,370
who knows what you're smelling.
You might be smelling things like a dog

3004
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,800
dog.
Dog seemed to enjoy really fucking

3005
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:19,010
stinky.
Smells might be because their sense of

3006
02:11:19,011 --> 02:11:21,470
smell is so much more potent.
Let's just start that room.

3007
02:11:21,471 --> 02:11:23,040
Or Jimmy Duranti.
As Wolf powers,

3008
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:27,050
wolf smell
senses.

3009
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:31,490
Smell was it explained to me in a real
weird way like the differences between a

3010
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:33,890
person who dog,
but this way is a good way.

3011
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,900
If you ever want to like pictured in
your head.

3012
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:38,720
You know how when a skunk sprays in the
air,

3013
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:42,050
it's only a certain amount of parts per
million and you could smell it.

3014
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:44,090
You can be nowhere near it.
Well,

3015
02:11:44,091 --> 02:11:46,100
for a dog,
everything's like that.

3016
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:51,050
So like a skunk can spray something and
he could spray something in a block

3017
02:11:51,051 --> 02:11:53,030
somewhere and it can be.
You'll be a block away like,

3018
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:54,350
oh,
fucking skunk.

3019
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:57,410
And you smell it for a dog.
Could smell person like that.

3020
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:59,840
Just always.
Everything could just smell things.

3021
02:11:59,841 --> 02:12:01,580
It's just a matter of picking these
things out.

3022
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:02,940
So just trying to like,
uh,

3023
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:05,270
like you hear a sound to your right and
you know,

3024
02:12:05,271 --> 02:12:07,580
instinctively your ears telling you it's
in that direction.

3025
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:09,320
What were the dog?
It's similar to that.

3026
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:11,090
Especially like a bloodhound or
something like that.

3027
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:14,630
Do you know they have those long ass
ears to make the smell come to their

3028
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:15,464
face.

3029
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:20,280
Know when dogs are like bloodhounds,
they have these crazy long ass ears that

3030
02:12:20,281 --> 02:12:23,450
so that the smells waft up into their
face when dogs,

3031
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,780
dogs,
like intelligent dogs doing anything.

3032
02:12:26,781 --> 02:12:30,890
I'm impressed when they find drugs or
any of that shit or fucking in the cars

3033
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:35,300
as my favorite on cops when they brought
the canine unit and he's like,

3034
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,520
that's cool.
We don't have to search your car.

3035
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,570
You went the dog smell around the car.
The dog starts like

3036
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:48,680
they opened the gas thing and there's
always some crystal meth pipe or

3037
02:12:48,681 --> 02:12:50,610
something in there.
They tried different ways of hiding it

3038
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,460
too.
That just never worked.

3039
02:12:51,461 --> 02:12:53,120
Like you gotta you gotta put it in
coffee.

3040
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:55,340
A good luck with that.
Try getting that passed for those

3041
02:12:55,341 --> 02:12:57,290
fucking dogs.
They could smell it.

3042
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,300
You know?
It's terrifying.

3043
02:12:59,301 --> 02:13:02,540
They were bringing weed on those cruise
ships.

3044
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:03,440
You bring pens?

3045
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:04,700
No,
I haven't.

3046
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,400
I don't have a pen.
Oh No,

3047
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,630
no.
Getting off some symptoms.

3048
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:16,010
He's randomly have the dogs.
This is a good one.

3049
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:17,720
Pens?
Yeah.

3050
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,640
That's an excellent one.
I'm a big fan.

3051
02:13:21,330 --> 02:13:22,520
Thank you.
It's all you buddy.

3052
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,030
You're leaving today,
right?

3053
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:26,330
Yup.
Yeah.

3054
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:28,460
New York's got to get its shit together
when it comes to weed.

3055
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:30,590
Carmen,
I hope it's coming.

3056
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:33,660
Anything think if you're carrying an
answer under.

3057
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:36,540
It's just a ticket.
She shouldn't even be.

3058
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,760
That shouldn't be.
Leave me alone.

3059
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:41,490
Stupid.
Do you believe in smoking on the streets

3060
02:13:41,491 --> 02:13:42,810
and everything?
No,

3061
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:44,580
I don't think you should be able to do
anything on the streets.

3062
02:13:44,581 --> 02:13:46,170
It's going to affect anybody else's
health.

3063
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,760
Should be treated like alcohol.
Yeah.

3064
02:13:47,790 --> 02:13:51,420
Well the problem with smoking is you can
hotbox people you know,

3065
02:13:51,421 --> 02:13:55,290
so like if you decided to smoke pot in a
nightclub filled with people,

3066
02:13:55,590 --> 02:13:56,970
you can get people around you high.

3067
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,160
That's sure that's happened on this
podcast.

3068
02:13:59,161 --> 02:14:01,110
One hundred percent.
We've gotten people high that were just

3069
02:14:01,111 --> 02:14:03,570
sitting there and they've got a contact
high 100 percent.

3070
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:04,890
So interesting.
That was bullshit.

3071
02:14:04,891 --> 02:14:05,890
Recently.
Say that,

3072
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:07,690
but it's not.
It's not.

3073
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:09,420
Have you ever done that place?
Yeah,

3074
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:13,740
I'll have to
talk about it.

3075
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:18,510
It's the only place where if you do a
set where I love it and people smoke so

3076
02:14:18,511 --> 02:14:20,790
much weed,
they're like the green out,

3077
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:23,910
so you'll be performing a show in that.
Some guy gets up and he goes,

3078
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:29,100
I gotta go and then he has to go in a
hallway while a nice lady.

3079
02:14:29,101 --> 02:14:30,880
Patches like rubs his head while he
leaves,

3080
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:34,350
like lay on the ground right there.
Triply there when triply didn't smoke

3081
02:14:34,351 --> 02:14:35,490
weed.
Really?

3082
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,020
Yeah.
And uh,

3083
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:40,860
he was just crisp,
defied by the time he went up on stage,

3084
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:42,150
there's no air in the room.

3085
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:44,610
It's all smoke and breathing and pot
smoke.

3086
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:47,220
There was no ventilation.
Dave Smith who was just here A.

3087
02:14:47,221 --> 02:14:47,850
Yeah,
it did it.

3088
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:49,160
Did he tell you he did it not too long
ago?

3089
02:14:49,161 --> 02:14:50,640
No,
I didn't like the weekend before he came

3090
02:14:50,641 --> 02:14:52,860
out here.
He did it and uh,

3091
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:55,530
he was not smoking weed for about six
months.

3092
02:14:55,590 --> 02:14:58,920
He stopped and then he's right back.
Can't go.

3093
02:14:58,921 --> 02:15:00,170
They're not.
Well,

3094
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:01,910
they changed the coolest.
Yeah.

3095
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,570
I'm not sure because money couldn't
guess,

3096
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,130
uh,
probably sells weed,

3097
02:15:05,370 --> 02:15:09,300
but it's a cool little spot.
It's a cool little spot,

3098
02:15:09,301 --> 02:15:13,000
but if you don't smoke weed you cannot
go because you can't stay in there for a

3099
02:15:13,001 --> 02:15:16,770
length of time because you realize it's
a different temperature in that room

3100
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:20,220
than the room right next to it.
Don't smoke.

3101
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:24,030
It's just pure people had a bong at
every table.

3102
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:25,590
But it's such a fun crowd though.

3103
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:27,450
Two great kids,
they don't get stoned,

3104
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:30,150
like removed,
like they get,

3105
02:15:30,151 --> 02:15:31,760
like they actually sink in the watch
company.

3106
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:33,770
They,
it's definitely like very pro.

3107
02:15:33,771 --> 02:15:36,060
So it was very few people in there that
it's like their first time there.

3108
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:37,950
I did it with the iron cheek.
Really?

3109
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:39,450
Yeah,
that's fucking hilarious.

3110
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:42,450
Brought the iron sheik on stage and then
he'd love it.

3111
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:43,680
Oh,
he had a great time.

3112
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:46,050
He poor guy.
He's got real bad hips.

3113
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:48,930
His hips are fucked up I think is nice
too.

3114
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,680
He's got some serious wear and tear on
his body from all that wrestling because

3115
02:15:52,681 --> 02:15:57,250
he was like a real legit wrestler at one
point in time and like the uh,

3116
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,840
what was his bodyguard for the Shaw?
Yeah,

3117
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:01,680
for the shop around.
Yeah.

3118
02:16:01,681 --> 02:16:03,690
He's a bad motherfucker.
But uh,

3119
02:16:03,691 --> 02:16:04,470
yeah,
he was there.

3120
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:08,410
I guess he smokes a lot of weed.
Was he fun to talk to at all or is he

3121
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:10,410
like,
is he taking him like 20 minutes and

3122
02:16:10,411 --> 02:16:10,891
you're like,
all right,

3123
02:16:10,891 --> 02:16:13,320
it's plenty.
I had a good time talking to him because

3124
02:16:13,321 --> 02:16:15,150
first of all,
I remember him from when I was a kid.

3125
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:18,860
He's always been like this famous
wrestler and he's just a,

3126
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:20,130
he's just there.
He is right there.

3127
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:21,733
It's great

3128
02:16:29,610 --> 02:16:34,610
us under version function,
but I want to ask Joe,

3129
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:41,370
what is the top left corner quarter or
that the toughest sport in the Olympics?

3130
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:49,880
His freestyle wrestling served.
I'm certain

3131
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:55,730
he knows what he talks kids.

3132
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:01,930
He's a guy man.
He likes to pull his dick out.

3133
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:03,510
Of course.
Why not?

3134
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:07,770
He's seven years old.
He doesn't give a shit.

3135
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:11,550
Don't get along.
It looks like you already know.

3136
02:17:11,650 --> 02:17:12,970
I didn't.
That's a great one too.

3137
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,120
What is it called?
Just called chic on Netflix.

3138
02:17:16,121 --> 02:17:17,290
That's great.
Yeah,

3139
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:18,153
totally.
Yeah,

3140
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,830
and it's,
it's him and his wife not getting along.

3141
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:23,410
It's just him and his just as life in
general,

3142
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,630
like not working out,
just kind of sad.

3143
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:29,890
It's kind of sad to kind of prop them up
and send them out to do stuff and like

3144
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:32,950
you always kind of make a living.
He just goes and now his new thing is

3145
02:17:32,951 --> 02:17:34,690
just to kind of like freak out on
people,

3146
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:38,290
but he's still like mad and Hulk Hogan
like really?

3147
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:41,980
Because it never broke Keith and he
doesn't know that it's Kayfabe like he's

3148
02:17:41,981 --> 02:17:44,830
never bright.
He still is to pissed off as he goes.

3149
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:48,630
Hulk Hogan promised me a rematch at the
Madison Square Garden and you're like,

3150
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:54,170
she didn't know what
he promised me at the greatest arena

3151
02:17:57,310 --> 02:18:01,120
where the squirt gun and a rematch for
the title.

3152
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,440
He never gave it.
Like,

3153
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:04,450
this is meg.
Oh,

3154
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:06,640
he's always on.
I guess like he was ducking him.

3155
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:11,470
I guess he's just always on.
I mean that's his business.

3156
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:14,500
Got bigger fish to fry.
What happened to his daughter?

3157
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,650
I know I'm jumping all over the place.
Uh,

3158
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:18,260
his daughter.
What about her?

3159
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,050
She wasn't going.
She was in the public eye for awhile and

3160
02:18:20,051 --> 02:18:22,350
then I realize how stupid it will still
be in the public eye.

3161
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:23,470
She's like,
fuck this.

3162
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:28,480
She was making music and shit.
I like when people realize how gross it

3163
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:30,380
is to have people attack you and they're
like,

3164
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:32,560
oh,
back away from this.

3165
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:36,370
You know,
I can remember when a real housewives.

3166
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,040
Kelsey grammer's.
Yeah.

3167
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,800
Ex wife was she tried to be the current.
Yup.

3168
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:44,320
And they did the fucking attack,
the assault.

3169
02:18:44,321 --> 02:18:44,831
She was like,
Hey,

3170
02:18:44,831 --> 02:18:46,000
uh,
we're good.

3171
02:18:46,090 --> 02:18:47,790
I'm out.
Bailed.

3172
02:18:47,791 --> 02:18:49,540
Like he just disappeared from the public
eye.

3173
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,630
Like entirely.
I slipped away because she wasn't

3174
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:55,090
desperate enough.
It's what it is like when you,

3175
02:18:55,091 --> 02:18:55,924
when you need to.

3176
02:18:56,010 --> 02:18:58,600
That's when you have the desperation of
wanting fame.

3177
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,810
She,
they want fame already have the money.

3178
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:05,110
Right?
Like wanting fame and needing the money

3179
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:07,720
is such a different thing.
That's why the bad girls club show is

3180
02:19:07,721 --> 02:19:10,210
the greatest thing on TV.
Oh,

3181
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:13,630
put a up a trailer for it.
If you're listening,

3182
02:19:13,631 --> 02:19:15,250
this is going to be good.
They just get.

3183
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:20,620
They get like we talked about this eight
pieces of garbage and then they just

3184
02:19:20,621 --> 02:19:24,670
fucking make them drink and stuff.
I'm going a goddamn house for three for

3185
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:29,450
three months and it's,
it's they have to go to the hospital for

3186
02:19:29,451 --> 02:19:32,930
the fights.
One of Europe's this year showed up in

3187
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:37,430
the first day she was there.
The other girl just said she was these

3188
02:19:37,431 --> 02:19:41,720
fat pitches or try to ruin my birthday
and picked up like a rocks glass and

3189
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:42,770
bounced it off.
The girls.

3190
02:19:42,771 --> 02:19:43,500
Hey,
like splitter,

3191
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:47,810
eyeopener and the other thing is like
they have 15 girls per season because

3192
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,540
eight of them get kicked off and they
have to bring in replacements.

3193
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:55,700
Christ season 14,
season 15.

3194
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:57,600
See if you can find the season.
Tina's this year.

3195
02:19:57,630 --> 02:19:59,820
This the one I just watched that's not
just grow it.

3196
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,700
Go run this,
run this.

3197
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:12,300
They feed them booze morning til night.
Girls just digging stuff ass.

3198
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:17,430
We're back bitches.
It says Los Angeles,

3199
02:20:17,431 --> 02:20:21,250
California ladies.
What happened in this time?

3200
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:24,580
There was a women that came earlier.
The three of us got a little bit more

3201
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:29,620
and
we proceeded to go on about all the

3202
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:33,960
other things will stay here in the house
and they proceeded to destroy all of our

3203
02:20:33,961 --> 02:20:36,900
personal belongings in the house.
It looks like a tornado

3204
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:48,650
because
isn't going to give me any way

3205
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:55,190
they do.
They broke up each other's money like

3206
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:57,410
their animals,
so they just can't like the worst

3207
02:20:57,411 --> 02:20:58,520
people.
They could find.

3208
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,720
Make them fuck with each other.
There are.

3209
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:04,820
These are all girls that in two seconds,
if you would just give them a porn

3210
02:21:04,821 --> 02:21:06,110
contract,
they would do it,

3211
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:10,610
but they figure they want to sell more
porns by being a part of the show.

3212
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:12,680
Then you're the girl from the bad girls
club.

3213
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,710
Why am,
why am I not hearing about this more

3214
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:19,760
often?
This show is is fantastic.

3215
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:25,850
They are the worst people.
It's garbage and then what they do is

3216
02:21:26,380 --> 02:21:28,440
then they,
they,

3217
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:29,180
they,
you know,

3218
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:31,580
they filmed the whole season,
they edit it,

3219
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:35,990
then they air it now while they're
airing it.

3220
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:40,700
These girls now watch the show and they
see that all the girls they thought was

3221
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:44,630
their friend shit talk behind their back
or so they were using them for

3222
02:21:44,631 --> 02:21:46,700
something,
all the confessional shit and they're

3223
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:49,470
just build up this more.
As much as they already hate each.

3224
02:21:49,471 --> 02:21:51,410
Oh,
now they're more irate than they have

3225
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:55,700
like a three part reunion.
They had to break it into three parts.

3226
02:21:55,701 --> 02:21:59,060
When people get arrested,
like during the show,

3227
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,600
all real 100 percent real.
They got arrested during the reunion

3228
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:05,330
show.
What kind of a person produces a show

3229
02:22:05,331 --> 02:22:10,331
like this genius
guy.

3230
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:13,230
He's been reading my mind.

3231
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:20,600
Yeah,
because man,

3232
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:23,240
it's sure.
Fire attainment,

3233
02:22:23,330 --> 02:22:24,500
they're going to fuck up,
right?

3234
02:22:24,501 --> 02:22:25,870
They're not going to get along great.
They just.

3235
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:29,370
They cut out the middleman of.
Of all the

3236
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:35,870
real world was a show based on alcohol
that shows where it took off.

3237
02:22:36,391 --> 02:22:39,030
Where it got exciting was when it'd be
fueled like no one cared about.

3238
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:42,930
This one's trying to get a job in
animation in this girl's and aspiring

3239
02:22:42,931 --> 02:22:43,561
singer.
It's like,

3240
02:22:43,561 --> 02:22:44,394
no.
It goes,

3241
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:46,710
what happens when you.
When that fucking member,

3242
02:22:46,711 --> 02:22:50,010
the guy put his finger in the guy's aids
peanut butter and then that was a whole

3243
02:22:50,011 --> 02:22:51,780
thing like that's what people want to
see.

3244
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:56,340
They've cut out all of that,
like shit of like watching live their

3245
02:22:56,341 --> 02:22:59,580
lives and have real emotional
conversations and just get them boozed

3246
02:22:59,581 --> 02:23:03,750
up and then they're like,
girls were going go karting today,

3247
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:06,470
and then they go kart drunk and then
they're like,

3248
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:07,100
this bitch thing.

3249
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:09,270
She's a better than me.
She bumped in front of me.

3250
02:23:09,271 --> 02:23:12,060
I was supposed to be next in the go kart
and that bruise.

3251
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:15,390
Then they get dressed for the night and
they go out and they fight and fucking

3252
02:23:15,391 --> 02:23:18,840
bars and limos.
Then they come home and take off their

3253
02:23:18,841 --> 02:23:21,600
shit and put on better fighting clothes
and then continue.

3254
02:23:21,601 --> 02:23:25,650
The fight gets kicked out.
Every episode has two fights.

3255
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:30,090
He should be in spokesperson.
Why don't you narrate the show?

3256
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:34,380
What we wanted to do is I want to do a
live show where we get transcript,

3257
02:23:34,381 --> 02:23:35,700
companion.
I want to know,

3258
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:37,470
trying to get transcripts of bad girls
club.

3259
02:23:37,471 --> 02:23:42,270
We just have dudes reek is if you read
what they say with any kind of rational

3260
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:45,990
tone of something is it will be a be a
fucking nightmare.

3261
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:51,070
Is actually a great idea for a show.
I'm in fucking dude fights they've had

3262
02:23:51,450 --> 02:23:52,860
this year particularly.

3263
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:54,780
It goes,
uh,

3264
02:23:54,781 --> 02:23:56,770
I'm over there trying to work and this
bitch is like,

3265
02:23:56,771 --> 02:23:58,200
you know,
she tried to work next to me.

3266
02:23:58,201 --> 02:24:00,160
She was writing my workspace and it's
like,

3267
02:24:00,910 --> 02:24:03,540
the bitch can't work like me.
You shouldn't be on the same level.

3268
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:06,180
And then it's like having fights like
his face.

3269
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:07,080
He goes,
bitch,

3270
02:24:07,081 --> 02:24:11,250
because you ain't on my level.
That's why I'm up in your face because

3271
02:24:11,251 --> 02:24:14,210
you ain't on my torque level.
And then.

3272
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:17,250
And then one girl goes,
they throw a punch and then the

3273
02:24:17,251 --> 02:24:20,070
confessionals were all like,
I buy that bitch knows who could work

3274
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:22,650
now
and there's blood.

3275
02:24:23,550 --> 02:24:25,560
They throw toasters.
It's insane.

3276
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:28,950
I just hurt my eye from laughing.
I got pulled something in my.

3277
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:31,230
I was laughing so hard.
All right.

3278
02:24:31,231 --> 02:24:33,870
I'm in,
but if we can get a transcript,

3279
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:36,330
freezer belly room show.
Yeah.

3280
02:24:36,331 --> 02:24:38,730
I'm sit there and read the transcript.

3281
02:24:38,730 --> 02:24:40,410
If you guys want to practice,
shut the fuck up.

3282
02:24:40,530 --> 02:24:42,060
Okay,
let's do it.

3283
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:46,440
Is this bad?
Makes a little larger from the episode.

3284
02:24:46,441 --> 02:24:48,040
The Ugly Duckling.
It was a season.

3285
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:52,740
Ward Tunisia,
Tunisia now hosts all the reunions.

3286
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:56,310
She's a big fat black lady.
Hm.

3287
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:59,580
It's hard to know if you have to.
You have to give them and find the

3288
02:24:59,581 --> 02:25:01,020
arguments yet.
That's the thing.

3289
02:25:01,021 --> 02:25:03,270
Yeah,
because they're just doing them in

3290
02:25:03,271 --> 02:25:05,140
general,
but the whole episode would take anyway,

3291
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,920
but just finding like a fight,
like when they start getting into it

3292
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:12,980
like a torque level flight
and then they try to have them be like

3293
02:25:13,510 --> 02:25:16,230
emotional moments like with like a life
coach.

3294
02:25:16,410 --> 02:25:18,480
But that show will be so much better if
you were narrating it.

3295
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:19,440
Oh,
I love.

3296
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,840
Since you're such a fan,
you should reach out to them.

3297
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:22,783
It really should.

3298
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:25,490
Do they have a narrator?
Nope.

3299
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:28,780
What they do now,
just like the Internet of Commercial

3300
02:25:28,781 --> 02:25:29,920
Shit,
bad girls club.

3301
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:32,380
If you hire Jay Oakerson to be your
narrator,

3302
02:25:32,830 --> 02:25:35,470
I will do everything I can to promote
your show.

3303
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:36,700
I will.
I will help.

3304
02:25:36,701 --> 02:25:38,110
I will.
I will put it on twitter.

3305
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:41,320
I'll make an instagram post and it'll
never stop out on the podcast.

3306
02:25:41,350 --> 02:25:44,530
Let's make it happen.
You got you got you got a gold mine here

3307
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:46,830
and do it.
He could do it in an afternoon.

3308
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:49,170
He'll do the whole season.
There is a

3309
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:51,603
say a,
uh,

3310
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:54,670
every season.
There's always a new batch of people who

3311
02:25:54,671 --> 02:25:56,980
were idiots and want to do it.
It's a great idea.

3312
02:25:57,010 --> 02:25:59,200
They also,
I think I started to find out now that

3313
02:25:59,201 --> 02:26:02,610
behind the scenes that reality stuff,
like they'll pull from other shows,

3314
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,070
like the cast offs of something else.
Like somebody tried to,

3315
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:09,820
in fact the girl selling this year,
she tried to be on the real world and

3316
02:26:09,821 --> 02:26:11,710
she didn't get the real world.
But then she got a call from another

3317
02:26:11,711 --> 02:26:12,890
producer a few days later.
I was like,

3318
02:26:12,891 --> 02:26:14,710
Hey,
you want to try to be on this show?

3319
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:15,670
And she was like,
yeah,

3320
02:26:15,671 --> 02:26:16,660
sure.
Because they just

3321
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,040
be on TV.
Yeah.

3322
02:26:18,041 --> 02:26:21,160
Well Shit.
The people that did fear factor that uh,

3323
02:26:21,390 --> 02:26:24,730
did the casting for fear factor.
They also did the casting for a lot of

3324
02:26:24,731 --> 02:26:26,380
other shows too.
And they would do it that way.

3325
02:26:26,730 --> 02:26:27,940
You know,
I don't work for this.

3326
02:26:27,941 --> 02:26:31,240
You might work for them.
They find people that are like fun and

3327
02:26:31,241 --> 02:26:31,571
they go,
Oh,

3328
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:34,360
this guy's like,
you do become like a player.

3329
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:37,210
Like you become like a,
a role player.

3330
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:37,901
Like,
Oh,

3331
02:26:37,901 --> 02:26:40,780
this guy,
he's the coach them to.

3332
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:42,190
They sit down with them and they go,
look,

3333
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:45,100
got to be.
Remember how we talked about it before.

3334
02:26:45,130 --> 02:26:47,840
You're going to be like really,
really pissed off at him because he's,

3335
02:26:47,841 --> 02:26:49,350
he's the guy that had been disrespecting
you.

3336
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:49,721
Yeah,
yeah,

3337
02:26:49,721 --> 02:26:50,141
yeah,
yeah,

3338
02:26:50,141 --> 02:26:50,890
yeah,
yeah.

3339
02:26:50,890 --> 02:26:53,050
Don't let him do that because this is
going to be on TV.

3340
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:54,640
Okay.
And you can get them back,

3341
02:26:54,641 --> 02:26:56,500
but you gotta you gotTa really get them
back.

3342
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:58,300
Okay.
Got To really get them back and you're

3343
02:26:58,301 --> 02:26:59,670
gonna get a lot of air time and so
they'll,

3344
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:01,910
they'll like coach these people go,
oh yeah,

3345
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:04,300
yeah.
So you're watching like this artifact.

3346
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:08,950
And the reality of reality shows is that
it's all just,

3347
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:11,080
it's almost like a curb.
Your enthusiasm thing with like

3348
02:27:11,081 --> 02:27:14,470
untalented people.
The scenarios are painted out.

3349
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:17,740
They kind of know what's going to happen
before they get there and they just play

3350
02:27:17,741 --> 02:27:21,850
it out with their awful personalities.
But these pieces of shit hate each

3351
02:27:21,851 --> 02:27:23,860
other.
They are dead people.

3352
02:27:23,861 --> 02:27:26,230
Every one of them stayed behind.
None of them.

3353
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:30,850
But I think if the show is just a wildly
hilarious,

3354
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:32,740
I'm in,
I made any of that.

3355
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:36,100
Like uh,
like reality stuff like that started

3356
02:27:36,101 --> 02:27:40,360
with that,
that show they had years back about all

3357
02:27:40,361 --> 02:27:43,630
the talk shows like Maury Povich back to
Jenny Jones and all that shit.

3358
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:45,610
Yeah.
Like same thing,

3359
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:49,240
like they really do a prey on the weak
in a lot of ways.

3360
02:27:49,241 --> 02:27:50,230
Like,
Oh yeah,

3361
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:53,320
like these chicks are kind of asking for
it.

3362
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:53,980
But uh,
and I,

3363
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:58,360
and as I said before,
like I kind of liken that to springer

3364
02:27:58,361 --> 02:28:00,280
now where there's just like people who
are like,

3365
02:28:00,281 --> 02:28:01,600
what do they make up?
The stories are not.

3366
02:28:01,601 --> 02:28:01,931
It's like,
hey,

3367
02:28:01,931 --> 02:28:04,240
we're going to go fake fistfight on
Jerry Springer,

3368
02:28:04,241 --> 02:28:05,770
show over a fucking,
you know,

3369
02:28:05,890 --> 02:28:09,190
scrawny Hispanic guy.
And they kind of worked that out and

3370
02:28:09,191 --> 02:28:11,350
they give them booze and they incite
them to do it.

3371
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,920
But the way they laugh at like these are
they're telling like life falling apart

3372
02:28:17,231 --> 02:28:19,870
stories and the way that you could even
get the person who's like,

3373
02:28:19,871 --> 02:28:22,850
you know,
your boyfriend's fucking your sister or

3374
02:28:22,851 --> 02:28:25,430
you already have a kid with the Guy
Kinda Shit at some point of the show.

3375
02:28:25,431 --> 02:28:27,680
The fact that she smiles and giggles at
all,

3376
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:30,230
you're like,
this is not that real to her.

3377
02:28:30,231 --> 02:28:32,270
You know what I mean?
Like they're making this up to some

3378
02:28:32,271 --> 02:28:34,160
degree because why would she,
you would never laugh.

3379
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:36,590
Like you probably genuinely leave the
show,

3380
02:28:37,130 --> 02:28:40,100
but they go to them with booze and they
kind of liked that,

3381
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:44,420
lead them in a direction and do it.
But when they did that years ago,

3382
02:28:44,421 --> 02:28:45,650
it wasn't always just like,
you know,

3383
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,100
cheating shitter who's the father those
shows would try to do like,

3384
02:28:49,101 --> 02:28:52,490
you know,
people have tried to cut off their own,

3385
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:54,350
like Dick's,
but you know,

3386
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:56,300
because they hate their own dick,
you know,

3387
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,970
try to get,
he's gripping news type things.

3388
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:01,370
And same thing with them is they would
get them all.

3389
02:29:01,371 --> 02:29:03,560
Like they'd get these nervous people
just boost them up like that.

3390
02:29:03,561 --> 02:29:06,950
Really is like preying on the weak,
just getting them like,

3391
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:09,680
am I just go get hammered and give it a
shot I guess,

3392
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:12,950
but if somebody doesn't eat the wounded
lay antelopes than the wounds,

3393
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:16,070
antelopes will continue to make their
way into the waterhole.

3394
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,870
Sure.
Crocodile will starve.

3395
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:22,940
Jerry Springer's a crocodile and all
those jumps on that show their wounds

3396
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:26,140
antelopes he's a genius in way.
I mean,

3397
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:28,280
so some of that 25 years we looked that
up.

3398
02:29:28,330 --> 02:29:30,790
It's still going 25 years.
I'm still brand new up.

3399
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:34,190
Shout out to my friend Pete.
The cop from Pete is one of the,

3400
02:29:34,191 --> 02:29:35,660
uh,
security guards on there.

3401
02:29:35,661 --> 02:29:37,190
He was on season one,
a fear factor.

3402
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:37,971
Oh really?
Yeah.

3403
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:41,190
He's Andre Arlovski's buddy.
Is he the guy who does the start?

3404
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:43,430
That's always one of the one.
Jerry Springer was just go start the

3405
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:45,500
chance.
I don't think he does that.

3406
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:47,090
He's big handsome.
Applicant fellow.

3407
02:29:47,091 --> 02:29:48,090
He's a legit cop.
Yeah,

3408
02:29:48,091 --> 02:29:49,400
it lacks.
The last time I saw him,

3409
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:51,650
he's actually recovering from gunshot
wounds.

3410
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:53,120
Really?
Yeah.

3411
02:29:53,121 --> 02:29:56,450
He got shot on the job and shot in the
arm.

3412
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:57,970
Jesus.
Yeah.

3413
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:01,400
They had a cast on his arm or a sling on
his arm is pretty fucked up.

3414
02:30:01,401 --> 02:30:04,250
Whereas the Acom Chicago in Chicago.
Yeah.

3415
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:09,020
Chicago is a scary spot to be a cop.
They do spring or in Connecticut now.

3416
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,420
I wonder if that's why get the fuck out
of Chicago.

3417
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:13,250
Not a bad idea.
Probably cheaper too.

3418
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,900
I mean that's probably why espn is
there,

3419
02:30:15,210 --> 02:30:15,690
you know?
Okay.

3420
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:16,940
I get now.
Yeah.

3421
02:30:16,941 --> 02:30:21,620
Espn has been in Connecticut and it's
real close to a New York wwe

3422
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:23,870
headquarters.
Like a lot of people like rich folks

3423
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:26,210
live in Connecticut and make that trip
to Manhattan.

3424
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:29,600
I know that's what letterman used to do
to what Baba booey does.

3425
02:30:29,630 --> 02:30:30,320
Does he?
Yeah.

3426
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:31,430
He lives in Connecticut.
No,

3427
02:30:31,431 --> 02:30:32,810
Shit.
That's a long ass drive.

3428
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:36,590
It's more than an hour.
Easy.

3429
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,700
I could be an hour.
Yeah,

3430
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,580
maybe really bad now if you leave at a
good time,

3431
02:30:40,581 --> 02:30:42,650
it can be an hour.
If you go into the stern studio,

3432
02:30:42,651 --> 02:30:44,660
you're going to Sirius,
Sirius Xm,

3433
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,080
and then you've got to go back to
Connecticut and your whole day.

3434
02:30:48,130 --> 02:30:48,551
Yeah.
You're.

3435
02:30:48,551 --> 02:30:51,710
You're getting home at like the show's
over 11 by the time they get to see him

3436
02:30:51,711 --> 02:30:53,590
walking out.
What time do you think he leaves?

3437
02:30:54,380 --> 02:30:57,440
I see him walking out sometimes.
Rarely 3:00 PM or so.

3438
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:59,060
Yeah,
because he's got work to do after the

3439
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:01,580
show's over.
So he's probably catching the first wave

3440
02:31:01,581 --> 02:31:05,900
of traffic back to Connecticut Western
wrap up show recently.

3441
02:31:05,901 --> 02:31:08,690
And when I came out they were like
sterns gonna walk by.

3442
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:09,450
They were Kinda like,
you know,

3443
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:11,690
I don't like shake his hand or talk to
him at all.

3444
02:31:11,691 --> 02:31:12,540
And I was like,
Nah,

3445
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:15,180
that Kinda bummed me out.
That somewhat even like,

3446
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:17,720
have to tell you that.
Wait a minute,

3447
02:31:17,721 --> 02:31:18,740
what?
Say That again?

3448
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,670
Start and walk.
I did the wrap up show,

3449
02:31:20,671 --> 02:31:23,880
which is not,
it's John Haydn and Gary.

3450
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:27,150
Right.
And when I was leaving and going back

3451
02:31:27,151 --> 02:31:29,190
out to the lobby there,
external to walk by and they were like,

3452
02:31:29,191 --> 02:31:30,024
yeah,
I don't like,

3453
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:32,100
you know,
they're basically give me like a don't

3454
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:32,641
try to like,
you know,

3455
02:31:32,641 --> 02:31:33,474
hey,
how are.

3456
02:31:34,390 --> 02:31:36,300
Yeah,
I mean I wasn't going to anyway,

3457
02:31:36,301 --> 02:31:39,750
but I am a huge fan,
but I was like why would they say that

3458
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:43,080
my guests,
because Howard doesn't want to like to

3459
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:44,400
shake hands,
but maybe like again,

3460
02:31:44,401 --> 02:31:46,620
it could be one of those things where
they're protecting somebody who doesn't,

3461
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,480
who's not asking to be protected so
much,

3462
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:50,310
but who knows,
you know what I mean?

3463
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:53,760
That's a bummer.
Yeah,

3464
02:31:54,050 --> 02:31:57,510
and dice will get there,
but dice I can make happen.

3465
02:31:58,170 --> 02:32:02,820
I'd like to make that happen.
I really went back in La a probably be a

3466
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:03,290
month or so.
Okay.

3467
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:06,390
But when you're back,
Holler at me twice in the two of you

3468
02:32:06,391 --> 02:32:08,400
guys sit down together and do a podcast
together.

3469
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:09,660
I told her,
eleanor,

3470
02:32:10,450 --> 02:32:13,170
I'm like,
try to get them to watch my special on

3471
02:32:13,171 --> 02:32:14,220
Friday.
Don't do that.

3472
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:16,790
He would love you though.
He would love it.

3473
02:32:16,791 --> 02:32:20,130
I think he was a good guy.
You'd see how inspired is by like his

3474
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:20,820
thing.
Yeah,

3475
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:25,820
for sure is he's a good guy.
He's a fun dude and he's A.

3476
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,970
Yeah,
he's,

3477
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:28,470
you know,
like we both agreed.

3478
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:31,080
It's very important.
Very important.

3479
02:32:31,081 --> 02:32:34,380
That will be a kick for like for like my
step pops was able to call my step up

3480
02:32:34,381 --> 02:32:35,071
after and be like,
yeah,

3481
02:32:35,071 --> 02:32:35,640
we just hung out.

3482
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:37,800
Like we really.
He was such a big part of me and his

3483
02:32:37,810 --> 02:32:39,570
like friendship,
you know what I mean?

3484
02:32:39,571 --> 02:32:41,870
Me and my stepfather being like me thing
was pumps.

3485
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:43,350
Pretty cool.
He would love that.

3486
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:45,660
Yeah.
Next time you're in town,

3487
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,800
I'll definitely set that up.
Yeah,

3488
02:32:46,801 --> 02:32:48,180
let's do it.
He's at the store all the time.

3489
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:51,510
He takes time off,
standing up and then gets back to it.

3490
02:32:51,511 --> 02:32:54,290
But he's doing that showtime show now.
Here show.

3491
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,150
It's called dice.
Yeah.

3492
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,193
Yeah.
Duh.

3493
02:32:57,490 --> 02:32:58,410
I'm like,
what is the truth?

3494
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:01,170
But he did that other show too.
It's eight is an HBO show.

3495
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:02,790
Who's doing what?
Who's making it?

3496
02:33:02,791 --> 02:33:03,610
Showtime.
Right.

3497
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:07,140
Showtime and associate comedy store type
show,

3498
02:33:07,141 --> 02:33:09,390
but that's not that.
But he was.

3499
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:11,820
He played a part in something.
Something else.

3500
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:13,230
Oh yeah,
he was on vinyl.

3501
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,250
That's right.
Hbo,

3502
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:15,031
the Vinyl Show.
Yeah.

3503
02:33:15,031 --> 02:33:17,070
It was only on an episode,
but he was fucking great.

3504
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:18,593
He's a good actor,
man.

3505
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:20,610
He's really good in that Woody Allen
movie too.

3506
02:33:21,020 --> 02:33:22,290
Jasmine.
I saw that too.

3507
02:33:22,291 --> 02:33:25,650
I thought it was fantastic in that we
think about that woody allen thing.

3508
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,240
What's a little weird,
right?

3509
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:30,570
Which thing?
Bangs his daughter just in general.

3510
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:32,700
A little weird,
but it's not as daughter.

3511
02:33:32,701 --> 02:33:33,570
Right?
That's the at the end,

3512
02:33:33,571 --> 02:33:35,850
but it's basically his daughter
allegedly.

3513
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:36,631
Yeah.
I mean that's,

3514
02:33:36,631 --> 02:33:39,390
you know,
he looks like a drawing of a guy who

3515
02:33:39,391 --> 02:33:40,224
fucks his daughter.

3516
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:49,250
Really?
Here's the caricature of that guy.

3517
02:33:51,490 --> 02:33:54,720
Yeah.
I have a woody allen stand up a CD,

3518
02:33:54,990 --> 02:33:59,610
whatever you wanna call it album.
It's on my phone and when I play I'm

3519
02:33:59,611 --> 02:34:01,110
going to have the Bluetooth linked up to
my car.

3520
02:34:01,230 --> 02:34:04,670
It's the first thing,
one of the first things that plays the

3521
02:34:04,690 --> 02:34:06,510
Thomson one,
but it's a,

3522
02:34:06,530 --> 02:34:08,910
it's,
it's because it's the letter a is the

3523
02:34:08,911 --> 02:34:12,390
beginning of the thing and when I plug
in my ipod at ace of spades starts

3524
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:15,300
playing every time.
It's a uh,

3525
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:19,570
it's a weird.
It's a weird album because not knowing

3526
02:34:19,571 --> 02:34:24,130
that is kind of kinked up sexually.
Like you see how weird he was,

3527
02:34:24,330 --> 02:34:24,770
like,
you know,

3528
02:34:24,770 --> 02:34:29,650
like it kind of like snuck under the
radar because he was as nebbishy little

3529
02:34:29,651 --> 02:34:31,630
Jewish guy,
but he was like letting everybody know

3530
02:34:31,631 --> 02:34:33,670
he was a pervert.
Like from the jump.

3531
02:34:33,710 --> 02:34:35,350
Yeah.
I mean his voice,

3532
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:39,640
he has a natural voice of the fake voice
you would do as a guy who's like a

3533
02:34:39,641 --> 02:34:41,530
creep.
You know what I mean?

3534
02:34:41,531 --> 02:34:44,230
Like he lives with that voice.
Yeah.

3535
02:34:44,620 --> 02:34:46,870
It's fucking bizarre.
Can you do an woody allen,

3536
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:53,240
woody Allen and dice clay together now?
Yeah.

3537
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:55,540
I don't know.
I couldn't do in bed together.

3538
02:34:57,950 --> 02:35:00,340
Take it.
You fucking Jew.

3539
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:04,740
Oh,
as I.

3540
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:08,980
Anthony Kumi always did a great dice man
because like it's getting like the

3541
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:12,530
detail of the oppression of the Ha.
Just like,

3542
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:13,280
just like,
yeah,

3543
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,770
it was just like saying hon for
something.

3544
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:17,730
It's nice.
Yeah.

3545
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:19,530
Anthony Kumina can do a bunch of
different pressures.

3546
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:21,280
He's a very good impressionist.
Yeah,

3547
02:35:21,281 --> 02:35:22,270
he's great.
Yeah.

3548
02:35:22,290 --> 02:35:25,060
He's that dice used to like when they
did a,

3549
02:35:25,061 --> 02:35:27,730
if you ever want to listen to a few
seconds of,

3550
02:35:27,731 --> 02:35:28,690
uh,
when he does,

3551
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:31,360
dice gets religious.
It's on youtube.

3552
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:32,860
I've heard that.
Yeah,

3553
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:35,580
it's a fucking with us.
The footprints poem was like,

3554
02:35:35,610 --> 02:35:36,820
Jesus,
I come one.

3555
02:35:36,821 --> 02:35:40,090
There was only one at my hardest terms.
There's only one set of footprints.

3556
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:43,150
Why did you leave me?
You fucking scumbag.

3557
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:48,070
He goes,
that's what I was carrying you and I

3558
02:35:48,071 --> 02:35:48,904
cried.

3559
02:35:50,730 --> 02:35:52,730
Goes broke down.
It was.

3560
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:55,980
I was over here.
Now I'm over here now with the Lord.

3561
02:35:55,990 --> 02:36:00,940
I'm over here.
Are you guys on [inaudible] network?

3562
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:02,103
No,
not anymore.

3563
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:03,760
You were just left [inaudible] that
work?

3564
02:36:03,761 --> 02:36:05,860
Yeah,
we're on gas digital network now.

3565
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:08,770
Why is everybody on the sky explaining
network to me?

3566
02:36:08,771 --> 02:36:10,960
What's the benefit of being on network?
Uh,

3567
02:36:10,961 --> 02:36:14,290
exposure to Anthony's thing was to.
Anthony's a audience was nice for the

3568
02:36:14,291 --> 02:36:15,730
time we were there.
It was great.

3569
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:18,100
Um,
the way we're doing it now.

3570
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:22,450
I really like this may be the,
one of the only things that does make

3571
02:36:22,451 --> 02:36:26,800
sense to me.
It's the gas digital thing is all of us

3572
02:36:26,801 --> 02:36:29,770
in all of our kinds of other things.
So I do the SDR show sex,

3573
02:36:29,771 --> 02:36:32,110
drugs,
rock and roll show I do with Ralph

3574
02:36:32,110 --> 02:36:33,300
Sutton.
Um,

3575
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,900
that's just where we interviewed porn
stars.

3576
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:37,810
And music people,
he has a connection to all music people

3577
02:36:37,811 --> 02:36:38,590
in porn stars.

3578
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:42,070
So we interviewed them,
a legion of skanks nails,

3579
02:36:42,071 --> 02:36:46,150
me Louis and Dave Lewis has the real
last podcast he does by herself.

3580
02:36:46,151 --> 02:36:47,350
Dave,
that's part of the problem,

3581
02:36:47,351 --> 02:36:49,840
which is the political when he does and
it's all in the same,

3582
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:53,140
you know,
it's like all kinds of friends kind of,

3583
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:55,150
you know what I mean?
So it's like if you like one of these,

3584
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,710
you'll like all of them.
You know what I mean?

3585
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,390
Like we're going to be like,
oh,

3586
02:36:58,391 --> 02:37:01,180
but if you like elements of them,
there's something kind of for everyone

3587
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:03,910
in this grouping of like this click of
comics,

3588
02:37:03,911 --> 02:37:06,130
I guess I'll see you guys have created
your own network.

3589
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:06,761
They did.
Yeah.

3590
02:37:06,761 --> 02:37:08,440
Lewis.
And I'm Ralph Lewis and Ralph's.

3591
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:11,020
That sets gets Gomez in Sutton gas.
That makes sense.

3592
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:12,850
Okay.
So then besides that,

3593
02:37:12,851 --> 02:37:15,070
I don't actually know.
I don't know what the,

3594
02:37:15,740 --> 02:37:17,960
what the benefits,
unless you're exposing yourself to an

3595
02:37:17,961 --> 02:37:19,070
audience,
like I said,

3596
02:37:19,071 --> 02:37:23,840
for doing bonfire that show I do on
Sirius Xm on comedy central radio.

3597
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:27,650
That's been amazing in so many ways
because it's very discoverable.

3598
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,200
You're not playing to like just this
core audience,

3599
02:37:30,201 --> 02:37:33,530
like that's people just in their cars
but on comedy central and we're doing

3600
02:37:33,531 --> 02:37:35,750
this talk show times a week.
Like that's,

3601
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:40,370
that's done like huge on the road and
stuff like go on the road,

3602
02:37:40,371 --> 02:37:42,680
like people showing up to clubs.
Like that's amazing how that hits.

3603
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:44,510
So is that on serious?
Yeah,

3604
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:46,530
that's such a radio.
Yeah,

3605
02:37:46,531 --> 02:37:48,710
it's great.
We're going to be extended the days of

3606
02:37:48,711 --> 02:37:51,590
that soon.
So this is weird because they really,

3607
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:55,170
they're paying Howard and they pay and
Jimmy,

3608
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:59,690
but everybody else is like,
well that's the beauty of our situation

3609
02:37:59,691 --> 02:38:02,300
is we are not employees of serious.
Yeah.

3610
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:07,130
Comedy central works at a contract with
serious for their network to beyond.

3611
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:10,610
And then we are,
we're employees of Viacom.

3612
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:12,290
Oh,
so they pay you?

3613
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:13,670
Yeah.
Oh that's great then.

3614
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:14,780
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3615
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:16,070
Yup.
And with,

3616
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:18,530
we've done it for almost a year now.
We'll get an alert when your

3617
02:38:18,531 --> 02:38:21,140
anniversary.
It's going to be great and it's cool

3618
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:23,600
celebrations,
man in Louis and uh,

3619
02:38:23,601 --> 02:38:26,390
and my girlfriend both putting in that
skank fest thing is going to be really

3620
02:38:26,391 --> 02:38:28,050
neat.
Like Stan hopes coming in for it and

3621
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:31,880
heard todd glass is company wide.
He makes me laugh.

3622
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:34,760
He's so and yeah.
So I'm excited to get a few people in

3623
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:37,610
its first year we're doing it.
So t how todd glass was the.

3624
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:38,850
Well not talking about.
Yeah.

3625
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:42,230
Was it todd glass that a design help
design?

3626
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:45,140
I think it was that helped design
helium.

3627
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:47,130
Oh yeah.
Well that's right.

3628
02:38:47,140 --> 02:38:47,661
I think.
Yeah,

3629
02:38:47,661 --> 02:38:49,190
I'm pretty sure we talked about it when
he was here.

3630
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3631
02:38:51,470 --> 02:38:52,580
Alex.
nice atmosphere.

3632
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:54,950
Like he figured it out.
He nailed it.

3633
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:56,660
Um,
so Friday night,

3634
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:59,300
is it Friday or Saturday?
You comedy central special.

3635
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:01,460
It's Friday night into Saturday.
Midnight.

3636
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:04,550
It's midnight at Saturday technically,
but it's Friday night.

3637
02:39:04,580 --> 02:39:06,570
Dave said it's fucking awesome man.
Uh,

3638
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,551
Dave Smith.
Yeah,

3639
02:39:07,551 --> 02:39:08,301
he was there for.
Yeah,

3640
02:39:08,301 --> 02:39:10,580
it was a,
it was a hell of a nightmare.

3641
02:39:10,610 --> 02:39:13,680
It was really a,
it was above my inbox,

3642
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,500
above and beyond my expectations which
doing at Webster Hall in New York.

3643
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:23,540
I'm going to see too that we had a $600
per show and it was great.

3644
02:39:23,691 --> 02:39:25,550
We filled it with all fans.
We just did it.

3645
02:39:25,551 --> 02:39:29,120
I got the the band when I went on tour
with corn.

3646
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:30,411
I,
like I said,

3647
02:39:30,411 --> 02:39:33,080
I was like wigging out about that.
It shouldn't be what I should have

3648
02:39:33,081 --> 02:39:37,160
gotten to in that story was when I got
on the tour going through all this

3649
02:39:37,161 --> 02:39:39,950
anxiety,
like the second day,

3650
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:44,600
the support act on that tour as a band
called two cents and it's just these

3651
02:39:44,601 --> 02:39:49,601
like this wild dudes from like Malibu
basically and some of them from Malibu

3652
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,800
silver from riverside,
but they're just like,

3653
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:54,950
they were at a control for like fun
guys,

3654
02:39:54,951 --> 02:39:57,520
but I mean like just there on their
fucking route,

3655
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,360
first tour bus tour ever for them.

3656
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:01,100
Like they were all excited but they just
got,

3657
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:03,800
took me in.
They just became like real good friends

3658
02:40:03,801 --> 02:40:05,540
and they love.
There was a comedian on the tour and

3659
02:40:05,541 --> 02:40:10,320
they watched and laughed and supported
constantly and so when I got this

3660
02:40:10,321 --> 02:40:15,321
special I was able to get comedy central
to fly those guys out and they play like

3661
02:40:16,051 --> 02:40:18,680
the intro,
we make it like a rock show.

3662
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:21,050
And they did,
they blew Cryo jetson and they were on

3663
02:40:21,051 --> 02:40:24,870
stage with you are the big backdrop of,
uh,

3664
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,340
of the Legion of skanks logos behind me.
So you're onstage and they were like off

3665
02:40:29,341 --> 02:40:31,170
to the side while you're up there?
Yeah.

3666
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:32,490
Oh Nice.
Yeah.

3667
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:34,380
And they're in the dark,
but you can kind of see them like lit up

3668
02:40:34,381 --> 02:40:37,560
with it because there's like a glow in
the dark logo over by the djs booths.

3669
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:40,170
It's was,
it was cool to be able to like involve

3670
02:40:40,171 --> 02:40:40,860
them like that.

3671
02:40:40,860 --> 02:40:42,180
That's cool.
That's very cool.

3672
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:43,500
We made it a big,
big.

3673
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:46,170
It's funny,
I was just huge like rock show,

3674
02:40:46,880 --> 02:40:49,530
you know,
Marilyn Manson inspired opening and then

3675
02:40:49,531 --> 02:40:51,240
uh,
and then I sit on a stool for our

3676
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:53,580
comedy.
Central's taken some fucking chances,

3677
02:40:53,581 --> 02:40:55,020
man.
I like what they're doing.

3678
02:40:55,021 --> 02:40:57,440
I like the art show already shows
amazing.

3679
02:40:57,441 --> 02:40:59,400
Yeah.
He take some big chances with that.

3680
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:02,190
They're taking a big chance with his
roast battle show very big.

3681
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:03,660
They took a big chance on me.
It was,

3682
02:41:03,661 --> 02:41:05,280
it was a work.
It was a real like,

3683
02:41:05,281 --> 02:41:07,140
uh,
when I got it,

3684
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:10,140
I was why I got so emotional about it
really was because,

3685
02:41:10,141 --> 02:41:13,380
uh,
it shows like it came kind of out of

3686
02:41:13,381 --> 02:41:15,750
nowhere because three years ago I
pitched him that idea.

3687
02:41:15,751 --> 02:41:16,531
I mean,
David Tell,

3688
02:41:16,531 --> 02:41:19,470
doing his comedy underground thing,
broke down some walls over there for

3689
02:41:19,471 --> 02:41:21,390
like producing a show.

3690
02:41:21,690 --> 02:41:24,270
Their issue was never being showing
dirty stuff.

3691
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:27,330
They would acquire someone special in
plate after midnight,

3692
02:41:27,490 --> 02:41:30,480
doesn't matter to them,
but putting the money out to produce a

3693
02:41:30,481 --> 02:41:32,640
special that I pitched them.
I was like,

3694
02:41:32,641 --> 02:41:36,810
let's produce a special that's dirty
uncensored and just show it late night,

3695
02:41:36,811 --> 02:41:39,090
you know,
but like we'll make that like a thing,

3696
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:41,250
make it that it's cool to watch it after
midnight.

3697
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,520
And uh,
they just shut the idea down.

3698
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:46,050
But they were like,
they liked me,

3699
02:41:46,051 --> 02:41:47,610
you know,
and they kind of like hung in there and

3700
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:52,010
I give them tapes and they'd come back
with a bunch of red notes.

3701
02:41:52,030 --> 02:41:53,210
You can't say this,
you can't say that.

3702
02:41:53,290 --> 02:41:57,420
I kind of just checked out of it even
being a possibility and then like one

3703
02:41:57,421 --> 02:41:58,770
day and all the little pieces,
you know,

3704
02:41:58,771 --> 02:41:59,630
I said and,
and,

3705
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:02,850
you know,
make no mistake you letting be,

3706
02:42:02,851 --> 02:42:03,390
be,
uh,

3707
02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:06,480
exposed to your audience like this or
would Ari's done for me.

3708
02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:08,600
So many people.
You know what I mean?

3709
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,890
It's countless list of it.
Ron Bennington,

3710
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:12,063
Bennington,
sure.

3711
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:15,720
Exposing his fans.
Like all these little pieces came

3712
02:42:15,721 --> 02:42:18,300
together.
I mean like he fought for me to be on

3713
02:42:18,301 --> 02:42:20,550
that storytelling show.
I was the only newer comic.

3714
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,600
There was no other comics from New York.
They brought out a.

3715
02:42:23,850 --> 02:42:26,790
Now they are.
But the first two ones I did,

3716
02:42:26,791 --> 02:42:29,550
I was the only New York comic and the
first one they didn't want me.

3717
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:33,480
I think they're realizing that the
Internet has kind of changed the the

3718
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:38,540
level they changed the bar and you,
the television sensors are only getting

3719
02:42:39,301 --> 02:42:42,990
in the way of commerce like you're
fucking it up because the people can do

3720
02:42:42,991 --> 02:42:45,210
uncensored shit in other places like
Netflix.

3721
02:42:45,570 --> 02:42:47,310
Netflix doesn't give a fuck.
They don't care.

3722
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,270
They gave me zero notes and now you can
say the.

3723
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:54,680
Now you can say shit balls and pussy on
tbs know what I'm saying?

3724
02:42:54,690 --> 02:42:57,150
Like on channels like tbs now shift.
They're all close.

3725
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:59,790
Yeah.
Cable is not governed by the FCC.

3726
02:42:59,791 --> 02:43:02,710
It's only governed by what the
advertisers are willing to tolerate it.

3727
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,780
So they were always able to change the
own.

3728
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:06,690
That's why I said IFC,
that was their big thing.

3729
02:43:06,691 --> 02:43:11,691
Like how can I have you just have like
nudity and cursing on their channels.

3730
02:43:11,861 --> 02:43:13,130
Like they were like,
damn,

3731
02:43:13,131 --> 02:43:18,100
this lady told me they go any because my
show is Iraq was on ifc and we had

3732
02:43:18,101 --> 02:43:19,900
nudity and cursing.
I was like,

3733
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:21,100
how is this okay?
And they go,

3734
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,760
any like MTV could do that if they
wanted to.

3735
02:43:24,761 --> 02:43:28,160
It was just like they'll lose their core
of what they're trying to get you as an

3736
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,160
advertising audience.
Maybe not for them.

3737
02:43:30,161 --> 02:43:30,630
You know?

3738
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:32,110
That was the big thing with Dave
Chappelle,

3739
02:43:32,470 --> 02:43:34,680
the Dave Chappelle when he was doing the
Dave Chappelle show,

3740
02:43:34,681 --> 02:43:36,900
they were trying to get him to change
the language because they would get more

3741
02:43:36,901 --> 02:43:38,350
advertisers.
They were,

3742
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:40,710
they were telling him he couldn't say
nigger anymore.

3743
02:43:42,330 --> 02:43:45,390
They were trying to like cut down on the
amount of this and the amount of that.

3744
02:43:45,391 --> 02:43:48,060
They were just looking at dollar signs.
They were looking at taking this

3745
02:43:48,061 --> 02:43:52,800
cultural phenomenon and juicing the
blood out of it.

3746
02:43:52,801 --> 02:43:54,330
They could of course,
yeah.

3747
02:43:54,420 --> 02:43:56,700
I mean that's what they do mean that
they're not creative.

3748
02:43:56,701 --> 02:43:57,534
They're not artists.

3749
02:43:57,630 --> 02:44:00,240
People in suits make all the decisions
though somehow until you get to that

3750
02:44:00,241 --> 02:44:02,190
point that Louis ck thing is like,
uh,

3751
02:44:02,191 --> 02:44:03,030
you know,
or,

3752
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:05,980
or like you said,
what you've done here is really like,

3753
02:44:05,990 --> 02:44:06,751
you know,
amazing.

3754
02:44:06,751 --> 02:44:11,670
Like you give this for free the show and
you give people like hours and hours of

3755
02:44:11,671 --> 02:44:12,870
content a week.
You know what I mean?

3756
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:16,170
But it's all on your thing.
You have an audience bigger than,

3757
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:20,640
I mean a comedy central person said to
me yesterday,

3758
02:44:20,641 --> 02:44:21,630
I go,
as I'm doing,

3759
02:44:21,631 --> 02:44:23,100
uh,
I'm doing the Joe Rogan experience

3760
02:44:23,101 --> 02:44:25,830
tomorrow and promoting the special.
He goes,

3761
02:44:26,130 --> 02:44:27,030
oh,
that's going to be better than,

3762
02:44:27,110 --> 02:44:30,750
than that midnight at midnight tonight.
That's going to be a TV show.

3763
02:44:30,751 --> 02:44:33,570
Like this is hits way bigger audience.
You know what I mean?

3764
02:44:33,571 --> 02:44:34,920
And you've done it on your own way.
That's like,

3765
02:44:34,960 --> 02:44:35,820
that's fucking great.

3766
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:38,650
We just kept doing it to just keep doing
it.

3767
02:44:38,651 --> 02:44:42,000
And the thing that is for me,
it's like,

3768
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:46,240
it's not like it's the easiest thing in
the world to do in the sense that it's

3769
02:44:46,241 --> 02:44:48,840
fun,
like just show up and you know,

3770
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:52,390
take care of all the pieces that have to
be put into place as far as like how it

3771
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:56,230
gets uploaded and where it goes and how
it gets distributed through itunes.

3772
02:44:56,730 --> 02:45:00,760
It becomes pretty fucking easy.
And when it reaches the numbers that

3773
02:45:00,761 --> 02:45:03,430
it's at now where it gets to be like TV
show numbers,

3774
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,760
it's it.
And there's no end to that.

3775
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:09,790
There's no like there's no cap to it and
it doesn't cost anything,

3776
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:12,070
so for me it's just,
it's all fun.

3777
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:16,890
Your numbers drop for two months,
a little bit.

3778
02:45:17,490 --> 02:45:19,480
There's no one looming over you.
So I'm saying to go,

3779
02:45:19,481 --> 02:45:20,610
it's like whoa.
I noticed like,

3780
02:45:21,190 --> 02:45:22,950
you know,
in this or not even when your numbers

3781
02:45:22,951 --> 02:45:25,050
drop,
but it's like you picking up some here

3782
02:45:25,051 --> 02:45:28,280
but you're losing the people in
Wisconsin right now.

3783
02:45:28,410 --> 02:45:30,180
Who gives like why would you even give a
shit about that?

3784
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:32,820
I would have never made it the way it
is.

3785
02:45:32,850 --> 02:45:37,850
There's no way they would've advised me
to pick more popular people as far as

3786
02:45:38,341 --> 02:45:42,060
like guests as far as like a really
famous people instead of like authors

3787
02:45:42,061 --> 02:45:43,770
are weird.
Scientists are interesting.

3788
02:45:43,771 --> 02:45:47,070
People that I think would be fun to talk
to by doing it on my own.

3789
02:45:47,730 --> 02:45:50,700
I'm able to do the whole thing,
like book it,

3790
02:45:50,930 --> 02:45:52,170
you know,
decide when.

3791
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:53,690
If we know today,
you know,

3792
02:45:53,691 --> 02:45:56,250
like we're going to do it at one.
We both ran late.

3793
02:45:56,280 --> 02:45:59,000
We just fucking 1:30 gives.
You could have done it too.

3794
02:45:59,070 --> 02:46:00,820
It doesn't matter.
It's not like everything else.

3795
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:02,730
Can be done,
they're watching like pounding a thing

3796
02:46:02,731 --> 02:46:06,480
like come on guys and it's not a thing
in the world that can reach millions of

3797
02:46:06,481 --> 02:46:09,000
people like this that has three people
involved in it.

3798
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:10,160
You,
me and Jamie

3799
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,940
right now.
That's it.

3800
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:13,610
How far away before they're coming in to
regulate it?

3801
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:15,710
Just like the free airwaves.
I think they can.

3802
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:18,140
I think the genie's out of the bottle.
I think it's too late.

3803
02:46:18,141 --> 02:46:21,770
I don't think people will tolerate it.
I don't think it's possible at this

3804
02:46:21,771 --> 02:46:25,370
point without any sort of a massive blow
back.

3805
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:30,430
The blowback culturally and politically
would be so significant that I think it

3806
02:46:30,561 --> 02:46:33,170
would.
It would devastate whatever political

3807
02:46:33,171 --> 02:46:37,700
party leaned towards that because the,
the ire of the Internet would be

3808
02:46:37,701 --> 02:46:41,900
completely focused on them.
Anybody who tried to censor the Internet

3809
02:46:41,901 --> 02:46:44,150
at this point in time,
we really try to step in and say that

3810
02:46:44,151 --> 02:46:45,620
podcast like,
you know,

3811
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,010
no more,
no more saying nowhere.

3812
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:51,470
You know,
you have to figure out when you can,

3813
02:46:51,471 --> 02:46:55,160
can say certain things and how nonprofit
said it's a genie gets out of the

3814
02:46:55,161 --> 02:46:55,520
bottle.

3815
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:56,920
It's the sort of the thing with like,
uh,

3816
02:46:57,870 --> 02:47:01,070
like what was the time of the process of
like cell phone,

3817
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:03,470
regulatory,
whatever was remember cell phone bills

3818
02:47:03,471 --> 02:47:06,320
were like,
if you use them genuinely during the day

3819
02:47:06,321 --> 02:47:08,480
with any regularity,
your bill is going to be like 700,

3820
02:47:08,481 --> 02:47:11,600
$800 dollars or one point.
The words got to the point where it's

3821
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:14,530
just,
there's no more after 7:00 PM that holy,

3822
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:16,490
she's like a sham.
The whole thing which is a shampoo keep

3823
02:47:16,491 --> 02:47:18,680
like gouging people go,
this is going to become the new

3824
02:47:18,681 --> 02:47:21,480
communication and,
and they'll figure it out around self,

3825
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:23,780
what they did.
Magic Jack Shit like that,

3826
02:47:23,781 --> 02:47:26,690
you know what I mean?
Or a orange Internet calling,

3827
02:47:26,750 --> 02:47:28,370
you know,
and all that stuff comes around and it's

3828
02:47:28,371 --> 02:47:33,371
like you got to make cell phones just
like a regular bill payment that's like,

3829
02:47:33,771 --> 02:47:35,510
you know,
affordable for everybody.

3830
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:37,730
Well one,
you already have Sirius satellite radio

3831
02:47:37,731 --> 02:47:39,440
which completely uncensored in your car.

3832
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:40,640
Everybody has that.
I mean,

3833
02:47:40,641 --> 02:47:43,340
it's so common.
So many new cars come with that.

3834
02:47:43,580 --> 02:47:45,980
So what's the difference between data
and podcast?

3835
02:47:45,981 --> 02:47:46,551
Nothing.
Well,

3836
02:47:46,551 --> 02:47:48,350
podcast is getting in your cars.
They're gonna,

3837
02:47:48,590 --> 02:47:51,920
they're gonna run on four g like I
already have podcast.

3838
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:57,110
Most people do have a podcast app on my
phone and when I download something or

3839
02:47:57,111 --> 02:47:59,750
when I subscribed to something,
it automatically downloads to my phone.

3840
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:04,210
So when I'm driving around I just press
play and it goes here and we're in.

3841
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:06,950
The best thing about it is if a phone
call happens,

3842
02:48:07,010 --> 02:48:10,370
the car pauses it and then you answered
the phone call,

3843
02:48:10,371 --> 02:48:13,730
you talked to somebody and then you hang
up and then the podcast plays where you

3844
02:48:13,731 --> 02:48:15,950
left it off.
It's not like radio,

3845
02:48:15,951 --> 02:48:19,650
it's not like satellite radio.
It's better than all those things with

3846
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,710
the on demand now it's pretty good.

3847
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:22,840
It helps.
They are,

3848
02:48:22,870 --> 02:48:25,310
there should be on the Internet.
Why does it have to go up to the sky and

3849
02:48:25,311 --> 02:48:27,470
come back down the fuck you ain't go.
No,

3850
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:28,490
it doesn't.
Ultimately.

3851
02:48:28,491 --> 02:48:31,430
And the thing is like they might,
but they might,

3852
02:48:31,431 --> 02:48:34,730
uh,
like serious may jump into that world of

3853
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:37,970
they are like,
a lot of the channels are bringing

3854
02:48:37,971 --> 02:48:41,360
podcasts too serious now.
It's a good thing,

3855
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:43,070
which is a good thing.
That's a very good thing.

3856
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:44,690
It's all good.
It's all good in a way,

3857
02:48:44,691 --> 02:48:47,020
but you err on,
on open channel.

3858
02:48:47,021 --> 02:48:47,690
Right.
But it's an,

3859
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:50,090
it's an antiquated way of broadcasting
things.

3860
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:52,310
It's stupid.
It doesn't make any sense anymore.

3861
02:48:52,370 --> 02:48:54,470
It's just like that.
The time is done.

3862
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:58,360
Like that smoke signals you're saying
when the godfathers gone,

3863
02:48:58,370 --> 02:49:01,670
that's where I think when sterns done,
um,

3864
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:05,120
all this stuff will really take on.
I don't think he's going anywhere five

3865
02:49:05,121 --> 02:49:06,340
years.
He was four and a half more years.

3866
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:08,060
He'll stay.
They're

3867
02:49:08,060 --> 02:49:09,720
going to,
they're going to pay him so much fucking

3868
02:49:09,721 --> 02:49:11,070
money.
The deal actually though,

3869
02:49:11,071 --> 02:49:14,240
it's 12 year deal.
It's five.

3870
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:18,690
It might be a little off on this,
but I'm pretty sure I followed it's five

3871
02:49:18,691 --> 02:49:22,200
years on air from about six months ago
or so.

3872
02:49:22,890 --> 02:49:27,890
And then they own where they get rights
to play his entire catalog for seven

3873
02:49:29,131 --> 02:49:30,630
more years.
Oh,

3874
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:32,100
after that,
I think he's dumb.

3875
02:49:32,101 --> 02:49:34,890
He's going to be 67 years old and he's
done this one.

3876
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:37,350
It looks good though.
It was great.

3877
02:49:37,470 --> 02:49:39,920
But it means obviously still relevant
show business.

3878
02:49:40,240 --> 02:49:41,970
Otherwise you wouldn't have done
America's got talent.

3879
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:43,590
He,
he wants to be relevant.

3880
02:49:43,830 --> 02:49:44,590
Right.
Wild.

3881
02:49:44,590 --> 02:49:46,410
Why?
Why do you fly back to California all

3882
02:49:46,411 --> 02:49:48,870
the time to do that stupid show where
they actually did it in New York?

3883
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:51,050
Did they?
They moved to New York for me.

3884
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:52,163
Just shut the fuck up.

3885
02:49:52,700 --> 02:49:54,150
Um,
I just don't.

3886
02:49:54,151 --> 02:49:55,520
I just think it's a part of who he is.
I mean,

3887
02:49:55,550 --> 02:49:58,230
maybe he take some time off,
but I could see it would be fun if he

3888
02:49:58,310 --> 02:50:01,730
started fucking podcast.
Everyone said to me so much money.

3889
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:04,970
He's trying to stand behind that
argument he had with Ari so bad.

3890
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:07,290
It was so silly.
It was,

3891
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:09,720
it was the first chicken is armor I ever
saw.

3892
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:11,300
Well really,
like,

3893
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,950
just not even blindly,
uh,

3894
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:16,740
just to.
Because always my friend is just like,

3895
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,240
it was the first thing he was just kind
of wrong about like,

3896
02:50:19,290 --> 02:50:21,900
you can make a living off this,
but he's way wrong.

3897
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:24,540
I make more money from this than a lot
of other things I do.

3898
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:27,570
Yeah.
You can make more money doing podcasts

3899
02:50:27,571 --> 02:50:30,720
then you definitely can look at working
on a local radio station,

3900
02:50:30,721 --> 02:50:31,554
which is what he was.

3901
02:50:31,590 --> 02:50:32,351
Sure.
Yeah.

3902
02:50:32,351 --> 02:50:34,080
It's like,
and doing overnight shifts and the thing

3903
02:50:34,081 --> 02:50:37,860
is that is still the shitty process in
many ways for some people,

3904
02:50:37,861 --> 02:50:41,370
but if they're doing that,
but there's a difference between being a

3905
02:50:41,371 --> 02:50:44,310
radio announcer,
an entertaining podcast,

3906
02:50:44,311 --> 02:50:46,380
you know,
there's not a lot of Howard stern's,

3907
02:50:46,381 --> 02:50:47,550
you know,
it's like the difference between,

3908
02:50:47,551 --> 02:50:49,440
you know,
if you want to be an mc at a strip club.

3909
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:49,951
No,
no,

3910
02:50:49,951 --> 02:50:53,310
I don't want to be an MC to strip club.
I work as an MC district go because I

3911
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:55,480
need some time on stage.
Right.

3912
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:56,910
Then,
then you become a standup,

3913
02:50:56,911 --> 02:50:57,830
like what you want to do,
standup,

3914
02:50:57,831 --> 02:50:59,370
blah.
You got to learn how to bring up those

3915
02:50:59,371 --> 02:51:00,740
strippers and get to really know how.
No,

3916
02:51:00,750 --> 02:51:03,660
I don't have to learn how to be funny.
That's it.

3917
02:51:03,661 --> 02:51:05,100
So yeah,
I'm just trying to work out a muscle

3918
02:51:05,101 --> 02:51:05,490
here,
buddy.

3919
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:07,320
It's like this isn't.
His argument was weird.

3920
02:51:07,321 --> 02:51:12,321
Like you have to learn how to do a break
for a commercial stuff in music or any

3921
02:51:13,051 --> 02:51:14,040
of that.
By the way.

3922
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:15,600
Not only that,
like,

3923
02:51:15,640 --> 02:51:20,640
wow you to work your way up through
broadcasting and some local job like

3924
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:23,250
nobody wants to do that.
You want to work for somebody,

3925
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:26,190
why would you do that?
And this idea that like podcasts are for

3926
02:51:26,191 --> 02:51:28,140
losers.
I get he like,

3927
02:51:28,141 --> 02:51:31,770
he's probably in a negotiation with
serious at the time we saying all this

3928
02:51:31,771 --> 02:51:34,430
stuff and it's probably part of him
wants to like,

3929
02:51:34,710 --> 02:51:37,710
look,
the guy had ultimate power for so long.

3930
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:40,890
He had the ability to,
the ability to make or break careers by

3931
02:51:40,891 --> 02:51:44,580
shitting on you with no recourse.
And Ari who was one of the first guys

3932
02:51:44,581 --> 02:51:47,040
that owned him,
he owned them.

3933
02:51:47,310 --> 02:51:49,230
That video that he did and he did it
politely.

3934
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:51,570
Shit all over him on my show.
Mr Stern.

3935
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,570
And then he owned him with that video
where,

3936
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:57,030
because you know how it was trying to
say he's a nobody and then he points to

3937
02:51:57,031 --> 02:51:59,760
always get a photo of him with a
billboard on sunset boulevard.

3938
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:03,570
He's got to hit comedy central TV show.
His second comedy central special was

3939
02:52:03,571 --> 02:52:05,030
airing that we,
uh,

3940
02:52:05,350 --> 02:52:07,480
I mean it was,
it was bad timing.

3941
02:52:07,481 --> 02:52:09,640
I said he really picked the wrong mark,
but the thing is,

3942
02:52:09,641 --> 02:52:13,990
because Howard is a,
one of the things and he's he showed

3943
02:52:13,991 --> 02:52:18,250
that I think are in many ways in
America's got talent and he shows it

3944
02:52:18,251 --> 02:52:22,420
with like how he has with guests.
He has come in and when he talks about

3945
02:52:22,421 --> 02:52:25,900
on the errors and he's got like,
I don't disagree with all of it,

3946
02:52:25,901 --> 02:52:29,530
but like he's got some pretty horrible
opinions on standup comedy.

3947
02:52:29,530 --> 02:52:32,020
I mean it's just like he was,
he would not be my gauge for who to

3948
02:52:32,021 --> 02:52:35,410
watch or who to know who to listen to.
His little disconnected.

3949
02:52:35,411 --> 02:52:38,830
So he does it.
It's dumb that he doesn't know who he

3950
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:43,000
is.
Girl that's comics in the world.

3951
02:52:43,130 --> 02:52:46,930
He's one of the top 100 standup comics
in the world.

3952
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:49,300
That's just a fact.
And if you,

3953
02:52:49,301 --> 02:52:50,320
you know,
you don't agree with that,

3954
02:52:50,321 --> 02:52:51,820
it's because you're not talking to
comics.

3955
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:53,560
That's what I mean.
He's not like,

3956
02:52:53,730 --> 02:52:56,200
he knows like,
but he's not being logical.

3957
02:52:56,201 --> 02:52:58,780
It's just trying to crush him.
He's trying to crush crush art because

3958
02:52:58,781 --> 02:52:59,980
already called him.
An old man,

3959
02:52:59,981 --> 02:53:02,290
told him to suck clinics.
Eastwood's old man Dick,

3960
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:05,980
because he hated the Chris Kyle movie.
It's fucking funny,

3961
02:53:05,981 --> 02:53:06,980
man.
Like art.

3962
02:53:06,990 --> 02:53:08,860
He's a,
he's a gangster but,

3963
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:11,110
but already set them up.
He set him up.

3964
02:53:11,111 --> 02:53:13,780
He knew stern was gonna attack him,
stern attacked him and already had a

3965
02:53:13,781 --> 02:53:16,420
video response that which is measured
and polite.

3966
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:17,770
Showed,
showed it.

3967
02:53:17,771 --> 02:53:19,990
Howard had to get on Google.
He's like,

3968
02:53:19,991 --> 02:53:22,210
I don't know what you're using.
Probably Netflix navigator,

3969
02:53:22,211 --> 02:53:24,700
a lot of you old folks into the
Internet.

3970
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:27,490
Let me show you how to find my name and
see.

3971
02:53:27,491 --> 02:53:28,400
There you go.
Red.

3972
02:53:28,401 --> 02:53:30,220
She fear.
Oh look at all this stuff about me.

3973
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:32,800
Look at all this stuff.
And he owned a man.

3974
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:34,750
You know,
it's funny that people in his studio

3975
02:53:34,751 --> 02:53:37,560
knew that,
but I've talked to people that worked

3976
02:53:37,561 --> 02:53:38,351
there that were like,
eh,

3977
02:53:38,351 --> 02:53:40,570
that was like a rough horse,
you know?

3978
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:41,291
They were like,
they were like,

3979
02:53:41,291 --> 02:53:42,950
that was because they said like I was
saying,

3980
02:53:42,951 --> 02:53:43,930
I was like,
did you guys just want to like,

3981
02:53:43,931 --> 02:53:45,450
run in there and be like,
Howard,

3982
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:48,100
just like,
we just let this one go because he's got

3983
02:53:48,101 --> 02:53:51,820
comics that work for them essentially,
and they know what it is and like you

3984
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:53,020
said,
but in that thing he's the boss,

3985
02:53:53,021 --> 02:53:54,970
you know,
you got to let him do his thing and

3986
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:58,690
he just didn't know the a thing anymore.

3987
02:53:58,740 --> 02:54:02,020
He's so used to crushing people too.
He's so used to his whole career.

3988
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:05,530
He's had this ultimate power where he
could just shit all over you like you

3989
02:54:05,531 --> 02:54:10,450
did with mad cow with a lot of these
other guys and he just crushed them all.

3990
02:54:10,720 --> 02:54:13,540
Crushed them all.
But the playing field's different now,

3991
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:15,040
you know,
wildly.

3992
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:16,150
It's different.
I mean he,

3993
02:54:16,180 --> 02:54:18,340
if he comes on my podcast and shits on
Stern,

3994
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:20,470
$2,
million people are gonna hear and see

3995
02:54:20,471 --> 02:54:21,304
that.
Yeah,

3996
02:54:21,310 --> 02:54:25,210
that's a lot.
And if it then it gets a viral video on

3997
02:54:25,211 --> 02:54:28,840
youtube and then it gets on twitter and
facebook.

3998
02:54:28,841 --> 02:54:31,270
People start spreading it around back
and forth.

3999
02:54:31,450 --> 02:54:35,970
Those things will hit hundreds of
thousands of views like that and you,

4000
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:41,020
you don't have the ultimate like,
like field advantage anymore.

4001
02:54:41,710 --> 02:54:44,230
Like everybody can be a broadcaster now.
I mean,

4002
02:54:44,231 --> 02:54:45,064
what,
what did you doing?

4003
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:47,500
You're showing something broadly,
right?

4004
02:54:47,501 --> 02:54:50,530
In the loosest sense of the definition
of the word.

4005
02:54:50,770 --> 02:54:54,670
Well anybody can get on youtube and be a
broadcaster in that sense.

4006
02:54:54,671 --> 02:54:58,390
Anybody can get on a podcast and it
didn't use to be like that.

4007
02:54:58,530 --> 02:54:59,920
And he used to be.
When Howard did it,

4008
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:01,630
he would do it for.
I mean,

4009
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:04,400
look,
he wielded his power correctly.

4010
02:55:04,401 --> 02:55:07,520
He knew how to handle it and he was
dealing with a lot of competitive people

4011
02:55:07,521 --> 02:55:09,410
that we're trying to take his spot and
you know,

4012
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:11,040
he would go after them and crush them
with is,

4013
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:13,550
you know,
20 plus million at one time.

4014
02:55:13,551 --> 02:55:17,510
People listening to him every morning.
So if you had some rinky dink as radio

4015
02:55:17,511 --> 02:55:19,600
show with 100,000 people listening and
you're,

4016
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:21,630
you know,
in Philadelphia where the war,

4017
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:26,450
he could smash you.
It wasn't a damn thing you could do

4018
02:55:26,451 --> 02:55:31,400
about it and no one heard you shit on
him and no one could exchange it back

4019
02:55:31,401 --> 02:55:32,840
and forth.
There was no youtube.

4020
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:35,750
There was no way for your voice to get
viral.

4021
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:37,370
You only had the operation.

4022
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:38,990
Why that one guy said,
Julia heroed,

4023
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:39,853
everyone that,
uh,

4024
02:55:40,770 --> 02:55:44,500
he's a great guy.
Tom Bernard in Minneapolis.

4025
02:55:45,070 --> 02:55:46,800
Like,
that's the only town where like,

4026
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:49,840
he came into the challenge.
Tom Bernard's morning show in like last,

4027
02:55:49,870 --> 02:55:53,290
like star was there and going like very
quickly on thing under a year.

4028
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:55,630
I wonder what happened.
They just said if everyone's,

4029
02:55:55,930 --> 02:55:57,310
everyone's stuck by that Tom Bernard
show,

4030
02:55:57,311 --> 02:55:59,630
he still is a radio guy there.
Tom Bernard kidding?

4031
02:55:59,730 --> 02:56:02,530
Older guys.
He has like a scarface mansion in that

4032
02:56:02,531 --> 02:56:03,364
town.
He really.

4033
02:56:03,730 --> 02:56:05,020
Oh yeah man.
He's like,

4034
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:07,660
how do I not know this?
Kind of surprised.

4035
02:56:07,670 --> 02:56:07,930
Yeah,

4036
02:56:07,930 --> 02:56:09,220
that was a big thing for a while,
right?

4037
02:56:09,221 --> 02:56:13,390
Like local radio djs would be like huge
stars locally.

4038
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:14,051
He,
yeah.

4039
02:56:14,051 --> 02:56:15,140
His family is that.
They're like,

4040
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:16,810
they're,
well they're doing well.

4041
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:19,330
And then occasionally someone like Bob
and Tom,

4042
02:56:19,710 --> 02:56:22,720
they spread their empire out like all
throughout a bunch of states.

4043
02:56:22,721 --> 02:56:25,520
And I'm so happy that shows falling
apart.

4044
02:56:25,570 --> 02:56:28,270
Seems worse.
People are they bad?

4045
02:56:28,990 --> 02:56:31,690
I don't even know Bob.
He wasn't there when I was there,

4046
02:56:31,691 --> 02:56:33,640
but Tom,
they're just talking about a bunch of

4047
02:56:33,641 --> 02:56:35,590
people who are just disconnected and
hate each other.

4048
02:56:35,591 --> 02:56:37,210
Everybody in the studio hates each
other.

4049
02:56:37,360 --> 02:56:40,330
Really?
They treated me like a fucking jerk off

4050
02:56:40,331 --> 02:56:41,830
here.
They treated me bad too.

4051
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:44,620
I wanted to go.
I wanted to say shit.

4052
02:56:45,130 --> 02:56:47,920
I wanted to kind of come out to them and
say some stuff.

4053
02:56:47,921 --> 02:56:51,730
But I felt bad because I know it's like
for that club,

4054
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,140
that crackers club in Indianapolis,
that's like her promotion man,

4055
02:56:56,141 --> 02:56:57,970
that's the big deal to her.
And I like her.

4056
02:56:57,970 --> 02:57:01,330
I like ruth and a lot.
I didn't want to get her and a thing,

4057
02:57:01,331 --> 02:57:02,380
you know,
with them at all.

4058
02:57:02,381 --> 02:57:04,390
But I mean that was biting my tongue for
sure.

4059
02:57:04,391 --> 02:57:05,230
I was like,
why are you guys,

4060
02:57:05,590 --> 02:57:08,680
the guy just asked what it was like the
Harry Shearer on Wayne's world,

4061
02:57:08,681 --> 02:57:09,680
you know,
like,

4062
02:57:09,910 --> 02:57:11,880
so uh,
what do you.

4063
02:57:12,030 --> 02:57:13,680
So you do you live in New York,
Huh?

4064
02:57:13,810 --> 02:57:16,810
And they just start doing something else
and leans back to be like,

4065
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:17,673
uh Huh.
Uh Huh.

4066
02:57:18,090 --> 02:57:18,923
Uh Huh.
Okay.

4067
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:21,140
I'm just looking at his computer is
doing something else.

4068
02:57:21,141 --> 02:57:23,020
Like we're looking to cds or something.
I was like,

4069
02:57:23,140 --> 02:57:26,110
and I pointed it out at one point and
he's like,

4070
02:57:26,111 --> 02:57:27,730
what are you talking about?
Then this chick,

4071
02:57:27,731 --> 02:57:30,670
the sports guys like seems like just
disillusion.

4072
02:57:30,700 --> 02:57:33,500
They're just angry at you for some
reason for being in there at all and

4073
02:57:34,030 --> 02:57:37,090
they all should on the girl.
And then when it goes to commercial,

4074
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:40,240
like the blue angels man,
they split off and formed

4075
02:57:41,990 --> 02:57:46,630
and then the fucking chick sits in there
and talks about how shitty everybody

4076
02:57:46,631 --> 02:57:49,090
treats her and then they all come back
in and just started over again.

4077
02:57:49,091 --> 02:57:52,450
And they were mad at me because I said I
didn't want to do bits will.

4078
02:57:52,451 --> 02:57:55,480
That's what happened with me.
I said I'll,

4079
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:58,630
I'll tell you things about myself,
but I'm not doing bits.

4080
02:57:59,110 --> 02:58:00,020
Yeah man,
it's,

4081
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:02,340
I guess they just get tired of it after
awhile.

4082
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:04,951
I guess.
So man,

4083
02:58:04,951 --> 02:58:09,700
it's got the easiest fucking job ever.
That's what I said four.

4084
02:58:09,710 --> 02:58:11,190
It was with the,
with the radio show,

4085
02:58:11,191 --> 02:58:12,870
man.
I'm like me and you know,

4086
02:58:12,871 --> 02:58:14,930
even with the Legion of skanks,
but all of them like,

4087
02:58:14,931 --> 02:58:16,410
you know,
they're all things you choose.

4088
02:58:16,411 --> 02:58:20,010
Like I chose to do this thing with Dan
soder on the,

4089
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:23,270
on comedy central.
I chose to do legion of skanks with

4090
02:58:23,271 --> 02:58:24,690
those guys.
I wouldn't say we choose it,

4091
02:58:24,691 --> 02:58:25,410
so it's like,
yeah,

4092
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:26,700
it's like a thing.
You look forward to doing it.

4093
02:58:26,701 --> 02:58:29,460
It's not only that they had a super
successful radio show that brought them

4094
02:58:29,461 --> 02:58:30,780
a lot of money,
but bob and Tom,

4095
02:58:30,781 --> 02:58:33,130
when I was there were very nice.
They were very nice to me and the people

4096
02:58:33,131 --> 02:58:36,060
on there were very nice,
but one of the producers met me in the

4097
02:58:36,061 --> 02:58:37,320
fucking dressing room.

4098
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:38,460
He came into me and he goes,
okay,

4099
02:58:38,670 --> 02:58:41,190
what are the subjects you're going to
talk about and what questions do you

4100
02:58:41,191 --> 02:58:42,660
want them to ask you?
I went,

4101
02:58:42,661 --> 02:58:44,160
what?
And he's like,

4102
02:58:44,161 --> 02:58:45,660
yeah,
you have to have something prepared.

4103
02:58:45,661 --> 02:58:47,400
Like you got shitty with me.
I was like,

4104
02:58:47,401 --> 02:58:48,810
dude,
I don't give a fuck.

4105
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:50,550
Whatever you guys want to talk about,
we'll talk about.

4106
02:58:50,750 --> 02:58:51,583
I got.
I'm like,

4107
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:54,260
you're talking to the wrong guy.
Like marnee successful.

4108
02:58:54,370 --> 02:58:57,120
Like I don't have to do this.
Like I'm doing this for fun.

4109
02:58:57,380 --> 02:59:01,200
Like I'm in town.
I wanted to meet Bob and Tom on the show

4110
02:59:01,201 --> 02:59:03,330
at the crackers places almost sold out
already.

4111
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,120
This is all just for fun,
like don't get shitty with me.

4112
02:59:06,121 --> 02:59:09,090
Like it was in town for a UFC and uh,
it was,

4113
02:59:09,270 --> 02:59:10,270
it was weird.
It was,

4114
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:14,220
it was like I realized what it's like to
deal with these people that they like

4115
02:59:14,221 --> 02:59:16,560
put the clamp on you like get out there
and perform.

4116
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:19,530
You got to get out there and dance.
Like these are the subjects,

4117
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:21,800
but then you have great,
like the precedent.

4118
02:59:21,810 --> 02:59:23,790
Steve and Philadelphia.
Oh yeah.

4119
02:59:23,791 --> 02:59:25,100
Those guys are great because they're
great.

4120
02:59:25,101 --> 02:59:26,030
Yeah.
They don't have the bus.

4121
02:59:26,031 --> 02:59:28,800
You're the producer from palm and Tom.
He walked out of the room.

4122
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:31,950
It didn't tick a box walked when I said
I didn't have anything to turned around.

4123
02:59:31,980 --> 02:59:34,230
Walked away like I was a piece of shit.
I was like,

4124
02:59:34,231 --> 02:59:37,320
you guys,
this is like the worst way to set up

4125
02:59:37,710 --> 02:59:40,670
like any sort of a fun interview.
But when I got an Obama,

4126
02:59:40,690 --> 02:59:41,690
Tom are great.
Yeah,

4127
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:44,190
the other guy was great to the other guy
that was with them or the Gal or whoever

4128
02:59:44,191 --> 02:59:45,420
the fuck it was.
Kitty,

4129
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:46,680
kitty layers.
It was fun.

4130
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:48,990
They were fun.
We just had a nice conversation.

4131
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:50,070
But no,
uh,

4132
02:59:50,610 --> 02:59:51,000
that's good.

4133
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,790
I thought by that point I got there like
Bob wasn't coming in anymore.

4134
02:59:54,060 --> 02:59:55,170
Tom Seemed pissed.
I was like,

4135
02:59:55,350 --> 02:59:58,920
it was falling apart.
Fucking guys don't get along after

4136
02:59:58,921 --> 03:00:00,420
awhile too.
That's part of the problem,

4137
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:02,460
you know?
Sometimes like a fucking.

4138
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:04,430
Tom's getting all those gundam
attention.

4139
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:10,170
It was the market Brian thing.
Those guys seem to get along.

4140
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:11,440
Do they ever just fall apart?
They just

4141
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:14,820
don't remember.
They were La guys,

4142
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:17,970
Howard attack them too.
Didn't hold a mock funeral for them.

4143
03:00:18,190 --> 03:00:21,270
Yeah,
and that John Debella and Philadelphia,

4144
03:00:21,271 --> 03:00:23,240
that was a great one and I got to awful.
He,

4145
03:00:23,250 --> 03:00:24,750
ah,
he won't let me on the show anymore

4146
03:00:24,751 --> 03:00:27,840
because I said I won't give them bits.
Same thing really.

4147
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:30,570
I'm like,
why do you have an opportunity and don't

4148
03:00:30,571 --> 03:00:33,380
want to just have a genuine fucking
conversation with somebody.

4149
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:34,650
Why do you want to send me up?
Like,

4150
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,210
what are you,
Byron Allen,

4151
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:39,090
people want to hear shark attacks.
What's the deal with that?

4152
03:00:39,091 --> 03:00:41,550
Huh?
And then he turns and starts reading car

4153
03:00:41,590 --> 03:00:45,600
magazines,
the mustache wax.

4154
03:00:45,601 --> 03:00:47,910
And that's how it used to be though.
Before the Internet,

4155
03:00:47,911 --> 03:00:51,960
people used to go on these radio shows
and they expected you to do standup bits

4156
03:00:52,230 --> 03:00:55,170
and a lot of guys would just
automatically start plugging their bits.

4157
03:00:55,171 --> 03:00:59,500
I remember like one of the first times
Marin was on opiod anthony.

4158
03:00:59,530 --> 03:01:00,190
He was like doing

4159
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:02,200
bits,
like that's what people used to do.

4160
03:01:02,201 --> 03:01:03,640
I remember listening to that going,
Oh yeah,

4161
03:01:03,641 --> 03:01:06,430
that's how people do it and go on these
shows and they do bits.

4162
03:01:06,970 --> 03:01:08,740
That's no fun.
It's weird.

4163
03:01:09,370 --> 03:01:11,490
By the way.
I see the same exact thing I said to you

4164
03:01:11,491 --> 03:01:13,750
in that you said to them in that room
where I was like,

4165
03:01:14,230 --> 03:01:16,410
just whatever they're talking about,
we're talking about.

4166
03:01:16,720 --> 03:01:18,640
They're talking about news.
I was jumping into the news talk.

4167
03:01:18,641 --> 03:01:21,450
We're talking about local sports was
just,

4168
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,740
we'll figure it out man.
Which just go,

4169
03:01:24,970 --> 03:01:28,720
that's a worst way ever to here.
Stand up to in like a fake Byron Allen

4170
03:01:28,721 --> 03:01:30,250
style conversation.
Yeah.

4171
03:01:30,251 --> 03:01:31,300
We were just like,
you know,

4172
03:01:31,360 --> 03:01:33,640
for people in the room,
laughing at it,

4173
03:01:33,641 --> 03:01:38,050
sort of and knowing what's coming and
they and they uh,

4174
03:01:38,230 --> 03:01:41,740
like to,
to really rub salt in the wound when I

4175
03:01:41,741 --> 03:01:44,830
was on the show,
every time they went or came back from a

4176
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:47,050
commercial,
they would just play someone like doing

4177
03:01:47,051 --> 03:01:48,810
a bit in studio.

4178
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:54,160
It was like just road hack horseshit and
then they would all,

4179
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:59,280
you'd hear them in the audio laughing
from the time it was live and laughing

4180
03:01:59,621 --> 03:02:01,810
now who can edit in the studio with the
same kind of like,

4181
03:02:01,811 --> 03:02:03,160
you know,
just referenced.

4182
03:02:03,161 --> 03:02:07,120
Just slapping the table and say,
did this to fuck with you?

4183
03:02:07,121 --> 03:02:08,490
You think?
I don't know if that was to.

4184
03:02:08,830 --> 03:02:11,880
Maybe it's what they do,
but I mean like it's pretty awful when

4185
03:02:11,950 --> 03:02:14,440
they're just playing people's.
I mean real like,

4186
03:02:14,441 --> 03:02:15,430
you know.
Yeah.

4187
03:02:15,880 --> 03:02:18,670
My kids don't listen to me,
you know,

4188
03:02:18,690 --> 03:02:21,540
they're all like a whatever,
like the hook line and you know,

4189
03:02:21,550 --> 03:02:24,100
whatever.
Like the get her done is of that comic.

4190
03:02:24,820 --> 03:02:28,510
Like they all say the.
Were they good or does everyone in the

4191
03:02:28,511 --> 03:02:30,190
room says it?
Well,

4192
03:02:30,191 --> 03:02:33,820
I think wrec radio is,
it's like every,

4193
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:35,640
everything else,
there's people that are really good at

4194
03:02:35,641 --> 03:02:35,680
it.

4195
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:36,580
Like Preston,
Steve,

4196
03:02:36,581 --> 03:02:40,240
they're actually fun to fund shell and
then there's people that just,

4197
03:02:40,241 --> 03:02:42,970
for whatever reason,
that combination they put together as

4198
03:02:42,971 --> 03:02:45,310
far as the team just was toxic.
It didn't work.

4199
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:49,640
If you were at Stanford and sons in
Kansas City that's not,

4200
03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:53,950
no one wants you to do like seven radio
shows and it's always like they want you

4201
03:02:53,951 --> 03:02:57,100
to do bits and you're like,
we have this argument every fucking time

4202
03:02:57,101 --> 03:02:57,950
I come here,
man.

4203
03:02:58,540 --> 03:03:00,670
Go Talk.
Yeah.

4204
03:03:00,671 --> 03:03:03,040
Well,
pressure to give to you.

4205
03:03:03,100 --> 03:03:03,940
To have to do,
I think,

4206
03:03:04,470 --> 03:03:06,340
I think they realized they think it's
gonna make you more comfortable.

4207
03:03:06,341 --> 03:03:09,430
It makes me so uncomfortable with the
concept of even trying to do that.

4208
03:03:09,490 --> 03:03:11,680
I don't think that's what it is at all.
I think they're lazy.

4209
03:03:12,010 --> 03:03:14,560
I think they don't want to have to make
something entertaining with you.

4210
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:16,850
They'd just rather you plug in and just
start doing your bets.

4211
03:03:16,930 --> 03:03:18,880
Just give us content.
I mean like you saying.

4212
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:19,820
So you're from New York,
Huh?

4213
03:03:20,470 --> 03:03:22,720
Yeah,
I mean that kind of thing.

4214
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:25,810
That's like someone that's lazy,
that's not someone who's trying to do

4215
03:03:25,811 --> 03:03:29,410
the best possible show they can do and
too jaded to realize they're being like

4216
03:03:29,411 --> 03:03:31,810
mega rude to somebody just came in and
you're like,

4217
03:03:31,811 --> 03:03:33,850
hey fucker,
it's five in the morning for me too.

4218
03:03:33,910 --> 03:03:35,940
Well they know that no one can see them.
Yeah.

4219
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:38,560
So because no one could see them,
they can just totally disengage and let

4220
03:03:38,561 --> 03:03:41,060
you just go ahead and dance monkey
because that's,

4221
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:44,350
that's kind of interesting thing too
about a podcast that was so many of them

4222
03:03:44,351 --> 03:03:48,190
being video.
Like you're also held accountable for

4223
03:03:48,400 --> 03:03:49,940
paying attention.
Oh fuck yeah,

4224
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:52,570
and you could see like weird faces that
people make,

4225
03:03:52,870 --> 03:03:54,340
you know,
like if someone says something I was,

4226
03:03:54,400 --> 03:03:58,500
I don't think he did it,
you know,

4227
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:01,220
you could get away with a lot more.

4228
03:04:01,220 --> 03:04:02,960
There's a lot more things where it's
like,

4229
03:04:02,961 --> 03:04:05,030
Hey,
that joke you guys made that black dude

4230
03:04:05,031 --> 03:04:08,670
in the back didn't seem too impressed by
that was I went home.

4231
03:04:09,140 --> 03:04:10,370
Yeah.
I don't know.

4232
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:11,930
I'm,
I'm a big fan of podcasts.

4233
03:04:12,010 --> 03:04:14,590
I just think it's the best art form ever
for standup.

4234
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:17,540
It's a great thing that that's happened
for staying in particularly in that.

4235
03:04:17,750 --> 03:04:20,670
And those are the ones that rise.
I mean there's obviously other ones too

4236
03:04:20,671 --> 03:04:24,140
that rise to the top,
but like to Howard's point,

4237
03:04:24,141 --> 03:04:27,470
Howard Stern's point,
it's like of course like every shithead

4238
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:32,420
15 year old can just do it.
But like the reality is it's gonna.

4239
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,470
It's gonna be like,
you know,

4240
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:37,430
professional well done,
like entertaining but,

4241
03:04:37,431 --> 03:04:39,680
but you don't have to be famous and it
can be like,

4242
03:04:39,770 --> 03:04:42,600
look at those girls that make that
podcast guys we fucked.

4243
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:44,270
They are always in the top 10.

4244
03:04:44,350 --> 03:04:46,040
Yup.
They're always in the top 10 and no one

4245
03:04:46,041 --> 03:04:47,750
knew who they were before that.
I mean,

4246
03:04:47,751 --> 03:04:49,120
or at least weren't.
They weren't white.

4247
03:04:49,130 --> 03:04:50,680
They were still like,
like,

4248
03:04:50,730 --> 03:04:53,580
uh,
I mean like in the business and like

4249
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:56,030
lower level comics,
just like their time in.

4250
03:04:56,060 --> 03:04:57,630
They sold out the main room at the
comedy store.

4251
03:04:57,631 --> 03:04:59,780
I don't know what I'm saying.
It's from their podcast.

4252
03:04:59,810 --> 03:05:02,210
So it's pretty impressive.
It's very impressive.

4253
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:04,520
The I,
the idea that that would be for losers.

4254
03:05:04,970 --> 03:05:07,040
That's crazy.
I mean they've made it,

4255
03:05:07,041 --> 03:05:09,890
like I said it,
it jumped their level on,

4256
03:05:09,970 --> 03:05:12,590
that's what I'm saying on their standup.
They're just the years and stand up

4257
03:05:12,591 --> 03:05:14,870
through the years and to sell out a
room.

4258
03:05:15,380 --> 03:05:16,700
Don't you think there was a guy like
Howard,

4259
03:05:16,701 --> 03:05:19,160
he's so famous,
so rich and so successful.

4260
03:05:19,161 --> 03:05:24,161
It's probably got to be like so hard to
just hang with people so hard to just go

4261
03:05:24,501 --> 03:05:25,310
somewhere and hang.

4262
03:05:25,310 --> 03:05:27,020
Well,
he's just accepted like old,

4263
03:05:27,250 --> 03:05:29,300
you know,
whatever the quote unquote old Hollywood

4264
03:05:29,301 --> 03:05:30,170
to him is now.
So,

4265
03:05:30,390 --> 03:05:31,223
you know,
it's like,

4266
03:05:31,490 --> 03:05:34,520
it's like Hampton's hangouts with like
Jimmy Kimmel and Seinfeld.

4267
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:35,780
Do you know what I mean?
Like,

4268
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:39,650
it's like that's his world now,
which if you're going to have a group of

4269
03:05:39,651 --> 03:05:42,530
buddies to fucking awesome group of
buddies.

4270
03:05:42,590 --> 03:05:43,460
Sure.
No,

4271
03:05:43,470 --> 03:05:44,081
no,
without a doubt.

4272
03:05:44,081 --> 03:05:46,780
I think as people he hangs out with his,
like he does like,

4273
03:05:47,030 --> 03:05:47,863
you know,
uh,

4274
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:49,880
are a fun group,
but he's gone that route.

4275
03:05:50,180 --> 03:05:53,690
It used to be like,
I'm with you people,

4276
03:05:54,290 --> 03:05:55,010
you know,
we're,

4277
03:05:55,010 --> 03:05:59,060
we're fucking raging against the Johnny
Carson's and the whatever else,

4278
03:05:59,061 --> 03:06:00,240
you know.
Yeah.

4279
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:01,840
And uh,
or just like,

4280
03:06:01,970 --> 03:06:03,800
you know,
the upper echelons celebrities were.

4281
03:06:03,801 --> 03:06:05,450
Now it's like,
I mean,

4282
03:06:05,451 --> 03:06:07,610
he interviews like that drives already
lang,

4283
03:06:07,611 --> 03:06:11,730
that's I think is because stern
interviews people they actively worked

4284
03:06:11,731 --> 03:06:13,100
to like shit on years ago.

4285
03:06:13,530 --> 03:06:14,300
Mm.
You know what I mean?

4286
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:16,370
The Rosie O'Donnell's,
the Kathy Lee Gifford,

4287
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:19,730
these people who it's like,
he's like friendly with now because you

4288
03:06:19,731 --> 03:06:20,660
know,
well,

4289
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:25,680
he's changed to way more liberal and way
more openminded and way more relaxed and

4290
03:06:25,911 --> 03:06:27,620
way more politically correct.
Sure.

4291
03:06:27,660 --> 03:06:32,330
You did mature and there's no need for
him to be extravagant to get attention

4292
03:06:32,331 --> 03:06:33,760
or to be outrageous.
No,

4293
03:06:33,770 --> 03:06:34,660
he doesn't really have like,
there's,

4294
03:06:34,730 --> 03:06:38,330
there's rarely nudity on that show
anymore and it used to be a lot of times

4295
03:06:38,331 --> 03:06:42,540
like stripper involvement and,
and when that Howard TV first kind of

4296
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:43,910
came out,
the uncensored one,

4297
03:06:43,911 --> 03:06:46,730
there was a lot of like filthy shit on
the show and then it just kinda all went

4298
03:06:46,731 --> 03:06:48,260
away.
The bummer for me it was opie and

4299
03:06:48,261 --> 03:06:49,850
Anthony.
That was a bummer.

4300
03:06:50,090 --> 03:06:53,180
That was a real bummer.
But they split ways that really bothered

4301
03:06:53,181 --> 03:06:55,380
me.
Or did they find out physically didn't

4302
03:06:55,381 --> 03:06:56,880
like each other for years before that?

4303
03:06:57,170 --> 03:06:58,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

4304
03:06:58,100 --> 03:07:01,900
But I thought they'd worked it out.
I thought they had like a little riff

4305
03:07:01,930 --> 03:07:05,440
but worked it out.
But when the show went on without him,

4306
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:08,200
like I'm happy because I love Jimmy.
Sure,

4307
03:07:08,250 --> 03:07:09,430
you know,
and love hanging with them,

4308
03:07:10,090 --> 03:07:13,990
but it just always opie and Anthony and
Jimmy,

4309
03:07:13,991 --> 03:07:15,110
you know,
it's like that.

4310
03:07:15,270 --> 03:07:19,020
That trio was what were the magic was,
you know,

4311
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:22,330
they had,
they had a really good show and I had

4312
03:07:22,331 --> 03:07:27,331
some fucking fun times on that show over
the years when we did the baby bird was

4313
03:07:28,061 --> 03:07:32,520
me for a rec.
Fear and uh,

4314
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:33,800
who else?
Well,

4315
03:07:33,810 --> 03:07:37,330
an opiod,
anthony and Jimmy and some dude threw up

4316
03:07:37,331 --> 03:07:40,050
in some dude's mouth.
They did a,

4317
03:07:40,290 --> 03:07:45,290
a fucking eggnog eating contest and I'm
pat from when he drank,

4318
03:07:46,120 --> 03:07:48,620
he won.
He wins every year when they're not only

4319
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,810
diabetes.
So this guy had diabetes and he's

4320
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:55,300
drinking eggnog and I'm not just talking
about drinking some Eggnog,

4321
03:07:55,870 --> 03:07:57,880
drank quarts of Eggnog.

4322
03:07:58,030 --> 03:08:01,720
And then we were trying to figure out a
way to make it more disgusting way threw

4323
03:08:01,721 --> 03:08:03,550
up.
And there's this kid named Pat Duffy who

4324
03:08:03,551 --> 03:08:07,210
was an intern and he'll do anything.
He ate dog shit.

4325
03:08:07,211 --> 03:08:09,150
He brushed his teeth with dog shit.
He's a,

4326
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:11,810
he,
he ate throw up and cheerios and he

4327
03:08:12,080 --> 03:08:14,170
said,
how about if he leans his head over the

4328
03:08:14,171 --> 03:08:18,160
garbage can and pat throws up in his
mouth and he says,

4329
03:08:18,161 --> 03:08:18,994
okay,
I'm in.

4330
03:08:19,310 --> 03:08:20,620
Who named it?
The baby bird.

4331
03:08:20,621 --> 03:08:22,000
I don't remember who named it the baby
bird.

4332
03:08:22,270 --> 03:08:23,590
I want to say it was red.
It might've been.

4333
03:08:23,830 --> 03:08:26,500
I might've been burned put.
So there's Pat.

4334
03:08:26,710 --> 03:08:28,270
Enormous man.
Huge.

4335
03:08:28,271 --> 03:08:33,271
Remember diabetes drinking sugar,
sugary milk and drinking like a record

4336
03:08:33,731 --> 03:08:35,860
number of it.
So he's up to like,

4337
03:08:36,160 --> 03:08:38,980
I dunno like 70 cops of this stuff and
then he throws up,

4338
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:42,040
but no,
not keep watching because it keeps

4339
03:08:42,041 --> 03:08:43,090
going.
The number,

4340
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:47,020
the amount of throw up is insane because
it becomes cartoonish because it keeps

4341
03:08:47,021 --> 03:08:47,920
coming.
Look at that.

4342
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:52,040
Hey guys never break and he's got his
arms crossed.

4343
03:08:52,880 --> 03:08:55,970
He's filming it on a flip phone and the
right hand corner.

4344
03:08:57,500 --> 03:08:58,460
We'll get it.
Keeps going.

4345
03:08:58,461 --> 03:08:59,450
Look,
he just keeps going.

4346
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:02,860
Jesus.
This

4347
03:09:06,570 --> 03:09:11,570
is one of the funniest fucking videos
I've ever seen in my life.

4348
03:09:13,810 --> 03:09:15,770
It keeps going.
It's insane.

4349
03:09:16,220 --> 03:09:20,030
The sheer volume that this sheer volume
look.

4350
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:23,090
I mean there's garbage bags all over the
ground.

4351
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:26,510
Look at it again.
It didn't make any sense.

4352
03:09:26,660 --> 03:09:29,750
It's like the sheer volume was almost
impossible.

4353
03:09:29,751 --> 03:09:33,830
It seemed like it was photo shopped,
but we were there seeing that live.

4354
03:09:33,831 --> 03:09:35,330
I was going to say it has to be like a
really.

4355
03:09:35,590 --> 03:09:39,790
It was favorite ops and the memories
always just going to be that I get.

4356
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:41,360
I didn't even have too much of a part in
it.

4357
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:42,503
Look at his face.

4358
03:09:43,190 --> 03:09:44,150
That's covered.
Covered.

4359
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:45,800
It's insane.
I didn't have a big part in it,

4360
03:09:45,801 --> 03:09:48,410
but it's always kind of cool that it's
such a memorable moment.

4361
03:09:48,411 --> 03:09:53,411
Is the patrice laughing at Norton trying
to talk a Bobo's bone or up and down and

4362
03:09:55,631 --> 03:09:58,450
he does it and it was patrice.
It's like a famous clip and patrice just

4363
03:09:58,470 --> 03:10:02,920
cackling at this happening.
It just happened to be there for the

4364
03:10:04,150 --> 03:10:06,670
loan or up and down.
He's got him excited.

4365
03:10:06,671 --> 03:10:07,421
He would just,
yeah,

4366
03:10:07,421 --> 03:10:09,460
he would just talk sexual shit to him
and,

4367
03:10:09,660 --> 03:10:12,700
and he'd sit there with his pants down.
He would get a boner and then no one

4368
03:10:12,710 --> 03:10:15,730
will just start talking to him about
something else and then it went up and

4369
03:10:15,731 --> 03:10:19,930
down like two or three times.
Jimmy's a national treasure really is,

4370
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:22,030
he's,
he's an interesting guy because he's

4371
03:10:22,031 --> 03:10:26,290
like one of the first,
like really open freaks out in the

4372
03:10:26,291 --> 03:10:27,124
public guy.

4373
03:10:27,390 --> 03:10:29,490
Like an open freak,
you know,

4374
03:10:29,491 --> 03:10:31,280
like someone will bring up a tranny,
like wow,

4375
03:10:31,390 --> 03:10:32,710
that must've been like,
get excited.

4376
03:10:33,070 --> 03:10:33,940
You know,
like he'll,

4377
03:10:33,941 --> 03:10:37,450
he'll start talking about sucking a
guy's dank or you know,

4378
03:10:37,451 --> 03:10:41,020
being with a tranny and it's just,
he's so open about what he did.

4379
03:10:41,021 --> 03:10:46,021
Was He shows though too,
is that like if you own shit,

4380
03:10:46,330 --> 03:10:48,610
even if it's like this,
but even if you own it any way,

4381
03:10:48,611 --> 03:10:52,120
if you go this is what I'm really into
or if you just like Kinda go like the

4382
03:10:52,121 --> 03:10:54,000
distance to be funny.
Yeah.

4383
03:10:54,190 --> 03:10:57,390
The world really does like forgive and
forget that even forgives,

4384
03:10:57,400 --> 03:10:58,780
not necessary.
Always put like,

4385
03:10:58,810 --> 03:11:02,020
and forgets right away.
Like I've never fro the thing me and

4386
03:11:02,021 --> 03:11:04,870
Lewis to,
to promote skanks one time they were

4387
03:11:04,871 --> 03:11:07,600
doing Kumi network was doing the,
what do you call that kind of

4388
03:11:07,601 --> 03:11:10,660
advertising for the other shows like
just the bottom corner of the screen.

4389
03:11:11,290 --> 03:11:12,160
It'll be like,
you know,

4390
03:11:12,610 --> 03:11:15,100
you want to kind of make fun of that.
So with all the podcasts we're doing

4391
03:11:15,101 --> 03:11:16,960
like a little like thing that happened
in the corner,

4392
03:11:17,410 --> 03:11:21,130
bottom corner of the screen and we
surprised dave because Dave's the most

4393
03:11:21,131 --> 03:11:21,964
like,
you know,

4394
03:11:22,300 --> 03:11:25,210
homophobic the wrong word,
but he's the most like least likely to

4395
03:11:25,211 --> 03:11:29,800
joke around gay,
like doing stuff at me and Louis just

4396
03:11:29,801 --> 03:11:34,720
said like it'll wig Dave Ellis just make
out when we were just taking like we're

4397
03:11:34,721 --> 03:11:38,200
just taking a picture together,
like a family photo and then me and you

4398
03:11:38,201 --> 03:11:42,040
just start over him just start going at
it hard and sure as shit man,

4399
03:11:42,041 --> 03:11:43,200
we did it.
We went for it.

4400
03:11:43,201 --> 03:11:44,350
Tongues and everything.
Yeah,

4401
03:11:44,351 --> 03:11:46,030
it was gross.
It was hardcore,

4402
03:11:46,031 --> 03:11:49,240
it was gross.
Neither of us enjoyed it but we just did

4403
03:11:49,241 --> 03:11:50,140
it for the law.
You know what I mean?

4404
03:11:50,140 --> 03:11:52,750
We got to laugh but I've never been
like,

4405
03:11:53,080 --> 03:11:55,240
no one's ever.
There's never been any backlash for that

4406
03:11:55,241 --> 03:11:56,620
in any way because we just kinda like,
yeah.

4407
03:11:56,621 --> 03:12:00,430
It's like,
well how could you get back loss

4408
03:12:00,431 --> 03:12:03,010
backlash is for people that are trying
to hide that kind of behavior.

4409
03:12:03,160 --> 03:12:04,840
It's not for people who are just open
about it.

4410
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:09,930
When they get busted on is like pretend
to be one thing like Jerry Falwell

4411
03:12:10,660 --> 03:12:12,670
busted,
but say there was no one that had like a

4412
03:12:12,700 --> 03:12:14,800
like,
I'm not going to be a fan of yours after

4413
03:12:14,801 --> 03:12:16,420
that kind of shit.
Like I guess a fan,

4414
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:18,970
you'd probably just never heard of them
because there's so many.

4415
03:12:20,170 --> 03:12:21,640
Yeah,
I mean more people just kinda like.

4416
03:12:21,641 --> 03:12:23,800
It's fucking hilarious.
You'll lose one.

4417
03:12:23,801 --> 03:12:25,540
You gain 10.
Like it was a fuck.

4418
03:12:25,630 --> 03:12:26,840
This is it right here.
Yeah.

4419
03:12:27,820 --> 03:12:28,810
We'll end with this.

4420
03:12:35,020 --> 03:12:39,790
But you guys keep going.
Grab my tits.

4421
03:12:39,791 --> 03:12:40,820
They got too weird.

4422
03:12:41,950 --> 03:12:45,190

4423
03:12:45,330 --> 03:12:46,270
