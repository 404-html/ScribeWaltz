1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,970
Through me doing stand up.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,460
Gene Simmons came to see me do stand up
at new years and a in La and then his

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:05,940
son,

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,400
uh,

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,670
like listened to one
of my cds and liked it.

6
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,290
So you drag the whole family out.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,010
Oh Wow.

8
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,480
I've never been starstruck before.

9
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,470
A show where I was like,

10
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,380
I felt weird about to go on stage.

11
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,031
I'm going to go,

12
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,070
I'm about to go on stage.

13
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,761
I couldn't,

14
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,930
it wasn't a normal show,

15
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,920
it just couldn't be a normal show.

16
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,380
It was just too weird to
me when I was a little kid.

17
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,011
Like I was little,

18
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,860
like seven or eight years old
or whatever the fuck it was.

19
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,580
I guess I was probably like 11 when,

20
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:27,880
when,

21
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,890
when kiss was big.

22
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,113
Um,

23
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,710
I remember like thinking they were the
greatest thing in the history of the

24
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,544
world,

25
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,121
you know,

26
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,490
like this is the greatest
band of all time.

27
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,390
Like I was a huge,

28
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,224
huge kiss fan.

29
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,400
So to like to be standing there as a
grown man and he's a grown man and,

30
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,960
and we're at my show.

31
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,231
I'm like,

32
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,910
that's just too fucking weird.

33
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,500
It's just too much for me.

34
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,283
I had to address it.

35
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,770
How to address,

36
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,460
I has shifted my whole act around

37
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,590
address it cause I have
something that whole

38
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,081
music thing.

39
00:00:59,081 --> 00:00:59,240
No,

40
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,520
I don't see Tim is chuck.

41
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,620
Luckily I didn't write,

42
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,653
uh,

43
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,000
there are some people there
like some young girls who,

44
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,403
who uh,

45
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,660
who would be more
starstruck by Gene Simmons,

46
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:11,494
his son.

47
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,460
She saw the two of them walking down
the street or some young in general.

48
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,290
Well he's a reality star.

49
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:17,960
Yeah.

50
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,880
He's a handsome devil.

51
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,840
Very tall.

52
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,070
The whole family is very tall.

53
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,591
When they were hugging me,

54
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:24,610
I felt like their child,

55
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,923
uh,

56
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,430
all of them is following
them around for Valerie show.

57
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,751
No,

58
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,584
it was legit.

59
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,790
It was just regular shell.

60
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,650
Did you know there's an abandoned zoo
and a la and the Griffith Park and London

61
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:36,980
zoo?

62
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,240
Yeah,

63
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,050
it closed in the 1960s.

64
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,290
It,

65
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,360
when was the first zoo in Los Angeles?

66
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:41,710
I,

67
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,540
they closed it down because
it was so fucking small.

68
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,410
And so they raised money for
the current zoo and so they,

69
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,950
it was like a mile down the street.

70
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,060
And so now I found out the other day
that you can actually go to this zoo.

71
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,890
It's still there and
they've gone through it.

72
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,101
Yeah,

73
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,510
they filmed the movie anchorman.

74
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,890
There's a scene in it from that movie.

75
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,430
So anyways,

76
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,430
you go through like this weird trail
and he'd go through this parking lot and

77
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,290
then you end up in this
zoo and it looks like,

78
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:03,501
you know,

79
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:04,750
like this is where the Tigers,

80
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,400
where this is where the elephants were.

81
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,410
And then there's like all these cages
where they used to be like gorillas and

82
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,244
stuff like that.

83
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,210
And what's so cool?

84
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,470
It's fucking creepy.

85
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:12,980
Like,

86
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,390
like it's been grown over,

87
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,070
like there's plants and
stuff like that and it,

88
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,160
half of the shits like still standing
how they're half is like crumbling.

89
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,060
Uh,

90
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,050
but people hang out there and like we'll
put bring blankets and there was like,

91
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,500
like people playing the
doors and one of the cells.

92
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,950
So you're just walking down
the here with Jim Morrison,

93
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,500
just kind of echoing through lessons.

94
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,250
A little fantastical.

95
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,581
I mean,

96
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:36,530
I live really close to
there and it's not like,

97
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,460
it's not that like,

98
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,101
it's just,

99
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:42,400
it's a field like right when you
drive in it off Riverside there,

100
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,940
right.

101
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,230
It's just a pass,

102
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,580
like the merry go round thing and there's
a big field and then some old cages.

103
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,870
You're freaking me out man.

104
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,700
And then,

105
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,450
and then we know about these doors.

106
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,760
Did you make of the old
house and talk to us?

107
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,070
He told us to go when it turns out he's

108
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,300
been dead for five

109
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,173
c we climbed,

110
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,350
we're in the animals walk up
and down or through the back,

111
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:08,741
you know?

112
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,880
And there was like people,

113
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:11,870
graffiti artists like really awesome.

114
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,040
Like oh you saw this?

115
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,420
Yeah.

116
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,530
Oh,

117
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:13,940
okay.

118
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,950
And behind that,

119
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,480
behind the there was like,

120
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:16,631
you know,

121
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,450
like a big drawing of like a gorilla face
screaming behind this badge of someone

122
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,880
that just club you over the head.

123
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,720
And the next thing you know,

124
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
taking your ass.

125
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,540
That was in the dream when I thought it
was the creepiest though it was mostly

126
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,540
women and girls like
just hanging out there.

127
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,241
I never,

128
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:36,911
stuff like that.

129
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,550
So it's a hangout people hang out at,

130
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,730
it's like a park on that,

131
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,740
but it was at night during the day.

132
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,570
So it's a former zoo that you could
walk through it and anybody can walk.

133
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:45,780
Yeah.

134
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,370
And it closed.

135
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,470
And then in the 60s and
then you can really explore,

136
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,360
there's a lot of trails you can find
like old things that like you can't,

137
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,640
it would be really cool to
see the blueprint and like,

138
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,031
oh all right,

139
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:56,110
this is where this used to be.

140
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,200
This word is cause there's a,

141
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,240
it's like a ghost town.

142
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,410
It's creepy as fuck.

143
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,670
I was working on most of it.

144
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,600
But it sounds,

145
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,490
what you're saying is yeah,

146
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,440
I was working for a private
investigator once and um,

147
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,020
I used to have to do a lot of drive and
forum and we were out in the middle of

148
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,860
fucking nowhere,

149
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,461
like way,

150
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,241
way far away.

151
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,990
And it was driving back home and I was
bored and I don't remember the town,

152
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,270
but it was a town in the
middle of fucking nowhere.

153
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:23,110
And I saw a sign that said the zoo
for whatever the fuck this town was.

154
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,621
I mean,

155
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

156
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,570
So I pull in and I go,

157
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,050
okay,

158
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,520
let's see what this
fucking zoos all about.

159
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,720
So I go there,

160
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,510
there's a tiger that is
in like a swimming pool.

161
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,351
I mean,

162
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:37,351
this fucking has nowhere to move and it
keeps pacing back and forth and back and

163
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,650
forth.

164
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,820
And that's as far as I got.

165
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,821
I got to that thing and I was just so
freaked out by the obvious madness that I

166
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,550
was seeing that they had taken
some animal and put it in wood.

167
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:52,450
It's really like a swimming pool and
this fucking thing is just going back and

168
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:53,830
forth and back and forth,

169
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,240
and there's no room for him.

170
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,910
A swimming pool on its side.

171
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,920
When I say a swimming pool,

172
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,290
it's like the size of a
swimming pool and it's cement.

173
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,531
I mean,

174
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,820
it's just this weird fucking thing
that this poor creature is stuck in.

175
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,220
He's pacing back and
forth and I'm watching it.

176
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,491
I'm like,

177
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,020
this is madness.

178
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,380
Like there's some like really tiny ass
zoos and some places for little fucking

179
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:17,590
animals are just,

180
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,453
you know,

181
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,750
even if you go to a nicest,

182
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
who though does that
not ever freak you out?

183
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,741
I can't,

184
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't like that feeling
of looking at these.

185
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,850
I mean it's cool that
we could see them all.

186
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,940
I mean I was spoiled educational.

187
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,400
I grew up one by one of the best zoos
and probably some people consider it the

188
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,540
whole country or whatever.

189
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:34,721
Yeah,

190
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,900
the Columbus Zoo where Jack hand
is frowning and all that stuff.

191
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,781
So ours do,

192
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,840
it was a little bit cooler they had,

193
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,831
cause it's Ohio,

194
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,130
they had like farm land,

195
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,790
you know,

196
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,730
where it was just like this elephant
was in like its own like woods.

197
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,370
Like it was like it didn't look like a k.

198
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,711
There was just,

199
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:50,920
you know,

200
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
big huge exhibits.

201
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,830
Do you think it bothers them though?

202
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:54,270
Okay.

203
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,980
It's take it,

204
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,040
if it gets big enough then it's okay.

205
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,430
Is that the justification?

206
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,681
I think.

207
00:05:58,681 --> 00:05:59,391
I think like,

208
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,280
do you know you,

209
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,730
you know that you're on,

210
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,380
you know where you're at right now.

211
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:03,650
You know,

212
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,350
if you grew up on an island like
Hawaii or something like that,

213
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,490
I mean that's a way bigger.

214
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,450
But you know,

215
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,200
elephants,

216
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,090
they just want a big thing of grass.

217
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,980
I don't think they care like to go hiking.

218
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Are you saying that
elephants are in Hawaii?

219
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,453
I'm so

220
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,500
[inaudible] equation,

221
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,470
I'm talking about like if animals
have enough space so they have like,

222
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,860
you know,

223
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,660
football fields.

224
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,493
I agree.

225
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,880
The San Diego.

226
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,151
Yeah,

227
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,220
San Diego Wild Animal Park is pretty dope.

228
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,610
And like the one animals that
definitely seem happy or the giraffes,

229
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,070
they're just kind of like chilling
and eating and wandering around.

230
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,020
And there's like no
one there to jack them,

231
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,710
you know,

232
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,543
which is,

233
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,630
if you're like [inaudible] or an antelope
or a fucking giraffe or anything,

234
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,310
you're always thinking something's
going to Jack you eventually.

235
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,350
You know,

236
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,610
you ever see the videos of,

237
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:45,911
um,

238
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:50,911
of them taking down giraffes of lions
taken down giraffes cause a bunch of them

239
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,370
on that line is,

240
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,590
it's crazy.

241
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,611
It's crazy.

242
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:55,300
One of them,

243
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,300
there's a lion and a n two lionesses
and they take down this giraffe in the

244
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,660
middle of a street.

245
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,720
And these people are filming
this from their fucking car.

246
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,560
They're inside their car and they're
filming it through the windshield.

247
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:12,580
And this fucking lion takes down
this giraffe right in front of them.

248
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,130
It's why I'll dude,

249
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,010
so fucking primal.

250
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,541
Oh,

251
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,720
you're right there and this thing,

252
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,140
it's just,

253
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,973
Ooh,

254
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,540
a shirt is so bad ass.

255
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:22,731
Yeah.

256
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:24,270
I got a bird crusher to shit on.

257
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,320
I don't think so.

258
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
That is beautiful.

259
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,160
It says I am the machine.

260
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,730
If you don't know Bert Kreischer as a
fucking hilarious story that he told them

261
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,600
this podcast,

262
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,180
which is amazing story of him and Russia.

263
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,073
And it's so funny.

264
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,580
So somebody animated that one,

265
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:38,791
right?

266
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,331
Yeah.

267
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:39,721
If I,

268
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,740
if I remember correctly,

269
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:42,510
it's like in the hundreds
of thousands now.

270
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,710
Yeah.

271
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,760
Fucking hilarious.

272
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,590
I'll find it later and
I'll tweet it tonight.

273
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,281
But,

274
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:47,521
uh,

275
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:47,881
you know,

276
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:48,511
Bert Kreischer,

277
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,090
he's been on the podcast a bunch of
times and he's one of the funniest guys.

278
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,050
Crazy story.

279
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,740
I heard it.

280
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,880
He did it at the Improv,

281
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
but he's so funny.

282
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,860
He's such a fun guy to be around,

283
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:57,480
man.

284
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,710
I didn't realize his like,

285
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,131
history.

286
00:07:59,131 --> 00:07:59,431
I mean,

287
00:07:59,431 --> 00:07:59,791
I just,

288
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,031
you know,

289
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:03,480
he's just the guy that I
met around doing comedy,

290
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,410
but I didn't know that he was like,

291
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,690
like the king of college
partiers and while stem

292
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,000
wild,

293
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,150
it was like such a nice guy.

294
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,750
Yeah.

295
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,710
It's so weird.

296
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,310
It's like he's a,

297
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,001
he's a partner.

298
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:15,241
Yeah.

299
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:15,601
But he like,

300
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,340
he doesn't have a fucking mean bone.

301
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:17,500
Yeah,

302
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,831
no,

303
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,280
no.

304
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,530
And he hangs out with his fans like,

305
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,470
like that one guy that monkey Todd.

306
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,241
Awesome.

307
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:23,110
Nancy grace video,

308
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:23,381
by the way.

309
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,640
Did you see that Nancy Grace Video?

310
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:25,474
It was beautiful.

311
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,870
Stewed called up Nancy
Grace and ask Nancy grace,

312
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:29,410
you know,

313
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,850
what is it who you want to marry?

314
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:31,780
Fuck or kill?

315
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,650
Yeah.

316
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,230
And she,

317
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,210
he asked her,

318
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,050
well,

319
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,140
would you rather like one marry,

320
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,870
kill or fuck a red band,

321
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,570
Sam Aaa or Jason Tebow?

322
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,260
And he says on Tmz live really racist.

323
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,094
Just sitting there like,

324
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,050
like you could kind of look
like she was going to smile,

325
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,160
but then it'd become angry.

326
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,950
And then monkey Todd goes
and would you dry hump?

327
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,460
Uh,

328
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
Sam Aaa and then uh,

329
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,231
Harvey,

330
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,220
the TMZ hosts.

331
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,310
This is what their first serious interview

332
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,380
I heard like they were like really like,

333
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,861
like wow,

334
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,930
this is the first time we have
a serious interview Harvey.

335
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,350
It's like,

336
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,520
is this serious?

337
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,820
Really like it,

338
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,900
it's uncomfortable to watch that video,

339
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,743
don't you think?

340
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,050
No nonsense.

341
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,590
She is not juggle babies,

342
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,443
animals full.

343
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,283
Laura,

344
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,570
did you know she was with
tapes or an office that big?

345
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Big.

346
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,911
Yeah.

347
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,720
Well you know,

348
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,390
getting fretting about
dead babies and Florida,

349
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:25,320
it allows you a lot of freedom
to eat Cheetos and stuff.

350
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:26,450
Your face with brandings.

351
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,500
You're all dead babies.

352
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,890
It doesn't seem positive.

353
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,511
Ring Ding.

354
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:35,511
If thought Doni this rating thing cause
this baby and Florida going to be alive

355
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:36,451
now.

356
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,231
I don't think so.

357
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,064
She just eats it.

358
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
She's,

359
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,170
it's hard to stay slim.

360
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,400
There's so many dead babies.

361
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,940
It's hard to say this last
baby she has like twin babies,

362
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:45,960
which doesn't seem right.

363
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,380
Like she doesn't seem
like child bearing now.

364
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,780
It seems like that should
be physically impossible.

365
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,920
Her eggs should it be just fucking
fighting to the death in there?

366
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,800
I questioned it.

367
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,570
I looked at her eggs should
look like a gladiator seen

368
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,610
fighting each other.

369
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,840
Keep magic.

370
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,561
She just had the pants.

371
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,370
Pussy ever just choose way,

372
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,040
just like a fist.

373
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,810
Imagine just like jerking you off of
her vagina muscles do have you seen that

374
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,020
Russian bitch online that can carry
like 30 pounds of their pussy?

375
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,760
I don't know how it works and
she doesn't really show the Gash,

376
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,480
but she's got like videos on how to like
control your pussy muscle so that you

377
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:25,520
can like pick up weight.

378
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,230
You know,

379
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,630
like she would just fucking crush
your dick just getting in there.

380
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,650
Maybe it would be too tight.

381
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,760
It would be uncomfortable.

382
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,200
Like a wrestling match with your Dick.

383
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,310
You know,

384
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,300
he'll like dogs.

385
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,640
I like dogs when they fuck,

386
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,610
they got a real problem because dogs
have a bone and that bone gets locked in

387
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,190
there like a fish hook and
sometimes they get stuck.

388
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,540
That's fucking pain.

389
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,370
Cats do.

390
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,790
And her jagged dicks.

391
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,630
Catholic.

392
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,200
It's jagged.

393
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
What do you do in jerking off cat son?

394
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,733
Well,

395
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,980
you see a cat.

396
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,840
That's why if you hear it,

397
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:57,811
that's why.

398
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,980
If you ever catch you seeking,

399
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,910
they're screaming.

400
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,451
Oh Wow.

401
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:00,930
So it's,

402
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,830
it's painful.

403
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,360
It's painful for their female cat.

404
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,350
That's nuts.

405
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,060
You should Google Google
cap penis right now.

406
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:06,850
You'd be shocked.

407
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,540
It looks like,

408
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,270
uh,

409
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,570
I've been tricked before,

410
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:10,410
but not that easily,

411
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:10,920
Brian.

412
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,753
Not that easily.

413
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,833
That penis,

414
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,890
penis.

415
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,311
Seriously.

416
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:14,671
Look at it.

417
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,730
I guess I need to know that everybody
knows who his dog Dick looks like,

418
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,930
but very few people know.

419
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,403
No,

420
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
you've never seen it.

421
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,030
No,

422
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,030
it didn't go take a look.

423
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,570
Okay.

424
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,370
I see little Barbie looking things.

425
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:26,761
Cat,

426
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:27,211
penis,

427
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,021
spines.

428
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,710
They're called,

429
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,000
my goodness.

430
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,290
He's telling the truth.

431
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,360
This is horrific.

432
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,070
Nature is so ruthless.

433
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,850
You know what it is.

434
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,970
That's to ensure that the,

435
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:37,321
the,

436
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,450
the male stays in there
and shoots his load.

437
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,950
This is horrendous.

438
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,990
Nature is so God damn vicious.

439
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,220
What a vicious fucking
animal in nature is,

440
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,340
are all cats would just
loosen up a little bit.

441
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,050
They wouldn't take their Barbie Penis.

442
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,190
You know,

443
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,360
that's a wild world.

444
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:53,380
We're living in a world of the cats.

445
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,140
You know,

446
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,973
big cats.

447
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,880
Jaguars are little baby
cats out there killing mice.

448
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,900
It's just the same thing.

449
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,500
It's all wild world of,

450
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,190
of fucking moving and killing
things smaller than you.

451
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,240
You know,

452
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,601
you can't,

453
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,180
we can't even understand what it must
be like to try and get some cat pussy.

454
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,070
You know?

455
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,400
You should imagine.

456
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,670
Could you imagine this bitch is in agony.

457
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,810
She wants to fuck so bad.

458
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,471
She's in agony,

459
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,380
but she knows that you're
going to rip her insides up,

460
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,480
but that needle he dick,

461
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,590
she wants you to just keep
talk being with no needles,

462
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,343
the needles

463
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,700
and they just circle each other.

464
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,870
That could be a good like let's
write that script cat man like he,

465
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,430
but he just has that Barbie peanut.

466
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,283
That's why

467
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,540
cats,

468
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,311
you know what they liked?

469
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,470
They liked those fluffy
cats that just give up,

470
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,240
you know like what are those called?

471
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,440
What was yours called?

472
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,281
Persians.

473
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:44,940
Persians.

474
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,331
Persians.

475
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:45,900
Just give up.

476
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,170
They just a little slutty cats.

477
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
They just relax and just take it.

478
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,620
That's why I like a big Tom cat with
like a Persian cat around the house so he

479
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:53,381
could just fuck it.

480
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,214
Random,

481
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,163
you know,

482
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,820
she's not going to fight back much.

483
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,150
You know,

484
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,230
she's going to barely fight back.

485
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,110
She can't fuck with him
being black street cat.

486
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,700
It's like the Kardashians.

487
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,421
They're Persian,

488
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:04,180
aren't they?

489
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,013
No.

490
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,521
No.

491
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:06,354
They're Armenian.

492
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,050
Did you just make a joke about
Armenian somewhere on Twitter recently,

493
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,850
so no,

494
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,541
I don't think so.

495
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,180
Have you ever worn a long exactly on par.

496
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,910
Oh,

497
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,680
Jen Kirkman tweeted something.

498
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:17,941
Yeah.

499
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:19,170
She tweeted something about,

500
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:19,351
what?

501
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:19,531
Is it,

502
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,210
an Armenian holiday today or something?

503
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,170
I Dunno,

504
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,590
is it?

505
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,610
She said something shit.

506
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,180
I called it.

507
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,500
She said she wasn't going to make any
sarcastic tweets about the Kardashians in

508
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,180
honor of some Armenian day,

509
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,940
and I called her and ask us.

510
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,370
That was the whole,

511
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,590
I didn't say anything negative

512
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
about Armenians.

513
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,410
I know you would never do that.

514
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,244
Right?

515
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,700
I would never say anything negative
about a group of people that proud

516
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,720
Armenians.

517
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,250
They love being Armenian.

518
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:44,830
You know,

519
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,740
there's a lot of Armenians who were like,

520
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:47,161
fuck,

521
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,890
I wish it wasn't you.

522
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,590
No.

523
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,030
They love being Armenians.

524
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:51,480
You know,

525
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,620
they're proud people.

526
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,870
Carl Breezy and duty
used to fight the UFC.

527
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,060
Fucking what a personality that guy has.

528
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,080
He's hilarious.

529
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,700
I got this thing that he,

530
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,870
we were having lunch.

531
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,820
I got to ask him if I
could put this video out.

532
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,950
It's a video of him
joking around about he,

533
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,550
his nickname was the heat and joking
around about giving girls the heat and

534
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,061
telling them,

535
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:12,481
what are you doing?

536
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:13,314
You're taking the heat.

537
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,310
They take the heat.

538
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,260
He's like yelling about it and he's like,

539
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,910
he's so Armenian.

540
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:18,460
Yeah.

541
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,931
You know what I mean?

542
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,880
It's so fucking hilarious.

543
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,690
You know those,

544
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,040
those really aggressive,

545
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,780
funny Armenian type guys.

546
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,470
Yeah.

547
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,741
I mean,

548
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:26,670
I don't know a ton of them.

549
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,680
I've only lived out here for
like extreme Italians years.

550
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,100
They're like extreme.

551
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,940
Like I actually had Armenians hook me
up at the tire center the other day,

552
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,260
which was the most weirdest thing.

553
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,460
There were six Armenians.

554
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,470
They all came out circle
around the car and was like,

555
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:40,651
hey,

556
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:41,130
how's it going?

557
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,890
Oh you got two nails in your tires
will change them and patch them.

558
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:44,401
And he goes,

559
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:44,761
you know what?

560
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:45,420
It's on us.

561
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,930
And I'm like,

562
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,560
what?

563
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,393
Really?

564
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,301
That's awesome.

565
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:48,901
Fuck is he though?

566
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:49,141
Yo,

567
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,980
you always hear bad things about people,

568
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,220
Russian people

569
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,510
and Armenian people and you know,

570
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,600
people from what we
consider like hard places.

571
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,230
You know,

572
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,063
I've,

573
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
I've made a lot of great,

574
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:00,171
I mean,

575
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:00,590
yeah,

576
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,480
I mean are people like a lot of passion?

577
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,760
You know,

578
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,350
there's a,

579
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,700
it's a,

580
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
it says something about
real ethnic groups,

581
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:06,531
you know,

582
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,120
a real group like the Armenian is,

583
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:08,301
you know,

584
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,710
like they stick to their culture.

585
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,820
And when I was growing up,

586
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,320
our startup culture is kind of bullshit.

587
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,250
Like who gives a fuck?

588
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:13,491
You know,

589
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:13,850
like,

590
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,420
you know,

591
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,540
does it really matter if you behave
exactly the way everybody else behaves?

592
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,340
But when you see like a really tight
knit ethnic community and you appreciate,

593
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,740
not that they're racist or
biased against anybody else,

594
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,490
but that they have like this
real distinct flavor to them,

595
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,450
you know,

596
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,680
the way they behave,

597
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,011
you know,

598
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:31,231
the,

599
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:31,511
the,

600
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,690
the things they like,

601
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,350
you know,

602
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,910
they have this real distinct,

603
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,570
let's see,

604
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,690
real uniqueness to it
that makes it interesting.

605
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,460
It's one of the interesting
things about life.

606
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,150
You know,

607
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,291
the,

608
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,580
one of the things I was thinking about
when I was in New Orleans this weekend,

609
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,180
I was like,

610
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,210
this is a completely different
way to live your life.

611
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,060
Like here there's these
people that are living in,

612
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,720
this is a totally different flavor,

613
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,480
a very unique flavor of its own.

614
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:53,901
You know,

615
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,970
it alls was like a race.

616
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,571
You know,

617
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:59,990
like Norland people are almost
like it's from another country.

618
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,281
But I think that,

619
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,000
you know,

620
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,601
when,

621
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,360
when people get assimilated it's the,

622
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,060
you mean the perfect thing is to have
everybody be cool with everybody.

623
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:08,421
And there's,

624
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:08,850
you know,

625
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,530
and no,

626
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,680
no people who are prejudice against any
particular group because we're all some

627
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,600
sort of weird shade of gray.

628
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:18,050
Now we've all interbred to the point
where there's no distinctiveness between

629
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,381
you.

630
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:18,501
No,

631
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:18,650
no,

632
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,630
no way of distinguishing
us between anybody else.

633
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,660
We're all just one sort of
individual type of thing.

634
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,771
But along the way,

635
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:25,011
man,

636
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,330
we're going to lose a lot of fun.

637
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,653
You know,

638
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,000
there's a lot of fun and people being
weird because a lot of fun and you know,

639
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,750
Armenian dudes who are like
suit wearing gold chains.

640
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:36,740
And try to get some pussy.

641
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,370
Those guys are awesome man.

642
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:38,690
Yeah,

643
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,523
those guys are fucking,

644
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,350
the Kardashians are Armenians.

645
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,210
I believe that they know.

646
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,850
But our is that like if you
make fun of the Kardashians,

647
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:49,640
like as an Armenian Guy gonna Punch
me and I don't think they claim,

648
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,503
um,

649
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,290
claim them cause it seems like
she's trying to get a white girl.

650
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,461
It's different,

651
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,120
you know,

652
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,620
think are Armenian women.

653
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,200
I don't want to speak for Armenian women.

654
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,193
They'll say,

655
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,681
well less.

656
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:04,370
They have to like forget about
whatever the fuck you know.

657
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,880
She's,

658
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,500
you know,

659
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,060
is she worthwhile and she worth anything.

660
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,690
What's the point?

661
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,590
We're talking about her.

662
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:14,390
So she's entertaining just as like Max
and Ruby is a cartoon that my kids love.

663
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:15,620
It's this little rabbit show.

664
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,641
It's a fucking show.

665
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
It's entertaining.

666
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,650
Maybe not to you.

667
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,990
I've never heard of kids to someone.

668
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,750
This Kardashians show is fucking awesome.

669
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,440
All right.

670
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,090
Oh that's that person.

671
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,900
They deserve it.

672
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,733
It's ridiculous.

673
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
As ridiculous as it is.

674
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,201
So,

675
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:30,740
uh,

676
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,340
I dunno,

677
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,790
I dunno if the Armenians
claimer but they should,

678
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,570
you see that she's a bad ass bitch when
it comes to like being like good at

679
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,110
that.

680
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,700
You know,

681
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,350
you've got to recognize Paris Hilton,

682
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,030
who she took the Paris Hilton thing.

683
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,680
So some completely new level to the point
where every time I'm at the airport,

684
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm my fucking sneakers into a bin.

685
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,750
I'm looking at her face just like ads
where it's her and a couple of other

686
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:55,970
famous people and I,

687
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:56,820
every time I'm like,

688
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:57,001
wow,

689
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,190
this girl started off in
a fucking porno movie.

690
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,440
Now I'm putting my change on her face.

691
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,110
It's so strange,

692
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,801
you know?

693
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,634
But you got to,

694
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,080
I love it.

695
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,640
I love the madness of it.

696
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,680
I love how ridiculous it is.

697
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,100
I've gotten to the point
where I love Rick Perry.

698
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
I see him talk and I know,

699
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,900
I know he's of stutter and fuck.

700
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,090
I know he's just like Bush.

701
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,980
I know he's going to
do the exact same shit.

702
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,300
Maybe even weirder.

703
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:24,841
You know,

704
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,630
maybe if he reminds me of dude.

705
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:27,180
Yeah,

706
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,700
Josh Brolin playing w in the movie.

707
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:30,520
That's what it reminds me.

708
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,081
And I look at it,

709
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,070
but I like it.

710
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:32,940
I like that he's there.

711
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,860
I'm enjoying that he's there.

712
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,580
I mean gang,

713
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,410
but then you can,

714
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,370
then it's just like,

715
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,770
so I don't know what was
given up on everything,

716
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:40,970
you know?

717
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,140
I mean that's kind of in the
same boat where it's like,

718
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:43,590
all right.

719
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,090
I mean I can either be walking around
like furious out of my mind all the time

720
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,410
or just like don't really pay attention
to it and enjoy the absurdity of it all.

721
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,560
It's like watching Mitt
Romney and Rick Perry,

722
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,480
like I just saw on the news.

723
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,420
I don't know what they were like
debating each other and it's like,

724
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,283
who's crazier?

725
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,900
Who believes in crazier Shit Dude?

726
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,020
Like that's like from an eighties and
look like they're like politicians.

727
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:12,021
They are like the archetype like bad
politician guy from like an eighties movie

728
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:12,931
or something.

729
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:15,510
It's just like this like robot dude.

730
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:17,160
They're both exactly the same.

731
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,380
I think when you take your choice,

732
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,230
we're getting a real clear message,

733
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,070
a real clear message with politics
over the last decade or so.

734
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,510
It's that what you are
seeing on television,

735
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,800
the people that are talking,

736
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,020
that's the guy who got that spot.

737
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,831
That's all that is,

738
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,970
and that guy is,

739
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,560
he's,

740
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,880
he's instructed,

741
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,820
he's pushed into a certain direction
for all the people who got him to that

742
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:42,240
position.

743
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,410
It's so clear.

744
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,240
It's so obvious there's,

745
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,460
there can be no denying it
when you look at it now,

746
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,960
to take it seriously,

747
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,831
as in,

748
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:50,101
you know,

749
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:50,551
to take it,

750
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,430
to think that there's really some sort
of a big vote going on and we're going to

751
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,810
change the way the whole thing works.

752
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,111
Hey,

753
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:55,970
I hear they're going to throw out,

754
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,980
the Federal Reserve is going to go back
to the only live in by the constitution.

755
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,170
We're going to cut the number
of laws back dramatically.

756
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,180
We've got to let people
have state's rights again.

757
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,130
Yeah,

758
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,290
we're,

759
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,123
can I get rid of all,

760
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,110
how long would that last?

761
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,383
No,

762
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,270
they would kill that guy.

763
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,871
They would kill that guy.

764
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,440
The heartbeat.

765
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,801
Oh yeah.

766
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:14,370
Of course.

767
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:14,761
We all,

768
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,680
we all agreed that the guy's saying like,

769
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:16,800
uh,

770
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,071
no,

771
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,160
I don't think I can sign that
bill called the clean air act.

772
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,830
That actually lets you pollute
more when people tell you,

773
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,700
well that's ridiculous.

774
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:24,660
You're being cynical.

775
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,580
This is a terrible message to send out.

776
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,100
You haven't really researched
this enough to be APP.

777
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,300
Absolutely accurate.

778
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,631
You get,

779
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,270
you're saying this damaging thing that
voting doesn't change anything and you're

780
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,710
sending a terrible message to people,

781
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,440
but at what point in time are
you allowed to be objective?

782
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,370
At what point in time do you look at a
guy like Obama who acts like a Republican

783
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,050
and does all this creepy shit that if
GE Gw was doing it and liberals would be

784
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:50,770
fucking calling into newspapers
every day and protesting every day,

785
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,940
he's doing shit.

786
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,510
Does just like the stuff that Bush
did and yet somehow or another.

787
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,140
Yeah,

788
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,920
absolutely.

789
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,221
I really,

790
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:00,190
somehow or another liberals aren't
even saying anything about it.

791
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,024
It's the whole,

792
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,370
it's so bizarre.

793
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:02,531
Lee.

794
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,540
Creepy and so bizarrely weird.

795
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Just like windows versus PC.

796
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,430
It's like the same sort
of retard battle going on.

797
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,450
It's the same sort of weird control
over some fucking boat that doesn't even

798
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,640
have a steering wheel.

799
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,130
It's like one day you break
into the fucking main cabin.

800
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:18,640
All right?

801
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,140
We finally got to the head of the boat.

802
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,663
There's no stairs,

803
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,931
there's nothing.

804
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:23,920
There's no instruments.

805
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,420
It's smooth as glass.

806
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,220
You can affect this fucking thing at all.

807
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,880
You could spend your whole life chipping
away at this insanely corrupt system.

808
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,103
Good luck.

809
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,801
Look at when we,

810
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,330
when you see anybody like challenges,

811
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:34,601
any,

812
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,770
any of the mainstream ideas
that we've come to accept.

813
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,190
Like look at a guy like Ron Paul.

814
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,380
They'd duct that fucking
guy every chance they get.

815
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,930
I've seen polls where they ignore the
number one guy and focus on the two and

816
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,590
three,

817
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,280
the real battle between
Rick Perry and Mitt Romney.

818
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,790
And they were,

819
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,780
they were literally ignoring
that Ron Paul was winning things.

820
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,591
Just ignoring them.

821
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:57,490
Just not even talking to them.

822
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,930
Yeah.

823
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,100
Because he's just telling him they're,

824
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,360
they're doing everything wrong.

825
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,710
We're doing everything wrong.

826
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,930
The people are going yes.

827
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,930
And the TV.

828
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,341
Well,

829
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,770
it's like when Howard got,

830
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,900
when Howard Dean said,

831
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,793
yeah,

832
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,560
just fucking but has never fucking,

833
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,380
he fucked up.

834
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,213
I fucked up.

835
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,970
You fucked up.

836
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,030
I think they set him up to manipulate,

837
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,350
like they took that footage
and twisted it into something.

838
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,571
Well,

839
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,330
I remember it was morning
mattress material.

840
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,550
There was a,

841
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,520
there was a show that I was thinking
of when I think of morning shows,

842
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,280
Charles Laquidara the mattress
in the morning and Boston.

843
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,581
Oh,

844
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:35,414
okay.

845
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,190
They would play something
along these lines.

846
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,470
So you know that every fucking single
wacky morning zoo radio station that crazy

847
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:44,011
yelled at her,

848
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,800
yelled out and it became a joke.

849
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,740
It became a national joke
in the matter of a day.

850
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,411
You remember it,

851
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:49,100
right?

852
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,900
Howard Dean did a campaign
speech and he's like,

853
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,161
Hey,

854
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,630
we're gonna Fairmont in New Hampshire.

855
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,240
And all they did was take that.

856
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:56,481
Yeah.

857
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:56,841
They're like,

858
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,250
no fucking way,

859
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,850
dude.

860
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,571
You can't ever,

861
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:00,404
yeah.

862
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,850
Resident.

863
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,370
They took it from like his body,

864
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:04,851
Mike,

865
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,270
when he was yelling to like,

866
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,200
you know,

867
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,250
a couple thousand people.

868
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,590
But could you imagine if Obama ever,

869
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,424
yeah,

870
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,371
well,

871
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:13,851
ever since.

872
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,750
How are we managing that?

873
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,790
You're not allowed to
show any emotion anymore.

874
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,961
I mean that's,

875
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,670
they have playbooks
now where they're like,

876
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:20,031
no,

877
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,200
don't show any emotion.

878
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,034
Just put the,

879
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,990
this is still in when you make your fist,

880
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,083
isn't it?

881
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,080
Isn't it amazing?

882
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:30,080
And don't ever answer a fucking
question no matter what you do.

883
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,910
Never fucking give a direct,

884
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,020
definitive.

885
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,540
Once people decide that
Howard Dean has done,

886
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,200
Howard Dean has done and he just pushed
to the side like he was the front

887
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:39,950
runner.

888
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,510
He was the number one surgeon

889
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,410
from Vermont.

890
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:42,711
Like,

891
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,280
you know,

892
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,000
you man,

893
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,833
brilliant man.

894
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,201
Wait,

895
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:45,781
speaker.

896
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:46,160
Got a little

897
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,530
emotion.

898
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,450
Good morals.

899
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah.

900
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,190
Fuck Outta here.

901
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,761
You know,

902
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,750
I kind of like him even more now because
he's so uncensored when he talks about

903
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,540
things and for months a
very interesting place too.

904
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,374
He's from Vermont.

905
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,341
It's amazing.

906
00:23:58,341 --> 00:23:58,820
It's like,

907
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,560
it's really northern in rural,

908
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:01,790
but it's really smart.

909
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,810
Have you ever done a Gig there?

910
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,290
Yeah,

911
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:03,800
I've done that.

912
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,290
A gig in Burlington when
I was living in Boston,

913
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,320
I did a weekend there once
was fucking great man.

914
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:09,620
I was like,

915
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:09,801
wow,

916
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,371
what a crazy.

917
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,030
And they were like,

918
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,050
winter's are tough though.

919
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:12,920
What he said,

920
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,620
I have a friend who lives
in Brattleboro and uh,

921
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,310
yeah,

922
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,300
winter's are fucking,

923
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:18,120
I wouldn't want to be there.

924
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,953
No winner.

925
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,360
There's a certain quality of your
life that you sacrifice when you,

926
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,701
you know,

927
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:23,060
you,

928
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,030
you live in someplace.

929
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,610
It's brutally cold.

930
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,700
Well it's the way it's
so rural that you have,

931
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:33,150
everybody's got like a 45 foot kind of
dirt driveway thing and then when it

932
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,130
snows and freezes,

933
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,940
it's like you can't drive my truck
down there fucking to know a tree.

934
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,810
Well up in big bear.

935
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,880
A lot of people drive around
with fucking chains on.

936
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,220
Yeah,

937
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,620
I think,

938
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:42,921
well yeah,

939
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:43,730
you can do hires.

940
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,400
I think you were required
areas and she used to be,

941
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,001
you know,

942
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,220
I know they make like
studded snow tires and shit,

943
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,060
so you can deal with that.

944
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,230
Like a lot of people in Colorado,

945
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:51,801
they had that,

946
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,570
but no changes are required.

947
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah.

948
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,130
That a place like Vermont,

949
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,310
it's fucking cold for a
good five or six months.

950
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,510
It's really cold.

951
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,621
Fuck.

952
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:01,880
Is it beautiful up there though?

953
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:02,540
Man,

954
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,620
it's one of the few places that's
like hasn't been fucked with,

955
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,280
you know,

956
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,300
because there's just,

957
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:08,770
you know,

958
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,070
it's,

959
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,110
it's a fairly small population and it's a,

960
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:17,030
it's got an incredible amount of wildlife
and incredible amount of like woods

961
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,660
and just beautiful nature shit to look at.

962
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:20,841
You know,

963
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,730
when you drive and drive up to Burlington,

964
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,564
you're like,

965
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,860
look how beautiful it is.

966
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,180
Just clear air and not that many people.

967
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:33,260
And it's almost all outdoor advertising
and Vermont to no billboards,

968
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,130
no outdoor,

969
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,990
you can't advertise outdoors.

970
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:36,980
Wow.

971
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,101
Yeah,

972
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:37,911
the real hippie.

973
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,770
That's where Ben and Jerry comes from.

974
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,510
Ben and Jerry's ice cream,

975
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,360
they came from their real
super happy up there.

976
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,630
Are they up there so you can actually
go to the factory and to the dude's live

977
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,990
up there too or did they fucking fake it
and they're in Miami getting made Dick

978
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:51,900
suck prime.

979
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,010
I don't know any magic there.

980
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,970
You imagine that they were just became
super rich and they just became ballers,

981
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,490
but then they'd have to like put
it on the fucking Birkenstocks.

982
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,810
So their ad campaigns,

983
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,090
they just want to be out there doing blow.

984
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,020
And that's a funny idea.

985
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:11,021
That'd be a funny like sketch mad big
hippies like fake Ben and Jerry get those

986
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,750
guys and when they get big or like p
diddy and fucking just totally shift here.

987
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,990
Ben and Jerry's becomes like Mcdonald's
where a different guy plays it in every

988
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:18,500
store.

989
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,680
Hey Jerry.

990
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,010
Yeah,

991
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,843
yeah,

992
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,610
yeah.

993
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,940
You have a fucking Ben and Jerry's show
that goes on before the actual ice cream

994
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:26,571
gets served.

995
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah.

996
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,550
I'm Ben and he's Jerry.

997
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,061
How are you?

998
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:29,690
Sure.

999
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,650
I thought I was jewelry.

1000
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,853
Yeah.

1001
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,251
Yeah.

1002
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:35,960
How the fuck did that
Mcdonald's thing happened?

1003
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,550
Remember when there's a real clowns,

1004
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,390
Justin up as Mcdonald's and you can
go to Mcdonald's like certain days and

1005
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,860
Ronald McDonald would be
there and you're like,

1006
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,830
shit,

1007
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,690
this has got a Ronald
Mcdonald's going to be at this.

1008
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,130
When people get excited about it,

1009
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,780
how ruthless has Mcdonald.

1010
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:49,590
They still do that.

1011
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,820
I had a roommate who was a clown.

1012
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,601
He really do.

1013
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,520
Ronald McDonald Shit appearance.

1014
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,391
Amazing.

1015
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:54,571
Now,

1016
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:59,571
what a tricky way to rope kids in eight
and your fucking food man to think that

1017
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:00,920
about.

1018
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,130
You know,

1019
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,770
when you think about the most delicious
serial as all the worst shit for you,

1020
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,860
that's all the ones with the
big attractive cartoon faces on.

1021
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,770
It literally is designed
to get little kids and go,

1022
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,161
Ooh,

1023
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:15,720
look like to them serial
called cookie crisp.

1024
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,210
Yeah.

1025
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,790
That's not going to be a feeling of a kid.

1026
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:17,971
Well,

1027
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:22,971
you could have a cereal box that was all
white that said captain crunch peanut

1028
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,174
butter,

1029
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,500
and you would look at it and go,

1030
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:26,640
fuck yeah,

1031
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,830
you could be completely
white with like black letter.

1032
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,710
But to a kid that's going to be
completely unattractive because they can't

1033
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:32,610
fucking read.

1034
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
They're getting them before they
can even can read that and go,

1035
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:37,860
I want this.

1036
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:38,694
I want this.

1037
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,200
Like my three year old can't read,

1038
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,360
but she looks at captain
crunch and it looks fun.

1039
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,850
You look at fruity pebbles and fun.

1040
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,760
They still make Bogue,

1041
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:47,594
blueberries,

1042
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:49,940
blueberry.

1043
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,750
In Ohio,

1044
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,390
there was no such thing as booberry.

1045
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,830
They had only the strawberry
and the chocolate,

1046
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,350
but then I would go on vacation in.

1047
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,260
And what was the Franken
Franken Berry Berry.

1048
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,610
Did you feel left out?

1049
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,770
I would go to Florida on vacation again,

1050
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:07,190
five boxes of it it or
you haul a mom very like,

1051
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:07,461
mom,

1052
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:07,821
please,

1053
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:07,871
I,

1054
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:08,601
this is my favorite series,

1055
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:12,800
so she'll spend like $30 and
buy as much booberry $30 oil,

1056
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:13,634
a little scrappy.

1057
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,840
It was rude.

1058
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,980
There's no reason for that.

1059
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:18,460
Blueberries is the best one and you
don't sell it in certain markets?

1060
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:20,530
I think I've ever had
booberry oh that's great.

1061
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,320
That's great.

1062
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,100
Or the strawberry on going to cvs,

1063
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,690
they saw my folks wouldn't
buy us the sugary stuff.

1064
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:27,360
I mean I've had it had

1065
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,051
it as an adult.

1066
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:28,830
Good,

1067
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,550
good for them.

1068
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,470
My parents bought it very sparingly.

1069
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,030
They let us have it every now and then
you'd like pick a favorite to just eat

1070
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,210
the stupid shit they would,

1071
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,100
they would indulge us.

1072
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,900
Lou would also let us eat TV dinners.

1073
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:40,830
We wanted a TV dinner,

1074
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,200
shots,

1075
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,420
stories and they're disgusting.

1076
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,770
But were for whatever reason,

1077
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,090
I saw the very steak.

1078
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,590
I want to eat a TV dinner,

1079
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,030
wanting eat the dumbest shit.

1080
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,680
So they would let me every now and then.

1081
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,401
But for the most part,

1082
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:51,720
they wanted me to eat healthy,

1083
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,270
so I didn't get to eat too many of those,

1084
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:54,720
but,

1085
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,100
but when I could,

1086
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,940
when I got a chance,

1087
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:57,240
man,

1088
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,571
oh fuck.

1089
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,130
Yeah.

1090
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,670
Well like what we were
talking about earlier,

1091
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,440
once you tell people they can't do shit,

1092
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,551
then it's on.

1093
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:02,911
It's like,

1094
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:03,211
really?

1095
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,170
I want some of that.

1096
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,481
Yeah.

1097
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:09,060
You mentioned if you grew up a Vegan
you would just like hunger for chicken

1098
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:13,050
livers and hearts and
meet and legs of lamb.

1099
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,311
He's smell it.

1100
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:15,330
And restaurants in life,

1101
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,220
you can never have it.

1102
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,770
Milk.

1103
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah,

1104
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
no shit.

1105
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,740
You're just getting seeds here.

1106
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,760
Eat the seeds.

1107
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,560
They have a full spectrum
of [inaudible] Polak acids.

1108
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,310
It's all vital nutrients.

1109
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,210
Eat the seeds.

1110
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,160
You can get everything and just the seeds.

1111
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:32,770
Yeah.

1112
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,603
Okay.

1113
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,031
Yeah.

1114
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:36,780
I don't know.

1115
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,830
Could you ever go vegan?

1116
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,960
I,

1117
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,010
I'd give it a shot.

1118
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,430
I mean,

1119
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,750
I wouldn't have any,

1120
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,320
I mean just for kind of like to see how
it makes me feel and like to kind of

1121
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,041
clean out like,

1122
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:48,221
you know,

1123
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,490
just eat and kind of raw.

1124
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,900
I would do like raw diet or
I don't know much about it,

1125
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,780
but I'd try like I think,

1126
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,340
yeah I could go vegan nut fish.

1127
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,750
I like fish too much.

1128
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,260
I like eggs till I could
drive vegetarian cheese take.

1129
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,780
There's some merit to vegetarian.

1130
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:05,481
I think it definitely,

1131
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:07,330
it probably changes your personality too.

1132
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,540
I think it's print been a least with
anecdotal evidence proven that people we

1133
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,160
meet are more aggressive than people who
are vegetarians kind of makes sense if

1134
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:20,230
you think about just
the nature aspect of it.

1135
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,990
Even though we're not going
out and getting the stuff,

1136
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,060
even though we're not
killing it ourselves,

1137
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,691
that makes sense.

1138
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,980
We're still eating it,

1139
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,221
you know,

1140
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,270
we're still getting it.

1141
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,440
You're eating flesh to the
attitude that you must have,

1142
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,550
like the cultivating your body.

1143
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,390
If you were a flesh eater,

1144
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,380
a constant flesh eater,

1145
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,020
it's gotta be a more predatory attitude.

1146
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:39,070
It just makes sense.

1147
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,790
Yeah.

1148
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,910
I mean I don't know how the real probably
just keeps something triggered in your

1149
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:43,840
body of like,

1150
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,674
you know,

1151
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,670
totally guessing here.

1152
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:46,870
Totally talking out of my ass.

1153
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,080
Cause obviously I don't know how the
real reward system works with like eating

1154
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,370
meat and getting aggressive,

1155
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,160
but we all associate like
steak with aggression.

1156
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
It's like a natural association,

1157
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:56,710
you know,

1158
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,130
fucking what's a man's meall,

1159
00:30:59,630 --> 00:30:59,980
right.

1160
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,970
Make sense to me.

1161
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,900
Sold,

1162
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,080
you know I'm doing no further research.

1163
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:06,250
I'm going to repeat what you said.

1164
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:11,251
Is fact the other people now I think if
we all ate shit that was like grass fed,

1165
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,170
if we all let just grass fed beef,

1166
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,640
there would be way less of it.

1167
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,970
But it'd be way better for you and
people would probably enjoy it more.

1168
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:23,050
But there's certainly at this point I
think there's just too many goddamn people

1169
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,880
and not enough food,

1170
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,890
you know,

1171
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,950
to to live like that.

1172
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:27,970
That scares me man.

1173
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,410
I mean there are a lot of,

1174
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,220
you know,

1175
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,050
we would have to have monstrous,

1176
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:35,820
monstrous farms to compete with some
of these crazy chicken farms will be

1177
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:37,480
fucking grow them all stuffed together.

1178
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,361
I mean everybody that,

1179
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:40,510
it freaks everybody out when
you watch those chicken videos.

1180
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,820
But if they weren't like that,

1181
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:43,350
like how,

1182
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,670
how much farm acreage would it cost?

1183
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,020
How much more would it cost?

1184
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,970
Is Is it at a point where we need cheap
foods so much that they have to do shit

1185
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:52,510
like this?

1186
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,970
Cause that's fucked up and I'm
not insinuating that they are.

1187
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,550
I'm just raising the
question that is fucked up.

1188
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,540
If that's the case,

1189
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,350
if it's like we need to do
like the factory farming
thing cause it's fucking way

1190
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:05,800
too many of us and then just sending
chickens out the moment they shit,

1191
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:09,370
I'm out there fucking pop it up in the
hormones cause they gotta get a big quick

1192
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,090
so we can ship them out to
the 300 million motherfuckers.

1193
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,310
And out of those 300 million,

1194
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,930
how many are farmers?

1195
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,320
How many a 300 million people are farmers?

1196
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,880
Is it even a million?

1197
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,541
No,

1198
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,270
it's not one in 301 and
300 people isn't a farmer.

1199
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,300
Do you think there's a million
farmers in this country?

1200
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,020
Probably say there's a different kinds of,

1201
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,180
I don't know man.

1202
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,013
Amelia,

1203
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,933
either way.

1204
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Let's look at it.

1205
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,230
Obviously folks for
you googling right now,

1206
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,110
he's fucking guys are so
off with their numbers,

1207
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,860
Huh?

1208
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,330
How can I say?

1209
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,151
All I'm trying to say is,

1210
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:45,620
could you imagine if that was the case?

1211
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,060
If it was one in every 300 could you
imagine if one person had to take care of

1212
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,290
300 fucking people?

1213
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,843
Yeah.

1214
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,390
That's ridiculous.

1215
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,501
Yeah,

1216
00:32:58,501 --> 00:32:59,334
I guess,

1217
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,333
oh no.

1218
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,600
I would just eat a lot of
water and she'd be like,

1219
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,240
you,

1220
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,740
you imagine one person you
had to feed 300 people.

1221
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,191
That's true.

1222
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:08,910
One person,

1223
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,740
one person feeds 300 people.

1224
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,690
What the fuck?

1225
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,110
That would be so hard.

1226
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:13,351
No,

1227
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:14,370
you'd have to do it by yourself.

1228
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,640
You couldn't employ anybody.

1229
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:17,960
We can employ a million
people and honor for our,

1230
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,230
our numbers to work.

1231
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,440
You can't employ anyone because it's
one of the 300 and we're being super

1232
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:22,831
generous.

1233
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:25,020
We're saying there's 1 million of farmers,

1234
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,341
so that's,

1235
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,990
that's where it gets fucking loony.

1236
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:28,824
Toons man.

1237
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,180
Obviously it doesn't work like that.

1238
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,350
They have a hundred people and they do.

1239
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,380
The work of 5,000 individuals are more,

1240
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:34,711
you know,

1241
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,090
I know obviously it
doesn't work like that,

1242
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:38,980
but it almost seems
like at this point the,

1243
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,350
the,

1244
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,490
the resources versus population.

1245
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:46,380
Isn't that a weird place where we need
an incredible amount of food and we all

1246
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:48,150
sort of take for granted
that it's out there,

1247
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:48,811
you know,

1248
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,790
like who's providing all of this,

1249
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,013
you know,

1250
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,550
it's a lot of fucking food and if the
three of us went out right now and had

1251
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:00,730
like two hours to just buy
as much food as possible,

1252
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,220
we could each by so much fucking food.

1253
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:03,990
Yeah.

1254
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,823
It's,

1255
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,640
to me it's like just fast food.

1256
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:10,270
Like if we had like an hour or two by
is unlimited felt like we could buy

1257
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,104
probably,

1258
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,183
I mean

1259
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,943
a van full.

1260
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,610
Yeah.

1261
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:16,911
More,

1262
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:17,480
yeah.

1263
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,400
250 cheeseburgers a piece.

1264
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,520
It's just to me staggering
the way we have,

1265
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,000
uh,

1266
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
grown from being hunter gatherers to
people who lived in like small villages to

1267
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,570
cities where we have to get the
stuff sent in every day in trucks,

1268
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,000
just more meat for the
wheel over and over again.

1269
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:40,160
Trucks and trucks of meat.

1270
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:44,570
I just pump it into the city all day long
and it's really only been going on for

1271
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,530
a few hundred years.

1272
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,791
That's nuts,

1273
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:47,090
man.

1274
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,700
Yeah,

1275
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,080
that's,

1276
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,010
that's amazing.

1277
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,040
It's almost like there's a living machine
called civilization and its blood is

1278
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,070
animals.

1279
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,010
I mean that's the pump you
hundred prompt alive by blood,

1280
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,510
you know the blood and the trucks.

1281
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,150
It's almost like individual blood cells,

1282
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,811
you know.

1283
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:03,520
But it's not,

1284
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,100
it's a circle is much larger scale.

1285
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,800
It's like yeah,

1286
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,100
just meet delivery devices.

1287
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,590
Yeah.

1288
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,450
And that's what Keith does.

1289
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,403
These are the,

1290
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,510
the meat delivery devices to the city
that keeps it moving at this insane pace

1291
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,810
where you can fit 7 million people on
one square floating place and have them

1292
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:27,080
stacked on top of each other and
he just keeps sending the meat.

1293
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,930
I saw that movie yesterday.

1294
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,063
Did it freak you out?

1295
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,950
All right.

1296
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,900
It didn't really freak me out.

1297
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,001
It,

1298
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,500
I don't think it's stuck on a sock from,

1299
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,330
I heard a lot of people say I liked it.

1300
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,343
Um,

1301
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,850
but tell me if this is right.

1302
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:42,000
Does Tokyo have 36 million people?

1303
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,220
Something crazy like that.

1304
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,020
They're packing blew my fucking
mind cause they were talking,

1305
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:46,261
you know,

1306
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:47,100
like as the thing,

1307
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,120
I mean everybody knows that.

1308
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:49,110
Not that it's about a disease,

1309
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:49,800
it spreads.

1310
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,461
And they would show like,

1311
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:50,641
you know,

1312
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,080
New York population,

1313
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,561
whatever,

1314
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,161
8 million,

1315
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:58,120
whatever lives in New York or California
or Los Angeles population is in and

1316
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,990
they will go to Tokyo
and it said 36.4 million.

1317
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:01,824
And I was like,

1318
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,850
Eh,

1319
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,720
that's incredible.

1320
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,720
That's like five times the
size of the goldfish rule.

1321
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,700
Like the bigger the bowl
of the bigger the fish.

1322
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,860
And that's why Asians
for the most part seem,

1323
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:11,101
you know,

1324
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,450
a little bit smaller built.

1325
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,080
And

1326
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,881
that's interesting.

1327
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:14,340
You know,

1328
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,990
that's very interesting Brian.

1329
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,590
That's a uh,

1330
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,520
an interesting physiological
theory of one that,

1331
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,851
you know,

1332
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,840
people would consider.

1333
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
It's funny if you judge
any group like that,

1334
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,260
say a lot of Asians are small,

1335
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:25,891
all of a sudden you're,

1336
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,280
you,

1337
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,420
you're tipping on the verge of the
swimming pool filled with racism.

1338
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,920
Like you look right there.

1339
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:32,470
What are you saying?

1340
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,810
We say Asians are small,

1341
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:34,490
but they,

1342
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,880
their actual statistics,

1343
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,030
you can look at like the
appetite and weight of them,

1344
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,341
right?

1345
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,480
They are still,

1346
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:39,740
it's,

1347
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,630
it's a weird thing if
you make an observation,

1348
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,450
there's always the danger
of being called a racist.

1349
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,370
Even a little observation.

1350
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,181
It's not,

1351
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:48,860
it's not at all.

1352
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,161
Did it?

1353
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:50,030
A girl from uh,

1354
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Japan and she took me on
a picnic at a dog park.

1355
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,380
That's racist.

1356
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,783
Yes.

1357
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,200
Cause I'm only think
Japanese people even eat dog.

1358
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:01,610
No,

1359
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,443
but

1360
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:03,870
they did.

1361
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,830
But jokes offensive in on many levels.

1362
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,953
Joke sucks.

1363
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,220
Logical level.

1364
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:10,770
Yeah.

1365
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,030
The Jug makes people go,

1366
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,440
people don't need dogs in Japan.

1367
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,090
That's what they do.

1368
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,710
They don't get a whole
audience full of people going,

1369
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,350
you blow your dogs in Japan.

1370
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,870
Yeah.

1371
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,130
That would be the sound in the audience.

1372
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:21,060
People that have dogs in Japan,

1373
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,170
thanks.

1374
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,003
Talks about pan

1375
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,640
that would be accepted.

1376
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:26,170
One Midwest,

1377
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,330
yet dogs and you're paying.

1378
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,050
I know they do.

1379
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,900
It does make sense of what you
said because in another animals,

1380
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:32,770
that is definitely the truth.

1381
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:37,771
Like these guys that I know told me that
they could get me some baby crocodiles.

1382
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,770
I had a giant fish tank and I was
looking for some exotic shit to put in my

1383
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:42,100
head.

1384
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,180
Paranas for a little while.

1385
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,063
Oh man,

1386
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,450
I got bored with them and I
wanted to get some crocodiles.

1387
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,310
It seems like such a bad,

1388
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:48,760
so terrible idea.

1389
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,021
This is what I was saying.

1390
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:50,321
I was saying,

1391
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:50,561
okay,

1392
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:51,394
well how long,

1393
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,170
how big are these
motherfuckers going to get?

1394
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,310
Why would I have crocodiles?

1395
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:55,200
Cause we can get you crocodiles.

1396
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:55,710
I go,

1397
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,511
you can get me crocodile.

1398
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:56,701
I was like,

1399
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,150
well how big are these
crocodiles going to get?

1400
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,661
He goes,

1401
00:37:58,661 --> 00:37:58,781
all,

1402
00:37:58,781 --> 00:37:59,650
you don't have to worry about it.

1403
00:37:59,710 --> 00:37:59,891
I go,

1404
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:00,311
what do you mean?

1405
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:00,551
He goes,

1406
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:01,510
as long as the tank is small,

1407
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:02,344
they won't get big.

1408
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:02,771
I go,

1409
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:03,604
what?

1410
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,930
Really quiet?

1411
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:05,740
No,

1412
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,310
what?

1413
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,790
Yes,

1414
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,121
yes,

1415
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:07,750
yes.

1416
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,141
He said,

1417
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:08,980
how big is your tank?

1418
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,843
It was like,

1419
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,020
I don't remember how big it was,

1420
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,430
but it was about nine feet long.

1421
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:13,750
It was a really big fish tank.

1422
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,340
And he said,

1423
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,640
ah,

1424
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,451
maybe I'm exaggerating.

1425
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,140
Seven feet long.

1426
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,321
Oh,

1427
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,390
that's a really big fish.

1428
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:18,881
It was big.

1429
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:19,714
It was very big.

1430
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,540
He said,

1431
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,850
don't ever get more than a few inches.

1432
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,570
Yeah.

1433
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,110
My uh,

1434
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,501
my dad,

1435
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,334
did you get them?

1436
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,970
No.

1437
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,630
No.

1438
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,890
I think they're super illegal.

1439
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,660
And I didn't know the dude that well.

1440
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:30,130
And what if he was a fucking cop,

1441
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,993
right?

1442
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,113
Yes.

1443
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,370
Dot Rogan's in.

1444
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,780
I got you some crocodiles,

1445
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:35,614
brother.

1446
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,663
My Dad,

1447
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,600
my dad built this huge pond
in the backyard and he got
like one of those like a

1448
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:41,220
hundred,

1449
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,561
uh,

1450
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,130
worth of,

1451
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:42,350
uh,

1452
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:42,761
a hundred,

1453
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,600
like a hundred goldfish at a pet store
and I can almost feed or Goldfish,

1454
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:45,761
you know,

1455
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:48,280
like Shitty goldfish
throws him in the pond.

1456
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,010
He took a couple out and put
it in this other separate pond.

1457
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,890
The fish and the gold
upon are still alive.

1458
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,551
A lot of them were like,

1459
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:57,370
I would probably say like 20 of them
are still alive and now they're huge.

1460
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,140
Like your monster goldfish.

1461
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,760
The other two are normal goldfish.

1462
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,200
Yeah.

1463
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,980
That's amazing.

1464
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,810
Yeah.

1465
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,690
They almost look like a boy.

1466
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,690
Well I think gold coin
goldfish are pretty related.

1467
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,730
Yeah.

1468
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,880
Look Related Shit.

1469
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:11,931
Yeah.

1470
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,700
What is with coys and tattoos?

1471
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,020
What's that supposed to signify?

1472
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,270
The coy becomes a dragon or some shit.

1473
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,590
Everybody's got Koi fish.

1474
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,360
It's Japan thing.

1475
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:22,840
I think some dope ass Japan shit hands.

1476
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,683
She's the legend.

1477
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,460
They figured out tattooing.

1478
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,190
They figured out how
to make like a sleeve.

1479
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,310
They're the ones who first figured
that shit out really to make like big,

1480
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:31,761
big,

1481
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:32,720
bold pieces.

1482
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,351
You know,

1483
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:34,910
like the old days,

1484
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:35,920
you have a Koi fish?

1485
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,471
No,

1486
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:37,251
I don't have any Koi fish.

1487
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:39,890
I do have a drag and
though tiger in a Samurai.

1488
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:40,590
How long ago?

1489
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,840
A lot of Japanese shit.

1490
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,110
This one's six years old and
this one's two years old.

1491
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:45,981
Oh,

1492
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,870
you had that all done at the same time?

1493
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,200
Yeah.

1494
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,560
This dude Aaron Dellavedova
from Guru Tattoo in San Diego.

1495
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:53,480
He's a fucking bad ass artist.

1496
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,643
And um,

1497
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,251
I just,

1498
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:55,790
uh,

1499
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,110
I just always enjoyed tattoos.

1500
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:57,944
I always liked him.

1501
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,130
I think you're wearing
some cool art on your skin,

1502
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:01,981
you know,

1503
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:04,040
and there's a lot of people
attach a lot of weird shit to it.

1504
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,000
Like you don't have to do it.

1505
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,961
But to me,

1506
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:08,600
like I take care of my body and
I'm a healthy and everything,

1507
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:11,330
but I'm want to decorate it
the way I want to give a fuck.

1508
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,900
For some people it's a,

1509
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,410
it's a weird thing.

1510
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,710
So weirds mountain tattoos,

1511
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,960
weird amount tattoos,

1512
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,150
weird people out because
they're permanent.

1513
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,150
You know when you have tattoos it's like
he's willing to do something permanent

1514
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,930
being that some dumb tattoos we got,

1515
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,910
I have Ozzie rules tattooed on my toes.

1516
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,600
Do you really?

1517
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,433
Are you serious?

1518
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,050
Before Ozzie came back like it was,

1519
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,213
that's weird.

1520
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,390
How old were you when you got that?

1521
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,780
26 I was waiting to hear 33 26 27 and uh,

1522
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,810
but it was before the Osbornes and stuff.

1523
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,710
Like it was like,

1524
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,611
yeah.

1525
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:48,911
Yeah,

1526
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,690
it was me and my friend
were talking about we watch

1527
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,030
done it or were you disappointed
once the Osbornes came out?

1528
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,140
Were you like fuck man,

1529
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,160
now it's mainstream?

1530
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,100
Um,

1531
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,611
not really.

1532
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:58,810
I mean it's on my toes,

1533
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:03,010
but it definitely made the joke like
not funny anymore cause you used to see

1534
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,860
like Ozzy written bathroom stall.

1535
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,760
I used to see Ozzy rules
written everywhere.

1536
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,040
Right,

1537
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,270
right.

1538
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,280
And he just didn't see it
anymore and I was like,

1539
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,870
Ozzy still fucking rules man.

1540
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,920
Like we saw this interview with him
on like VH one behind the music,

1541
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:15,760
me and my friend.

1542
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,690
And they asked Ozzy what
the key to happiness was.

1543
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,010
And Ozzy said the key to
happiness is appy knees.

1544
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,091
And they were like,

1545
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:25,630
what?

1546
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,110
And he's like,

1547
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,070
API knees.

1548
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,470
The key to happiness is API knees.

1549
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,030
And I like what?

1550
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:31,760
What are you talking about?

1551
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,710
He stands up and pulls his down and he's
got smiley faces tattooed on his knees

1552
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,401
and he goes,

1553
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:42,401
appy knees happy knees wide.

1554
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,850
I thought it was funny.

1555
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,301
I was like,

1556
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,360
Ozzy rules man.

1557
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,333
Funny.

1558
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,860
Not Funny enough to laugh.

1559
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,180
It's like funny loves to smile.

1560
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,740
I Dunno man.

1561
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,451
Ozzie was pretty,

1562
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,130
he's a pretty funny character.

1563
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,590
He did a lot of crazy shit.

1564
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,791
It's amazing.

1565
00:41:58,791 --> 00:41:59,331
He's still alive,

1566
00:41:59,331 --> 00:41:59,960
isn't it?

1567
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,793
Yeah.

1568
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,900
I mean he's one of those
dudes because they're like,

1569
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,410
wow,

1570
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,243
he made it through.

1571
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:04,570
Uh,

1572
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:04,841
yeah.

1573
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:06,280
And now he's like this mainstream.

1574
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:06,670
Like,

1575
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,580
did you ever think you'd see Ozzy
Osborne doing like a fucking,

1576
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,241
I don't know.

1577
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:10,820
He's didn't like,

1578
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,590
I'm sort of a thing with his wife
and his kids on TV commercials too.

1579
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:16,420
You see them in pretty
mainstream commercial.

1580
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:17,440
Really like fucking,

1581
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:17,921
yeah,

1582
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:19,960
for like direct TV and shit.

1583
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,670
It's weird.

1584
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,481
Or like cars.

1585
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:22,901
Probably,

1586
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:23,201
I don't know.

1587
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:25,480
I don't really pay
attention as we get older,

1588
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,323
say things.

1589
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,790
You know,

1590
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,190
as we get older we're more willing to do

1591
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,250
take shit from crazy people that
we like than we ever were before.

1592
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:36,580
You know,

1593
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,740
like look this Chris Brown dude who,

1594
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:39,160
Oh yeah,

1595
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,240
you got that reality check.

1596
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,860
He sort of making a comeback,

1597
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:42,521
you know,

1598
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:45,970
and it's like all these award shows
and Shit and apparently he's a super

1599
00:42:45,971 --> 00:42:46,804
talented,

1600
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,830
a great singer and there's some people
that are accepting it and some people

1601
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:51,491
not.

1602
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:53,560
And like look at this Micheal Veck thing.

1603
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,030
Michael Vick killed a bunch
of dogs and his back plan it,

1604
00:42:57,031 --> 00:43:00,250
you can't tell me this is the same world
that I grew up in because this is a

1605
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:01,090
different world.

1606
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,260
This is a different world.

1607
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,940
People are stranger world.

1608
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,500
People are getting away with more

1609
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,650
people are more forgiving because more
people are fucking up and doing weird or

1610
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,020
creepy or shit because of
the Internet and stuff.

1611
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:12,321
Man,

1612
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:15,710
the bar is going higher and
higher doing more deviant shit.

1613
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:16,191
So they're like,

1614
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:16,461
well,

1615
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,960
let's not be so hard on that
guy because I don't know,

1616
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,910
maybe I want to fucking try some
of that weird shit or whatever.

1617
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,420
Don't you think that people have bounced
back from Shit that they could've never

1618
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:27,650
bounced back from before?

1619
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,541
You know,

1620
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,470
sports I,

1621
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:31,801
yeah.

1622
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:35,460
I think Michael Vick is definitely
something that wouldn't have happened 25

1623
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:36,294
years ago.

1624
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,380
I'm shocked.

1625
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:38,911
But I mean,

1626
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:39,990
when you're that like,

1627
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,410
yeah,

1628
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,660
I think the morals of the,

1629
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,010
our entire cultures have just
been eroded a little bit.

1630
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,240
Like,

1631
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,073
yeah,

1632
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,980
I don't think that would
have been acceptable in the,

1633
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:52,800
in the early eighties like it would,

1634
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,451
it's,

1635
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:53,640
it's,

1636
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:53,940
it's,

1637
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,710
it's also fun.

1638
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,610
You have a guide that talented to who can,

1639
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,360
you know?

1640
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,691
But yeah,

1641
00:43:57,691 --> 00:43:58,021
I just,

1642
00:43:58,021 --> 00:43:58,351
I don't,

1643
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,990
I don't think money overrode everything

1644
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,710
25 years ago.

1645
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,860
Could you imagine if
Clinton was in office today?

1646
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,571
Oh Man.

1647
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:12,571
Jim Magic Twitter messages that like
interns would be throwing back and forth

1648
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:18,340
because he would get busted for
sure if it was an office today.

1649
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:18,630
Yeah.

1650
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,051
Yeah.

1651
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:20,650
I think about the crazy shit that dude did

1652
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,420
so many more avenues of him.

1653
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:23,254
Like a,

1654
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,410
he was always my,

1655
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,280
my proof.

1656
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:25,891
You know,

1657
00:44:25,891 --> 00:44:26,321
like when,

1658
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:28,610
when he got his dick sucked by that check,

1659
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:29,361
I was always like,

1660
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:30,081
God damn it.

1661
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:31,170
I fucking knew it.

1662
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,273
I knew it.

1663
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,140
I knew they have to be
crazy to get in there.

1664
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,540
You can't really be that
guy you're selling man.

1665
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:37,320
You can't,

1666
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,840
you're not going to have the kind of
[inaudible] likes blowjobs though,

1667
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:40,081
man.

1668
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:40,321
Yeah,

1669
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:40,810
yeah.

1670
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,790
Everybody explode exposures.

1671
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,010
But Clinton would just whip
his dick out on people.

1672
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,420
He would just get alone with girls.

1673
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:48,210
Just whip his dick out
cause he got out of control.

1674
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:49,260
He was a maniac.

1675
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,990
He's a fucking savage who got blossom.

1676
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,290
Just one of those dudes just
couldn't help it swaying.

1677
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,430
I can't help a swine.

1678
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,420
I saw the pitch.

1679
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,160
There comes,

1680
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,930
he just loved it.

1681
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:01,471
Yeah.

1682
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:03,780
I mean there were a lot of
chicks doing that to him.

1683
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,630
Could you imagine if
he existed during the,

1684
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:06,464
you know,

1685
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,940
the days of Wiener Gate?

1686
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:09,631
Fuck yeah.

1687
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:10,500
It could have been set up.

1688
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,300
I bet he liked Geraldo.

1689
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,230
I bet he likes to get drunk
and Bang State troopers,

1690
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,390
hot police troopers.

1691
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,470
How hot would not be in
the back of a police car.

1692
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,400
That's a lot of girls.

1693
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,361
A lot of girls.

1694
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:24,900
I bet.

1695
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,280
I bet it's pussy output tripled after
that Monica Lewinsky thing because there's

1696
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:31,470
a lot of girls that just want to let
him know and then keep their mouth shut.

1697
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:31,711
Listen,

1698
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,910
I know you had that problem with Monica,

1699
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,770
but you know when she's a little
girl and it's not me and I'm,

1700
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,620
I'm a grown woman and I wanted to want
what I want to do and I don't need

1701
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,020
anything other than you and my
mouth and that's the end of it.

1702
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:41,080
And he blew it.

1703
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,010
He was just dropping
loads on dresses and shit.

1704
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:52,280
He wasn't even and assistant,

1705
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,430
she'd get rid of the evidence.

1706
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,670
Maybe this could make people in
another part of the world is my DNA.

1707
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,660
We can't have that.

1708
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:00,480
Yeah,

1709
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,470
he was a freak though.

1710
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,630
Stuck in the fucking
cigars and bitches pussy.

1711
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,140
I don't know if it was
a good president round.

1712
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,033
I don't know.

1713
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,360
Maybe when he was in,

1714
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,030
he was when he was on the show.

1715
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,790
The writers had it
written in a more happy,

1716
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:18,110
friendly Wa and I thought you were
insinuating he did your podcasts,

1717
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:18,910
your,

1718
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,550
you imagine he was on the show,

1719
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,231
get him on the show.

1720
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:23,730
I am the President for eight years,

1721
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,613
dad.

1722
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,860
And it was a,

1723
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,360
for the most part laughs.

1724
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,410
Good guy in there.

1725
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,150
I mean there's only been though Buzzy,

1726
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:33,660
I don't know.

1727
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:33,841
No,

1728
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:35,190
Obama is probably a good guy.

1729
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:36,420
I don't know if any of them are good guys.

1730
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,254
I don't,

1731
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,620
I'm not sure what I'm going to do
anything fucked up shit to get that far.

1732
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:40,951
Yeah,

1733
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:41,460
I don't,

1734
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,870
I don't think you could be
just some regular fucking
dude with some unique ideas

1735
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,270
and get all the way to be president.

1736
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,890
You have to have compromise
yourself so deeply along the lines.

1737
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,930
And obviously I've done no research
whatsoever to substantiate any of these

1738
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:53,731
claims and stuff.

1739
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:57,990
This is just talking shit at 10 o'clock
in the evening after being in the hot

1740
00:46:57,991 --> 00:46:59,400
sun all day and barely able to talk.

1741
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,330
Um,

1742
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,870
I don't know.

1743
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,010
I don't believe it though.

1744
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,750
Do you believe that like a
good guy can make it this far?

1745
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:07,730
Now do you think you have to say,

1746
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,740
do they ultimately agreed to letting
unspeakable things happen on the regular?

1747
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:15,241
I mean,

1748
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,074
you have to,

1749
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,813
I want to say anything.

1750
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,050
You just think,

1751
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:19,330
oh,

1752
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,000
it'd be even rewrite the script.

1753
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,860
Everyone entity.

1754
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,960
A lot of people don't
believe that that's the case.

1755
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,790
A lot of people believe that
it was Lee Harvey Oswald

1756
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,280
and he got lucky and that people
make a big deal out of nothing.

1757
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:33,681
Yeah,

1758
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:34,514
maybe.

1759
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,503
Yeah,

1760
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,393
maybe.

1761
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:37,821
I mean,

1762
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:38,061
I,

1763
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:38,780
you know,

1764
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,650
Kennedy,

1765
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,150
Martin Luther King,

1766
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:41,960
both Kennedy,

1767
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,010
I mean it just seems like anybody who's
kind of like steering us towards some

1768
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:50,030
decent change winds up with their
fucking head blown off by a fucking crazy

1769
00:47:50,031 --> 00:47:50,864
gunman.

1770
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,700
Even John Lennon Dude,

1771
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:52,881
like,

1772
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:53,181
I mean,

1773
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:55,010
that could have started a revolution.

1774
00:47:55,011 --> 00:47:55,550
He was like,

1775
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,550
the web isn't a popular guy

1776
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:58,831
is,

1777
00:47:58,831 --> 00:47:59,041
it is.

1778
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:03,990
It's so tempting to fall into the idea
of conspiracy and collusion and it's very

1779
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:04,471
sexy.

1780
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:05,304
It's very tempting.

1781
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,090
But I mean there's no,

1782
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:08,950
it doesn't seem like there's
balance on the other side.

1783
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:09,071
Like,

1784
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,870
why didn't Nixon ever gets shot?

1785
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,351
Or like,

1786
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,400
I mean Reagan did.

1787
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,330
I guess that's a,

1788
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,500
you mean balance on the [inaudible]?

1789
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:14,721
Yeah,

1790
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:14,911
right.

1791
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:15,021
Yeah.

1792
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:15,500
You know,

1793
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,270
he was one of the most raw raw wall,

1794
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,140
but like,

1795
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:18,920
I dunno,

1796
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,431
it seems like,

1797
00:48:19,431 --> 00:48:21,210
you know Gandhi like yours.

1798
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:21,551
No.

1799
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,560
Well Shane,

1800
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,140
he didn't never got fucking shot
at because he was on team psycho.

1801
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,330
And is it possible that the psychos on,

1802
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,220
they're always going to be four tab?

1803
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,551
Yeah,

1804
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:34,520
they target the guys who are for
peace and love and change course.

1805
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,620
They went after Reagan.

1806
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:37,950
I wonder.

1807
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:38,660
Reagan might have been

1808
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,493
been,

1809
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,480
maybe that was a random thing.

1810
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:44,930
Maybe that really wasn't planned because
he didn't die or maybe they're just

1811
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:45,980
sending them a message.

1812
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,370
Shoot you in the Gulch and
watching that on TV going,

1813
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,111
God damn,

1814
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:54,410
they shot that actor dude
as now the president,

1815
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,760
somebody has a joke.

1816
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:56,630
It was a little kid.

1817
00:48:56,631 --> 00:48:57,464
You know,

1818
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,570
him and Leslie,

1819
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,460
like if he never became president,

1820
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,400
he would have the same career
that Leslie Nielsen had.

1821
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,310
I forget who

1822
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,180
fucking joke it is.

1823
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:06,451
Oh,

1824
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:07,284
that's brilliant.

1825
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,041
So true.

1826
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,330
Bedtime for Bonzo.

1827
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,253
Did you ever see that?

1828
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,001
I don't know.

1829
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:12,511
I mean,

1830
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:13,890
I'm an engineer with a monkey.

1831
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,161
Yeah.

1832
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:14,994
Yeah.

1833
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,601
He did.

1834
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:16,610
A couple wasn't there?

1835
00:49:16,611 --> 00:49:17,840
There's a couple of bonds.

1836
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:17,971
Oh,

1837
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:18,870
movies aren't there?

1838
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,033
I think so.

1839
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:20,910
I Dunno.

1840
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,390
I Dunno.

1841
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,370
I never watched like five
seconds of it and go,

1842
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:25,590
what the fuck is anything
more than one monkey movie?

1843
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:28,800
It just shouldn't be legal that if
you're a person who is a professional

1844
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:32,430
pretender that you go on to be the
guy who tells the truth to the nation.

1845
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,720
That just seems ridiculous.

1846
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:33,990
Well,

1847
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,640
you're awesome at lying.

1848
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:35,991
Yeah.

1849
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:36,261
Well,

1850
00:49:36,261 --> 00:49:36,861
it was just like,

1851
00:49:36,861 --> 00:49:37,970
I don't think now him,

1852
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:41,120
I don't think he made one decision and
the whole time I think there were people,

1853
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:43,400
there was like Dick Cheney
was telling him what to say.

1854
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:43,611
Look,

1855
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:46,340
there was a commission of
fucking assholes who were like,

1856
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:46,620
all right,

1857
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,550
this is what we're doing.

1858
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,780
Here's the script.

1859
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,951
You're an actor,

1860
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:50,650
act.

1861
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,680
You know what I'd love to make?

1862
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,950
Loves him out through the door.

1863
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,470
He's responsible for one little speech.

1864
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,760
That is one of my favorite speeches of
any president because he talks about how

1865
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:04,761
would we respond if we were all on
this earth facing a threat from another

1866
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:06,324
world.

1867
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:06,780
You know,

1868
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,620
how would we respond?

1869
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,600
How quickly would we
forget our differences?

1870
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:10,291
And I'm like,

1871
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:10,950
damn,

1872
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,783
that's brilliant.

1873
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,541
It's so true.

1874
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,850
It's a great speech and it makes you go,

1875
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:16,440
what the fuck does he know?

1876
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:16,831
Well,

1877
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:17,110
yeah.

1878
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,650
What was he really into
the fucking Star Wars Shit.

1879
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,390
Like he wanted to make that,

1880
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:21,681
you know,

1881
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,050
that missile defense system start
like maybe the aliens who were like,

1882
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:25,471
Hey man,

1883
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:27,030
we're going to fuck with you guys soon.

1884
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,771
I don't know.

1885
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,180
Who knows what's going on with all that.

1886
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,310
George Lucas during
the star wars thing go,

1887
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,731
hey,

1888
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,110
this is copyright and friends.

1889
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,123
Did He,

1890
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,301
what,

1891
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:37,790
why were they allowed to
car wars program program?

1892
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:38,870
Um,

1893
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,310
I guess because they're not,

1894
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,750
they're allowed to do anything want,

1895
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,340
I don't know their government,

1896
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,800
but they're not doing it for like profit.

1897
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:46,970
Yeah.

1898
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,331
You know,

1899
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,380
it's a defense.

1900
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,351
You know,

1901
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:49,820
there's a,

1902
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,130
uh,

1903
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:50,640
um,

1904
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,640
some big conspiracy theory about people
who created star wars that the strategic

1905
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:57,991
defense system,

1906
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:58,520
Star Wars,

1907
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,040
yeah.

1908
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,660
That it was all bullshit and that the
scientists one by one had been killed off

1909
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,930
apparently 22 different scientists who
worked on it were killed in a strange

1910
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:09,750
ways.

1911
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,470
He's serious.

1912
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,270
His Fist reation suffocation,

1913
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:13,980
decapitation death leap,

1914
00:51:13,981 --> 00:51:14,521
death leave,

1915
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:15,510
shotgun blast,

1916
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,270
missing person auto accident
over and over again.

1917
00:51:18,271 --> 00:51:19,410
All these different scientists.

1918
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,470
I don't want this coordinate
according to the Internet.

1919
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,693
Oh,

1920
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,530
operated by more than,

1921
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:27,041
listen man,

1922
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,670
I didn't at first thing I
went to on Google did start.

1923
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,050
I'm going to regurgitate that as fact.

1924
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:32,884
Just go for it.

1925
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:38,670
20 to 22 Sdi researchers all
supposedly 22 out of how many out?

1926
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,613
It's a good question,

1927
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,730
but 22 periods.

1928
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,220
A lot.

1929
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,150
Let's say if there's a hundred
comedians started dying,

1930
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:48,760
like I'd fucking skipped town.

1931
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:49,331
Yeah,

1932
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:50,260
that'd be gross.

1933
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,700
Would be hundreds.

1934
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,290
How many people you would
think that would be,

1935
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,660
what if they,

1936
00:51:55,661 --> 00:51:56,494
uh,

1937
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:57,603
if they did that,

1938
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,150
if they started killing comedian?

1939
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,570
Yeah.

1940
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:01,811
Oh,

1941
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:04,780
I was just saying if 22 comedians
died in suspicious ways,

1942
00:52:04,781 --> 00:52:05,614
I would fucking,

1943
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,030
you know,

1944
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:06,401
that's a,

1945
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:08,080
that's too big of a number for one.

1946
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,130
But I've out of all the,

1947
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,310
we'll get a puppet immediately out of
all the scientists that were involved in

1948
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:12,350
it.

1949
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:12,641
I'm sorry,

1950
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,860
my question was do you think
there was like 300 guys?

1951
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:17,260
Like how many different guys do you
think were working for this star wars

1952
00:52:17,261 --> 00:52:18,094
company?

1953
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,210
Was it a thousand people
with lives and yeah,

1954
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,490
I would say that even if it sounds that
would be from this janitor wanting to

1955
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:26,790
kill themselves while oh yeah.

1956
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,323
Or just disappear.

1957
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,990
As the number becomes bigger and bigger,

1958
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:31,150
it becomes more and more silly.

1959
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,500
You start looking at and go,

1960
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:33,970
well there was a million scientists,

1961
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:35,050
22 killed themselves.

1962
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,010
A bunch of them.

1963
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,430
Like there wouldn't be that
many that had like crazy.

1964
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,940
Not everybody has like
crazy security levels.

1965
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:44,230
Like you would have to kill everybody.

1966
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:46,370
Like every guy gets screwed
in a fucking light bulb.

1967
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,630
You would though.

1968
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,810
Cause maybe what was going
on was so fucking obvious.

1969
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,070
You had a clean house.

1970
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,670
This is the conspiracy
theory during me most

1971
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,520
step back and do my Alex
Jones voice we've got,

1972
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:01,070
here's a situation where special ops,

1973
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,450
what they're doing is they're
victimizing innocent people.

1974
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,980
That's fucking good,

1975
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:08,520
man.

1976
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,353
Thank you.

1977
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:09,990
I mean,

1978
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,823
did you hear them all?

1979
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,430
100% of the signs created
crystal Pepsi Guide.

1980
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,473
Shut the fuck.

1981
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,530
Uh,

1982
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,080
could you imagine if that is true?

1983
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:19,530
That what if there,

1984
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:19,921
I mean we're,

1985
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:20,111
we're,

1986
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:22,320
we know there's 22 scientists that died.

1987
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,080
We need to find out how many
there were making a documentary.

1988
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:25,943
Did you hear about a

1989
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,270
hydro collider thing?

1990
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:31,140
That guy I should go to Snopes for all
of this is what I should do then is the

1991
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,550
guy that might be a need from the future.

1992
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,130
Arrested at the collider.

1993
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,700
Uh,

1994
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,533
last week.

1995
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,080
Yeah.

1996
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,490
Some guy was arrested at the,

1997
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,000
what's it called?

1998
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,920
The hydrogen large Hadron Collider.

1999
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:41,370
Yeah.

2000
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,650
He was arrested because I don't know why,

2001
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,401
what he was doing,

2002
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:47,300
but he was said he was
from the future dummy.

2003
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,761
Oh,

2004
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,594
that's funny.

2005
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,310
Was he just crazy or was he from,

2006
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,150
I don't know.

2007
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,141
I just thought it headline.

2008
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,220
What a goofy fuck.

2009
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,900
That'd be so that's a funny idea.

2010
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,180
Show up there and a silver suit.

2011
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,840
You just have to ask him a few more
questions and there'll be pretty clear.

2012
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:03,091
Oh,

2013
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:04,140
you come from in the future.

2014
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:04,860
Okay.

2015
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,810
What am I right to?

2016
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,010
There was one guy with a website.

2017
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,910
There was a fuck,

2018
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,030
I forget the um,

2019
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,100
the scam g two t tour somewhere.

2020
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:17,530
I think they were calling themselves
something t tour from the future and yet

2021
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,680
they have this whole John [inaudible],

2022
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,810
t I t u r and some whole thing about how
he described how the civilization was

2023
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,200
going to fall apart and he had come from
the future to write and get the fuck

2024
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,660
out,

2025
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,400
man.

2026
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,490
Stop John t toward whatever it is.

2027
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:33,030
It's just,

2028
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,690
you really think that someone came from
the fucking future and came back to the

2029
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:37,290
past.

2030
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,340
You really think that it's just,

2031
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,870
that's what time travel's
going to be alike.

2032
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,141
Yeah,

2033
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,190
it was Nicholas Cage.

2034
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:41,911
You see that shit.

2035
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,090
Now they're saying that,

2036
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:43,381
that,

2037
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:46,790
that Nicholas cage is a time traveler
because there's a photo or something like

2038
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,390
John crew sack bro.

2039
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,710
Huh?

2040
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,640
Not they have Nicolas Cage.

2041
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,850
They have John Cusack cause he,

2042
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,640
he never looked at the older,

2043
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:53,941
oh,

2044
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:54,271
you know,

2045
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:54,750
I'm sorry.

2046
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:54,931
No,

2047
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:55,830
not even John Cusack.

2048
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,390
The other dude from the Matrix,

2049
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,501
Keanu Reeves,

2050
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,030
Yana Reeves cannot reuse.

2051
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:01,260
They have him at the time machine.

2052
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,760
They're always saying that he's a vampire.

2053
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,123
Ever gets old.

2054
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,410
Yeah.

2055
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,670
He's beautiful man.

2056
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,800
It's like 50 depths holding up.

2057
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:08,231
Okay.

2058
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:09,280
If he's holding up pretty good.

2059
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:09,500
Good,

2060
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:09,721
good.

2061
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:11,070
Both have kind of Indian blood,

2062
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,270
fresh pussy like vampires,

2063
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:18,360
the pussy that's constantly
swan diving under their cock.

2064
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:20,670
Every time they poke it
out the house for some air,

2065
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,650
put it through their mail slot and it
goes cage might be a vampire or so,

2066
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:26,730
one believer says,

2067
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,240
oh,

2068
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:27,830
photo,

2069
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,350
I'm from an old ass photo
that looks like Nicholas Cage.

2070
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,640
It's creepy.

2071
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,001
Wow.

2072
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:33,834
That's pretty dope.

2073
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,393
I was removed.

2074
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,280
He's in a most powerful empires kiss.

2075
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:39,114
That's pretty funny.

2076
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,680
The ghost rider,

2077
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,514
Bro.

2078
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,020
Did you see ghost writers saw that?

2079
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,220
No.

2080
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,000
It's terrible,

2081
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,590
but it's good if you're high and you know,

2082
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:51,591
it's terrible if you're like ready for
a terrible fucking ghost motorcycle

2083
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:52,830
superhero movie.

2084
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,640
Yeah.

2085
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,480
You have little girls,

2086
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:54,771
right?

2087
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:55,190
Yeah.

2088
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,860
Um,

2089
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,230
did you ever watch the
tooth fairy with the rock?

2090
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,790
The tooth fairy to rock?

2091
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:00,331
Yeah.

2092
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:00,720
No,

2093
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,740
I missed that one.

2094
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,461
That's a,

2095
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:03,600
I watched that man.

2096
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,650
Why did you watch that?

2097
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,030
Because it was like late.

2098
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,250
I took mushrooms with my and uh,

2099
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,140
and it was just that kind of like after
we're done tripping but we're still

2100
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,461
like,

2101
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:12,294
you know,

2102
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,480
up and hanging out and that was
coming on Hbr and we're like fuck it,

2103
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:16,081
let's watch it.

2104
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,360
It's probably good for a few laughs.

2105
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:19,980
And we had to,

2106
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:20,790
uh,

2107
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,130
we had to rewind it like 40 minutes
in because we couldn't follow what

2108
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,550
was going on.

2109
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,510
Like it's baffling.

2110
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,310
Like there's so many holes in it.

2111
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:30,220
Like he has this
relationship with this woman,

2112
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,370
but you don't know if they're
married and there's these kids,

2113
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,421
it's weird,

2114
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:35,920
like you don't know his
relationship to the,

2115
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:37,180
it's not his wife and kids,

2116
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:41,260
but like he's hanging around there
and he never kisses the woman

2117
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,013
and,

2118
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,450
and then he somehow like,

2119
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,690
it's never really clear on why
he turns into a tooth fairy.

2120
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:49,211
Like he said,

2121
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:49,831
something like that,

2122
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:52,680
the tooth fairy is bullshit
bullshitted kid like at one point.

2123
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,160
And then all of a sudden he's like in
this weird tooth fairy land and he's got

2124
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,150
to be very,

2125
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,680
it's kind of like,

2126
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,450
it's,

2127
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,510
it sounds awesome.

2128
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,110
And then Billy crystal makes an
appearance and I totally called it like,

2129
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,690
because he like goes through
tooth fairy training,

2130
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:09,871
you know,

2131
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:13,620
learning how to fly all fucking
bumping into the tooth fairy training.

2132
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,181
Well yeah,

2133
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:14,541
it's like,

2134
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:14,781
yeah,

2135
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,231
it's like,

2136
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,064
you know,

2137
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,710
where's tooth fairy land in his brain?

2138
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:20,680
He probably just got hit
on the head or something.

2139
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:22,310
And this was all in his head.

2140
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,020
That was really the plot.

2141
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,100
Yeah.

2142
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,580
Yeah.

2143
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,500
And then he turns into the tooth fairy

2144
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,370
and uh,

2145
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,810
and then like we were
watching it and it's like,

2146
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,281
and I was like,

2147
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:34,640
all right,

2148
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,360
Billy,

2149
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,530
Billy Crystal's old Jew characters
going to make an appearance or what be

2150
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:42,080
Goldberg or like somebody like that.

2151
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:43,250
And then fucking right there,

2152
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,200
Billy crystal comes down this ladder like,

2153
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:45,651
okay,

2154
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:46,820
hold your horses,

2155
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:47,151
hold you.

2156
00:57:47,151 --> 00:57:49,970
And he gives him some books
on how to be a tooth fairy.

2157
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:50,804
And,

2158
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,840
and then he like turns into the
tooth fairy randomly like ob,

2159
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,010
it,

2160
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,843
uh,

2161
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,391
you know,

2162
00:57:56,391 --> 00:58:00,290
out in public in this
wings just spurt out.

2163
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,170
I feel like I'm losing momentum

2164
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,350
trying to get it.

2165
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,270
You've got me in a trend
is you got me in a trance.

2166
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:07,320
That sounds ridiculous.

2167
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,000
It's really absurd,

2168
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:09,991
but when you have kids,

2169
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,280
you understand ridiculous.

2170
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,001
Keeps quiet,

2171
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:12,834
man.

2172
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,691
It keeps moving,

2173
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:14,530
but there's no,

2174
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,270
there aren't a lot of dots connected.

2175
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:16,511
We were like,

2176
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:16,721
wait,

2177
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:17,501
how do we get from here?

2178
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:17,800
It's like,

2179
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,520
oh,

2180
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,810
you just needed to get from here to here.

2181
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,380
So you just put some thing in the middle.

2182
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,214
Yeah.

2183
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:23,640
Yeah.

2184
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,600
It's really like,

2185
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,720
now I'm going to see it
to be waiting for that.

2186
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,001
I wonder.

2187
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:29,010
We're waiting for the whole,

2188
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:29,971
Oh,

2189
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:30,990
it's renal.

2190
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:31,831
You doing something.

2191
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:34,050
I'm trying to open
another root beer barrel,

2192
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:37,750
but I can't figure out how you
silly silly dad can't figure.

2193
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,270
We got to change these microphones.

2194
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:40,051
These microphones are too.

2195
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:40,980
God Damn sensitive.

2196
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,880
You're doing a down by your deck and we
were hearing it as if cracklin resume.

2197
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:45,211
I know.

2198
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:46,020
Sorry.

2199
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,100
These are the bags.

2200
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,700
The volcano bags I gave
up on that volcano.

2201
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:51,091
Well,

2202
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:53,820
most people shouldn't be trying
to open up our candy during a,

2203
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,021
what'd you say,

2204
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:55,310
Brian?

2205
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,670
That that kind of Mike
would be worse though.

2206
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,361
Oh really?

2207
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:57,830
Yeah.

2208
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,261
Cause these are,

2209
00:58:58,261 --> 00:58:59,430
you're supposed to talk into it.

2210
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,893
These are picking up every,

2211
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,620
here we go.

2212
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,090
That does at times a million.

2213
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,691
No,

2214
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:03,870
no,

2215
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:03,991
no.

2216
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:04,680
It's less.

2217
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,610
That's less Brian.

2218
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:06,840
Those are more vocal miles.

2219
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,370
Yeah,

2220
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,130
it's less.

2221
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:08,281
No,

2222
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:08,840
we tried it.

2223
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,800
Remember it picked up
way less ambient noise.

2224
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,390
That's our next move.

2225
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,261
As we expand,

2226
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,350
we're going to move this thing out into,

2227
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,860
I'm going to get an office
space at the Ice House.

2228
00:59:16,861 --> 00:59:17,250
Right?

2229
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:17,431
Well,

2230
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:18,420
we've got to do that too.

2231
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,433
We've got to do that too.

2232
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,280
But what we're to do with the ice houses,

2233
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:25,970
we want to set it up so the comics getting
offstage and going onstage can have a

2234
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,320
little different podcasts,

2235
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,210
not my podcast,

2236
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,320
but we're going to call it like
an evening at the ice house.

2237
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:30,790
Right.

2238
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:31,280
Habits.

2239
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,780
Just whatever comic is there,

2240
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,290
you know,

2241
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,150
within reason they hosted or whatever.

2242
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,130
They just figured out.

2243
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,330
It's just the reserve.

2244
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,580
Yeah.

2245
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,480
Brian's in town.

2246
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:38,660
He'll,

2247
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,350
he'll,

2248
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,183
he'll sit on it.

2249
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,360
Whoever the fuck is in town and
we just keep rotating comics.

2250
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,370
Like get off sick.

2251
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,530
Yeah,

2252
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,363
it'd be awesome.

2253
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,360
It'd be great for all of us.

2254
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:48,194
That'll be a lot of fun.

2255
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,790
That whole night with this stuff that
you and hour talking about siding.

2256
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,421
It's great,

2257
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:54,050
right?

2258
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:54,741
We want to go there.

2259
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:55,610
There's a place,

2260
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:56,810
the ice house in Pasadena,

2261
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,100
it's this really cool old club.

2262
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:01,160
It's been around for like 35 years
and they have this little tiny room.

2263
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,170
They just have like the 50th anniversary.

2264
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,543
That's insane.

2265
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,650
That's insane.

2266
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,710
50 smothers brothers and
shit performed there.

2267
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,580
There are a lot of albums recorded there,

2268
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:13,070
like if you're at a thrift store
and go through old comedy albums,

2269
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,030
that's amazing.

2270
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,720
Pat's hall.

2271
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,321
It's a great,

2272
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,500
great club and there's two rooms.

2273
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:17,540
She was the big room,

2274
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,530
which is very small.

2275
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,420
It's only 185 people and then there's the,

2276
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,411
or somewhere around there,

2277
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:22,100
right?

2278
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,460
One 85 one 97 was a perfect
size room by the way.

2279
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,880
Amazing set up.

2280
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,540
It's amazing setup and then there's
another room is really small.

2281
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:30,770
It's only like 85 people,

2282
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,030
90 people.

2283
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,491
And we,

2284
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:33,350
we've been doing that.

2285
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:36,290
We've been doing subsets there
and Brendan and I and Brian,

2286
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,630
Brian and one Friday out,

2287
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,980
magical came down and already went up.

2288
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,840
And you guys have one this Friday?

2289
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,820
Every Friday.

2290
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,181
Yeah.

2291
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:43,740
And uh,

2292
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:43,980
we're,

2293
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,160
we're going to start doing that on a
regular basis and as soon as I'm done with

2294
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:46,971
this fear factor stuff,

2295
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:47,960
which should be pretty soon,

2296
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,850
then we're going to move forward in
different dynamic podcast directions.

2297
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,020
So we'll call it a,

2298
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,780
an evening at the ice house or something
along those lines we ever talked about

2299
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,470
that.

2300
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:01,400
Remember when we brought up how David
Letterman social security number was on

2301
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:04,670
the wall and we went
there the following day.

2302
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:04,941
Yeah.

2303
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:08,780
We don't know whether or not that really
is still his social security number.

2304
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,530
Will they change it?

2305
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,640
Like it got out there,

2306
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,123
they put it back up,

2307
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,293
they block it out.

2308
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,580
They made a copy of it and it looks like
the idea that they're real one or they

2309
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:17,414
did something.

2310
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,293
It's gone now though.

2311
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:18,630
Well,

2312
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:18,990
we,

2313
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,360
we pointed it out to them.

2314
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,250
We're like,

2315
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:21,590
you know,

2316
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,620
you can see David Letterman social
security number on this contract.

2317
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,311
And they were like,

2318
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:26,000
no way.

2319
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,833
Like yeah,

2320
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,220
there's a picture of his contract.

2321
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:29,403
Yeah,

2322
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,070
we paid him.

2323
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,210
Oh,

2324
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,541
okay.

2325
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,500
Near the bathroom.

2326
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,390
A couple of different ones.

2327
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,021
Yeah.

2328
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:38,060
And that one actually has a
social security number on it.

2329
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,140
That's insane.

2330
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,263
It's ridiculous.

2331
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,500
Steals identity.

2332
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,640
Well that's what Brian or he did.

2333
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:45,853
He's trying to like,

2334
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,160
like viruses and shit.

2335
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:54,161
Like how I assume anybody
who knows anything about
computers can hack and all my

2336
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:54,471
shit.

2337
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:55,730
Cause I don't know anything.

2338
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:57,470
I'm really naive.

2339
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,610
I could do dumb shit,

2340
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,590
just trache shit.

2341
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:05,450
But there's kids right now that are
growing up from the time they're little

2342
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:05,991
kids.

2343
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:10,991
They've been fucking with hacking into
the registry and fucking with things and

2344
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:15,320
reading on forums and finding out how
to do things and working on coding.

2345
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,240
And there's wizards out there,

2346
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:17,450
man.

2347
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,190
I know they speak a language.

2348
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,100
We can't even

2349
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,540
fucking wrap our heads around.

2350
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,090
There was a documentary on one small area,

2351
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:25,050
I think it was a rush out.

2352
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,750
I forget what eastern bloc country it was,

2353
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,651
what they had.

2354
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:29,070
Um,

2355
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,401
this,

2356
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:29,670
uh,

2357
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:34,550
one town where they have
a disproportionate amount
of internet scammers and

2358
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,190
virus makers and people stealing
credit card numbers in there.

2359
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,510
We're all just drive in
Mercedes back at Fraley.

2360
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:39,761
Yeah.

2361
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:41,130
All these computer people,

2362
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,750
they just fucking hack the matrix.

2363
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,621
Found like,

2364
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:43,920
uh,

2365
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,150
an area like we're oil would come up
drilled into it and the oil was coming up

2366
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:49,050
in there one spot.

2367
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:49,740
Ah,

2368
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,401
it's amazing,

2369
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:51,234
you know.

2370
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,583
Wow.

2371
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:56,430
I told just identity theft and shit and
it was a lot of that going on for sure.

2372
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,530
There's a lot of,

2373
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:57,900
I mean,

2374
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,770
cyber crime.

2375
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:01,110
I would like to know
the statistics of what,

2376
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:01,471
you know,

2377
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:03,640
what has happened since
the Internet existed.

2378
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:05,460
Like it's crime up as crime down.

2379
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,730
What kind of crime is more
prevalent now that there's a,

2380
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,420
you know,

2381
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,820
little online things
that can rip people off?

2382
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:12,873
Yeah.

2383
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:13,781
Probably some,

2384
01:03:13,781 --> 01:03:14,614
like,

2385
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,143
I don't know.

2386
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,560
You're not leaving a paper trail,

2387
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,191
if anything.

2388
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:20,820
So if you just go in and move
numbers from one place to him,

2389
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,520
it just would scare the fucking shit
out of me to think that you would have

2390
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,020
anything important on why,

2391
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,483
you know?

2392
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,091
Yeah.

2393
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:27,601
I'm pretty,

2394
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:27,811
I mean,

2395
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,960
I guess that's one good thing
of not really being a techie.

2396
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,370
Like I don't get excited about,

2397
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:33,660
I don't have anything.

2398
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,440
Somebody could steal my laptop tomorrow
and they wouldn't really know any more

2399
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:39,270
about me than if they
stole one of my notebook.

2400
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,210
Yeah.

2401
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,490
I always look at websites
that are up and I said,

2402
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:45,160
these are only up because
someone didn't target you.

2403
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,203
That's it.

2404
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,600
Right.

2405
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,433
It's not like,

2406
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:47,820
oh,

2407
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,210
I could do anything about it.

2408
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:50,050
What are you going to do about it?

2409
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:50,920
You're not gonna do shit.

2410
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,880
It's like there's a,

2411
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,370
it's a wild west out there in some ways.

2412
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:54,611
I mean,

2413
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:58,290
they can track some people down if they're
really sloppy and they find out the

2414
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,070
people that do certain things
that shouldn't be doing,

2415
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,550
but for the most part it's,

2416
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:02,800
it's pretty fucking crazy,

2417
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,460
you know?

2418
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:03,671
Well,

2419
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:08,671
those guys like the anonymous
and who laws sec those like they,

2420
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,290
I was pretty amused by
what they were doing.

2421
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,060
Scary where it's like,

2422
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:13,923
oh fuck.

2423
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,380
It's like if they can fuck
with Sony for like a week,

2424
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,450
what could they do to meet their,

2425
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:20,800
putting some of those
dudes in jail though.

2426
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:21,851
It'd be like,

2427
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:23,500
well that's the other thing
you're going to get fucking,

2428
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,300
you don't get away with that kind of shit.

2429
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,550
This is going to be like
a government agencies.

2430
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,390
It's going to be a bad ass documentary
that we'll be able to watch and like 10

2431
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:32,224
years.

2432
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,900
Like if you ever watched a documentary
on the weather underground.

2433
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:35,711
Yeah,

2434
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:39,070
I saw radical hippie movement and
the sixties wanted to get rid of the

2435
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:41,800
government and it's fascinating
fucking documentary.

2436
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,210
That's what this is going to be like.

2437
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,350
You know,

2438
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,810
a decade from now when
we're even more oppressed,

2439
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:51,990
we'll look back at the time that the
internet and it almost rose before the

2440
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,153
Institute of the
censorship on the Internet,

2441
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,170
that would really lock everything down.

2442
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,440
That would either lock everything
down or cause a civil war.

2443
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,600
It'd be that would be the final push.

2444
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,880
If the government regulated the Internet,

2445
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:08,881
the way the FCC regulates television or
the way they regulate radio or anything.

2446
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,270
If they're like told you what,

2447
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:10,751
you couldn't,

2448
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:12,430
couldn't put out that Ooh,

2449
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,710
because that's where
it all got out of hand.

2450
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:19,660
Everything was doing great until the
and the nineties came along and all of a

2451
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:22,990
sudden people were getting their
information from different places.

2452
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,130
They were getting it from a fucking
computer with that Wiki leaks guy.

2453
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:27,431
I mean,

2454
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:28,720
aren't they essentially like,

2455
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:32,800
it's like you can't really put whatever
you want out there while they lock that

2456
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:36,010
guy up and they gave that guy
some sort of a house arrest deal.

2457
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,220
We had a show up at the police station
and check himself in every day.

2458
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,450
And from what I understand,

2459
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:41,231
he's trying to fight,

2460
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:42,370
being extradited.

2461
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,110
He doesn't want to have
to leave the country,

2462
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,130
but I don't,

2463
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,870
I have no idea what the fuck happened.

2464
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,580
But I do think that,

2465
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,870
I don't believe that this would
happen this way if he wasn't that guy.

2466
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:55,600
I think it seems pretty obvious
it's someone's targeting him.

2467
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:56,291
Oh yeah,

2468
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:56,730
it doesn't,

2469
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:57,230
it doesn't,

2470
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,390
doesn't seem kosher.

2471
01:05:58,391 --> 01:05:59,140
There may,

2472
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,000
you know that this what I mean,

2473
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,490
I don't believe she's even
saying it was really rape.

2474
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,490
It was by some really
broad definition of rape,

2475
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:08,830
like regret afterwards
or something like that.

2476
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,380
The feeling of being deceived
or something along those lines,

2477
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,110
you know,

2478
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,030
changed her mind.

2479
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:15,460
Like how when he was
finishing up or whatever,

2480
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:16,600
something along those lines.

2481
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:16,991
Right.

2482
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:19,280
And he was already inside of
her and he didn't want to stop.

2483
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:24,130
There's already like on the run like he
was already wanted and you know when all

2484
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:25,750
that happened I thought wasn't.

2485
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,480
Yeah,

2486
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:26,860
yeah.

2487
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,180
It's just fascinating how,

2488
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,240
how you know you're not allowed to
release information and less your,

2489
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,310
the New York Times or CNN or,

2490
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:41,311
or an established news organizations
slash corporation that we can trust.

2491
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,960
You're not allowed to just release that.

2492
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,190
So because like the,

2493
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:48,820
the real question would come up with what
would the New York Times do if it was

2494
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:49,870
given that information.

2495
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,300
If it was given all the
wikileaks documents,

2496
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,620
if someone came along and said,

2497
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:53,861
listen,

2498
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:55,150
here's a gigantic file.

2499
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,860
You're going to fucking shit your pants.

2500
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,110
This is all a bunch of
shit that I took from,

2501
01:06:59,111 --> 01:06:59,500
you know,

2502
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,430
US data banks and it's going to,

2503
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,300
it's going to blow the whole on this
whole Iraq war thing and there's a lot of

2504
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:04,750
things in it.

2505
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,940
It's going to really disturb the shit
out of people when they find out about

2506
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:11,890
real relationships between
different foreign countries
and different things that

2507
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:13,900
we're doing and all sorts of
different parts of the world.

2508
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:14,831
What do you think,

2509
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:15,664
what happened?

2510
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,640
I don't think that would get
released through a a real thing.

2511
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:21,750
The New York Times would go,

2512
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,481
get the fuck out of here.

2513
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:23,380
We're not releasing this.

2514
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,890
Probably could give it
back to the government,

2515
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,320
I think.

2516
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:26,790
Yeah,

2517
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:27,160
there was,

2518
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,780
it wasn't their property
is that there's a,

2519
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:29,614
is that a law?

2520
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,980
I think that they're dealing
with like a business,

2521
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,780
so we don't want to fuck it.

2522
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,880
Would it be stolen information?

2523
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:40,650
So there it would be illegal contraband
or something along those lines because

2524
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:41,470
it's top secret.

2525
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,750
I think the government would
just come and confiscate it.

2526
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:46,030
Somebody would call somebody
and the government and be like,

2527
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:49,240
you have a lot or sending someone
right down and then just like,

2528
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,010
does that ever going to change?

2529
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,960
Is that ever going to get to the point
where that doesn't happen anymore?

2530
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,270
Is that like a remnant of the old days?

2531
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:59,740
That's like slowly starting to work its
way out to the point where you know it's

2532
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,620
police aren't going to have like
that kind of absolute power.

2533
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,480
Is that possible?

2534
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,650
Uh,

2535
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:06,640
I don't think so.

2536
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,660
Really?

2537
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,170
No.

2538
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,861
It's gonna get worse.

2539
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:09,694
Right?

2540
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,630
Is it get worse like the future,

2541
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,613
you know,

2542
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:15,843
if you like,

2543
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,600
if you want a picture of the future,

2544
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,690
imagine a boot standing on
somebody's neck forever.

2545
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,680
Something like that.

2546
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,160
Oh,

2547
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:27,160
Orwell's bitch rag I was Orwell to you
are fucking killing me with this boot and

2548
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,181
neck thing.

2549
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:31,150
Why don't you just go to a massage parlor?

2550
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:32,930
You know,

2551
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,890
just a wonderful feeling of
warm oil on your balls and just,

2552
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,083
ah,

2553
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,540
just sweet release.

2554
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,270
You don't have to think
about x well needed.

2555
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,420
It's not all boots and next you
fucking dramatic cock sucker.

2556
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,141
I mean,

2557
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:47,390
he wrote animal farm in 1984 oh,

2558
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:47,871
he's brilliant.

2559
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:50,270
Like the forties when I
say dramatic cock sucker,

2560
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:51,710
I mean it was all due respect.

2561
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:52,860
He,

2562
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,180
he actually predicted a lot
of shit that went down that,

2563
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,023
you know,

2564
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,070
is essentially science
fiction at the time.

2565
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,150
Yeah,

2566
01:08:59,150 --> 01:08:59,983
it's amazing.

2567
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:00,863
You know,

2568
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,040
amazing Internet essentially.

2569
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,300
I mean you could argue that,

2570
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:05,720
you know,

2571
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,720
that screen that everybody had in their
apartments in 1984 1984 supposed to be

2572
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,640
the year where this,

2573
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,110
this story took place.

2574
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:16,340
Is that what the premises,

2575
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:21,270
isn't it amazing when you look back like
on space 1999 they thought that by 1999

2576
01:09:21,271 --> 01:09:23,180
and we'd be like fucking
living on other planets.

2577
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:24,470
Yeah.

2578
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,303
Thousand 10

2579
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:27,510
you know,

2580
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,310
2010 was the year they made contact.

2581
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:29,850
Right.

2582
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,390
In 2001 a space odyssey.

2583
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,730
That's like 2010 they thought this
is ridiculously far in the future.

2584
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,910
This is so far in the future that we're
never going to have to worry about that.

2585
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,800
We'll just make our money now and we'll
probably be right when 2001 Roosevelt,

2586
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:44,843
nothing.

2587
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:45,260
No,

2588
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,680
no fucking space travel at all.

2589
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:47,221
I don't know though,

2590
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:47,551
man.

2591
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:48,060
Like I,

2592
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:48,870
I was at,

2593
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,830
that's the one area though where we
grossly overestimated how far we would

2594
01:09:52,831 --> 01:09:56,960
advance space truthers unmanned
space shit out there and the shore.

2595
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,910
But there's this space station
with people on it right now,

2596
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,370
but space in 98 99 they
were living on fucking,

2597
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,200
there were shows like
Jetson's cars and yeah,

2598
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:14,240
I mean why didn't they have battles
with like other like fucking aliens and

2599
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:15,571
Shit?

2600
01:10:15,571 --> 01:10:17,730
I'm pretty sure they did probably.

2601
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:19,321
Oh yeah,

2602
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:19,501
no,

2603
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:20,400
that was the future.

2604
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,990
That's a prince song bitch.

2605
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,690
What's a ridiculous space in 1999
those smart cars are pretty futuristic

2606
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,200
looking.

2607
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,351
Well,

2608
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:32,650
you know Obama just passed some
new legislation saying that by,

2609
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,680
I think it's 2025 that the
average miles per gallon of a car,

2610
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,660
it has to be some insane number.

2611
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:45,661
It's like 50 plus miles per gallon and
that's what's going to be the standard

2612
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,430
average per corporation.

2613
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:49,510
Like you could have one stupid car.

2614
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:49,931
They're like,

2615
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:54,670
you can have one Mustang gt with a
fucking giant engine that eats gas.

2616
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:57,490
As long as you had a
slew of electric cars,

2617
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,950
got like 90 miles to the gallon and
sort of balanced it out for the most,

2618
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:01,081
like,

2619
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:01,300
yeah.

2620
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,410
It's kind of interesting.

2621
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:05,440
But did you ever see that documentary
who killed the electric car?

2622
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:05,891
Yes,

2623
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:06,620
I did.

2624
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,020
Oh,

2625
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,140
it was pretty interesting.

2626
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,003
Fascinating.

2627
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:09,850
I mean,

2628
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:14,040
they had a pretty decent electric
carts back in [inaudible] 86

2629
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:14,940
yeah,

2630
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,810
and then they reap.

2631
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:17,550
They just took them all and destroy them.

2632
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,193
That's fishy.

2633
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,240
Yeah.

2634
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,073
Yeah.

2635
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:21,730
Well,

2636
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:22,330
I mean,

2637
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,770
conspiracies are real man,

2638
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,101
you know,

2639
01:11:24,101 --> 01:11:26,050
and on the smartest men in the room.

2640
01:11:26,051 --> 01:11:27,410
Do you ever watch that documentary?

2641
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,140
Can conspiracies are fucking real.

2642
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,711
Okay.

2643
01:11:29,711 --> 01:11:29,951
Yeah,

2644
01:11:29,951 --> 01:11:34,570
they definitely went to war because I'm
looking on space 1999 and Wikipedia is

2645
01:11:34,571 --> 01:11:36,490
that a show is shooting lasers at them?

2646
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,181
Yeah.

2647
01:11:37,181 --> 01:11:39,610
Space 1999 you didn't
know that was a show.

2648
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,730
I thought maybe it was like,

2649
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,081
oh,

2650
01:11:41,081 --> 01:11:43,570
what I was saying that it was a show
that I used to watch when I was a kid.

2651
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:44,381
Oh No,

2652
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:45,041
I thought it was fine.

2653
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:47,440
It was a moderate on that and oh my God,

2654
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,880
the idea really was,

2655
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,410
they were so optimistic.

2656
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:51,360
This is how crazy they work.

2657
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:52,690
Cause we had just gone to the moon,

2658
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,140
you know,

2659
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:53,930
supposedly,

2660
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:58,930
and it's 1975 so did they just stop the
Apollo program and 72 so in 1999 they

2661
01:11:59,351 --> 01:12:02,200
thought we would be fucking going to war,

2662
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,760
but there was only 20 years.

2663
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,140
There were only guessing.

2664
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,600
2124 years in the future,

2665
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:08,710
24 years.

2666
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,281
They thought,

2667
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:09,640
we'll dude,

2668
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,930
we finally landed on the moon.

2669
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,580
Remember when we invented cars?

2670
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,900
Now look what what we drive.

2671
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,520
They finally ended up in the moon.

2672
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,271
Listen Dude,

2673
01:12:16,271 --> 01:12:18,820
by the time 1999 rolls around,

2674
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,740
we're going to be going
to battle and space.

2675
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,140
It's fucking people who
are living in uniforms.

2676
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:26,200
They had outfits and shit like that
was the other hallmark of the future.

2677
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,280
Everybody wore the same clothes.

2678
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:28,360
That's how you knew it was the future.

2679
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,280
Future or aliens.

2680
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:30,461
You know,

2681
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:31,720
they're all wearing the same clothes.

2682
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:32,940
Yeah.

2683
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:33,390
Well,

2684
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,860
I mean Walmart,

2685
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,800
I know that that is a fascinating thing.

2686
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,850
Matching silver jumpsuits.

2687
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,400
Most people were getting their
clothes from the same four places,

2688
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:44,840
probably old navy.

2689
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:48,140
It's amazing that they missed so badly.

2690
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,540
1999 they were so optimistic,

2691
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:51,081
you know,

2692
01:12:51,081 --> 01:12:52,690
2001 so optimistic.

2693
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,810
Know a lot of things.

2694
01:12:53,811 --> 01:12:54,644
Got It right though.

2695
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,170
That,

2696
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,770
that old a ride at Walt Disney world.

2697
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,221
Uh,

2698
01:12:58,221 --> 01:12:58,521
you know,

2699
01:12:58,521 --> 01:12:58,641
the,

2700
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:01,820
in the future where it was like a thing
where you just sat there and watched

2701
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:02,390
like the,

2702
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,010
what the future is supposed to be like,

2703
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,180
if you look at it now,

2704
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:05,870
it's pretty,

2705
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:06,561
pretty crazy.

2706
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:08,600
How similarity do you remember alien?

2707
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:09,923
You remember

2708
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,833
Strauma when they're,

2709
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:13,440
when they're in their ship and
he's working on the computer,

2710
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:15,110
it looks so fucking bad.

2711
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:15,680
Oh yeah.

2712
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,141
It's funny.

2713
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,510
I love that when Shit computer,

2714
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:22,620
you have a piece of shit with
it's green fucking letters.

2715
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,940
It's green lit up letters.

2716
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,570
Oh yeah.

2717
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:25,890
Yeah.

2718
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:29,760
Look so stupid in the printer paper
still has the holes on the side of

2719
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,830
the year 3000 out.

2720
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,530
He didn't even have a cell phone.

2721
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:37,711
Right.

2722
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:41,070
He had walkie talkies within the
stromal the fucking computer.

2723
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:41,550
Man.

2724
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,110
They missed so badly.

2725
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,710
But there's like now we're at
a point where we can imitate.

2726
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:48,780
You predict things a little like I think,

2727
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:49,051
you know,

2728
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,250
it seems like a lot of crews.

2729
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:55,251
What was that minority or that shit
sort of shit and other movies too.

2730
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:57,310
So maybe that's the
way things were headed.

2731
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:59,220
When I swiped my iPhone,

2732
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:02,730
when I'm going through like contacts
or when I'm going through a email,

2733
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:04,100
I think I think of it that way.

2734
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,160
Like this is amazing.

2735
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:05,971
These things are amazing.

2736
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:08,610
Sliding this thing back
and forth with my fingers.

2737
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,480
And then iPads,

2738
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:10,314
the same thing.

2739
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,183
I read books,

2740
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,010
the IPAD and

2741
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,970
we haven't turned the page.

2742
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:17,960
Just slowly slide your finger and slowly
curls the page over and then enrolls in

2743
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:18,660
the next page.

2744
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,493
Like,

2745
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,250
Whoa,

2746
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:21,821
this is,

2747
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:25,210
this is some freaky fucking futuristic
shit and we're getting it right.

2748
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:25,310
Yeah.

2749
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:29,120
Now like I went to a concert a couple
of weeks ago and you just look,

2750
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,210
I went to smoke a cigarette and was
like looking at the whole crowd in the

2751
01:14:32,211 --> 01:14:36,200
Hollywood bowl and you just see
all these little light up things.

2752
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:36,381
Yeah.

2753
01:14:36,381 --> 01:14:37,214
And it's like,

2754
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,600
that's kind of crazy man.

2755
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:38,871
Like it,

2756
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:40,010
it happens so quickly.

2757
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,620
Really 10 years ago you didn't see,

2758
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,140
I was typing an email today and I was
on the iPhone and I f I just was just

2759
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:50,200
thinking about how crazy it is and I
could just touch these little spots,

2760
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,900
knows pretty much what
letter you're trying to say.

2761
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,340
And then you can just swipe your finger
and it's spins through all your pictures

2762
01:14:57,341 --> 01:14:58,780
and spins through all your music.

2763
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,610
Like this is nuts man.

2764
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:02,890
This is so specific to its so like

2765
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:03,610
Joe,

2766
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,060
you got God to try out
this thing called Spotify.

2767
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,450
It's kind of like rhapsody city.

2768
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:10,570
It's an all you can eat any kind of music,

2769
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,970
you know for $10 you get
all the music you want.

2770
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,701
Pretty much thing.

2771
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:15,520
So for $10 one time fee,

2772
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,270
no,

2773
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,300
every month,

2774
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,021
$10 a month,

2775
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:17,831
$10 a month.

2776
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:18,230
I mean he was,

2777
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:22,910
but you sit there and you just have access
to pretty much any song ounces mine.

2778
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,913
But it is,

2779
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,140
I don't really understand
the service but yeah,

2780
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:28,060
you can like $10 a month.

2781
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:32,290
You could put it in like rolling stones
and every rolling stones song will come

2782
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,450
up and you can download.

2783
01:15:33,451 --> 01:15:34,284
But what's called,

2784
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,600
what's cool is it whoever has
it connected to their Facebook,

2785
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:38,261
like a lot of your friends,

2786
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:42,700
like Dunkin is a good example is you're
going to see his whole entire music,

2787
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:44,020
like what he likes,

2788
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:44,920
what he listens to.

2789
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,581
So you can just like,

2790
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:47,800
if you're looking for new music
is basically what it takes.

2791
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,420
And he just like,

2792
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,260
look at all this music.

2793
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:51,094
It's pretty cool.

2794
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:51,960
I would try it out.

2795
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,210
You can download their music too and you
could also download it onto your phone

2796
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,860
and has that album.

2797
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:57,360
I want it.

2798
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,720
And you can put it on an iPhone.

2799
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:02,260
He put it on an iPod and you kill
what the thing is the Spotify,

2800
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:03,250
it's like your iTunes,

2801
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:06,240
but it's held at some servers in a way.

2802
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,860
But I think there's a way
to also download the tracks.

2803
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:10,610
So like if you have offline mode,

2804
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:13,090
so like if you just pick
what things you want,

2805
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,040
it'll download the
tracks onto your iPhone.

2806
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:16,300
That's annoying.

2807
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,221
I would want to,

2808
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:18,470
I don't,

2809
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:19,440
I'm Todd.

2810
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,800
I wanted on my hard drive.

2811
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:21,640
I want a physical,

2812
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:22,630
I think you can do that.

2813
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,021
Really?

2814
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:23,350
Yeah.

2815
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,400
I think once you do that,

2816
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,620
yeah you can put it on
your download or your iPad.

2817
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:29,350
Your phone doesn't have to be
connected to the Internet to use it.

2818
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:29,980
Uh,

2819
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:30,221
no,

2820
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:31,150
you could download it.

2821
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,400
You have to be connected to
the Internet at some point.

2822
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:34,100
You know what I mean?

2823
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:34,300
Yeah.

2824
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,760
To get it right.

2825
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,190
Right.

2826
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,410
But you just like refreshing it just,

2827
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:42,850
it just saves it onto your device
and it is just like downloading it

2828
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:50,780
to a CD and I think I might have
some kind of a time like fit.

2829
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,720
It only lasts a certain amount of time,

2830
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:54,370
like it has really see,

2831
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:54,781
oh no,

2832
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:55,081
no,

2833
01:16:55,081 --> 01:16:55,421
no,

2834
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,254
no,

2835
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:57,641
no.

2836
01:16:57,641 --> 01:16:58,490
I think that's how it works.

2837
01:16:58,491 --> 01:17:01,900
Did I think it has to check for
subscription once in a while or something?

2838
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:02,171
Oh,

2839
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:03,004
that's annoying.

2840
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,490
But uh,

2841
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,350
so as long as your prescriptions up,

2842
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:07,650
but you know,

2843
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,440
it's good to get a car
driving around going.

2844
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,310
It's all annoying

2845
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,581
man.

2846
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:11,151
When you got it,

2847
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:12,020
you got it right.

2848
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:12,201
I,

2849
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:15,290
I keep an iPhone or an
iPod always charged up.

2850
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,300
I always listened to in my car.

2851
01:17:16,301 --> 01:17:17,780
I hardly ever listen to the radio anymore.

2852
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,160
I just listen to my Ipod,

2853
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:20,420
know connects to my car.

2854
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:20,841
It's fucking,

2855
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:21,740
it's amazing.

2856
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:23,060
You can just choose whatever music,

2857
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,300
but all I have to do is just like sync
it back and forth between my computers.

2858
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:31,100
I don't want to go home and then just
fucking register and pay 10 bucks a month.

2859
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,460
I buy the CD on Itunes,

2860
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:35,450
I buy the mp3s.

2861
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,530
That's good for me.

2862
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,330
I don't want any of that craziness.

2863
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:43,450
I have satellite in my car and I like it
because I've been turned onto a lot of

2864
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:45,190
new music that I wouldn't have heard.

2865
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:48,970
There's one station in particular like
I like that and d kind of rock shit.

2866
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,180
I like what type of road shit?

2867
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,281
Like indie,

2868
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:54,190
like I like nineties
Indie rock a lot and like,

2869
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,510
you know like pavement,

2870
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:56,344
Shit like that.

2871
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,143
Sing me a song.

2872
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,180
Ah,

2873
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,251
well I mean,

2874
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:03,130
I don't know like dinosaur jr
you familiar with any of that?

2875
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,750
I wasn't in the scene.

2876
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,000
A radio station wantsW ,

2877
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,020
a f and Boston and um,

2878
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:09,741
the,

2879
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:10,070
uh,

2880
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,550
one of the dudes from dinosaur Jr,

2881
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,860
what does it Maskus what does it say?

2882
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:17,861
Mass Mass just sang a song like right
there and it was a real creepy like

2883
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:18,890
acoustic song.

2884
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:19,521
And I'm like,

2885
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:19,821
wow,

2886
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:21,500
what a weird dude this guy is.

2887
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:22,071
I bet this guy.

2888
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:23,570
Some fucking crazy,

2889
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:23,961
creepy,

2890
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:24,950
weird genius dude.

2891
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,571
They are,

2892
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:27,400
I mean that's a certain genre.

2893
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,473
Um,

2894
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,230
like uh,

2895
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,270
well like Nirvana came out of that too.

2896
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,141
Yeah.

2897
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,020
It's like the Melvins and fucking right,

2898
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:34,943
but is nirvana,

2899
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,260
if you talk about like that
kind of music you want,

2900
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:37,981
that you like,

2901
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:38,860
if you say Nirvana,

2902
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:39,570
did they think,

2903
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:39,781
oh,

2904
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:40,710
you're all mainstream?

2905
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:41,953
Um,

2906
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:42,500
no,

2907
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:42,801
no,

2908
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,950
because I mean their vinyl like
naturally happened that came from like,

2909
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:49,670
they want it to be as big as sonic
youth or dinosaur junior and just,

2910
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:54,110
they just wrote songs way too
good and fucking just got huge.

2911
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:55,630
They reinvented things.

2912
01:18:55,631 --> 01:18:55,811
Hey,

2913
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:56,950
change the format,

2914
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,090
everything they fucked hairbands
and vanilla ice and MC Hammer.

2915
01:19:01,091 --> 01:19:02,230
Those guys were big ox.

2916
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:02,970
I owned it on.

2917
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,803
But yeah,

2918
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,070
like where'd this come from?

2919
01:19:05,071 --> 01:19:07,370
Is All this truth and pain and reality.

2920
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,770
Dude screaming,

2921
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:09,640
rape me,

2922
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,980
raped me again.

2923
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,600
It's a great song.

2924
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:14,770
Oh yeah.

2925
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,101
I mean,

2926
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:16,720
rape me is a great fucking song.

2927
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:17,950
And it played on the radio.

2928
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,470
You know,

2929
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,760
just,

2930
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,050
just wrap your head around that.

2931
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,640
Imagine trying to put that out today.

2932
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:22,661
Rape me.

2933
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:23,530
A song called rape me.

2934
01:19:23,531 --> 01:19:24,730
People would freak the fuck out.

2935
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,080
They wouldn't want to
play that on the radio.

2936
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,400
Too many people would be complaining.

2937
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:32,680
This guy went on stage or
a in the UFC this weekend,

2938
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,250
uh,

2939
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,600
there was a controversy.

2940
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,141
This,

2941
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:35,830
um,

2942
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:40,150
these two fighters went out to a
controversial songs and one of them was,

2943
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:41,980
he went out to smack my bitch up.

2944
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,031
Okay.

2945
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:45,400
And so this writer was
complainants that that was,

2946
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:46,234
yes,

2947
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:51,300
they wrote an article and Yahoo about
how it was insensitive to have that song.

2948
01:19:52,631 --> 01:19:55,270
And that song promotes violence
against women and Jess,

2949
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,770
that people might find it offensive.

2950
01:19:56,771 --> 01:20:00,720
And then the other son they complained
about was the scorpions rocky,

2951
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:01,690
like a hurricane.

2952
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,280
Because obviously we're in
New Orleans and New Orleans,

2953
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,070
but meanwhile you watch them two

2954
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,700
guys beating the shit out of each
other and when that song came on,

2955
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,730
I don't think people
thought that I didn't,

2956
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:14,564
that I didn't even,

2957
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:18,610
I didn't even assume that
action until I read the article.

2958
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:21,510
Conti little writer fucking
monitor cause a stir.

2959
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,620
Do you know how funny it is?

2960
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:26,970
And you just said that cause I got in
trouble for calling is very writer Conti.

2961
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:27,690
Really?

2962
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:28,410
Yeah.

2963
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:28,861
People are like,

2964
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:29,880
you shouldn't use that word.

2965
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:31,463
Sounds like content.

2966
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:31,890
I didn't,

2967
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:32,281
I didn't,

2968
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:34,350
I did not inform you of this beforehand.

2969
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,340
We had no discussion.

2970
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,810
There was no coercion on your part.

2971
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,270
Nope.

2972
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,103
Ladies and gentlemen,

2973
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,960
nature finds its fucking course.

2974
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:42,320
She'll the other one was the,

2975
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,081
the scorpions.

2976
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:43,950
Rocky like a hurricane.

2977
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:45,330
When I heard that song I didn't think,

2978
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,400
oh no he did.

2979
01:20:46,401 --> 01:20:48,990
And a hurricane hit here and
devastated the population.

2980
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,853
That's just thought.

2981
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:50,790
I thought,

2982
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,050
oh it was a fucking jam.

2983
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,033
Yeah.

2984
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,290
That's a good thing to listen to before
you're going to go get in a fistfight.

2985
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:56,820
Yeah.

2986
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,140
It's a fucking good song,

2987
01:20:58,141 --> 01:20:58,530
man.

2988
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,870
You can't not have that good song anymore.

2989
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,850
It's not responsible for the hurricane.

2990
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:03,890
Okay.

2991
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:07,560
Now if he played like walking on sunshine
by Katrina and the waves that then

2992
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,221
that would be like,

2993
01:21:08,221 --> 01:21:08,461
wait,

2994
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:09,930
why is he fucking playing this?

2995
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,580
This doesn't go along with this sport.

2996
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,170
I wonder if you'd be allowed to do that.

2997
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,320
And one of Dana [inaudible]
cause he approves every song

2998
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,700
he approved smacked.

2999
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:19,261
By the way,

3000
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:19,831
smacking my bitch.

3001
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:21,720
I was one like all these awards,

3002
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:22,471
it's like,

3003
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:26,130
you know it's in Charlie's angels smack
my bishop was in Charlie's angels.

3004
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:26,720
How does that go?

3005
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,140
It's like,

3006
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,070
like complaining,

3007
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,560
smacked up big bit.

3008
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,360
It's like this crazy like techno.

3009
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,590
It's a really famous song.

3010
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:35,370
He never heard it before.

3011
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,280
I probably have the names
just not ringing a bell.

3012
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,210
Is it like it is the chemical
brothers and I am familiar with it.

3013
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,410
I have like all their stuff.

3014
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:46,530
I guess just hilarious though that
someone would complain about that.

3015
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,600
Like that seems like kind of silly,

3016
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:49,681
you know?

3017
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:50,514
Of course.

3018
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:51,871
What is it?

3019
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:53,190
Anything about anything silly.

3020
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,350
We nerfing the fucking world.

3021
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,030
What is going on Brendan Walsh.

3022
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:57,511
Now,

3023
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:02,280
I asked you this because you're a
a comic and you're also a fucking,

3024
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,360
you know,

3025
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:03,751
you,

3026
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:04,530
you go deep,

3027
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,520
you push buttons,

3028
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:06,050
you know,

3029
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:06,660
you're uh,

3030
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,190
you talk about crazy shit on stage.

3031
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:08,940
It's fun.

3032
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,440
It's my kind of comedy good.

3033
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:10,711
You know,

3034
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:10,880
when,

3035
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,200
when I saw you the other
night at the ice house,

3036
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:13,501
I was like,

3037
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:17,180
thank God there's still
guys tilling that laddering,

3038
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:17,600
man.

3039
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,140
It's true.

3040
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:18,451
You,

3041
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:19,830
you been really dirty.

3042
01:22:19,831 --> 01:22:21,000
The new stuff's kind of

3043
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,060
go deeper.

3044
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:24,961
I was there.

3045
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:25,261
Why?

3046
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:25,800
I mean,

3047
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,371
I look,

3048
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:26,480
I,

3049
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,870
I'm a huge fan of standup comedy.

3050
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:28,291
He's still,

3051
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:30,510
but it's not enough.

3052
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,860
People are doing crazy shit.

3053
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:32,820
I not enough.

3054
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,860
Not Enough people are going
to the deep end of the pool,

3055
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:35,510
you know,

3056
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:39,990
there's not enough people are just
making fucked up things really funny.

3057
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:40,650
You know?

3058
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:41,720
And there's a few,

3059
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:42,271
there's a few,

3060
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:42,810
but you,

3061
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,750
you were nailing a bunch of,

3062
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:46,110
I don't want to do any of your material,

3063
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:49,050
but you were nailing a
bunch of left and right.

3064
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:49,321
I was like,

3065
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:54,240
this is really funny stuff and I enjoyed
it that Taso does comedy supposed to be

3066
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:55,560
kind of fucked up man?

3067
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,050
The best stuff when you've
got a couple of drinks in you.

3068
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,430
The best stuff like you know like Nick
Dipaolo is one of my all time favorite

3069
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:03,151
guys to watch.

3070
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:06,190
When I got a little buzz
on cause he would have

3071
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,390
fake mean shit.

3072
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:09,280
I mean it was me and it was a but B.

3073
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:09,971
He's not a mean guy.

3074
01:23:09,971 --> 01:23:10,631
He's a nice guy.

3075
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:11,464
He's a great guy.

3076
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,251
He's just fucking,

3077
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:14,850
that's the style of comedy and
he's going after it and it's,

3078
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:16,960
and it's especially when
you've got a buzz on,

3079
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:21,640
it's a fucking great art form and by
people complaining about a dude coming out

3080
01:23:21,641 --> 01:23:26,641
to rock you like a hurricane and by people
trying to take some of the flavor out

3081
01:23:28,731 --> 01:23:28,880
of,

3082
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,170
out of,

3083
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,210
out of the world tone things down there,

3084
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,320
they're ruining everything
that's cool about life.

3085
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:36,660
Yeah.

3086
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:37,530
There's this subtlety.

3087
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,210
Yeah.

3088
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,960
Knowing what's right and
what's wrong and knowing when,

3089
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,540
when to let things go and when to do this.

3090
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:45,770
This is a big fucking,

3091
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,053
it shows a big,

3092
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,300
it's like prioritization.

3093
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:49,550
Yeah.

3094
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,590
If you're going to sit
down and fucking like,

3095
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:52,431
you know,

3096
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:55,580
police Wikipedia on your fucking own time.

3097
01:23:55,581 --> 01:23:57,350
Just because somebody adds,

3098
01:23:57,351 --> 01:24:00,590
Jerry Seinfeld's started directing
adult films after whatever,

3099
01:24:00,591 --> 01:24:00,840
you know,

3100
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,940
like there's somebody who's,

3101
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:02,690
you know,

3102
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:07,690
policing Craig's list for like people
trying to be funny or gross on it.

3103
01:24:07,701 --> 01:24:09,900
Like fuck's wrong with you man.

3104
01:24:09,901 --> 01:24:12,950
I like the prior like there's a million
other things you could be doing right

3105
01:24:12,951 --> 01:24:13,560
now.

3106
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:13,921
Yeah.

3107
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:15,410
And that needs to be illuminated,

3108
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:15,751
right?

3109
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:16,830
It needs to be pointed at it.

3110
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:18,150
Like why are you doing this?

3111
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:18,751
Well,

3112
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:20,520
because like usually what they're doing,

3113
01:24:20,521 --> 01:24:25,320
I mean I'm just speaking from experience
of like I had a fake Yelp account where

3114
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,630
I would just complain about businesses.

3115
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,330
Like I took businesses that had like,

3116
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,660
there was a car wash called the
handy j and I wrote the review.

3117
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:37,860
Like I was expecting a hand job at the
end of the car wash and it was blatant

3118
01:24:37,861 --> 01:24:39,360
false advertising.

3119
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:42,480
And there's a restaurant called
the happy ending on sunset.

3120
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:46,020
So either way I was just all written
by this naive guy who was in a shitty

3121
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:48,060
marriage and he was just
looking for a hand job.

3122
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,710
And none of these places hand jobs
and his pink Taco place in Arizona.

3123
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:56,070
Like some guy beats the shit out of him
cause he tries to get his daughter to

3124
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:56,520
fuck.

3125
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,010
I mean it was just a
silly thing I was doing,

3126
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:02,550
but he got taken down because
I guess somebody you know,

3127
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,560
complained or was monitoring
Yelp and I lost all my fucking,

3128
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:08,550
uh,

3129
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:11,100
he didn't write hand John Anywhere again.

3130
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:11,880
No,

3131
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,601
I was like,

3132
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:12,781
I,

3133
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:15,510
that's before I even knew that
you could do a screen grab.

3134
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:16,470
Like I just,

3135
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,513
I think I,

3136
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,130
well wasn't there a thing that
you could do on the Internet,

3137
01:25:20,131 --> 01:25:20,431
Brian,

3138
01:25:20,431 --> 01:25:22,170
where you could go back in time?

3139
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:23,210
I go,

3140
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,043
yeah.

3141
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,070
Not just that.

3142
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh,

3143
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,050
you could go and,

3144
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:26,720
yeah.

3145
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:26,830
Uh,

3146
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:27,221
yeah,

3147
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:27,530
but that,

3148
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:27,941
that,

3149
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:29,530
that probably is not on there.

3150
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:30,100
I don't know.

3151
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,390
It was a couple of years ago.

3152
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,253
And how does that work?

3153
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,240
What it does is it's,

3154
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,330
it's just a program,

3155
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:34,571
you know,

3156
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:39,100
like a spider or a Bot that takes
screenshots and kind of saves websites,

3157
01:25:39,101 --> 01:25:41,710
kind of archives of websites
called the Internet archive.

3158
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,630
And it works all stored at uh,

3159
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,513
I dunno,

3160
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,000
I think it's connected with some museum
or something like that or some kind of

3161
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,470
weird thing.

3162
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:51,050
I'm like,

3163
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:51,230
hmm,

3164
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:52,063
need a base.

3165
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,641
But it,

3166
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:53,030
it,

3167
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,410
it does,

3168
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:55,330
it works like 70% of the time.

3169
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:58,060
Like you can go to your
old website from like 91,

3170
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,140
you know.

3171
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,440
Well website 91 or 92 or whatever,

3172
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,830
98 and uh,

3173
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:04,070
you

3174
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,900
could see it and some things will work.

3175
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:07,010
Some photos we'll work some things.

3176
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:07,570
Wow.

3177
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,140
You know,

3178
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:08,973
that's,

3179
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,383
that's wild.

3180
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:10,830
Yeah,

3181
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:11,663
it is weird.

3182
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,630
I Pepsi Spice Projects on there somewhere.

3183
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:15,620
Yeah.

3184
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,453
That's hilarious.

3185
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,360
Brian did a thing where he pretended that
he was eat nothing but Pepsi spice for

3186
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:24,200
like months and he got Pepsis vice.com
it was a titan new type of Pepsi did they

3187
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:28,820
had Pepsi spice.com he registered it
because they were fucking slow on the take

3188
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:30,890
and they didn't realize
the power of the Internet.

3189
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,450
It's the only writes his blog detailing
these horrific fucking physical ailments

3190
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:36,500
that are occurring to shedding.

3191
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,870
So just eating nothing but Pepsi place.

3192
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:41,540
What was it?

3193
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,600
Spicy Pepsi.

3194
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,700
Ginger.

3195
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,980
Remember that shit at all.

3196
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,640
It was horrible.

3197
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:48,950
Awful was like thanksgiving.

3198
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:50,000
Do you remember new coke?

3199
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,930
They tried to farm member.

3200
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:51,531
New coach.

3201
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:52,070
Yeah.

3202
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:53,180
It was classic.

3203
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:53,751
It was like,

3204
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,590
what are you doing?

3205
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,940
And then they don't do that anymore.

3206
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:58,080
Right now they got rid of Newco.

3207
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:58,380
Yeah,

3208
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,070
a new coach.

3209
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:02,210
This was w it was a slow introduction,

3210
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:02,400
you know,

3211
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,811
was like,

3212
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:04,190
it was like the metric system.

3213
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:07,560
They tried to shove it up and
then they pulled it back there.

3214
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:07,780
All right.

3215
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,410
We give up,

3216
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:08,790
give up.

3217
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,310
We go up.

3218
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,880
New Coke just tasted like Pepsi.

3219
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,790
Do you think there's a different type
of person that drinks coke rather than

3220
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:14,210
Pepsi?

3221
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:14,930
Fuck yeah man.

3222
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,220
I Hate Pepsi.

3223
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,500
Like drinking Pepsi is kind of the same.

3224
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,390
Diet Pepsi better than Diet Coke.

3225
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:25,750
Zero rows do dumber people
like Pepsi or Smarter,

3226
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,293
Dumber Drinking Soda on a regular basis.

3227
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,860
I bet they are smart people.

3228
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:32,420
I probably smoked cigarettes.

3229
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:32,920
We,

3230
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,310
this guy is Daniel Pinchbeck.

3231
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:36,650
This brilliant author told me
just quit smoking cigarettes.

3232
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:36,981
I was like,

3233
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:39,370
what the fuck you want,

3234
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,900
but you just quit to write tough man.

3235
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,513
When did you quit?

3236
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,181
I'm flake.

3237
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:45,080
On my third day.

3238
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:45,980
So that's it.

3239
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:46,580
Not even,

3240
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:51,580
I quit for a year a couple of years ago
and I smoked a joint with my friend,

3241
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:54,320
rolled a joint with tobacco
in it and it fucking,

3242
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:57,530
it's crazy once you have that
little taste that was like,

3243
01:27:57,531 --> 01:27:57,740
hey,

3244
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:58,521
wrote me a cigarette.

3245
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:01,610
Like a couple of days later I was staying
with them in upstate New York after

3246
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:05,930
Montreal and so it was kind of on vacation
and that vacation mode and was like,

3247
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:06,701
oh,

3248
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:08,900
I have a couple of smokes
until when I get back to La,

3249
01:28:08,901 --> 01:28:13,901
I'll stop and went down to the city for
a week and bombed a couple cigarettes.

3250
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:16,010
But cigarettes are like
15 bucks a pack there.

3251
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:16,371
So I was like,

3252
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:19,220
I'm just going to buy a pack and you know,

3253
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,500
give them the people and
I'll smile either way.

3254
01:28:21,501 --> 01:28:22,760
It just snowballed into,

3255
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,550
is that the only physical
addiction you've ever had?

3256
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,170
Um,

3257
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,030
Cock Brian.

3258
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:30,081
Yeah man,

3259
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:30,680
that's rude.

3260
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,120
That's rude behavior that you're
fucking going out on the Internet.

3261
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:36,710
Other people are going to hear this,

3262
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:40,700
that to slander or liable and
whatever it is in your mouth and cry.

3263
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:41,390
Okay.

3264
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:41,751
Listen,

3265
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:42,980
you took it too far back?

3266
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,030
No,

3267
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,350
I've never had any real like,

3268
01:28:45,351 --> 01:28:46,040
you know,

3269
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,510
I like to drink and stuff,

3270
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:48,700
but you've never had like a,

3271
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:51,890
a physical craving like that
before we got attached to it.

3272
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,450
Cigarettes or alcohol or cigarettes
is the only one like that.

3273
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:57,680
I mean how bad is alcohol?

3274
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:00,740
Have you ever gotten to a I
need a drink every day stage?

3275
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:01,260
No,

3276
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:01,620
no,

3277
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,101
no.

3278
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:02,934
It's cigarettes.

3279
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,270
My put,

3280
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:05,340
what I was trying to get
at was like cigarettes are,

3281
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,640
they're torn and really tough and,

3282
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:09,150
and,

3283
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,470
and much stronger.

3284
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,470
They have a much stronger pull than a
lot of the other things to get people.

3285
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:17,190
Well because you don't get anything
out of cigarettes to like cigarettes.

3286
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:19,710
If they got you high or drunk wake

3287
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,280
your poison,

3288
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:27,090
like do you get pissed off with those
people that fucking telling you they can

3289
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:30,300
smoke and they don't ever get hooked
because there's a lot of people that do

3290
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:32,810
though whenever I want.

3291
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,820
I think there are different kinds of,

3292
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:40,821
like I do lean more towards like an
addictive like you know like if there's

3293
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:44,280
something that's kind of fun I'll like,

3294
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,650
my impulse is to overdo it.

3295
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:49,130
I mean I have self
control and other things.

3296
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:50,103
That's why you're funny.

3297
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,730
Almost all comics have that.

3298
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:52,700
Every conflict of interest.

3299
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,990
It's really funny cause impulsive
Kreischer he's really impulsive.

3300
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:57,490
Brian Keaulana really impulsive.

3301
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,610
Joey's impulses.

3302
01:29:58,660 --> 01:29:59,021
Fuck.

3303
01:29:59,021 --> 01:29:59,400
You know,

3304
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,640
I'm glad that they're still improving
the technology of a cigarette though.

3305
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,320
They have camel crushes now,

3306
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,910
which are so awesome.

3307
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,260
Like you're smoking a
cigarette and you're like,

3308
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:07,561
you know what,

3309
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:08,640
I'm bored with this cigarette.

3310
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:11,790
Then you just crushed a filter and we
releases more chemicals under the filter.

3311
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,930
Then it tastes like mint.

3312
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:17,190
So now I'm in Boston but
it's a little chemical.

3313
01:30:17,191 --> 01:30:18,024
Bollier

3314
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,071
wait a minute,

3315
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:19,441
wait a minute.

3316
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:21,230
So you can change your experience.

3317
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:24,140
You go from a regular or
at any time back and forth?

3318
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:24,501
No,

3319
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:24,681
no.

3320
01:30:24,681 --> 01:30:29,681
Just one menthol you or
has this available to it?

3321
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:30,541
The whole pack.

3322
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,051
The whole pack.

3323
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:31,260
Yeah.

3324
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,390
They have little spearmint balls and I've

3325
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,970
got to find out that
that gives cancer cancer.

3326
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,500
Yeah,

3327
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,440
definitely give your cancer

3328
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:41,370
Batman,

3329
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:42,540
but once you get out of the woods,

3330
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:43,800
when I quit a couple of years ago,

3331
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:47,120
I mean I went like a year and it's been
a year now that I spend smoking again.

3332
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,573
Uh,

3333
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,471
once you get out,

3334
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:51,090
or at least once I got out of the woods,

3335
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:53,070
like after a couple of weeks I was like,

3336
01:30:53,071 --> 01:30:53,660
okay,

3337
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:54,000
fine.

3338
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,960
I don't need this.

3339
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:55,794
But then really?

3340
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:56,731
Yeah,

3341
01:30:56,731 --> 01:30:57,390
I really didn't.

3342
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,830
I was pretty cocky about it.

3343
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,281
I was like,

3344
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:02,300
I'm never going to stick another one
of those things in my mouth and I could

3345
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:02,420
have,

3346
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,201
I would hang out at bars.

3347
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:05,010
I'd go out with my friends
when they went to smoke,

3348
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:05,641
I was like,

3349
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:06,120
I'm done.

3350
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:06,953
I don't smoke.

3351
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,760
I read this book that helped a lot.

3352
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:09,211
I mean,

3353
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:10,440
granted I'm smoking again,

3354
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:11,310
but because,

3355
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:12,121
well,

3356
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:12,990
but I mean,

3357
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:15,150
under my circumstances though,

3358
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:16,920
I kind of didn't really do it by choice.

3359
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:20,490
Like I smoked this joint that had tobacco
and I knew I tasted it right away,

3360
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:21,170
but I was like,

3361
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:21,270
ah,

3362
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:22,170
I could fuck it.

3363
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:23,310
I'm going to say this is like,

3364
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,680
it's been 11 months
since I had a cigarette.

3365
01:31:25,681 --> 01:31:28,560
I can have a pop tobacco demon
talking to you fucked up.

3366
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:30,060
So it is the nicotine demon.

3367
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:34,080
Well that's the way the guy see that's
the way he describes it in the book is

3368
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:36,810
like you're just feeding this little
monster that needs to be fed over.

3369
01:31:36,811 --> 01:31:38,070
Like it's a very short,

3370
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:42,150
I even heard that like after CCI or
whatever you get to like it starts burning

3371
01:31:42,151 --> 01:31:46,140
fat that has nicotine still in it and so
you start getting cravings again after

3372
01:31:46,141 --> 01:31:46,920
like a certain period.

3373
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,100
Love

3374
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:47,721
is bullshit.

3375
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:50,630
Someone said that too and I
thought that sounded silly.

3376
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:51,590
It seems kind of silly.

3377
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:52,520
It might be though.

3378
01:31:52,521 --> 01:31:54,590
I mean I know marijuana
stays in your system.

3379
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:57,140
I think if you're like really
fat and he gets super high,

3380
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,270
we can stay in your system for weeks.

3381
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,363
Yeah.

3382
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,780
It stays in your fat styles,

3383
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:02,030
right?

3384
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:02,530
Yeah.

3385
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:03,760
So if that,

3386
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:04,031
I mean,

3387
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:05,080
if it's there,

3388
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,801
maybe,

3389
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:09,970
I mean it's obviously the grip of
that stuff is way stronger than,

3390
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,250
I mean there's people that say
they get addicted to marijuana,

3391
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,850
but there's nothing like the feeling
that I don't think that they get with

3392
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:16,361
cigarettes.

3393
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:17,950
They don't need to smoke it all day low.

3394
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:19,240
It's more of a habitual,

3395
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:19,690
I think,

3396
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:20,710
marijuana to you get,

3397
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:22,510
you get hooked on the ritual of it.

3398
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,750
I also have this shit.

3399
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:24,584
Yeah,

3400
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,290
I'm willing to,

3401
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:29,110
I'm willing to believe that everybody
has a different biochemistry and some

3402
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:32,260
people can get physically addicted to
almost anything because I think people

3403
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:33,610
gets physically addicted to sugar.

3404
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:34,091
You know,

3405
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:39,091
some people that like have crazy sugar
fixations where it's an addiction,

3406
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,120
you know,

3407
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,070
so they could get addicted to marijuana,

3408
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,260
but nothing like the
addiction to cigarettes.

3409
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:46,390
That is one of the weirdest ones,

3410
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:46,690
man.

3411
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:48,370
It's like when you see people,

3412
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:49,360
like when Brian,

3413
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,460
when Brian started
smoking cigarettes again,

3414
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,960
it's almost like I have to accept
that he got bit by a vampire,

3415
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,423
you got

3416
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:58,550
cigarettes,

3417
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:59,790
makes me want to have a cigarette.

3418
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:00,663
Oh Dude.

3419
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,730
Are you ever going to quit or you just,

3420
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,113
yeah.

3421
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:04,253
Oh really?

3422
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,140
You're ready to given
today's been rough plaza,

3423
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:07,590
but no,

3424
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:08,160
I should,

3425
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:08,851
I've just been,

3426
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:09,181
you know,

3427
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:10,680
I keep fucking want in line,

3428
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:11,221
but it's like,

3429
01:33:11,221 --> 01:33:11,401
yeah,

3430
01:33:11,401 --> 01:33:12,234
it's that,

3431
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,450
what is it?

3432
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:13,680
Tell,

3433
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,580
explain it to me.

3434
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,250
What is it?

3435
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:15,551
What does the,

3436
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:17,140
what's the pull as a person who's never,

3437
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:17,981
it's a,

3438
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:19,960
I've had a cigarette or two in the day,

3439
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:20,920
but I've never got it.

3440
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:22,661
Yeah,

3441
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:23,171
it's just,

3442
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:23,771
it seems,

3443
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:25,540
it's sounds like a really good idea.

3444
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,860
Like I just want to kind of fucking smoke
a cigarette and there is a little bit

3445
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:30,131
of a,

3446
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:30,380
yeah,

3447
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:30,950
a little lake.

3448
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:35,950
You know what it's like when you go and
you're hungry is fuck and you like the

3449
01:33:36,981 --> 01:33:39,590
movie theater and he smelled
that popcorn and you're like,

3450
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:40,010
fuck,

3451
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:40,880
I need that popcorn.

3452
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:41,401
No,

3453
01:33:41,401 --> 01:33:41,901
there can be,

3454
01:33:41,901 --> 01:33:43,120
it's gotta be way crazier than that.

3455
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,340
Cause I can pass it down.

3456
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:44,810
No,

3457
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:47,180
because you can sit there
and not get popcorn.

3458
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:49,640
But if you sit there and keep on
smelling it over and over again,

3459
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,840
I mean he'll drive me crazy.

3460
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,480
Don't you still think
of popcorn specifically?

3461
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:56,600
Think of like you're really hungry
and you smell like fucking hell.

3462
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:01,260
Fogo de Chao and the guy keeps coming
back with the meat and I have my thing

3463
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,120
flipped over to read.

3464
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:03,480
Is it that good?

3465
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:04,111
It's,

3466
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:04,381
yeah,

3467
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:04,601
it's,

3468
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:05,430
it's more than that.

3469
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,781
It just like,

3470
01:34:05,781 --> 01:34:06,614
we smell like,

3471
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,960
like somebody cooking cookies or
brownies in your house and you're like,

3472
01:34:09,961 --> 01:34:10,051
oh,

3473
01:34:10,051 --> 01:34:11,280
I need that fucking cookie now.

3474
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:12,150
It's like that.

3475
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:13,590
That's what the yearnings kind of like,

3476
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,210
like it's something where it's like,

3477
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:15,390
oh,

3478
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:16,110
when you get it,

3479
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,680
when you finally give into the beast and
you're a bitch up and you suck it in,

3480
01:34:19,681 --> 01:34:20,514
what does that like?

3481
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,200
That completely goes away.

3482
01:34:22,201 --> 01:34:23,034
That stress.

3483
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:24,690
It goes away and then,

3484
01:34:24,691 --> 01:34:25,480
but then I guess

3485
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,020
no,

3486
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,330
mine's immediately going
to be followed by guilt.

3487
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:28,990
Yeah,

3488
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:29,730
but you don't do,

3489
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:30,580
you don't think,

3490
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:30,971
okay,

3491
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:31,600
here I am.

3492
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,580
I'm poisoning

3493
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,380
dude.

3494
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,131
Oh God,

3495
01:34:34,131 --> 01:34:35,840
the thoughts I fucking go through my head.

3496
01:34:35,841 --> 01:34:37,590
That's so dumb.

3497
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,520
I think about it like I don't
think about when I'm doing it.

3498
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,340
Like I think about it
the next morning went on,

3499
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:43,310
did

3500
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:44,510
you start smoking a pipe?

3501
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,010
Yeah.

3502
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:46,970
Smells better.

3503
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,573
Tobacco,

3504
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,780
maybe you could smoke a pipe and be okay.

3505
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:53,210
Just,

3506
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:57,110
you just got to stop doing it
because they're both junkies.

3507
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,070
You

3508
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,000
guys can't help it,

3509
01:34:59,150 --> 01:34:59,421
man.

3510
01:34:59,421 --> 01:34:59,811
But you know,

3511
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:00,770
this is like,

3512
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:01,580
you know,

3513
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:01,881
yeah,

3514
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:02,840
it's my third day.

3515
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:03,674
So it's pretty,

3516
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,513
it's awesome.

3517
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:05,900
No,

3518
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,591
you see that's,

3519
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:09,800
I'm not a big daytime smoker.

3520
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,570
Like I don't,

3521
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,730
I use it for a lot of
smoke during the day.

3522
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,910
If I'm with lunch.

3523
01:35:14,911 --> 01:35:15,744
So you don't eat,

3524
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:16,820
like,

3525
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,680
if I'm really hungry,

3526
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,543
I'm just too busy.

3527
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,200
I'll smoke a cigarette and that
kills it for another 30 minutes.

3528
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:22,070
Oh my God.

3529
01:35:22,071 --> 01:35:23,150
That's so gross.

3530
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,093
Yeah.

3531
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,670
That's gotta be terrible for you.

3532
01:35:25,671 --> 01:35:26,240
But I do,

3533
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,290
if I'm around people,

3534
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:31,070
like I was staying with a buddy of mine
in Austin and he wakes up in the morning

3535
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:33,170
and has a cup of coffee and a
cigarette and I would do that.

3536
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:34,023
Oh,

3537
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,080
well it's just,

3538
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:36,770
it's more like,

3539
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:37,070
oh,

3540
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:37,431
again,

3541
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:38,300
like when in Rome,

3542
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:38,661
like,

3543
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:39,230
okay,

3544
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:42,290
but I wouldn't do that on like give
you a crazy head rush was I do for you?

3545
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:42,890
You know,

3546
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,210
I'm not crazy about that.

3547
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:45,044
Uh,

3548
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:47,000
that Combo first thing in the morning?

3549
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:47,241
No,

3550
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,910
it makes my stomach whereby shitty.

3551
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:49,401
I know,

3552
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:51,230
but even before they have food.

3553
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:52,580
Yeah.

3554
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:52,731
No,

3555
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:53,210
I think,

3556
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:55,190
I think a lot of people are really,

3557
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:56,323
what's the big deal?

3558
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:56,811
I don't know.

3559
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:57,501
It just goes together.

3560
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:57,951
Perfect.

3561
01:35:57,951 --> 01:36:00,740
It's the taste of the coffee and the
tasty over figure shit out from that

3562
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:01,574
combination.

3563
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,310
Is that a combination where you start
your day out with a new perspective?

3564
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,050
You get a little boost from the cigarette.

3565
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,730
Little boost from the
coffee at the same time.

3566
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:08,870
It's kind of like a kickstart.

3567
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:10,160
Amazing,

3568
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,480
amazing shit.

3569
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,640
Nobody ever talks about
getting rid of cigarettes.

3570
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:14,713
They're like little,

3571
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,830
little evil demons to the,

3572
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,100
they should be fuck elected themselves.

3573
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:19,993
Illegal.

3574
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,290
It's amazing.

3575
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:22,190
It's amazing.

3576
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:25,160
It's amazing when you think about
all the shit that is illegal.

3577
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:27,740
You think of the actual
numbers that they're doing.

3578
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,640
We were talking,

3579
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,500
I was talking to Henry Phillips about the,

3580
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:31,700
I don't know if you guys know Henry,

3581
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:34,840
but a guy who played guitar on Stan hopes

3582
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,580
and we were just like,

3583
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:37,851
you know,

3584
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:41,840
Kinda drunk talking on the phone one
night and we were both talking about how

3585
01:36:41,841 --> 01:36:42,051
like,

3586
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:42,321
God,

3587
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:43,340
what are we still smoking?

3588
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,761
You know,

3589
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:45,320
cause he smoked cigarettes too.

3590
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:46,460
And uh,

3591
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,121
he was saying like,

3592
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:47,271
yeah,

3593
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:51,320
if like an alien life form was like
looking down on us and they'd be like,

3594
01:36:51,321 --> 01:36:51,591
wait,

3595
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:54,590
so this fucking thing kills you know,

3596
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:57,830
like a million people a
year and it's not illegal.

3597
01:36:57,831 --> 01:36:59,510
Like why don't they just make it illegal?

3598
01:36:59,511 --> 01:36:59,811
And it's like,

3599
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:03,410
well cause these five guys are
getting really rich off of it.

3600
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:03,910
And he's like,

3601
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:04,760
when the aliens would be like,

3602
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:09,850
well why not just kill those five guys
and save like the millions and just make

3603
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:10,401
it like,

3604
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:11,900
it seems like a no brainer,

3605
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:12,621
but it's like,

3606
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:12,801
yeah,

3607
01:37:12,801 --> 01:37:14,180
that's just the way
everything's fucked up.

3608
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:14,960
It's like,

3609
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,141
yeah,

3610
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:18,470
why not just kill the five guys who
are fucking everything up for everyone?

3611
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,760
Well there's two arguments.

3612
01:37:19,761 --> 01:37:22,500
Is one the freedom of x or you know,

3613
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,040
the freedom argument where you're,

3614
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,460
you're free to do whatever you want to do,

3615
01:37:25,461 --> 01:37:27,590
even if it's heroin if you want to,

3616
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,820
but why can't you?

3617
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,350
Because it's illegal.

3618
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,310
But should we allow
more things to be legal?

3619
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:35,240
That's the other question.

3620
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:36,230
It's like we have enough.

3621
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:36,541
No,

3622
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:37,910
I'm saying make cigarettes.

3623
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:41,780
It would be hard because a lot of people
say they want to be able to have a

3624
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:42,560
fucking cigarette.

3625
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:42,921
I know,

3626
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:45,090
but I think a lot of people
want to fuck 10 year olds,

3627
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:45,963
two

3628
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,093
cigarettes.

3629
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,750
They legalized fucking 10 year olds.

3630
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:53,360
That might be way more
addictive than cigarettes.

3631
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:54,620
I've never done it.

3632
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,070
The is

3633
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,180
connecting to you.

3634
01:37:57,181 --> 01:37:59,850
You fucking 10 year olds is you
interfering with other people's lives.

3635
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,033
You're making your own.

3636
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,360
You have your own personal freedom
to go and to this obviously being,

3637
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:07,260
I know of course,

3638
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:12,290
but it's a weird thing that you want to
say that it is illegal because I think

3639
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:15,120
you should be able to do whatever the
fuck you want and then if you want to

3640
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:16,110
smoke cigarettes and they,

3641
01:38:16,111 --> 01:38:16,411
you know,

3642
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:17,244
they're addicted.

3643
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:21,000
I think we should look down horribly
on the people who sell them.

3644
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:21,310
You know,

3645
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:24,790
just like any person selling
any fucking deadly drug.

3646
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,060
I mean especially things that just,

3647
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:32,410
what are those 599 fucking ingredients
that they've added to cigarettes to make

3648
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:34,110
them more addictive?

3649
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:36,810
Like what a crazy combo
they've put together.

3650
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:41,880
Smoke those American spirits almost
my whole career they have the,

3651
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,231
their whole thing is,

3652
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:45,600
it's 100% additive free tobacco,

3653
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:46,221
like whole foods,

3654
01:38:46,221 --> 01:38:46,620
cigarettes.

3655
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,810
Is it less addictive?

3656
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,150
Nicotine's pretty addicted to nicotine.

3657
01:38:51,151 --> 01:38:54,820
Nine itself is addictive enough
and all the $500 shit is like

3658
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,290
to make it,

3659
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:57,124
it's like,

3660
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:59,560
like what they do to food at Mcdonald's.

3661
01:38:59,561 --> 01:39:04,561
Like it's designed to have to burn a
certain way for the ash to be shaped

3662
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,100
this certain way.

3663
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:06,881
Do you,

3664
01:39:06,881 --> 01:39:07,270
um,

3665
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:08,930
do you notice the difference between the,

3666
01:39:08,931 --> 01:39:11,430
the cigarette experience from Lego,

3667
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,530
the natural ones and the
ones like the cool lights or,

3668
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,280
yeah,

3669
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:16,980
as well as the different,

3670
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:17,320
what do you,

3671
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,150
you spoke about camel camel lights,

3672
01:39:19,151 --> 01:39:21,130
but when I decided a
really strong one isn't it?

3673
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,700
Campbell's really strong American spirits
actually to me feel like they do more

3674
01:39:24,701 --> 01:39:26,620
damage just because it's a thicker,

3675
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:27,730
they last longer,

3676
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,033
they last long.

3677
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,370
Like I'll smoke like,

3678
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:31,780
you know,

3679
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:34,150
American spirits the next day
I'm coughing up black shit.

3680
01:39:34,151 --> 01:39:36,640
Like I feel like focus many of them.

3681
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:37,421
I mean that's,

3682
01:39:37,421 --> 01:39:41,240
you can't smoke as many
or like I always find so

3683
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,220
when z it's so ridiculous.

3684
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:44,340
Like how do you take your poison,

3685
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,181
uh,

3686
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:45,661
you know,

3687
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:47,580
you gotta be careful
with the natural poison.

3688
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,730
Natural poisons.

3689
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,590
Hard to swallow.

3690
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,850
Well I think it's just,

3691
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,541
it's a no,

3692
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:51,901
you see,

3693
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:52,840
I don't think it's hard to swell.

3694
01:39:52,841 --> 01:39:55,410
I just don't think you
want it as frequently.

3695
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,610
Like the other ones burn faster
and like diet pop you can,

3696
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,780
you can just keep getting knocked down
to camels for like one of camels used to

3697
01:40:03,781 --> 01:40:04,471
have no filter.

3698
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:04,901
They are filled.

3699
01:40:04,901 --> 01:40:05,521
They still have,

3700
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:06,031
they all,

3701
01:40:06,031 --> 01:40:08,940
all cigarettes have like no filter
and filter like lucky strikes,

3702
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:09,470
you know,

3703
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:10,690
come wherever it doesn't matter.

3704
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,470
Well they have some morrow.

3705
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:12,631
Yeah,

3706
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:14,490
they have non unfiltered Marlboros too.

3707
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:15,850
I don't know if they stole mine.

3708
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,070
I don't know if the camel,

3709
01:40:17,071 --> 01:40:17,581
no filters.

3710
01:40:17,581 --> 01:40:17,940
Awesome.

3711
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:18,151
No,

3712
01:40:18,151 --> 01:40:18,721
I know that.

3713
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:19,554
Yeah.

3714
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,240
What is,

3715
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:21,200
what is that all about?

3716
01:40:21,201 --> 01:40:21,830
What's the non,

3717
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:22,260
yeah,

3718
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,930
that's like some dude who's
a fucking rockabilly shit.

3719
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:28,150
He going to the nth degree
to fucking maintain.

3720
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,940
Why else are you smoking lucky
strikes except for the package.

3721
01:40:33,941 --> 01:40:37,650
It looks cool and goes good with your
fucking bowling shirt with flags on it.

3722
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:40,890
Like a grease back hair.

3723
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,420
You're fucking tattoo of
a howling cartoon dog.

3724
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,720
I don't want to give any more
descriptions cause has got,

3725
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,640
I don't get punched in the
face of one of those guys.

3726
01:40:49,641 --> 01:40:50,021
Know what?

3727
01:40:50,021 --> 01:40:53,770
I'm an author and there's those girls
that have that very specific to those

3728
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,070
files,

3729
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:57,130
but bro ask or you were
talking about that?

3730
01:40:57,131 --> 01:40:57,821
That's crazy.

3731
01:40:57,821 --> 01:40:58,654
In Austin like yeah.

3732
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:00,640
Yeah.

3733
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,980
They all dress like or some shit.

3734
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:03,630
Yeah,

3735
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:05,140
they seem is roller derby girls.

3736
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,210
They're all cut from the same cloth.

3737
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:07,510
He went,

3738
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:11,140
the fuck is this longing for the
style path that everybody has?

3739
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:11,770
I don't know.

3740
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:16,270
I have a joke about it where
I say I love Roller Derby.

3741
01:41:16,271 --> 01:41:17,140
I've never seen it,

3742
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:20,260
but I liked that exist because it cuts
down on all the crappy girl bands.

3743
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:21,430
It would be around otherwise

3744
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,500
some attention.

3745
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,401
It's like,

3746
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:27,581
yeah,

3747
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,600
don't start a band dude.

3748
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:28,751
Yeah,

3749
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:28,960
dude,

3750
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,100
that fucking do bro.

3751
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:30,731
Lasker,

3752
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:31,630
uh Oh,

3753
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:32,170
that's fun.

3754
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,130
Or Roller Derby.

3755
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,130
Have a friend from the message board
that's in a roller derby thing.

3756
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:36,760
Vicky,

3757
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,593
from the message board.

3758
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:38,270
Well it's,

3759
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,011
it's just a joke,

3760
01:41:39,011 --> 01:41:40,420
but she's her.

3761
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,343
She's a nice girl,

3762
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:45,040
but she gave me a roller derby
girl tee shirt or wear it.

3763
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:45,933
Oh yeah,

3764
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:46,301
no,

3765
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:47,230
it's a cool thing.

3766
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:49,180
Like Roller Derby girl tee shirt.

3767
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,853
Yeah,

3768
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:52,690
it was fucking podcast is over.

3769
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,010
It's things gone forever,

3770
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:55,200
man.

3771
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,631
And was leaving.

3772
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:56,171
I rambled.

3773
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:58,810
We rambled through a good part of it
where I didn't know what the fuck we were

3774
01:41:58,811 --> 01:41:59,690
talking about getting part.

3775
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,700
I was not awake.

3776
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:01,451
We too tired.

3777
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:01,751
You know.

3778
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:03,280
That's the problem with
doing a late night one.

3779
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:05,530
I work all day doing fear factor.

3780
01:42:05,531 --> 01:42:07,110
I'm out in the fucking hot sun all day.

3781
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,470
That shit cooks your brain.

3782
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:10,900
You can drink a lot of
water and rehydrating helps,

3783
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:12,340
but it makes you really stupid.

3784
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:12,980
At the end of the day.

3785
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:13,600
Just curly.

3786
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,410
Tarred.

3787
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:15,243
How many,

3788
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:20,310
can you see how many people
started listening and stop
just to 1,276 not bad for

3789
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:22,170
the end.

3790
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:22,910
I've been on forever.

3791
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:23,741
Two one half hours,

3792
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:23,921
right?

3793
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:25,570
It's 11:00 PM on the east coast.

3794
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:25,880
Ah,

3795
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:26,713
fuck,

3796
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,060
fuck.

3797
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,811
Or on the west coast,

3798
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:29,644
whether it's 11:00 PM.

3799
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:30,720
All right.

3800
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:31,240
Um,

3801
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,200
thank you Brendon for coming.

3802
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:32,620
Bye.

3803
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,520
That was all asking me.

Tweet that and I'll retweet it.

3821
01:42:51,811 --> 01:42:54,510
And if you've never seen him
go fucking see it will be fun.

3822
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,480
That's hilarious.

3823
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:00,680
You're one of those guys that right now
in my book of like funny guys to watch.

3824
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,870
You're one of those that hasn't
been nationally recognized yet,

3825
01:43:03,871 --> 01:43:05,070
but it's going to happen quick.

3826
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:05,431
Cool,

3827
01:43:05,431 --> 01:43:05,611

3833
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,451
Really Fun.

3834
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:12,631
Yeah,

3835
01:43:12,631 --> 01:43:13,464
they're great.

3836
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:13,680
Yeah,

3837
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,410
we're really lucky and most of it is
these fucking freaks and they're listening

3838
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:16,950
right now.

3839
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:17,910
And we'll be in Houston.

3840
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:18,661
You dirty freaks.

3841
01:43:18,661 --> 01:43:18,841
Yeah,

3842
01:43:18,841 --> 01:43:20,010
we're going to be in Houston together.

3843
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:23,790
We're going to be there with
the Great Joey Coco Diaz.

3844
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:26,520
It's a bonafide experience,

3845
01:43:26,521 --> 01:43:27,360
ladies and gentlemen.

3846
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:28,231
And what does that like?

3847
01:43:28,231 --> 01:43:30,060
October 7th,

3848
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:33,300
October 7th and that said
the Verizon wireless theater.

3849
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:34,230
And uh,

3850
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:35,220
this weekend,

3851
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:38,580
September 23rd?

3852
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:39,420
Yeah.

3853
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:39,750
Yeah.

3854
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,660
September 23rd I'm with,

3855
01:43:41,661 --> 01:43:42,390
um,

3856
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:45,990
Joey and Ari and we're
going to be in Denver,

3857
01:43:45,991 --> 01:43:48,720
Colorado and we're at the paramount
theater and it's almost sold out.

3858
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:49,500
Um,

3859
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,010
such,

3860
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:50,940
it's going to be a lot of fucking,

3861
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:53,300
I haven't been back to
Denver in a long time,

3862
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:54,320
so I'm looking forward to that.

3863
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,520
So that should be the shirt.

3864
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,320
And then the weekend after that,

3865
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:57,800
uh,

3866
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,750
October,

3867
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,580
the first week in October.

3868
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:02,901
Oh No,

3869
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:03,740
the 30th,

3870
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,350
the 30th of September.

3871
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,400
I'm in Washington DC and
that's at the Warner theater.

3872
01:44:10,401 --> 01:44:11,510
And that's what Ari should fear.

3873
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:12,170
Alright,

3874
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:13,060
you dirty pictures.

3875
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:13,880
Yeah.

3876
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,720
You guys are awesome.

3877
01:44:14,721 --> 01:44:15,470
Thanks for tuning in.

3878
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:17,720
Thanks for lasting all
you use stream freaks.

3879
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,190
You hung in there and all your people,

3880
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:21,290
yet they listening to
this at the gym and go,

3881
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:23,750
this is a very disjointed
fucking Weirdo podcast.

3882
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:25,250
Yes and no.

3883
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:30,170
Surely we could edit this and get the
good parts and it would be an hour and 45

3884
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:31,880
minutes of absolute deliciousness.

3885
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:35,780
This would be really good at one 41
45 this podcast would be the shit,

3886
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,270
but I'm sorry we don't
have that for you today.

3887
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:41,070
We have two hours and 20 minutes
of disjointed conversations.

3888
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,230
Some of it's entertaining,

3889
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,830
thousands of pieces on you.

3890
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:46,910
Some of it is just plain
[inaudible] so thanks.

3891
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:50,870
Thanks for tuning in to the podcast and
thanks for everything and thanks to the

3892
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:52,940
flashlight for sponsoring the podcast.

3893
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:54,500
And if you go to Joe rogan.net,

3894
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:58,280
click on the link for the fleshlight
and enter in the code name Rogan.

3895
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:03,430
You will get 15% off the top
one sex door from oh shit.

3896
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,620
Brandon wants to going to
take one home with them.

3897
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:09,110
I don't shoot mad loads and that shit.

3898
01:45:09,111 --> 01:45:09,670
Son.

3899
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,910
I don't know if I can trust myself.

3900
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:11,211
Well,

3901
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:11,660
yeah,

3902
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:12,320
maybe I will.

3903
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,040
You're going to do it.

3904
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:17,780
I'm going to be back on Sunday this Sunday
evening with Graham Hancock and that

3905
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:19,040
is going to be fucking awesome.

3906
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:21,170
My one of my favorite authors of all time,

3907
01:45:21,171 --> 01:45:22,280
if you've never heard of him,

3908
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:25,220
go look them up online and watch
some of his videos on youtube.

3909
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,780
Google on by his books,

3910
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:29,720
fingerprints of the Gods changed
the way I looked at the world.

3911
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:30,350
And uh,

3912
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,430
he's going to be here this Sunday,

3913
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,011
so,

3914
01:45:32,011 --> 01:45:32,240
well,

3915
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:33,073
that's it.

3916
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,003
I'll see you guys soon.

3917
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:34,910
Thanks for everything.

3918
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:35,091

Bye.

3920
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:52,140
Yeah.
