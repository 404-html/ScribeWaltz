1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello,
freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,040
My mom was a wonderful man.
I just spent.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,971
Oh,
you know,

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,930
she's getting old and stuff and I,
I,

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,140
I took her to see Dolly Parton and Tampa
and a Dolly Parton have seen three times

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:13,951
in two months.
Man,

7
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:18,951
she smells like she smells like cotton
candy and baby powder and a high note

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,810
here,
let me try to hit you.

9
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:25,770
Always hit me to cool shit.
Dolly Parton is 70 years old.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,610
She did a three hour fucking show.
She didn't sit in one place.

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,690
You moved all over the stage.
He played piano,

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,250
Guitar,
Banjo,

13
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,080
flute,
and then at one point she blew a

14
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,590
saxophone.
Now she didn't just a saxophone,

15
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,990
like I had a few notes.
She played Yakety Sax,

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,310
which is like grand an,
an,

17
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:42,511
an,
an,

18
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:42,781
an,
an,

19
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,390
an in it that requires some fucking lung
power.

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,680
She's 70 years old.
I took my 70 year old mother to see her

21
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,080
and like mom's got a cane and we had to
get a people mover and stuff like that.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,310
Like she's,
it's crazy man.

23
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,480
So like I took mom to go see Dolly.
Pardon my mother.

24
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,201
You know,
God love her,

25
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,420
she's amazing.
One of my favorite people in the world,

26
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,920
but you know,
she's like tiger,

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,710
you finally made it and I was like,
why?

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,050
And she's like,
because like we got to meet Dolly

29
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,311
Parton,
I was like,

30
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,970
mom,
you could have met Dolly.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
Pardon?
Any old title and that's not a sign of

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,030
prosperity or success or something like
that.

33
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,830
Like that happened back on clerks or
something.

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,410
But those days when Dolly Parton was on
TV,

35
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,210
there was only like three channels.
Yeah.

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,780
She fills arenas like it's crazy.
It's a massive.

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,560
And just watching somebody like,
you know,

38
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,020
I saw,
I saw when I went up to Vancouver to

39
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,790
shoot an episode of the Flash,
I went and I was like,

40
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,680
Holy Shit.
Then there's a part of me,

41
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,150
of course,
I'm not a big country guy,

42
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,350
but my old man loved country and Western
even though we came from New Jersey and

43
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:45,000
we weren't even from like Southern
Jersey.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,280
We're from Central Jersey.
He loved country,

45
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,140
West country and western.
I hated it growing up.

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,630
And he's now dead for like 12,
13 years.

47
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:54,270
And naturally the older one gets,
you hear that music,

48
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,060
it takes you not to the president,
but right back to your childhood.

49
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,280
So lately,
even though I've never been a country

50
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,650
person,
I find more country leaking into my life

51
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,350
and it has everything to do with my
father or something like that.

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,370
So I went to see the show and it was
like I might as well taking my dad with

53
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:09,420
me.
He's been dead so long.

54
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,920
But like that was his dream show.
Like he loved Dolly parties,

55
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:15,930
big country music fan generally love
Dolly Parton.

56
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,240
So I went to see the show the first time
because I was like,

57
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,230
I got nothing to do,
let's go.

58
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,030
And then I was blown away by her
showmanship,

59
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,290
a storyteller as well.

60
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,530
She doesn't just sit there and play the
music between songs.

61
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,380
She'll sit there and tell you a story
about growing up in the rocky mountains.

62
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,000
She's fucking funny dude.
I know she's got like patterns she's

63
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,710
probably been doing for years,
but she talks about.

64
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,720
She's like,
when I was a little girl,

65
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,410
like we went into town and they grew up
fucking poor and she's one of 13

66
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,540
children or something like that and
she's like,

67
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,270
I saw this woman,
beautiful woman,

68
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:46,890
and she's painted like an angel and she
had pretty clothes and real big,

69
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:49,740
pretty hair burn heels and a lot of
makeup.

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,821
And I said,
Mama,

71
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,950
who's that?
And her mom is like,

72
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,470
that's the town Trav,
that girl is nothing but trash.

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,010
And she goes,
I said,

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,710
that's what I want to be when I grow up.
So that's why,

75
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,330
that's why she's got the look.

76
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,163
She's got it.
She's like,

77
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,030
it cost a lot of money to look this
cheap.

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
So she's hilarious.
It's a true like even if you're not like

79
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,630
a Dolly Parton Fan,
like what a true night of entertainment

80
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,370
like,
and you just want to appreciate.

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,430
I saw her like last weekend I took mom
to see her in Tampa.

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,270
And so once innovate time I saw at the
Hollywood bowl and then uh,

83
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,300
like a month ago.
And then I took mom to see her in Tampa

84
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,800
and that was more like,
Hey,

85
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,990
dad would love this,
you know,

86
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:32,170
but she had this weird moment where she
met Dolly in like,

87
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,880
you're talking about two,
seven year old women.

88
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,110
And my mom went in for a fucking kiss.
Not like,

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,950
like,
I want a friendship,

90
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,600
but just like the way you would kiss a
friend.

91
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,320
But,
and then you could see Dolly who's like

92
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,270
had to politically maneuver strangers
for 50 years or so.

93
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,060
Figure out,
do I say,

94
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,040
Hey,
I don't kiss strangers or do I just have

95
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,430
her lips were going for the lips of what
she was going for.

96
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
It was awkward dude.
There was a moment where they were the

97
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,980
exparel.
And then finally they hugged and uh,

98
00:03:58,981 --> 00:03:59,591
you know,
she was like,

99
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:03,100
my husband loved your music and shit.
It's really fucking beautiful the see.

100
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,470
But mom,
I love mom to death.

101
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,190
But mom is like such A.
Everybody's mother is very singular

102
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,260
individual.
But mom had this thing I was trying to

103
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:11,921
figure out.
I was like,

104
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,540
when did this person die?
I think we were talking about Barbara.

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I was like,
when did aunt Barbara di and my mom's

106
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:16,841
like,
oh,

107
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,450
hold on,
and she had this thing when we were

108
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,940
kids,
like she get a calendar from church and

109
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:25,450
she wouldn't write on it your birthday
or a relative's birthday.

110
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,690
She'd write the day that they died.
So like this day was the day uncle Andy

111
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,010
die this day and Connie died.
So my mom keeps all that information.

112
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,300
So she goes,
hold on.

113
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,810
She comes out with a box of like funeral
mass cards.

114
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,460
Like when somebody dies,
you go to a funeral,

115
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,880
there's a little trading card that has
picture of St John.

116
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,140
The bag has a person's name and when
they were born,

117
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,800
when they were dead,
my mom has like a collection,

118
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,080
the way you would collect baseball cards
and shit and we spread them all out on

119
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,930
the table is 12 significant deaths in
our family.

120
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,870
She had lots more,
but the ones that would matter to both

121
00:04:55,871 --> 00:05:00,871
me and her in our immediate zone,
a family and between 12 deaths I was

122
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,440
able to quiz my mother like who died in
1980 and she was like,

123
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,274
oh,
that was grandpa Smith.

124
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,600
Like she is my mom's obsessed with death
but not in a like death is metal.

125
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,130
When she was a child in Catholic school,
they tried to explain hell her,

126
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,290
you know,
as you do in Catholic school,

127
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,900
and she was fucking far too young to get
the idea.

128
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:22,330
So death has been her obsession her
whole life.

129
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,440
Staving it off,
stopping it from taking not just her but

130
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,251
her family,
you know,

131
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,600
she lost her husband to it.
We all.

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
Death is just a natural part of the
process.

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,860
My mom finds it like she's terrified,
but now I as a,

134
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,560
as a creative person,
and I wonder if you feel the same way

135
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,040
and I fancy myself a creative person.
Some people like you,

136
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,720
not very creative,
but I fancy myself a creative person.

137
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,190
No caveats.
Death to me is not scary as much as like

138
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,580
a repugnant idea where you're like,
what?

139
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,480
Stop all this.
Like I'm just getting the hang of it.

140
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,970
I'm just learning like I got so many
more jokes to tell and Shit like that.

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,470
Like death to people who make stuff like
us and that's why you might be the

142
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,890
exception because you deal with death on
a regular basis.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,580
Like with hunting and shit like that.
Like it's just something that probably

144
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,960
enters your purview farm with a month,
but it is like one of those things,

145
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,550
man,
were you like wow,

146
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,830
I hadn't really thought about that too
often,

147
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,340
but she's thinks about.
Often when I think of death I'm

148
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,200
irritated by it because I'm like,
it's unfair.

149
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,150
Like why?
Like.

150
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,220
But I imagine if I was by my
grandmother,

151
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,450
my grandmother lost her sight 12,
14 years before she died and I loved

152
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,340
hanging out with her.
I just play cards with her and shit like

153
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:34,520
that.

154
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
And then when she lost her sight,
she did.

155
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,740
She was no longer interested in living.
So she would sit around and be like,

156
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,120
how are you gram?
You go visit her,

157
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,100
she'd be sitting in the dark and shit,
listen to the radio,

158
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,710
maybe no longer crocheting like she used
to.

159
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,360
We used to play cards,
can do any of that shit.

160
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,730
So she just sat there and he'd be like,
how are you?

161
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,240
And she'd be like,
well I asked him to take me and he said

162
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,040
he didn't answer,
still not today.

163
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,970
And I was like,
Ooh Graham.

164
00:06:55,971 --> 00:07:00,440
She's like Jesus every day I pray that
he finally take me and I'm still here.

165
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:04,230
And she grew slowly,
grew to be bitter about life and shit.

166
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Now,
from where I sit right now,

167
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm the guy that's like,
I never want this party to an oh shit.

168
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,920
But I guess there could be a time in my
life where you know,

169
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,760
everyone you know and love is past and
you just get to a place where you're

170
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:17,900
like,
you know what?

171
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,890
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

172
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:23,891
Like who was it a,
the singer that that just passed a law

173
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,000
was the guy that sang Hallelujah.
Leonard Cohen,

174
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,200
Leonard Cohen didn't interview like
before he passed like five months,

175
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,020
five weeks,
maybe 40 past where he was like,

176
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,220
yeah,
I'm ready for death.

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,290
He's pretty much done everything I
wanted to do and I'm,

178
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm ready for it,
and he went fairly short there.

179
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,800
Shortly thereafter.
Grandma didn't Ms. Young on for a while

180
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,460
but wanted to die.
I hope I'm never that person.
