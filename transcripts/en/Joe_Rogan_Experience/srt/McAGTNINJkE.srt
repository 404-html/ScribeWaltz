1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,110
Three,
two one Brendan Schaub.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,960
You got to say that he's the greatest of
all time.

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,030
Now we're talking about talking about 
money,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,260
man.
Say it.

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,094
Yeah.
We'll live our live mighty mouse the 

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,380
greatest of all time.
I agree.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,143
I said,
you know what?

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,560
I finally agree with you,
man.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,483
Mighty mouse number one in my book.
Now I've seen everybody except fade or 

10
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:25,710
live.
I would have to sing,

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,573
fade,
or live like in his prime to really get 

12
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:29,964
a feel.
I feel like mighty mouse is better than 

13
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,544
all of them.
That dudes aren't so many different 

14
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,850
levels.
It's like he's like,

15
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,290
here's the,
here's everybody,

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,870
here's next level shit,
and here's mighty mouse.

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,780
He's so next level.
Yeah.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,633
It doesn't matter if you,
if you come in and you were the best 

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,920
striker on the planet,
he still gonna fuck you up.

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,370
He'll still fuck you upstanding.

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,920
I'll take you down and submit you.
Anyways.

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,933
You come in at the world class,
wrestler comes in and he's the best 

23
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,754
restaurant in the world.
Mighty mouse mouse still gonna fuck him 

24
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:02,814
up and take him down.
He got a guy who was just amazing at 

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,670
Jujitsu.
Mighty mouse still gonna fuck you up.

26
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,860
Why didn't you still,
you still Wilson Hayes.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,120
She's here.
Wilson Hayes.

28
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,610
After he went,
I'd rather get knocked out though.

29
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,620
So does demoralize Brazilian,
I mean mighty miles.

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,590
His strikings insane.
His takedowns are insight.

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,070
Jujitsu.
His cock confidence is insane,

32
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:30,540
but his work ethic ethic,
cardio the best,

33
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,950
the best.
The best of all time.

34
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,270
Do you have any sort of seen the 
ratings?

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,090
Whoa stuff all time on Fox.
He needs to go up.

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,850
I just pulled out your cornflakes.
How crazy is that?

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,790
We need to see,
we needed to see him go up in weight.

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,860
I think that's the answer.
I know it's obvious.

39
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,840
Dana does.
Dana doesn't want that.

40
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,693
It's on.
Yeah,

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,543
but damn,
those are imagined him against Tj 

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,363
dillashaw really hard.
It's really hard to sell an opponent 

43
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:04,890
against him other than someone going up 
like a or someone or cody going down.

44
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,900
Cody's talked about going down and he 
said he's down.

45
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,190
He says he can make it.
Well,

46
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,040
it's hot.
It's not that uncommon that someone just

47
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,060
rules a weight class so much that he 
goes up and the way they do it on boxing

48
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:19,110
and let's step down,
up or down generally step up.

49
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's see if I could take a bigger dude 
lets you know what I mean.

50
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,074
Like Connor's on that level.
He's like a fuck up to 45 hours but I'm 

51
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:28,260
going to come up to 55 and they for the 
challenge Bj did it.

52
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,230
It's how do you think it is rumor now I 
haven't even texted Dana about this.

53
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,200
There's two UFC two 13 rumor have you 
heard this?

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,580
Jim told me that about Matt Know 
Mcgregor and Co and um,

55
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,050
and Tyron Woodley.
Yeah,

56
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,490
no I saw that 100% bullshit.
What do you think?

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,473
I think from what I hear it's bullshit.
I'm supposed to be utilizing my 

58
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,010
connection.
I know.

59
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,844
See a text you heard it's bullshit.
I'm pretty sure I saw every should have 

60
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,320
a rumor section,
you know rumor,

61
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:57,321
part of the show rumors,
rumors for Joe Bro.

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,293
Dude,
you'd have to best rumors show of all 

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,670
time.
I had some deep I t shirt aerial,

64
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,504
shut that down but seidler I'm pretty 
sure cyborgs fighting at UFC two 13 

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,923
anaheim.
She tweeted that out recently like as I 

66
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,400
was getting to know us something 
recently,

67
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,560
we should tweet it out that a few of he 
doesn't get her a fight,

68
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,210
let her go.
It doesn't work like that.

69
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,010
Like I love when fighters do that,
but it's like,

70
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,270
hey,
if you don't fight me soon,

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm fucking out here.
You ain't going nowhere bitch.

72
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,570
Like you contract you have to but to 
defend UFC here,

73
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,510
which is,
you know,

74
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,270
they offered her fights like too and she
wasn't ready so they're like,

75
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,890
dude,
we tried all right,

76
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,724
we'll figure something out but Jeez and 
now you want to take off like give us a 

77
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,634
second here.
And in her defense apparently didn't 

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,100
mean there's the only way the that like 
you saw it or would grant her there.

79
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,640
It goes to our 29 my first year fc fight
in the USA.

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,590
So who do you think she fights?
He's just fine.

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,210
Just says she's fights Duran to me.
She says she is fighting Duran to me.

82
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,400
What's up son?
And you know what's cool with that?

83
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,920
My goodness is Sunday.
July.

84
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,750
Oh Shit.
This is,

85
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,390
you can do both.
Oh Shit.

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,560
God Damn Dude.
And there's a big brown breakdown live.

87
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,123
Yeah,

88
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,780
everybody's all girl Ebi.
July 3rd oh shit.

89
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,360
UFC requested it.
The UFC asked us,

90
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,230
can you do an all girl Ebi?
And I said,

91
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
Damn.
I thought you'd never ask.

92
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,980
Hell yes.
Jump in that bitch.

93
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:28,814
She's not going to get touched and 
coming in and just smash all your girls 

94
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,320
all at once.
Get someone big.

95
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,910
No,
I just have all of them jump on her.

96
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,733
Be Sick.
I go to fucking King Kong was a little 

97
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,480
plane Kong movie.
No,

98
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,314
it looks dope.
It's a dope from went for awhile when 

99
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,980
you're,
you know you left at 12 year old boy and

100
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,390
your brain out.
It's fun.

101
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,523
But for,
that's really stupid hospital down to 

102
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,314
see it though.
What's his face is a John c Riley's in 

103
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,560
that movie.
He's hilarious.

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,230
Yes.
And he's done Ralph.

105
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,670
Really?
He's that guy in the movie.

106
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,080
He's,
he's comic relief.

107
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,490
Does he play for your health?

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,031
He plays,
it.

109
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,470
Does lead to crash,
landed there,

110
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,360
but does he play the guy from,
for your health?

111
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,770
Do you ever watch that on Tim and Eric?
No.

112
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,310
Do John C.
Reilly is humongous.

113
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,144
He's so huge.
But he'd love doing the Tim and Eric 

114
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,060
Show.
You're saying size wise on no,

115
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,970
no,
no.

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,580
As a star.
And then tim and Eric is so crazy,

117
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,100
bizarre,
obscure comedy show.

118
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,360
It's fucking nuts.
It's like key and peele on,

119
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,520
on acid.
And there it is.

120
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:33,521
I've seen this big ass after does this 
show and he plays a character.

121
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,150
He's like a news host.
He's Gotten,

122
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,670
oh,
I have to,

123
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,170
his name is Steve.
Dr Steve Berlin.

124
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,560
Of course,
I can't believe,

125
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:43,394
like,
I couldn't think of the doctor Steve 

126
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,540
Brewer.
He's the funniest guy.

127
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,850
It does it for free.
Yes.

128
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:50,960
He don't give a shit.
He's also,

129
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,810
he's one of the funniest guys of all 
time,

130
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,500
like that,
that fucking scene or him and,

131
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,334
uh,
him in the fucking Neil Farrell and not 

132
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,380
in stepbrothers,
but in Talladega nights discussing,

133
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,214
shake it,
bake.

134
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,350
I mean,
come on.

135
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,443
Nobody tells him when he's uh,
he takes over and he's his girl and 

136
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,860
paints his face over here.
Fuck you doing.

137
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:12,694
He's like,
I'm looking at man cause like you want 

138
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:18,860
to hang out with nobody calls him up and
ask him how to use history.

139
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,500
Why the fuck would you want to watch tv 
while listening to the radio?

140
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,710
Because I like to party that movies got 
like the best timing of all time.

141
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,410
I came and will ferrell together.
You could just have them.

142
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,393
All you need is to just get a couple of 
funny guys to write some loose format 

143
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,370
for them and just let them go wild and 
go.

144
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,500
They might be two funniest pairs ever do
cheat.

145
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,120
He was pleased,
played so serious in that movie.

146
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:48,954
Uh,
gangs in New York and met him in gangs 

147
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,810
in His York.
Right.

148
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
He was a serious dude.
Nasty dude.

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,673
Top Daniel.
That must be so much fun for me in that 

150
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,250
movie.
He's so shit.

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,060
I felt like it was like he was really 
the butcher.

152
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,390
They said he's an asshole on set.
He was in character man.

153
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,490
He's one of those,
I'm in character guys.

154
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,560
Two people played a bad motherfucker in 
that movie.

155
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,280
That movie gangs in New York is scary.
It's underrated.

156
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,353
Oh it's so good.
But it's scary because you imagine like 

157
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,660
what life was like if you were born into
that environment.

158
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,780
Cause those were real on whether or not 
that exactly happened with it.

159
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,614
Now how much,
I mean I'm sure there's some sort of a 

160
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,730
dramatic flair that they added to the 
reality of that,

161
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,593
but whatever the fuck it was,
there have been places on earth that 

162
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:39,530
have existed where people hacked each 
other up with axes and swords like that.

163
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,960
Just when you watch that and you realize
Jesus,

164
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,000
that was the only like,
you know,

165
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,280
a few hundred years ago,
not that far.

166
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,590
Not that far in the past.
Indians and shit.

167
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,710
I mean with,
they would,

168
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,650
uh,
you know,

169
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,050
I would retaliate,
you know,

170
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:57,020
cause white man came and tried to take 
their lands so the Indians were like,

171
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,230
fuck yeah,
we spot a wagon.

172
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,870
We're gonna fuck you up.
Oh yeah.

173
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,760
You know what I mean?
So it was just back and forth.

174
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,590
You got to worry about not just fucking 
a bears and shit,

175
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,424
but you got to worry about an Indian's 
damn that if the Indian spot you and 

176
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,440
they want to fuck you,
you're done.

177
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,980
Son Does a lot of cannibalism going on 
to the people don't know about,

178
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,310
they probably love eating white people,
especially the Nez perce.

179
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,653
I just saw Steve Rinella told me about 
all this shit when I was hanging with 

180
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,530
them in the woods when Callan and mine 
went hunting with him.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,420
Are there any stories terrifying?
Are there any stories?

182
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,523
There must be stories of slaves that 
escaped and went and hid out with 

183
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,990
Indians.
You know what I mean?

184
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,520
Put on this to others and stuff like 
that,

185
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,920
but the paint on,
I don't think the Indians are let you in

186
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,610
understand.
No they won't you.

187
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,540
No.
The Indians would be,

188
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,633
they understand for evil,
they understand that were guys are 

189
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:53,744
running for their lives.
There had to be so you get to the tent 

190
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,600
and listens to,
and there was all sorts of stories about

191
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,570
the mountain men meeting Indians and 
fallen in love.

192
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,190
He didn't fall in love.

193
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,290
I've seen movies.
Well you know what,

194
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,140
it would have to be a white guy helping 
the Indians out and,

195
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,083
and being on the Indian side,
understanding that that was being taken 

196
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,290
rewards for you.
Dances with wolves.

197
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,770
Hundred percent.
Dude,

198
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,604
I watched it.
I want to see resonated in my mind it 

199
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,740
seemed really than anything I watched on
the news.

200
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,870
Dude,
we fucked him up so bad.

201
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,930
We fucked him up.
So just our diseases,

202
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,520
we get like the flu and you take that 
pill.

203
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,220
Can you imagine percent of the native 
Americans like talk guys,

204
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,490
dead dudes are like,
do escaping.

205
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,543
We're going to go find some Indians and 
live with them and fuck all the Indian 

206
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:55,011
women to imagine or could you touch the 
women even crazier?

207
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:58,860
Could you image show up?
They show up with these gigantic dead.

208
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:03,710
Yeah,
you're not coming in my fucking town for

209
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,113
Shauna's problems for sure.
I just don't think that if anybody came 

210
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,870
from like those native Americans that 
were here back in that day,

211
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,220
like you know,
they,

212
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,250
they were competing with each other.
You know,

213
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,143
I mean there was a lot going on there,
but like to say that the white people 

214
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,820
feel better,
and that's true though.

215
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,743
Right?

216
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,880
True though.
It's true though.

217
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,610
You had a cold and you just watched 
everybody die.

218
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,290
You like,
you gave them a cold.

219
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,170
Like you came over on a boat,
you got sick and everybody died.

220
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,970
90% of the people died.
They didn't know though.

221
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,490
But how crazy is that that we,
our bodies adapt to bugs and diseases so

222
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:48,110
well maybe they just said that.
Maybe they just slaughtered them all and

223
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:48,511
say,
dude,

224
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:53,511
let's just say they say yes.
Guess what?

225
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,410
We got some bad news to the Navajo.
Indians are wiped out.

226
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,410
They had disease and someone sneezed on 
homes.

227
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,910
They're allergic to cheese.
Yeah,

228
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:08,911
they all died.
There was a gone now basically it's crew

229
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,120
knows what part of history is real 
enough.

230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,973
Indians in the UFC Indian can imagine a 
Jim Thorpe and the U of C Some I don't 

231
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,780
send your just from a reservation comes 
in and fucks everybody up.

232
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,770
It'd be like Indian versus white gets 
him from street fighter.

233
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,020
You never know.
Well,

234
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,863
I don't think so.
There's gotta be some bad ass Indians 

235
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,220
out there like full blown up to go to 
Canada.

236
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,140
Bad Ass Indians.
So you remember that one?

237
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:40,980
Native American that Bas rutten fought.
Remember that dude?

238
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:43,710
He was in King of the cage.
She fired a lot of uh,

239
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,410
different fights.
He was like a real good mid level guy.

240
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,690
Big Native American guy.
I don't remember.

241
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,920
Find out Bas rutten's last MMA fight.
He fought an Indian and the last one?

242
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,763
Yeah.

243
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,790
Or was the guy a white guy but claiming 
one 16th Indian.

244
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,630
I'm trying to it as the card.
I think the guy was native American.

245
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,464
I'm pretty sure.
I don't think you're supposed to say 

246
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,160
Indian.
You mean you want to off?

247
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
That's right.
Rubin Hurricane Villareal.

248
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,910
That's the last guy he fought.
That sounds Mexican.

249
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,510
Reuben doesn't sound very Indian.
Find out what nationality.

250
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,680
Oh,
warpath.

251
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,150
Yeah.
Oh God damn.

252
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,190
He looks Indian.
He does for sure.

253
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,760
Big Dude.
Six 14.

254
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,340
Sasa salty record.
Oh Shit.

255
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,870
22 wins.
28 losses.

256
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,853
This same for you.
If I'm answering their belly dump bus 

257
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:33,250
route and doesn't give a fuck that part 
Indian right.

258
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,413
Get that cheque right.
You'll have to be one 16th to get that 

259
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,870
chance.
He has to prove that shit.

260
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,250
Do we got an MMA,
a wikipedia there?

261
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,150
Well either way.
Either way.

262
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:44,170
He's Indian.
His Fudge,

263
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,450
at least in my book he is,
he's it part,

264
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,440
oh he's full of patchy corn.

265
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,840
My book.
That's,

266
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,674
so that's one thing that I do know.
I don't know a whole lot about native 

267
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Americans,
but I know that the Sioux people,

268
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:55,594
they actually call themselves look Coda 
and the other Indians would call them 

269
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,044
the sue cause it means enemy.
So there was like all sorts of crazy 

270
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,430
infighting.
Look at that.

271
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,280
Oglala Lakota fight gets first UFC went 
okay.

272
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,620
Other than that dude looks super native 
American.

273
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,470
The guy and the right or left left.
The guy looks white as shit.

274
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:16,220
He kind of left with the jury is totally
his Chin Deanna.

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,730
Right?
He looks like a straight white boy.

276
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,823
Crazy Apache to me.
He looks to see what Baskins moms come 

277
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,060
on site.
He looks straight out of fucking,

278
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,150
I've seen this dude fight.
It's a tough dude.

279
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,133
Yeah.
Really tough,

280
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,043
strong American native as fuck.
You got that dude come on and say I'm 

281
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,920
going to lie.
His name is David.

282
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,310
Well you know what they look like.
They look like people from Siberia.

283
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,770
That's the origination of the native 
American.

284
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,783
They traced the genome back.
They did this thing for 'em when they 

285
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,210
were,
uh,

286
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,970
the Mormons are trying to prove that 
Jesus came from a,

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,833
uh,
native Americans like that say way more 

288
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,033
than bars are trying to prove that the 
lost tribe of Israel was the date of 

289
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,730
Americans cause it's in one of their 
books.

290
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,370
God,
good.

291
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,480
That's a good one right there.

292
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,490
Turns out that the Indians,
but you know,

293
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,880
in history we paint them out to be 
savages.

294
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,743
Well,
we're so lucky that this fucking people 

295
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,754
that studied this shit and so that we'd 
know that we could sit here in a room 

296
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,743
and just talk shit and Google.
How the fuck did people get here from 

297
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,620
Asia?
They walked across the bering strait.

298
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,454
We know that.
It's like the fact and then once they 

299
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,490
did the genome and the native American,
they went yup,

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,550
these people from Siberia.
So as people from Siberia,

301
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:36,040
if you ever look updated,
fucking strong features,

302
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,893
super strong stout shane bones and 
fucking like rue salon prod mocad vowed 

303
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,790
to cough,
providing a cough.

304
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,713
I don't know.
Since he said he was like pissing black 

305
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,020
times,
like you know what I think I'm good.

306
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,540
He's one of 'em uh,
speed of sport guys.

307
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,260
This guy

308
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,300
is,
he's still working with him.

309
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,134
He's a friendly guy and he's a nit curse
on God and the curse on worked with 

310
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,110
them.
He's the only man.

311
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:57,944
He's been in some wars.
That's what's up straight up the way 

312
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,090
that guy fights.
You can't do that for very long.

313
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,103
You know,
there's guys like floyd mayweather that 

314
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,820
can go an entire career and get rocked 
like maybe three,

315
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:08,654
four times.
Like where he got tagged a little and 

316
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,540
then you got guys like providing a cough
that just butt heads with everybody.

317
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,490
They tried to break everybody.
He had a back to,

318
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,320
he had to like back to back fights with 
Alan.

319
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:20,450
Gerry.
And then with a homeboy,

320
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,130
the,
the black velour.

321
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,320
The beast though.
Desert Storm.

322
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,220
Yeah.
Tim Brown.

323
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,510
Tim Brown.
Tim Bribing him.

324
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,840
Hey Os wars.
No,

325
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,480
tim badly.
I have to fight.

326
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,910
Had a stutter for six months.
His wife was like,

327
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,020
please stop fighting.

328
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,100
He was sick for like months.
Not Jesus Christ.

329
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,730
I'm not surprised.
It was the fight of the year to chaos.

330
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,590
Chaos.
It was chaos.

331
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,820
Those fights,
man.

332
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,740
I'm so torn because while I'm watching,
I'm enjoying the shit out of it.

333
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,070
And me too.
But part of me is going,

334
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:49,904
fuck,
I know what these guys are doing 

335
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,224
themselves right here.
It's we how you almost like you have an 

336
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:58,130
extra bump of information.
That's too much,

337
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,820
but it's it,
it still makes like a UN Arturo Gotti,

338
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:05,110
micky ward fight even more glorious when
they walked in the room.

339
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,070
He just like Jesus Christ and they are a
man.

340
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,083
Like I'll never forget with Jon Jones,
when he fought Gustus Finn and I fought 

341
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,230
[inaudible],
you know,

342
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:15,850
he had a war and my coach Tony Jeffries 
has never been to UFC.

343
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,120
The UFC has ever been to.
And John Jones one and he's coming by on

344
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:23,750
a stretcher because he was so beat up 
and his lips were out to here.

345
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
Both lives clogged and he's shaking.
That was when he went straight to the 

346
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,021
hospital.
She's shaking,

347
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,590
she's fine.
I just,

348
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:32,010
from there I just grabbed him and I 
didn't know what to say.

349
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:32,601
I went,
Dude,

350
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,050
I'm so proud of the champ and he just 
put a thumbs up.

351
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:37,800
I'd probably be cutting,
see me like stewie eyes like [inaudible]

352
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,500
shit.
And my coach goes,

353
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,420
holy fuck,
that's the winner.

354
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,200
[inaudible] does some about Jon Jones.
I think this is,

355
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:49,040
I got a theory,
I got an older brother theory and I feel

356
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,180
like dudes who have bad ass older 
brothers can fucking take it.

357
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,050
Like Weidman.
Weidman had an older brother and him and

358
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,060
the older brother apparently according 
to some of his interviews,

359
00:16:59,061 --> 00:16:59,641
they,
you know,

360
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,070
and his older brother beat him up and 
Shit,

361
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,890
man makes you tough.
Like Matt Hughes,

362
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,753
two twins.
Imagine looking at yourself every day 

363
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,950
just trying to beat up your shot wrap 
and just a dead even every fucking time.

364
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,640
Just a war.
Jim Miller,

365
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,400
Dan Miller,
a lot of these two guys.

366
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,380
My brother used to beat me up,
but I never,

367
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,150
uh,
not beat me up,

368
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,530
but just like a sock my shoulder,
like about what?

369
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,230
Fart.
He socked me full.

370
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,760
I'd have to sit there and I would take 
it.

371
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,470
I would never fight back.
And I was like in,

372
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,430
in box and there's the Smith family.
Liam Smith.

373
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,390
Uh,
although Smith,

374
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,253
there's four brothers,
a three are world champions called 

375
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,340
Miller and Michael Miller.
I'll just fuck.

376
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,450
Yeah.
Savages.

377
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,800
Monsters.
Man Does a tums on brothers.

378
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,840
The lozan brothers,
brothers,

379
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,900
Nogueira brothers,
shit.

380
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,070
Twins.
They're right too.

381
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,030
There's a bunch,
man.

382
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,220
Dude,
so many mud shogun and Ninja.

383
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,860
Oh,
here,

384
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,400
here's something that fucking rock your 
world or not rock your world.

385
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,810
But if John Jones wasn't such,
you know,

386
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,950
a fuck up for lack of better terms,
he would,

387
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,640
we're not even having this conversation 
that mighty mouse is the best ever.

388
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,550
He'd be just going based off his regular
schedule now.

389
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,220
He'd be 13,
14 time world champ if no one beat him.

390
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,233
And he'd probably be fighting that 
heavyweight and having that belt to go 

391
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,050
down as best ever.
Well,

392
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,640
he's still got a chance.
I mean,

393
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,474
John John's only 30 years old,
which is crazy because that means he's 

394
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:21,960
really about to jump into his prime.
I say like an athlete's prime for combat

395
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:22,794
sports.
I feel like it's somewhere around 30 to 

396
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,000
32 for heavyweight.
I see.

397
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,980
I don't think everyone,
I think the lighter weight classes,

398
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,720
it's earlier,
but look at the welterweights,

399
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,633
the t,
the champs are always aligned around 

400
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:36,060
that age.
Except for GSP.

401
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:40,050
I think he won a title when he was in 
his late twenties,

402
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,240
twenties.
When is tyron Woodley's what,

403
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,580
33 yeah.
Yeah.

404
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,241
That's fair.
I mean,

405
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,580
he had wrestling background.
John Jones,

406
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,700
what was wrong?
How old's Robbie?

407
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm Jon Jones is uh,
his suspension comes up in July.

408
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,850
Did you hear what Dana White said today?
I texted to you.

409
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah.
They're going to fight.

410
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,230
There was a Nakamoto,
right?

411
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,093
Yeah.
Brett accomo interviewed Dana White and 

412
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,420
uh,
from espn he said that,

413
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,010
uh,
DC,

414
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,080
we'll fight Jon Jones if,
if,

415
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,280
but if John Jones isn't ready by it,
I think it's the July card.

416
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,670
Was it July 29th?
Yeah.

417
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,504
If he's not ready by then,
then he's gonna Fight Jimi Manoa and 

418
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,160
then they'll fight down the road.
Crazy.

419
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,440
So no warm up for Jon Jones.
If he doesn't want one,

420
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:22,050
then what do you think about that?
Do you think that's smart for John?

421
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,730
What do you think John should take a 
warm up?

422
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,923
He should take a warm up.
The UFC should give them a warmup cause 

423
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,040
joe,
when has it ever worked when a guy takes

424
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,980
this much time off and just throw them 
right to the top of the heap?

425
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,163
Think of chill,
sewn in like there's a lot of guys and 

426
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:36,990
people go,
well dominick Cruz,

427
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,490
dominick Cruz didn't fight.
Cody Garbrandt,

428
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,860
Tj dillashaw after all that time he 
found up Ms Asakia,

429
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,703
who's a tough guy,
but it's a cocky and then he went right 

430
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:47,010
into tj.
Still a warm about Tj was,

431
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,690
no,
the teacher was a big gap.

432
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,093
I know,
but at least he didn't fight that first 

433
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,760
fight back.
He ain't being tj.

434
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,723
Right.
But you know that he got injured after 

435
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:58,730
the Mitzi gawky fight and it was another
year plus [inaudible] fought again.

436
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,720
And He,
and he might be the outlier here,

437
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,550
but I'm just saying he's not like,
but,

438
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,523
but he's not as good in the first fight.
If you look at them at the Tj fight and 

439
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,270
then you look at him in the second fight
when he fought uriah faber,

440
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,790
he's way better in the of fape.

441
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,210
Correct.
He's more lean.

442
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,640
He's fitter and he's,
he dealt with a lot of the problems that

443
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,820
he has.
His serious plantar fasciitis,

444
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,673
ma'am.
Have you ever had that fucking 

445
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,300
nightmare?
I've had to deal with it.

446
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,970
And you look at his style,
it's like,

447
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,830
uh,
this Fascia in the bottom of your feet,

448
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,510
tears.
You can't even like,

449
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:30,660
you can't get out of bed to warm up.
It's a fucking nightmare.

450
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,330
It's impossible.
Dominick Cruz is all footwork.

451
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,583
And what happened after he tore his acl.
He took a long time off and his feet 

452
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,263
just weren't strong enough to keep up 
with his training because this training 

453
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,920
is so foot movement.
Yeah.

454
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,830
That's all my it back to the point.
Should John Get a warm up?

455
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,790
You're,
you're in the grand scheme of things.

456
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,624
I understand.
We want these big paydays and you want 

457
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,110
them the big rating.
So he tossed them DC.

458
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,400
John Jones,
a huge raider,

459
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,343
right?
But if something happens like Rhonda 

460
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,390
Rousey lost weapons,
we gave Rhonda Warmup,

461
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,910
so you get paid on that.
It's huge drawl.

462
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,030
And then she fights the huge draw.
But when you just toss them right to the

463
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,890
very top,
it's a one and done man.

464
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,140
What does it make sense to me where they
were worried,

465
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,390
I guess,
you know with the sale,

466
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,060
you know you buy something like $4 
billion,

467
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,160
you want to,
you want to maximize your profits.

468
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,023
You know,
it's just the issue comes up with 

469
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,500
purists,
which I think all of us are purists,

470
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,363
right?
When you consider like when you look at 

471
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,800
it,
like at the end of the day,

472
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,100
I want to see the number one contender 
fight the champ.

473
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,113
I ride the fence,
I get the business side from what the 

474
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,840
they want to do and then I get from a 
pure fighter standpoint.

475
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,693
I was just about to say,
but I'm a hypocrite because I was happy 

476
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,360
when Dan Henderson got that shot against
Michael Bisping.

477
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm like,
that's what we want to see or GSB.

478
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,500
It makes no sense.
He's fighting Bisbee well,

479
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,470
the problem with the GSP business fi's,
it ties up the division.

480
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:51,340
And when you have a guy like Robert 
Whitaker who just ice is Jocko roy hole,

481
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,260
that's the best adjective to use it.
He's a killer.

482
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,350
Winokur's a killer.
Straight killer.

483
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,790
Straight killer.
Who beats him in the top three?

484
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,723
I liked his chance to get to anyone.
Now Yoel Romero is such a freak show 

485
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,940
such a free that sun.
Maybe you,

486
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,310
you,
you're 100% right.

487
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,390
That it's a hell of a fight.
I mean,

488
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,224
do you see Yoel Romero and chocolate?
I don't even think you'll beat jock 

489
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:17,261
gray.
Really.

490
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,570
You could really give some of that fight
to Jock,

491
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:19,770
right?

492
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,250
Like you remember it was a split 
decision.

493
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,084
He had that one moment where he spun and
Jock right with that spinning back fist 

494
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:26,304
and put 'em on Queer Boulevard occur.
May jock caray looked like a fucking 

495
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,743
amateur.
Just fucking hawked them down even at 

496
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:34,474
his back's like,
get the fuck out of here Jujitsu 

497
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,440
vehicle.
See it.

498
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,383
I feel like whittaker is better now than
ever and I think he's only 25 or 26 26 

499
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,060
26 I think somewhat.
He's no,

500
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,923
no older than that.
He's a young buck and he's coming up 

501
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,164
strong and he's another one that went 
from one 70 to one 85 and improved 

502
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,244
tremendously.
As soon as he stopped cutting that 

503
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:53,464
radical amount of weight.
All of a sudden dude's got vitality and 

504
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,880
power is not in the band.
Johnson fight,

505
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,743
the Bronson fight serious.
That was a big wake up call to people 

506
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,560
cause [inaudible] was putting it on him.

507
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,840
Well Brunton rushed Adam Chin first and 
I was like,

508
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,310
oh my God,
how's this gonna work out?

509
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,144
And he'd covered up you smart compose 
and then just yet those Australian 

510
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,974
fucking shovel.
I'm a fan now and I thought he's going 

511
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:16,600
to lose that fight and I'm like,
oh,

512
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,750
that's my guy down.
I'm down there and see all the crocodile

513
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:23,950
Dundee means no.
There was me and my man,

514
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,770
a dude from Australia fights a dude who 
calls himself the alligator.

515
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,900
She,
that's just,

516
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,910
that's a great fucking it out done.
Besides working now this is a knife.

517
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,630
Fucking now that's a Nazi.
Yeah man.

518
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,320
He's the new hotness and that divisions 
eat some hotness like the new blood.

519
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,120
I love when there's new blood cause like
fun.

520
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,463
That's what we need.
Now we need that heavyweight and light 

521
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:46,630
heavyweight

522
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,470
light heavyweight were like,
yeah,

523
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,363
I guess you know what dc John King has 
his fight each other every other 

524
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:52,101
weekend.
Well,

525
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,570
what did you think about rumble 
retirement?

526
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,090
When I went,
when I saw here's what happened,

527
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,400
right.
They read off the submission.

528
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,810
DC raised his hand,
you know,

529
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,653
I'm going into interview DC and rumble 
and DC are hugging and then DC puts his 

530
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:05,980
hand on rebel.
Shoulders goes,

531
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:06,801
he,
you go first,

532
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,000
you go first.
That was a bad idea,

533
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:08,691
I think.
No,

534
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:09,860
I don't think it was a bad idea,
man.

535
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,450
I think it was classy.
You know,

536
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,030
d this is what I think about DC at the 
end of the day.

537
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,090
Daniel cormier is a really good man.
Great Guy.

538
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,100
He's a really good man.
You know what I mean?

539
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,690
Hate.
I don't get it,

540
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,291
man.
I mean,

541
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,410
he's competitive and you know,
in before the fight he's saying,

542
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,244
you know,
it's too bad that Anthony Johnson's in 

543
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,620
my weight class because they'll never be
champion.

544
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,453
You know?
He's saying all this shit that you're 

545
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,950
going to say,
but at the end of the day,

546
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,360
it's true.
He's a,

547
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:33,194
he's a,
he's on another level when it comes to 

548
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,950
his ability to compete there level,
there's another level,

549
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,123
and just to critique the fight,
they're a DC looked at in the worst 

550
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:42,254
shape we've seen him.
I thought if Anthony Johnson can beat 

551
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:44,954
them,
this can be the time.

552
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,913
Anthony,
I didn't know going into it and if 

553
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:48,680
Johnson didn't want to fight or be in 
there,

554
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,900
he had one.
If you even talking about retiring,

555
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,950
you're fucked with a guy like dc who's 
going to grind it out.

556
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,843
It was just not going to rumble.
Johnson was about four inches from a 

557
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,454
head kick knockout.
He caught him with the foot in the face 

558
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,680
and broke his nose.
If he caught him with his Shin,

559
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,783
if he,
you know when you mean see where that 

560
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,284
kick landed him and you feel like God 
damn toes Daniel Cormier can fucking 

561
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,610
take it.

562
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,030
He can fucking take it.
Cause he,

563
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,840
he took that shot right in the chin.
He went back to his corner.

564
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,420
Is Nelson's clearly jack,
we're looking at an in between rounds.

565
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,360
Like that looks really broken.
Went out there like it didn't bother him

566
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,450
at all.
And that was a good tune up fight for DC

567
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,050
too.
Not that Anthony Johnson's a tuneup,

568
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,903
but his game plan was crazy.
He obviously didn't execute the game 

569
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,654
plan.
So I think that was good for DC cause I 

570
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,440
think if that DC fights John,
he's in trouble.

571
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,450
I wonder what would've happened if 
rumbled connected.

572
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,810
My question is,
look at this smack,

573
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,490
he catches him right with them.
It's almost better.

574
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,900
He bent down,
his nose absorbs hell.

575
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:44,734
Yeah,
those small knows to Jesus Christ in 

576
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,563
combination.
We've never really seen DC with a gut 

577
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,530
like that.
Well look it,

578
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,940
obviously it wasn't affecting them.

579
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,580
Who knows if he's injured.
He probably was always injured.

580
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,050
He's always doing some shit.
Scott,

581
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,240
he's got a problem with his knee and 
he's had it.

582
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,610
He's had it worked on.
It just gets dumped cells in it.

583
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,300
She's going to have 38 cause he's like,
that kicked fully connected.

584
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,680
Right.
They just took out.

585
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,383
He went down into it,
which I think you didn't get full 

586
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:12,800
momentum like you said with the Shin 
where he met a lot of trouble.

587
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,280
It looked a lot harder than I thought it
was.

588
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
But it was certainly the foot.
And the thing about fetus,

589
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,570
you can knock some of the fuck out with 
a foot,

590
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,550
no doubt about it.
But a foot gives a little bit.

591
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah,
I was just going to say it.

592
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,040
It gives a little bit,
you know,

593
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,190
the first time I ever realized like how 
much of a benefit that was.

594
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,060
I worked out with Maurice Smith and 
Maury Smith was showing me like the,

595
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,850
when Maury Smith faces a heavy bag,
it's really interesting.

596
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,240
Like if he throws a roundhouse kick,
the bag goes straight.

597
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,130
Like he hits it,
like he's hitting straight

598
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,963
on,
he's like stepping to the side and 

599
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,254
hitting straight on.
It's almost like he's hitting it with a 

600
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,790
front kick in terms of how the bag moves
away from him.

601
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,700
And in the,
the taekwondo and karate days,

602
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,623
everybody went round,
he's round kicks and it was more like a 

603
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,404
slap.
It didn't have the same kind of 

604
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,234
penetration.
And when you see like a Maury Smith 

605
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:04,680
where Pedro Hisdo to Eddie,
do you remember when you and I went to,

606
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,220
we went to Beverly Hills Jujitsu way 
back in the day,

607
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,143
way back in the day.
You are purple belt went to Beverly 

608
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,810
Hills and Jitsu and uh,
we watched marco who was kicked the bag.

609
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,291
Oh No,
no,

610
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,060
no.
Pedro Huizar was Pedro.

611
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:18,341
His,
oh,

612
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:20,490
was kicking the back.
Who else was too?

613
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,930
But Pedro,
his,

614
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,764
oh,
I never saw anybody in my life who had 

615
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,030
lake kicks that were as scary as Pedro,
his,

616
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:30,690
oh,
I remember he kicked Rico Rodriguez once

617
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,673
when they fought and the thud,
the sub walk and you looked at it and 

618
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,251
you went,
oh,

619
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,450
you can't take those.

620
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,250
There's no way.
No one's taking those.

621
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:41,160
You can only take so many of those.
Even randy couture was like,

622
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:41,970
yeah,
but he,

623
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,803
he was on the show and he goes,
look at my leg that's from fucking 

624
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,560
fucked up forever for,
it's like a huge dent.

625
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,570
Like someone took a bat.
Does the same thing to randleman.

626
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,730
He would leave dense in you,
dude.

627
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,690
Do you remember?
Why?

628
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,130
Do you remember I was watching and 
kicked the bag.

629
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,970
Do you remember that?
I think it was someone else we went to.

630
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,500
Beverly Hills should use who?
You weren't there?

631
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,190
No,
I'd never been in a beverly hills.

632
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,480
I've been there once and it wasn't with 
those that toffel faulty memory.

633
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,430
It was you and me,
man.

634
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
What was weird too without fives.
Anthony goes,

635
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,594
I'll move on to something else.
And then his twitter background changes 

636
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,160
the Los Angeles Rams.
He put the Hashtag La Rams and ma.

637
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
So all my friends are texting me and now
I judge them for it.

638
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,971
They're like,
oh bro,

639
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:23,550
he's played for the rams with you 
fucking moron.

640
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,800
No,
he's not playing for the,

641
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,883
you know,
he's not fucking suiting up for the 

642
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:28,254
rams.
I don't know if he's being a special 

643
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,300
teams coach or some shit like that.
But he is not touching the field.

644
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,070
Catching footballs to tell you that 
right now.

645
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,840
No.
He's got some sort of executive job.

646
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,580
Correct.
Is that what I've been hearing?

647
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:40,590
So this the rams helmet,
that's all he had?

648
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,760
Yes.
Okay.

649
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,490
What does this say anything there?
Was it say just La Rams?

650
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,100
Rumba Square Hashtag Rams.
Huh?

651
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,790
Well [inaudible] up as if he's the 
mascot and he's the new la Ram.

652
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,970
That shit would be dope.
I think sometimes the job for that.

653
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,800
I'm not playing.
No,

654
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,663
you knuckleheads.
I'm not playing for the ramp that you 

655
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,030
crazy.
That's hilarious.

656
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,230
I love it man.
Good for him.

657
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,220
Cause it's,
you know,

658
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,960
this come from a guy who retired early 
or maybe one too late,

659
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:09,450
but for him to be able to do that,
the balls it takes,

660
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:12,060
especially you're talking about,
he's tip of the spear.

661
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,620
Number two could be anyone not named 
Dco.

662
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,493
John Jones.
He can beat everybody else and he did 

663
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,750
for him.
Like I'm good man,

664
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,390
I'm out.
It takes a lot of courage and balls man.

665
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:24,510
So I congratulate him on and I love that
he just goes out and says it.

666
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,340
I don't want to hit get hit in the head 
anymore.

667
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,810
I don't want to wrestle with dues 
anymore.

668
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,863
Just came out though.
And I think people are shocked by that 

669
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,621
when they hear,
you know,

670
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,630
nfl guy where they don't sit one when 
their plane,

671
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:34,860
but then you find out later,
he's like,

672
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,050
dude,
I fucking hated playing.

673
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,903
It was the only thing I was good at and 
I was making tons of money with Anthony 

674
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,470
Johnson.
He's always stayed like,

675
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,160
yeah,
I don't really like to train man.

676
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,240
I like to get out and shit.
I like,

677
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,320
you know,
it's not my thing.

678
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,720
Yeah.
I just happened to have this fucking God

679
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,760
given power.
I'm really good at it.

680
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm finding that light heavyweight now 
get fame and money.

681
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,600
Oh,
another opportunity.

682
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,290
Fucking see.
Ya know,

683
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,870
there's nothing wrong with that.
Man Does.

684
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:56,704
Definitely nothing wrong.
People are surprised when they hear 

685
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:58,750
professional athletes going.
Yeah,

686
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,670
I don't really enjoy it man.
I'm just really good at it.

687
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,050
You know what I man,
I'll never forget.

688
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,780
Well I appreciate his honesty because I 
think that's it's,

689
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,960
it's when,
when a guy talks about it that way,

690
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,280
it's important.
Like for everybody.

691
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,114
Like I remember when Matt Hughes got 
beaten by Bj Penn and Bj took the title 

692
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,164
from him and uh,
I asked him about it in the interview 

693
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:17,471
and he said,
honestly,

694
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,780
I have to tell you to relieve the 
pressure.

695
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,430
Being a champion is a,
you know,

696
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,860
everybody coming after you.
It's honestly a relief.

697
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,713
Yeah.
Like balls at that guy has to say that 

698
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,030
in front of all these people that it's a
real,

699
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,420
it means being completely honest.
It's cool man.

700
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,530
Cause,
especially as an athlete,

701
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,610
especially for Anthony Johnson guy who 
he identifies as being justified or he's

702
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,500
rumble for him to go,
I'm good man.

703
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,970
Number two in the world.
See Ya.

704
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,920
God Dang it.
It's inspiring.

705
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,260
It should be inspiring to people.
It is.

706
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,840
I think it's inspiring and it's also 
inspiring.

707
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:48,580
If he decides to take a year off and 
then he goes,

708
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:51,250
fuck this desk job,
I want to kick somebody in the face.

709
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,180
I just needed a break.
Fucking great.

710
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,860
I'm just waiting for someone else to get
the belt because I can't beat DC.

711
00:30:57,861 --> 00:30:59,200
You fools.
I mean,

712
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,430
isn't that an issue,
right?

713
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,250
The kind of out of money,
I need some money.

714
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,433
Fight.
Well,

715
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,580
he was smart with his money.
We're on the street.

716
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,460
That's good.
Wasn't angel was smart with the money.

717
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,530
That's good.
But even that guy,

718
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,270
like people don't,
you know Anthony Johnson,

719
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,120
number two in the world has god given 
power in his hands.

720
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,403
You got to realize as as a UFC fighter,
a tip of the spear and that it's just 

721
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,300
where the sports that he's not set.
It's not like,

722
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,193
oh,
I'm see a fucking yachts in Miami and I 

723
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,224
can do whatever I want and he's not set.
He never had a seven figure payday that 

724
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,430
we know.
If you don't think doesn't work for her,

725
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,470
one of those title fights,
what do you think you got paid?

726
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,770
Which topic you're talking about with 
the first one with DC and the second one

727
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,070
with DC?
Uh,

728
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:37,960
maybe.

729
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,190
I don't know what he got paid.
I'm not even speculating on the,

730
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,790
on the book.
He didn't get seven figures.

731
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,983
So how many legends in boxing retired 
and then later came back because I 

732
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,530
needed money.
Oh Jesus.

733
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:51,364
Bro.
Crazy.

734
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,920
We're making millions.
Yeah,

735
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:57,520
back in the 80s for sure.
But I think more than that,

736
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:59,110
like sugar ray come back,
came back.

737
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:00,450
He was still rich.
Yes.

738
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,950
Yes.
We'll come back for the money.

739
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,800
Our Hopkins is set.
Some Jones might have some issues,

740
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,560
but he's with HBO.
But our husbands with HBO,

741
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:09,394
they do it for the love of the gay.
Most of those guys are set like just 

742
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,401
fucking sick.
You know,

743
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:15,910
Bernard still drives an 89 civic cause 
he doesn't want to go broke.

744
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,740
Um,
Bernard has a Bentley.

745
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,873
Does he have a bed liner?
There's a whole story about him driving 

746
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:24,540
a Bentley and some kid drove the Bentley
Forum and the kid dental wheels got damn

747
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,810

00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,810
You,

753
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,400
Where'd you get your story about this 
last one?

754
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,210
It was a story about him,
um,

755
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,063
that he was doing like a,
it was helping out this kid that was 

756
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:52,640
terminally ill and uh,
how did his roles get brought up?

757
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,080
What was the,
the car,

758
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:56,570
the kid,
he let the kid drive the car and the kid

759
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:59,060
like a curved one of the wheels,
like fake news.

760
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,480
CNN Dude.
Either from the library.

761
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,110
I let Callan's friend drive my Bentley 
and he fucked it up.

762
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,040
I didn't know he,
he,

763
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,023
he doesn't drive.
He just drives a a bike in New York and 

764
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,150
he goes,
oh,

765
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,070
we're doing this,
we're doing this bit,

766
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,420
and we're filming it.

767
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,190
And this cop goes,
hey man,

768
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,510
I'm going to tow this car if you don't 
leave.

769
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:17,961
And I go,
oh,

770
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,790
fuck when the middle of it.
And he goes,

771
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,560
dude,
I'll fucking whomever right down,

772
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,670
move on the spot.
And I go,

773
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,580
I don't let anyone drive my drive.
Very rarely even valley.

774
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:26,710
And I go,
all right.

775
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,260
I trust the guy who got damn near 60 I 
toss them the keys.

776
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,660
He comes back to all good.
It's all good,

777
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:33,770
brother.
Cool.

778
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,320
I walked out there to the right,
parked down the street,

779
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:38,270
and this guy comes out from the house.
He goes,

780
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,463
dude,
I don't know who the fuck was driving 

781
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,730
that car,
but he hit the shit out of the curb.

782
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,220
You know,
Bentley wheels are tough to come by.

783
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,410
I look at it and I'm just like,
oh,

784
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,200
mother fucker.
I got it fixed.

785
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:52,280
But it was a nightmare.

786
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,650
Did you bring it up to him?
No.

787
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,880
Wow.
Interesting.

788
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,680
Just swallowed it to bring it down on a 
podcast.

789
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,611
Well,
no,

790
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,060
I'm not going to call his name.
You know,

791
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,720
it's been taken care of.
I just,

792
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,070
if I was younger on a flipped out,
but I was like,

793
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,530
I sat my,
currently it's just a car.

794
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,270
It's all right.
He didn't mean to man.

795
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,390
Life is good for you.
Did you say you have a Bentley?

796
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,613
Yeah,
exactly.

797
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,370
Nice Bentley continental gt supersport 
supersport dope.

798
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,340
Tastic oh man.
It's a dope cards.

799
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,193
Kerosene.
It podcasts life before you had a 

800
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:29,290
weight,
like a beam.

801
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,470
No,
not a porsche.

802
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,550
Porsche.
That's right.

803
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,010
Yeah.
He had a red nine 11 no,

804
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,973
and got to trip him m six that yeah,
those [inaudible] are smooth fuck 

805
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,143
around.
Good size cause it's [inaudible] Park 

806
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,800
cruiser but still sporty granturismo 
style.

807
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,680
Like it's comfortable.
It's comfortable.

808
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,513
The bentleys cool out dead.
The best car I've ever had and I'll 

809
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:54,350
always be loyal to them in his porsche.
It was the best car you've ever had.

810
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,700
That little car.
I love Porsche's,

811
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,110
man.
I just let the quality,

812
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:58,580
the customer service,
it's just,

813
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,414
it's different.
Bentley I had to take to get my fucking 

814
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:02,960
rims fixed.
I took them in.

815
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,190
I mean they could give two fucks.
You know what the game is?

816
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,550
A rental mom,
Volvo.

817
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,160
And I was like,
what the fuck is this understated.

818
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,053
Yeah.
And they're like character for a few 

819
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,530
days,
protection for a month.

820
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,513
A friend of mine,
a student of mine that had a lot of 

821
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,034
money on a bet lean because you want to 
borrow it for a month and tell a little 

822
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,240
story like why he couldn't drive.
It's kind of hilarious.

823
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,400
Why couldn't dry dry?
He couldn't drive it.

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,320
Do you remember?
No,

825
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:28,220
he went away.
Yeah.

826
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:30,740
But do you remember why?
Why he didn't want to drive it anymore?

827
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,783
Because he owned a weed shop and the 
cops did not like when people were 

828
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:38,010
flaunting the trash and lot of money and

829
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,880
weed shops.
No,

830
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:39,960
I forgot.
You're right,

831
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,750
you're right.
So he got a dodge charger cause the cops

832
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:45,030
like it when you would drive the car 
that they drive.

833
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,770
Like he had a whole psychological 
approach.

834
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,220
This,
yeah.

835
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,350
He's like,
I'm going to get a dodge charger and put

836
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:53,730
some cool wheels on it because these two
were case fucking smart guy.

837
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:57,120
Man.
He was right because he's like,

838
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:57,954
you know,
these guys don't want you drive in 

839
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,054
something they can never afford,
but if you're driving what they're 

840
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,380
driving,
guys like cars,

841
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:04,971
so like,
oh,

842
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:06,600
he's was good charge though,
Dude.

843
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,980
I'm telling you.
You're not a cop.

844
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,920
If you were a cop and you had a,
this is it.

845
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,920
It makes sense.
No,

846
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,450
it doesn't.
Cops are so cool to me.

847
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:17,250
I get pulled over all the time.
You're big brown.

848
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,070
They're fighting the kid fans.
No,

849
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:20,904
for real man.

850
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,760
I think he was right.
I think when he said it to me,

851
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:24,990
I was like,
that totally makes sense.

852
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:25,680
He goes,
yeah.

853
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,431
He goes,
they'd like,

854
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,130
he was a friend of mine's a cop.
It's like they tell you they like it the

855
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:29,964
best.
Your best chances of them like treating 

856
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,730
you like one of them drive what they 
drive.

857
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Drive a fucking charger,
charger fucking baby.

858
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,810
He says,
boy,

859
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I would drive a charger.
Srt trying to drive a hellcat ridiculous

860
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,270
car.
I'd drive that demon challenge.

861
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,260
You know,
that's like $135,000 at walnuts.

862
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,863
How loan itself.
It makes my dick hard as dodge has come 

863
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,374
out with the most preposterous car in 
all of mantle hurts my heart and 850 

864
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:09,030
horsepower,
it goes zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds.

865
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,850
It's called the dodge demon.
They took a dodge challenger,

866
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,910
put this ridiculous hood scoop on it,
but fender flares on it,

867
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:15,744
widen all the wheels and dumped the most
insane engine than anybody's ever put 

868
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,170
into production because it's so God damn
American.

869
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,230
It's not even funny.
It's,

870
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:24,064
it's a eagle suck on that.
It's an eagle getting his dick sucked 

871
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:27,774
while he's holding a flag gone.
And the other one with the Statue of 

872
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,003
Liberty.
So Lydia,

873
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm like just fucking go look at that.
808 horsepower.

874
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,560
17 pound feet of torque.
That is fucking insane.

875
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,140
There's only a thousand on he shit.
Fucking get one.

876
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,070
Yeah,
you can't get one.

877
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,650
Everyone's going to be clean asylums.
But why?

878
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,290
Look at the giant fucking hold on back 
that up again.

879
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:55,980
Where the size tires in the rear.
Back it up just a little bit there.

880
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,100
A little bit further.
There it goes.

881
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,120
Okay,
so they got forties in the rear.

882
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,553
That's pretty,
what production does that mean at least 

883
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,160
a hundred is that what they're saying?
Production car.

884
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,460
They keep calling it a production of 
fastest production car.

885
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,450
It means,
it's not like,

886
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,760
you know,
super like there's not like 10 of them.

887
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,010
Why did they put little tiny wheels in 
the front?

888
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:14,844
That's not the original.
That's not the wheels that are coming 

889
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,310
with the car.
Right.

890
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,830
That's what it has to wheels.
Trying to make them do wheelies.

891
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,353
I think they put those little tiny 
wheels in the front because they're 

892
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:23,664
trying to make the car do wheelies,
but I'm assuming because it does pull a 

893
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:28,570
wheelie.
It's the first production ever.

894
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,650
Yes.
I don't need a Wheelie,

895
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:34,770
but I think one of the ways they get it 
to do a wheelies,

896
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,900
they put little skinny tires on it.
It comes,

897
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,920
it comes with one seat.
It only comes with one seat saying car.

898
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,690
This is a car that says,
fuck.

899
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,790
You just said you get the second seat 
for a dollar.

900
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,690
Oh,
that's it.

901
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,180
But if it comes with one that's kind of 
dope.

902
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,080
I want my friends to jump in.
It's just the biggest fuck you car.

903
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,580
You drive how we got one seat Bro.

904
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,483
That way,
that way you have a good excuse not to 

905
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:00,184
bring the wife.
Oh it says it costs less than a hundred 

906
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,610
thousand dollars.
That's what they say.

907
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,410
So hey,
it's only be $88,000.

908
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,440
Put the dealers do the markup to the 
demand so you're fucked.

909
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,390
Oh the markups probably going to be 
100%.

910
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,383
You'll get one right now if I could.
And just fucking cruise the streets 

911
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,370
shitting on people.
You know,

912
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,450
it's hilarious.
They had this,

913
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,284
uh,
they're talking about the Ford Mustang 

914
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,810
gt three 50,
the shelby gt Cobra Dope car.

915
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,093
And they're talking about it keeping it 
around two to 2018 and I looked at the 

916
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:30,700
numbers like the zero to 60 numbers and 
they're really great.

917
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,310
It's like 4.1 with the stick,
3.9 with the automatic and um,

918
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,700
you know,
they have a 10 speed automatic.

919
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:37,660
I'm like,
what a bad ass car.

920
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,650
But then you compare it to that.
You like this,

921
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,593
all that thing.

922
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,540
What do you drive?
Who makes shitty,

923
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,460
shitty cars out there.
Really make shitty cars anymore.

924
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,750
Can't get away with it.
It's too many.

925
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,584
Look,
they're making new cars constantly like 

926
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,410
that's one of the craziest things about 
cars.

927
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:54,244
They need consistent innovation.
Every year there's zero to 60 time gets 

928
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,020
better.
Their gs g force get better.

929
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:03,060
The Mile Mile per gallon get better and 
better in your mouth.

930
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,230
Again,
Mary Ross 30 it's been 30 since I was 12

931
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,373
but a porch twin turbo gets 30 when the 
fast cars on the planet and all wheel 

932
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:15,010
drive at all.
Cars are not really,

933
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,873
not really it.
You don't try it like funny drove 

934
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,280
supercar gets 24 miles.
It's crazy.

935
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,413
Put a bull up.
Nine nine one nine 11 turbo miles per 

936
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:27,334
gallon.
It should be 200 miles to the gallon by 

937
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,084
now.
It's like I smell conspiracy theory 

938
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:34,354
coming up this up.
It's like if you see him getting ready 

939
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,930
to go to for the twister role,
he might give you a little towel.

940
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,590
See the seminar.
I'm crazy.

941
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm crazy.
He always went with it.

942
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:49,314
With the Indians.

943
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,000
Was there ever an md and the Indians 
would have let him the slaves,

944
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,893
the Indians would have led to this lake.
That's a key and peele movie right 

945
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:00,964
there.
Black Indians and there's a bunch of 

946
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:08,221
butter is a book about it.
He goes to been some you fucked up.

947
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,930
They fucked up letting big dixon the TPU
knowing that it'll be different.

948
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,650
It'll be different now folks,
you girls are like,

949
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,320
all right,
well but I want to how many,

950
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,170
I wonder how common that was and I 
wonder who,

951
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,980
what,
what,

952
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,813
um,
whether it was white people or whether 

953
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:29,291
it was,
you know,

954
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:33,530
White Europeans or slaves who bred with 
racist town.

955
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:34,520
You,
they escaped

956
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,570
to the Indians so they can make go 27 
highway,

957
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:41,080
20 city.
You have a super car.

958
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,841
It's amazing.
No,

959
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:42,950
don't get me wrong.
Look,

960
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:43,784
that car might be the best car in the 
world and you just think about the best 

961
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:49,730
all around car hands down nine 11 turbo.
You drive that thing.

962
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,800
It drives like a,
like a regular car.

963
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,200
It feels great.
Like it smoothed over bumps and shit.

964
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,210
It's the,
the dampening system that they have.

965
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:57,044
It's all electronically controlled.
It seems to be able to predict what the 

966
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,870
ground is like and adjust to like 
different bumps in the road.

967
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,610
Like really well the best.
Hey,

968
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:08,600
that was 2015 I'm talking about to then 
18th they even better.

969
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,553
That was to them.
15 10th and then he got probably a few 

970
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,470
miles per gallon.
Right?

971
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,303
Yeah man.
But those cars are zero to 60 in 2.5 

972
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,910
seconds.
It's best code on the road.

973
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,150
Four wheel drive for pound money from,
yeah,

974
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,410
it's the best.
They just look man.

975
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,273
There's something about Japanese 
engineering and German engineering that 

976
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:28,550
is hard to fuck with.
I don't fuck with the Japanese.

977
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:29,930
They never branched tag,
no racist.

978
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,900
They never break.
I buy Japanese cars all the time.

979
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,250
That's like my always,
that's us.

980
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,950
Yeah.
Like I love Lexus because it's like,

981
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,530
you know when you get in that fucking 
thing,

982
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:42,470
every time you press that button it 
starts out on the stone every time.

983
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,323
Yeah.
Every time you bought a fancy Toyota 

984
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,110
Tundra,
watch your mouth Toyota and drag.

985
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:48,944
Nothing wrong with Toyota.
I'm just saying it's compared to German 

986
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:53,090
though and I just chill him.
That hundred bay.

987
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,933
But here's the thing Jeremy,
the interior on German cars bed the 

988
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:57,500
best.
Yeah.

989
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,363
Well their engineering is so sporty too.
Like the Japanese don't really make a 

990
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:05,870
car like a nine 11 gt three they don't 
really make that.

991
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,973
They make these track cars that work 
really fascinating track like like the 

992
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,070
Nissan Gtr,
but that's like super electronic.

993
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:15,620
When you get in that thing,
it's like a spaceship dude.

994
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:18,500
That thing is incredible.
Like levels you out.

995
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:19,334
Like when you go in and take turns,
you actually feel it flattened the body 

996
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:22,940
out.
With electronics,

997
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,610
it turns like this.
Like you're you,

998
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:28,610
you can make a hard turn and there's no 
body lean.

999
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:29,660
It's weird.
What else?

1000
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,510
And then the Acura Nsx dead,
the new ones,

1001
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:33,344
insane.
The new NSX is insane to hybrid engines 

1002
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:37,634
and the front wheels,
first rye weapons grade nine 11 what 

1003
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,910
does it say there with the Myob ground?
2029 wow.

1004
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:47,260
Yeah.
29 Porsche nine 11 it's my fave.

1005
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:48,094
It's a beast car.
Those are super reliable too for the 

1006
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:54,560
most so reliable.
But it's just the engineering has to get

1007
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,730
better and better every year.

1008
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,190
So they're sharpening this razor's edge.
They're developing these cars that like,

1009
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,840
like there's,
there's skid pad numbers that used to be

1010
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,960
ridiculous like one g and a skid pad.
Like God,

1011
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:08,600
it would have to be like a Ferrari f 40 
or something like that.

1012
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:09,434
You know,
now you get that shit out of a BMW m 

1013
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:11,984
three like everything does a g on the 
skid pad and those corvettes like grand 

1014
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,490
sport corvettes,
they do ridiculous.

1015
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,000
He received the Viper ACR.
Fuck,

1016
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:25,001
you can just buy a fucking 660 
horsepower race car from viper.

1017
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,530
I'd be lying if I didn't say I was 
online last night.

1018
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,160
How about I've done it three nights a 
week

1019
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
for a month.
Three nights a week for a tough nut to 

1020
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,144
pull the trigger.
I've watched every fucking viper video 

1021
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,024
they have.
It's the most retarded American car 

1022
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:41,994
ever.
It literally but fucks the demon cause 

1023
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:45,474
it's so ridiculous.
The demons still looks like a 

1024
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,120
challenger.
I agree.

1025
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,983
This things is Saint Paul,
but viper acr 2017 please people that 

1026
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:53,730
should just be like,
you know what?

1027
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,140
Fuck you man.
How about that,

1028
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,940
but fun or you do.
What are you doing?

1029
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,590
What are you doing?
Fast and furious.

1030
00:44:58,591 --> 00:44:59,424
Look at a wing on that fucking thing.
That is an insane car and it's breaking 

1031
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:07,470
records at every single race track all 
over the world.

1032
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:11,250
Heard it too.
It sounds amazing.

1033
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,560
See that?
That one right there is a regular viper,

1034
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:18,561
which is still pretty dope.
That's just look for the viper srt ACR.

1035
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,913
The SRT ACR is the crazy one.
That's the one that they just built for 

1036
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:24,150
racing.

1037
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,660
There's a margaret.
Oh,

1038
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,630
fucking for sure.
Actually.

1039
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:29,130
I heard they're having a hard time 
selling them.

1040
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,510
Well,
make sense?

1041
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,870
Yeah,
because people are like enough terms.

1042
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,713
We trump's president and this will you 
remember when the vipers first came out 

1043
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,700
as 500 horsepower,
500 pounds of Torque and there's so many

1044
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:40,830
crashes because guys just didn't know 
how to deal with it.

1045
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,160
They'd go around the corners and just 
fucking also,

1046
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,800
they didn't have antilock brakes.
The old vipers had nothing.

1047
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,753
I rented an old viper once.
Beat the fuck out of borrowing to buy 

1048
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:51,444
one just to fuck around La didn't the 
Viper Jack for a while it was a 

1049
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,440
shambles.
They were considered like vanilla ice of

1050
00:45:58,441 --> 00:45:59,200
cars.
Right?

1051
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,820
Yeah.
See there he is with the extreme arrow.

1052
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:04,360
Pat.
Such a good looking car.

1053
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,203
Extreme aero package.
They literally have a giant race car 

1054
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,340
wing in the back of it.

1055
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,150
But it's so ferocious that though I feel
like until you are so excited.

1056
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,410
I know this is a car that girls would 
get mad at you if you buy like your wife

1057
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,720
like printing.
What the fuck?

1058
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,990
That's like buying like getting bigger,
bigger tits.

1059
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,953
Yeah.
You be like when you're trying it cause 

1060
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,480
I'm awesome.
Look at that stop right there in red.

1061
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,730
I usually don't like a red car back that
bitch up.

1062
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,030
I loved the way that thing looks red.
That's a,

1063
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,000
that's a bad ass fucking thing is so 
hard.

1064
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,863
That is about as American as it gets.
I mean it's so much more bad ass look 

1065
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,030
and then a corvette.
Oh way more.

1066
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,280
And of course that's pretty bad ass.
Look at corporates.

1067
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,740
Don't do it for me.
Oh fuck with him.

1068
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,940
You know?
At the end of the day,

1069
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:50,700
man,
it's like we're still little boys.

1070
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,803
Fuck yeah.

1071
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,790
You said you look at him three times a 
week.

1072
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,060
Literally last night I was like,
God,

1073
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:57,540
should I just buy one?
It doesn't make any sense.

1074
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,980
It makes no sense.
Look at that thing.

1075
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,650
It's a beast.
It's such a beast.

1076
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:04,140
It must be so fun.
See Fun.

1077
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,520
Yeah.
At the end of the day,

1078
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:07,920
it's fun.
It's just a different kind of experience

1079
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:08,754
and gets about three month negative 
three miles a gallon with a really big 

1080
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,320
too.
Here's the other one.

1081
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,090
They have that they're wide and they 
have this really long hood.

1082
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,490
It's not giant engine.
Yeah.

1083
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:19,170
It's not like you're,
when you drive in a Porsche,

1084
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,090
one of the weird things about is it's 
rear engine,

1085
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:21,924
so your front end,
you get a really good clear view of the 

1086
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:24,594
road.
Like you remember that Nsx and add 

1087
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,570
Eddie.
That's so renaissance yet,

1088
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,590
dude,
I'd love that.

1089
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:29,424
Thanks to day.
I reminisce about that car shit hung on 

1090
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,160
again.
Boom.

1091
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,080
Started every time.
Not a fucking problem ever.

1092
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,063
Boom.
You have problems like I haven't had a 

1093
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,060
lot of problems.
I had a porsche that shit out on me.

1094
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,090
Nine 11 turbo.
Um,

1095
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,150
2002 it did a lot of problems.
Turbos 99 long time for a long time.

1096
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,373
Super.
Two and 93 or what the kid oh and a 

1097
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,250
Toyota super turbo in 1994.
Yeah.

1098
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,900
You fucking with me.
I'm not to fuck with you Tara Grip.

1099
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,753
So I just fucking walked in the door.
You got an m six and I spent every 

1100
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:20,590
goddamn dime I had to get punched in the
face on that thing and it was used.

1101
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:24,010
Very different approach.
Oh I'm Oh us Hoodrich for awhile there.

1102
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,893
That's what I had.
That's one of the greatest coaches of 

1103
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:29,320
all time out of silver one.
They're worth a lot of money now too.

1104
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,740
It's crazy.
Well they there,

1105
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,250
there's something special mat and do 
those.

1106
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,650
Hey heto hillis jump on it.
I know,

1107
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,300
right?
Come up with a new one.

1108
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,510
I think they are as a matter of fact,
but it's just,

1109
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,613
you know,
there's something to stout that Porsche 

1110
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,723
has figured out how to capture where 
they have a look that it looks like a 

1111
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:49,000
nine 11 every he is guys do it.

1112
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,833
They have to start from scratch like a 
new fucking car because remember back 

1113
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,840
then it was the Toyota supra,
the rx seven.

1114
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,733
Those were like the ones like seven and 
then there was the Mitsubishi gt 3000 I 

1115
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,050
like that one.
Look at that shit.

1116
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,670
Go back to that black one.
That's the same car.

1117
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:05,320
This is the new one.
Holy Shit.

1118
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:06,154
Back what?
I said.

1119
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,900
This one's doper.
If they come,

1120
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,200
they actually come out with this was 
this say it says ft one digital.

1121
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,393
Get that down.
I'm not 20 is that a real image or is 

1122
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:17,170
that a computer created in image 
computer shit,

1123
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,910
isn't it?
It's hard to tell.

1124
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,130
They're so good at it now.
I know.

1125
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,650
You know I mean damn.
Oh it looks like it's real.

1126
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:28,180
That concept.
But as that a concept is that,

1127
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,530
oh,
it's all bullshit.

1128
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,580
You can change the colors of it.

1129
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:35,590
Never got the collars are gross.
Just give people like shit.

1130
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,373
How about the fan?
The paint and the color makes no 

1131
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,660
difference.
Well it tells it some cars,

1132
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,520
some cars just look goofy.
Certain colors.

1133
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:51,370
Like if you ever see a yellow Ferrari 
and you're like relax buddy,

1134
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,550
just screaming.
I have a small deck.

1135
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,610
It's just I dude,
I get it.

1136
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,310
You're single.
You do spray tans,

1137
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,623
a black Ferrari.
You might have like a crib in downtown 

1138
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,903
La.
We have incense burning before you even 

1139
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,420
walk in taking people.
Dan.

1140
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,880
Yeah,
you Dick and people down and like one of

1141
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:07,714
those warehouse apartments and you know 
those types of the case Laura curtains 

1142
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:13,354
and you have a little wine fridge dress.
Well probably a good dude like one of 

1143
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:18,544
them movies where like that dude is like
a secret scientist and he lives in a 

1144
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:22,564
loft and he's got like his couch in the 
middle of the loft with like a carpet 

1145
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:25,510
there.

1146
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,830
But everything else is that Polish to 
doesn't have a TV,

1147
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:30,050
doesn't have time to watch TV.
TV's for pussies,

1148
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,570
only wine mount here reading books and 
doing Kung Fu.

1149
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,480
Fucking fucking everything that comes in
that door.

1150
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,530
But you get a yellow green.
No Sir,

1151
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,140
you're up in the Hollywood hills.
You probably got herpes.

1152
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:45,920
Just,
yeah man.

1153
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,720
You can't have no,
they won't even let you in downtown with

1154
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,920
Bro.
You gotta be more new.

1155
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:55,370
Are you going to be darker and more 
mysterious?

1156
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,830
Windows?
It's weird.

1157
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,070
There's certain things about certain 
color cars,

1158
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,233
but then there's like classics.
Like if a guy has like a 1971 red 

1159
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:06,770
porsche,
no,

1160
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,560
it's beautiful car.
It's a classic color.

1161
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,060
If it's in red,
it's a classic color.

1162
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,320
But like a brand new red car,
like it's gotta be like that Viper.

1163
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,900
It has to be some touch has to be 
certain cars and then you know,

1164
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:20,390
even a Porsche,
cause when I bought my porsche is red.

1165
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,350
He goes,
you know,

1166
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,030
they,
they don't make a lot of these,

1167
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:24,380
cause a lot of people that don't want 
red,

1168
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,110
they don't want the attention.
Your insurance is higher.

1169
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,670
The cops look for you like it's classic.
They're like,

1170
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,710
people are going away from it.
It is weird.

1171
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,350
Red is like,
go fuck you.

1172
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,243
Look what about those magnum Pi Red 
Ferraris or they classics now or people 

1173
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:38,804
bringing them g two three 50 40 gt 40 
Gina said it is a three 50 bringing 

1174
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,630
those back.
The classics now,

1175
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,730
right.
It should be worth a lot of money.

1176
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,130
I want to,
I wanted to buy lower deloreans are they

1177
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,750
or they come back,
they must be deloreans are back steel.

1178
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,190
Yo girl,
I'm tired.

1179
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:56,703
No socks.
Sling and Dick would an old school cop 

1180
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:02,480
called stash.
Ooh God damn has those boat shoes on.

1181
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,314
Just that fat dick in the front from 
magnum Pi doesn't even care if his feet 

1182
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:06,970
stink.

1183
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:11,390
The sling sling dick with stinky shoes.
He was,

1184
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,510
I would drive that conservative.
He's super conservative.

1185
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,373
He's the guy that got on Rosie O'donnell
show and she famously sort of attacked 

1186
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:26,210
him for supporting the MRA and 
connecting him to shootings.

1187
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,493
He's,
which one of the greatest Americans 

1188
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,370
can't understand what she was trying to 
do.

1189
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:34,160
And I understand her sentiment.
I met Rosie O'donnell and I did her show

1190
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:34,994
and I think she's a nice person.
She's just think that like things like 

1191
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:39,470
that are ill advised,
you know,

1192
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:40,304
and that people got real mad at her man.
All those fucking NRA people due to 

1193
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,990
view,
if you talk anti second amendment,

1194
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,070
they come with the force.
They fucking come after you.

1195
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,840
Good.
Yeah.

1196
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,733
Well if they didn't,
they would have lost the right a long 

1197
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,704
time ago.
There's a lot of people that would like 

1198
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,320
take those rights away.

1199
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:57,163
My boy Tom Selleck went on there.
We can only hit diamond piece talking 

1200
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,683
about guns.
Tom Selleck didn't go on it and talk 

1201
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:01,730
about guns.
Agree.

1202
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,190
Went on there to talk about something 
else.

1203
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:06,140
Just promoting something and she wanted 
to bring up the NRA and you know,

1204
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:06,974
he was upset about it.
But I think if you're talking about a 

1205
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:12,100
gun violence,
like there's a lot,

1206
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,003
there's a lot of factors and it comes to
gun violence and you can get really 

1207
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,510
crazy.
But one of them is that it's all men.

1208
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,523
How about that?
How about we just ban all men because 

1209
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,210
all men are responsible for mass 
shootings.

1210
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:25,250
It's fucking all men.
It's never chicks.

1211
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,010
So what

1212
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,260
do we do?
We ban all men because without the men,

1213
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,020
the guns don't even work.
So okay,

1214
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,210
we're not banning all men.
So should we ban all guns?

1215
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,740
Yeah,
we should definitely been all guns.

1216
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,191
Okay,
well,

1217
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:36,024
if we're going to ban all guns,
how come only a certain percentage of 

1218
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:38,694
the guns get used in these crimes?
What about all those other people that 

1219
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:45,531
are lawful law abiding Americans who are
kind and peaceful and keep John guns for

1220
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:47,004
personal security or for hunting?
Do we take them away from them and who 

1221
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,450
gets to decide?
That's where the problem lay.

1222
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,040
The problem doesn't lay in the idea that
she's stepping in because she's got this

1223
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,630
thing in front of her and she sees it's 
a problem.

1224
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,464
She wants to talk about the problem.
The problem is that the problem is 

1225
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:02,430
multifaceted and it's not just all men.

1226
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,503
The number of these men that are 
medicated on pharmaceutical drugs is 

1227
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:07,674
fucking staggering.
And then they say correlation does not 

1228
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:11,394
equal causation.
So you can't assume that just because 

1229
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:16,380
someone's on pills that that makes 
people shoot people.

1230
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,210
But damn,
it's close.

1231
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,280
It's,
there's something in there.

1232
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,143
There's something going on there.
[inaudible] psychoactive drugs are 

1233
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:26,700
responsible for some changes in your 
behavior.

1234
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:28,200
That's a fact.
It's undeniable.

1235
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,123
How much is debatable and how much of 
these disassociative sorta drugs allow 

1236
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:36,000
people to just like blank out and go and
do wacky shit.

1237
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,280
Different people with different brain 
chemistry.

1238
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,310
Who the fuck knows?
Did you,

1239
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,360
did you see the facebook killer?
He actually committed suicide today,

1240
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,650
but here he was going around killing 
people and doing it live on facebook and

1241
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,960
they were saying people were upset at 
facebook going,

1242
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,940
what the fuck man,
you allow him to do this?

1243
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,661
And they're like,
yeah,

1244
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:55,380
we're going to change some of the rules.
The cops said that he didn't do that.

1245
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,990
They wasn't streaming.
He uploaded upload it later.

1246
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:58,890
So they're like,
well,

1247
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,970
you know,
we'll watch that more.

1248
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:00,804
But then I saw a cop was like,
it actually helps us like in if you 

1249
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:04,644
didn't commit suicide,
like there's times where there's been 

1250
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:10,200
other crimes that people do when they 
hear it live or upload it to facebook or

1251
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,600
they rob a bank.
Then posts like could rich with cash and

1252
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,420
they actually helps the cops track him 
down.

1253
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:16,254
So like,
I don't know if you should go away with 

1254
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:19,650
it because,
well there's not kill regardless.

1255
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,880
Now they're just,
you know,

1256
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:22,770
they can upload it on youtube or 
wherever.

1257
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,210
They might take it down,
but they're like,

1258
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,613
we shouldn't stop it.
Cause that you're helping on a little 

1259
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:27,390
bit.

1260
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,223
Yeah.
It's a good excuse to go in there and 

1261
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,080
control the Internet.
I mean,

1262
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:31,914
who knows?
It sounds like that could easily be a 

1263
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:34,470
false flag.
Is there any,

1264
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:34,921
uh,
well,

1265
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:35,754
it's not a false flag.
There's definitely a dead guy and he's 

1266
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:39,060
definitely a guy who killed himself.
So same thing.

1267
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,940
I think more often then they're being 
false flags is a,

1268
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:43,783
is an event happens and people try to 
take advantage of that event and they 

1269
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:47,844
try to make it easier on themselves,
especially law enforcement might try to 

1270
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,260
make it easy on themselves and enforce 
laws,

1271
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:56,130
especially politicians might take it as 
an opportunity to push their agenda,

1272
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,233
their constituents want.
There's a lot of factors when it comes 

1273
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:01,650
into dealing with any kind of gun 
violence,

1274
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,550
but it's a multifaceted issue and you 
don't take it up with Tom Selleck.

1275
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,190
Okay.
Magnum fucking Pii is not the reason why

1276
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,990
their school shooters,
Tak Mak,

1277
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,824
just because,
because he has a lawful gun permit and 

1278
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:14,034
because he joined the NRA cause he 
believes in the right to keep and bear 

1279
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:18,504
arms.
The real problem is people that are 

1280
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:23,500
willing to kill a bunch of other people.
It's not the guns.

1281
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,100
It's not

1282
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,933
that they're men.
It's not neither one of those two 

1283
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,860
incredibly common factors.
Guns and men.

1284
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,440
I always think it's weird too,
whenever there's a shooter,

1285
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:35,140
like with this whole facebook fucking 
killer in Ohio,

1286
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:35,974
ruins like,
oh,

1287
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,550
mental illness.
Yeah.

1288
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,010
God,
I don't know if you can just chalk it up

1289
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:42,700
to mental illness all the time.
Some donuts it's medicated too,

1290
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,870
but sometimes,
but then sometimes he just a fuck the,

1291
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:46,704
there's a lot of bad apples to me.
Just a bad dude like when he was on 

1292
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,150
there and why are watching all someone 
down a weird rabbit hole on Easter.

1293
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,340
But when he was,
he was on there just talking,

1294
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,020
you know,
coherently being like,

1295
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,250
you know,
I've worked at this job forever.

1296
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,770
People Shit on me.
My girl just broke up with me.

1297
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,604
I'm fucking sick of this man.
I'm going to go around killing people 

1298
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:03,550
because I'm pissed off at the world.

1299
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,260
Fuck this.
Yeah.

1300
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:08,820
Well the problem is someone who has that
attitude lacks empathy and the,

1301
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,780
it's not normal.
So the question is like,

1302
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:14,260
how does someone get to that stage where
they're completely void of empathy?

1303
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,030
That's what scares the fuck out of 
people.

1304
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,133
What doesn't scare the fuck out of 
people is that people were willing to 

1305
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,840
kill to defend their loved ones or any 
of that shit.

1306
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,260
What bothers people is people that don't
have any empathy.

1307
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,123
People that want to go fuck the world or
fuck you and fuck everything and then 

1308
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,124
just hurt people and laugh.
What would he be that way if he didn't 

1309
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:32,050
get whatever's coworkers were picking on
him?

1310
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:32,710
Who knows?
Like,

1311
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,543
is it a mental illness because he's 
getting picked on or with is it this is 

1312
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,680
this,
is this backlash to that bullying or his

1313
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,180
girl breaking up with them because it is
small.

1314
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,080
Daikin,
he was fat.

1315
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,750
There's lot of factors there that could 
be a part of it.

1316
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,720
I'm saying overall proximal and just be 
a bad apple man and just,

1317
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,280
it was like fuck this,
the world,

1318
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,380
this world sucks man.
It's possible.

1319
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,180
I mean we just,
I my my,

1320
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,073
my whole thing here is,
I just think we chalked up mental 

1321
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:55,924
illness too easily.
Well I think what you're talking about 

1322
00:57:57,461 --> 00:57:58,294
though is mental illness.
I mean what I'm saying is that anybody 

1323
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:04,540
that's willing to kill people like that 
is mentally ill and you could say like,

1324
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,590
oh,
how to define it.

1325
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:07,000
Is it herpes?
You know,

1326
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:07,834
is it the flu?
But I think the lack of empathy is in 

1327
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:14,310
itself a disconnect from the human race 
and can make you mentally ill.

1328
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:16,720
Like you could classify someone as 
mentally ill.

1329
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,780
The problem is anybody could be mentally
ill.

1330
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,850
If you get born into the wrong 
situation,

1331
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:23,980
you get abused and grow up,
fucked up.

1332
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:28,150
Your brain is all hardwired to have.
You're stressed out all the time and all

1333
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,163
the people around,
you're all fucking crazy and you're 

1334
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:33,130
just,
your cortisol levels are off the charts.

1335
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,330
We all have the potential to lose our 
fucking mind.

1336
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,890
All of us do.
Or He,

1337
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:39,724
you know,
you grew up desensitized where you see 

1338
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:43,930
the struggles of life.
It's like life doesn't own shit.

1339
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:45,460
You see your friends and stuff like 
that.

1340
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:46,140
You're like,
God,

1341
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,620
this sucks man.
Who Cares?

1342
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,670
And I think it's super important that we
have empathy for people like that.

1343
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:54,010
Should we understand that?
That could have easily been us.

1344
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,470
You know,
the people get born into terrible,

1345
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:59,380
terrible situations and he probably 
would have you eaten over there bro?

1346
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,010
She's got bro.
She got bro,

1347
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,740
which got bro.

1348
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,371
Oh,
that's one of them.

1349
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:04,870
Peanut butter bars.
Those are delish.

1350
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,870
Those are good when they're called.
Um,

1351
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,390
rx bars,
three egg whites,

1352
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,630
14 peanuts to dates,
no bs.

1353
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,620
That's all.
It's in there.

1354
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,350
Those are legit.
Those are good.

1355
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,220
It's better than the rx bar.
Um,

1356
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,100
I like the peanut butter by,
but I like that dark chocolate.

1357
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,760
When you a two you couldn't handle it 
well.

1358
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,960
Yeah.
Too much for you.

1359
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,400
Too much flavor.
It's a little too much.

1360
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,240
I like it.
I like fucked up flavors though.

1361
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,270
I am convinced that what one person 
tastes.

1362
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:35,030
I don't taste.
I'm just fucking convinced why like real

1363
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,350
bitter stuff.
Like my coffee,

1364
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,184
I get like super strong.
Like callan tries like do this tastes 

1365
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:40,940
like cigarette ashes.
I'm like,

1366
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:41,840
yeah,
like it's super like,

1367
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:45,020
I like real bitter like coffee.
I like a strong coffee too.

1368
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:49,200
I like a good a dark roast your ass on 
that.

1369
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,170
That light roast.
Get the fuck out of me.

1370
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,350
I get super bummed out when someone 
pours me and I see the,

1371
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,160
the coffee going down right away.
See through any deal.

1372
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,490
I'm like,
well if this place sucks,

1373
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:02,780
they chasse coffee,
gas lemonade out of my fucking face that

1374
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:06,330
tea out of my God damn coffee shop.
Sometimes it looks like d.

1375
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,980
I can tell on the only I need to get the
fuck out of here.

1376
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,360
I'm one of those,
you know those Nespresso things.

1377
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,390
You have those little capsules.
I'm a curious man.

1378
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,220
I don't fuck with no prep.
Nespresso.

1379
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,690
I like him.
You know why?

1380
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:21,500
Cause you can make espresso like that.
You can make espresso like that.

1381
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,140
Like you're out there fucking with a 
spoon.

1382
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,691
It tap,
tap,

1383
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:28,691
tap on the,
you need to get espresso with a tesla.

1384
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,760
Like is that like,
you know what I'm saying?

1385
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,150
Like grass,
like a goddamn gangster.

1386
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,270
I like that dark as fuck.
I pour it little home and milk.

1387
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:43,450
I take three espressos from an espresso.
I don't fuck with her.

1388
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,150
Bad for the environment too.
It's great for my stomach.

1389
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,120
Why is it bad for the environment?
The birds?

1390
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,540
Yeah.
Then the guy,

1391
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,423
the guy who created those craig things 
in the nurse suppressed so they can't 

1392
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:57,230
recycle them and that was nothing to do 
with him.

1393
01:00:57,231 --> 01:00:58,070
And he's like,
I fucked up.

1394
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,380
I wish I could stop it.
But he gave the,

1395
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:03,380
the,
the formula to someone who ran with it.

1396
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:08,381
Often the espresso should and they did 
it and now it's fucking people up.

1397
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:09,224
Do you know that they could do that 
easily with almost everything that we 

1398
01:01:11,091 --> 01:01:11,924
make with hemp,
but then just refuse to because they 

1399
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,310
want the cotton business now they don't 
have a full whole,

1400
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,840
he just grabbed that microphone was 
like,

1401
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:22,841
we're about to spit knowledge.
[inaudible]

1402
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,220
it's own.
Say cotton business.

1403
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,310
Someone said conspiracy and have been 
one sentence.

1404
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,620
You know what?
I was like,

1405
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,120
I was sitting here thinking,
damn,

1406
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,690
this podcast has so much power.
You're gonna,

1407
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,800
you're going to bring back cars.
You know you're getting me into cars.

1408
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,080
Bring back cars.
Cars never went anywhere,

1409
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:46,520
but they're fucking here.
I'll take it.

1410
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,380
Cool.
For younger people,

1411
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,990
younger people love cars.
Everybody loves cars.

1412
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,710
If you raise them right,
not only rich people like cars.

1413
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,880
That is one thing that is true because I
did ignore cars when I was broke.

1414
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,840
I was like,
that is Karma.

1415
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:01,943
Goddamn could cut that part of my head.
And then once I started making some 

1416
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:04,971
money,
I was like,

1417
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,270
oh,
loosen up the reins z here,

1418
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,750
man.
Time to go back to what I enjoy.

1419
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,960
When I was a kid,
I had a bunch of muscle cars.

1420
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,150
I had a gang of different kind of muscle
cars,

1421
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:19,650
broke people that know everything about 
sports cars and the latest shit.

1422
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:20,290
Damn.

1423
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,123
That wasn't new.
Right when I was a kid I knew a lot 

1424
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:25,560
about muscle cars.
I didn't know a lot about like Porsche's

1425
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,560
or Ferrari's.
Those all seemed like way out of range.

1426
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,860
But I know a lot about like 69 mustangs,
1970 barracudas that kind of shit.

1427
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:39,051
I loved the Porsche's cause my Stepdad 
was the best Porsche mechanic in Newport

1428
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,680
beach day got kill was the shit as the 
mechanic.

1429
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,740
He worked in Newport beach and so he,
I knew about Porsche's through him.

1430
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,290
Like I knew what a nine 11 was when I 
was years old.

1431
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,213
Nine 28,
nine 44 I was kind of hip to it just 

1432
01:02:57,301 --> 01:02:58,510
because of him.
Um,

1433
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,800
there was this one got strip club,
these to show up in a cause,

1434
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,270
you know,
there's that nine 24,

1435
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:05,850
those are the cheap ones.
He would switch it and he made it.

1436
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,073
He put a nine 28 and he would drive to 
the Strip club and tell girls got at 

1437
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,240
nine 28 and get the girls,
I'll wait a minute.

1438
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,073
He said he got a nine 44 but you know 
the nine 24 hours or the low level ones 

1439
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:26,280
right in the nine 44 was like you know 
rich rich guys pull eight at nine 59 you

1440
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:29,740
get dude suck your Dick guys.
I miss that one.

1441
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:30,863
I didn't know that was a nine 15 due to 
choose to work with on news radio who 

1442
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:38,070
was a camera man who got a nine 24 and 
would race it and he said it was the one

1443
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:40,470
of the best cars for racing is it's 
really well balanced.

1444
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:41,304
It,
it didn't have a lot of power but he 

1445
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:44,450
knew a lot about racing cars.
He must have.

1446
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:45,241
Yeah,
he's like he did.

1447
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:48,210
They don't have a lot of power but the 
thing is around race tracks,

1448
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,240
it's more about handling.
It is about power until you get to those

1449
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:55,110
like crazy high end nine 11 turbo,
four wheel drive,

1450
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,640
motherfuckers,
that kind of shit.

1451
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,100
Those things are just ridiculous.
You know the,

1452
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:01,440
the new nine 11 turbo,
the wheels turn the back wheels turn.

1453
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,050
So when you're going around a corner,
yeah,

1454
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:04,884
the back wheels,
they turn and make the corner shorter 

1455
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,810
dude.
And it's good.

1456
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,360
They turn the opposite way in parking 
lots to make it so you can,

1457
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,390
you can pull in the spots easier.
The bus.

1458
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,283
Yeah.
Like your attorney radios is off the 

1459
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:20,370
chart that they're ridiculous.
There's the engineering man.

1460
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,560
You guys going to get into helicopters 
and shit?

1461
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:26,310
Nah Man,
that's too [inaudible] about that shit.

1462
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,283
Helicopter money.
Do you ever look on Bill Belichick all 

1463
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:32,604
that's right,
huh?

1464
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,110
Yeah,
he gets places.

1465
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:35,010
He's like,
he goes from,

1466
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,690
he's got a helicopter and he did a Gig 
in San Diego and he flew a helicopter,

1467
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,053
uh,
out of a la and fluid down to San Diego 

1468
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,473
with his,
uh,

1469
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,880
instructor Pii helicopter.
Like the little bubble one.

1470
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,520
Are we talking about like fucking Marine
One shit?

1471
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:51,354
I don't think you can get a marine one 
for rental bill [inaudible] my makes 

1472
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,413
good money,
but he's not stupid to me in the world 

1473
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:57,061
right now.
No,

1474
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,210
Kevin Artists,
I'm saying as far as funny lies,

1475
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,820
he's probably up there.
It's him,

1476
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,130
it's him or Chappelle or Louis C k there
was,

1477
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,170
that's probably the battle.
But they're new.

1478
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:10,560
And I watched him back the back of the 
comedy store and I was just like,

1479
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,450
not,
it's so inspiring.

1480
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,600
But his shit,
I was laughing so hard,

1481
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:16,270
man.
Dude,

1482
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,980
he's so fucking his,
some of his new

1483
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,460
shit that I want to say the premise,
but it's so good.

1484
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,070
I do.
I was laughing the premises.

1485
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,070
I'm like,
of course,

1486
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:25,720
man,
that's fucking brilliant.

1487
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,090
And then I watched you,
I,

1488
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,033
you know,
I see at the store at 10 so I'll watch 

1489
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:32,670
your sets.
And I was baffled how just I,

1490
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,041
I,
you know,

1491
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:33,581
I'm new to,
it's,

1492
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:36,130
I don't know how you went from,
you did three sets.

1493
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:40,040
I'm followed along with your three sets.
How he changed them like on the go while

1494
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:41,740
I'm trying to figure out the right way 
to do it.

1495
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,603
It's good,
but it's bad because sometimes you go 

1496
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:44,344
the wrong way because I fuck around so 
much because I changed my materials so 

1497
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,000
much.
I changed the approach,

1498
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:49,834
I tried to change how I set it up.
I tried to figure out what's the best 

1499
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,490
way to do it.
I feel like once I settle in on one way,

1500
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,563
our whole net one way,
but I don't even know if that's the 

1501
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:56,950
right way.

1502
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:59,650
So I tried different ways and sometimes 
those ways to take me nowhere.

1503
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,030
That's how you know though,
right?

1504
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,950
Yeah.
But that's what the store is for.

1505
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:03,640
You know,
the store,

1506
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,080
like what I'm doing is trying shit out.
No.

1507
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,250
Says when I see them doing a set,
like once you do a special,

1508
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:10,503
then the months after the special it's,
or like some of your materials fucking 

1509
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:14,830
shaking,
you know,

1510
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,370
and it will eventually hammer together.
But on nights,

1511
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:19,204
some nights it's perfect and on some 
nights you don't really have the 

1512
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:22,900
approach.
Correct.

1513
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,530
It's like coming in for a landing,
you know,

1514
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,340
I,
I saw uh,

1515
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:27,503
uh,
Chris rock get up there and just like 

1516
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,820
riff.
Literally he was just like,

1517
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,890
what?
And you could tell he just had nothing.

1518
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:35,500
Who's just going and it's off the 
brilliant still.

1519
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,140
Well,
you've always been,

1520
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:37,974
you know,
very few people have seen you live war 

1521
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,780
than me,
very few people for a few years there.

1522
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,240
I saw you live pretty much every time 
you,

1523
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,450
you,
you did a show and um,

1524
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:54,990
you have your bits that are worked out 
and some that you're working out.

1525
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,333
Um,
but every night you went up and you mix 

1526
01:06:58,601 --> 01:06:59,434
the totally different like a DJ.
There were the same bits and you were 

1527
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,620
working on them.
But um,

1528
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,690
it was a different mix every night.
You never did shit in a row.

1529
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:09,240
That was nothing.
It was all you just flowing.

1530
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:12,810
The problem with that is when you do two
shows and you're on the second show,

1531
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:13,683
like what the fuck did I say?
Have I done this one yet or was it the 

1532
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:21,381
earlier show?
The second show just gotta be more rigid

1533
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,260
and a show is a different mix.
You don't ever do the same shit twice.

1534
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,363
It's a different mix.
I don't know if you've changed recently 

1535
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,513
because of all your specials,
but every show I've never saw the same 

1536
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:34,020
show twice.
Never same bits,

1537
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,950
but always mixed.
It's always a different segue.

1538
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:37,771
You,
oh,

1539
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:39,320
it was,
it was fun for you.

1540
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,770
And I thought that was just definitely,
that's part of it.

1541
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,060
You want to keep it fresh,
but you also,

1542
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,330
it's all about trying to figure out what
the right way to do it is.

1543
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,750
And you know,
I got to try it like eight wrong ways to

1544
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:52,490
get the right way.
I'll tell you what else was crazy.

1545
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:56,090
As I'm reading that jet APP towel book 
sick in the head and he,

1546
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:56,841
uh,
they came,

1547
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:59,690
I was going on the same show and they 
come in like,

1548
01:07:59,691 --> 01:08:00,520
hey,
um,

1549
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,000
judd's going to jump on before.
I'm like,

1550
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:04,400
who's Judd Apatow Malik?
Oh Shit.

1551
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:05,900
And he walks back.
Now you know,

1552
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:07,850
you don't want to be that fucking Dick 
sucker.

1553
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:08,923
But we just started talking.
I didn't know how cool he is going to 

1554
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:11,084
be.
I don't know anything about him besides 

1555
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:12,584
that book in his movies.
And then I'll sit in there and he's 

1556
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:15,351
like,
you got a man.

1557
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:16,280
I'm like,
I don't,

1558
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,530
and then we started talking to super 
cool now I was just like,

1559
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:20,350
dude,
your buck and which gone to the book,

1560
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,160
he was the nicest guy ever.

1561
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,120
Man.
He's very,

1562
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,920
very nice.
He's super down Earth,

1563
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,200
easy to talk to.
People don't realize that.

1564
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:29,870
Like he wrote for a Roseanne Barr,
Tom Arnold,

1565
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:32,660
like Adam Sandler,
like he's wrote for a ton of guys,

1566
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,120
which I find is interesting cause he's a
standup comic,

1567
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:38,450
but he would write for other people.
That's just cause he's not a performer.

1568
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:41,870
So you'd rather just write for them.
It's like why not do it yourself?

1569
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:45,530
Well I think he just was real busy.
I think when you're producing movies and

1570
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:46,940
stuff and doing all the shit that he 
did,

1571
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,790
I don't think he had the time to go to 
the clubs and to do standup.

1572
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,100
Right.
You got to go to the clubs.

1573
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:54,920
He got to fuck around like like that 
other night that I'm talking about.

1574
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:57,980
We were talking about rather where you 
see me doing all these different sets.

1575
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,970
Everybody does that.

1576
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,920
You know,
if you see Louie at the Improv,

1577
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:02,360
you'll see him later that night at the 
store.

1578
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,340
You know these guys are,
they're hopping on and they're,

1579
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,760
they're trying to mix stuff up and it 
doesn't,

1580
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,610
doesn't Louis say that you it to get 
really good at stem should only be doing

1581
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,444
that.
It's what he said the other night we 

1582
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,250
were talking,
he said he'd only,

1583
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,700
he'd been doing nothing but stand up for
the last two years and he was saying,

1584
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:19,010
you know what,
you could be good and do other stuff but

1585
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:21,290
to really be your best you have to do 
only stand up.

1586
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,120
And I'm like,
I think you're right.

1587
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,730
I think he's right.
I mean it makes sense.

1588
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:27,500
Would you be happy doing just stand up 
though?

1589
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,423
I would always do a podcast I think,
I mean I don't think you would have to 

1590
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:34,490
just get rid of podcasting.

1591
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,800
I feel like it helps you with Id.
UFC would definitely,

1592
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:37,634
I would definitely have to get rid of 
the OFC and I think that's probably 

1593
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,220
going to happen eventually anyway.
But the,

1594
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,510
the thing that you get from podcasting 
is you almost get like an education,

1595
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:45,960
cause I,
it's a,

1596
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,933
it's a pretty peripheral education when 
it turns cer certain things that people 

1597
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:52,790
say to me,
cause I'm listening to you say it and it

1598
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:53,624
blows me away,
but I only retain a certain percentage 

1599
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,774
of it unless I listened to the pot.
Like Lawrence Krauss is a theoretical 

1600
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:03,110
physicist that I had on was trying to 
explain some theories to me and I was,

1601
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,260
my stupid brain was just not taking it 
in.

1602
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,700
And then,
you know,

1603
01:10:07,701 --> 01:10:10,030
uh,
I had Dennis Mckenna on yesterday who's,

1604
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,950
you know,
psychedelic pioneer and he's a,

1605
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,293
what is his,
he's ethnobotanist and he's a professor 

1606
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:19,190
and he's a fucking insanely smart guy.

1607
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,053
So I,
I'd have to listen to that two or three 

1608
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:23,640
times he's explained to me the,
um,

1609
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,420
the reason why certain drugs work so 
well,

1610
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,610
like in particular mosque mushrooms,
and he was explained,

1611
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:29,444
pulled up like our molecule chart.
It was explaining to us the difference 

1612
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,594
between the molecules that are connected
to silicide been versus the molecules 

1613
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:38,870
that make dmt to,
it's really just one thing off.

1614
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,550
Oh,
it's off the charts deep.

1615
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,533
So,
but I feel like those kind of 

1616
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:45,230
conversations they make me,
they make me smarter.

1617
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,030
You know what made me more aware of 
Shit,

1618
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,870
which is great for standup.
It's better for standup.

1619
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,290
Yeah.
I'll tell you who's a smart motherfucker

1620
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,170
did change lanes here,
but I had a meeting with Aubrey Marcus.

1621
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:57,891
He know,
I know Aubrey,

1622
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:01,130
like you as a friend and we know we've 
done some business together and we're in

1623
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:01,964
this meeting and I looked down and said,
what kind of fucking Alpha brain a ut 

1624
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:11,210
and he came in a suit was all,
it's just start spinning like God damn,

1625
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,720
there's a reason why he's at where he's 
at.

1626
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,480
And he's a smart dude.
He's very tuned.

1627
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,820
I honestly didn't think he was a stupid 
human being,

1628
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:20,670
but he was dropping some fucking 
knowledge.

1629
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,320
Yeah,
give me whatever you're taking.

1630
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,550
He's very smart.
And he also,

1631
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,413
he knows a ton,
especially from this business about 

1632
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:28,470
nutrient absorption.
Yes.

1633
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,400
What yet,
like you know,

1634
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:30,234
certain foods that you can eat where you
really only absorb surrounded nutrients 

1635
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:35,460
if it's connected to fats and things 
like that.

1636
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:37,980
He's an expert on that shit.
He knows a lot about where man,

1637
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,950
his mom was a,
she was like a natural path or something

1638
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,600
like that.
Was She?

1639
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,620
Yeah,
something like that.

1640
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,630
Uh,
but he's,

1641
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:46,464
he's been pretty knowledgeable about 
that kind of stuff for a long time and 

1642
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,810
he's a unique dude who's a lot of,
you know,

1643
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:54,270
we're really lucky.
We know a lot of really unique people,

1644
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,343
you know?

1645
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,430
Yeah.

1646
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:57,390
Fo Sho.

1647
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,250
Yeah.

1648
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:03,680
Silas,
let's start Kim.

1649
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,750
See those videos of people worshiping 
him like he had the Beatles have to,

1650
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,000
did you see the one where they almost,
it's almost too ridiculous.

1651
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:15,834
Like they are chasing him through the 
streets and soldiers acting like little 

1652
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:22,640
girls.
To me.

1653
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,160
It's on believeable.
Yeah,

1654
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,920
they literally have to.
Matt,

1655
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:30,690
did you ever see with a curious,
fascinating.

1656
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:36,170
It's very fascinating how that like,
it's a terrible mind boggling.

1657
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,450
North Korea is,
it's amazing videos.

1658
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,240
People,
we're shipping him and then you watch,

1659
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,610
there's documentaries of people going 
in.

1660
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,210
They get inside and they,
and they're like constantly being guided

1661
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,073
through North Korea.
There are people with them that there's 

1662
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,310
fake.
Yeah.

1663
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:53,460
Wait a minute.
Most people think,

1664
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,450
look there.
So communists they're putting on this is

1665
01:12:57,451 --> 01:12:58,201
like a,
yeah,

1666
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:00,030
they're putting on a show.
It's obvious that they're,

1667
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,460
they're,
they're giving them a tour of the city,

1668
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,070
but they're being guided the whole way 
through.

1669
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,790
They got people on them and they're not 
allowed to do shit.

1670
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,130
You see Shane Smith saying when he went 
to North Korea,

1671
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:15,420
so most people are thinking,
man,

1672
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:19,620
they're show communists or whatever or,
or,

1673
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:20,410
uh,
the,

1674
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,243
the,
the dictatorship is so strong there 

1675
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:23,700
that,
look,

1676
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:25,890
they won't even let people walk around 
freely.

1677
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,331
You know,
it's like,

1678
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:28,320
it just seems like,

1679
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:33,080
is that what the fuck is going on with,
I don't know.

1680
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:35,180
I don't want,
do you think there's a conspiracy in the

1681
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:36,830
conspiracy?
I think maybe.

1682
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:39,920
Is this a double negative fucking double
cross?

1683
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:40,700
Oh,
he,

1684
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,250
oh,
they're testing missiles.

1685
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,060
Did you see that shit?
If blue scene,

1686
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,953
the parade show,
the clip of the parade where they show 

1687
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:51,723
them like the soldiers marching in a 
parade and then the floods it on and 

1688
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:57,680
then the bringing out the missiles,
they said they'll show the show that and

1689
01:13:57,681 --> 01:14:00,350
then they'll cut the gym home long.
Or Jim?

1690
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,110
Kim Jong Ou.
Yeah,

1691
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:05,950
with his genitals.
Like there's a clip of like like they're

1692
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,070
like,
no,

1693
01:14:07,071 --> 01:14:07,904
no,
like kind of watching and they're kind 

1694
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:09,284
of,
and then they cut back to the brain and 

1695
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:11,830
it's the clip

1696
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,470
and then they go back to Kim Gen ed 
just,

1697
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:17,110
I dunno and you're not buying it I 
think.

1698
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:17,944
Well here's what you have put.
Let me just wait before you go any 

1699
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:20,074
further.
Let me just explain what the 

1700
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:24,550
distractions do you stock footage when 
they have stories on these guys and they

1701
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:27,550
use it all the time where they don't 
have footage of the guy currently,

1702
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,473
so they have a story about Kim Jon when 
they start talking about them and then 

1703
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:31,684
they show stock footage.
That stock footage could be him to open 

1704
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,110
his career releases video.
Understand that's what it was.

1705
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:38,944
It was like,
this is lower buddies are trained just 

1706
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:44,040
to move like that though.
There's no head there.

1707
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,230
It's a communist dictatorship.
Fake cities and shit.

1708
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,490
Yeah.
Well that's China.

1709
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,413
China has more than China.
It does to write out the board or they 

1710
01:14:52,131 --> 01:14:53,230
have like two Indians.

1711
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,350
The people of the south to come to North
Korea.

1712
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,333
They,
I think North Korea really needs to be 

1713
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:04,910
looked into because you think it's fake.
If you go to war world son,

1714
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,480
you think North Korea is fake?
I'm not saying it's fake.

1715
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,940
I'm just saying it's saying that it's 
fake.

1716
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,910
I'm just saying that Kim Jong Il could 
eat,

1717
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:15,040
I think might be part of,
I think they're all buddies.

1718
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,560
I think at the very top,
the top of Russia,

1719
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,240
the top of the United States,
the UK,

1720
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,600
they're just putting on a show and he's 
designated villain.

1721
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,500
When we need to distract people from 
this or that fucking he,

1722
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:28,720
Oh Kim Jong is a kill.
A lot of people testing,

1723
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,370
testing and missiles did.
He's testing missiles.

1724
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:34,204
He said he's going to fire off one,
but in China it's very possible that 

1725
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:39,394
we've changed our foreign policy and 
that we're getting more aggressive with 

1726
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:42,694
them and this is their response and that
they also are very incompetent because 

1727
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:48,070
they are terrified they're there.

1728
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,110
What they are essentially is a military 
dictatorship.

1729
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:53,440
There were terrified population and 
their science is shitty.

1730
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:54,274
They don't have any,
but we're getting all this from doing 

1731
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,380
hamstring media,
so like the head,

1732
01:15:57,381 --> 01:16:00,070
yet we can't miss the truth,
but we're getting this from everywhere.

1733
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:00,973
You can't always assume that everything 
from the mainstream media is not true 

1734
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:06,160
because here's the deal.
If something does happen,

1735
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,173
that's a real thing that happens.
The mainstream media is always going to 

1736
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:10,560
cover it.
What does he say?

1737
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,660
Stop and listen to me here cause this is
important.

1738
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,990
Just because something's in the 
mainstream media and I know you distrust

1739
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:17,824
the mainstream media,
it doesn't mean that it's not true 

1740
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
because you always have to realize that 
if something happens,

1741
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,690
say like Mount Saint Helens blows,
right?

1742
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,420
Love lava flowing down the street,
bunch of people die.

1743
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,150
That's a real natural disaster that we 
all know happens.

1744
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:30,730
Fox News is going to cover that.
CNN is going to cover that.

1745
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:32,100
Everybody's going to cover that.
Not every,

1746
01:16:32,101 --> 01:16:33,850
everything that covers fake.
Right.

1747
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:38,800
So if North Korea does try to launch a 
missile and it does fail,

1748
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:39,813
everyone's gonna cover that.
So just because CNN has something on 

1749
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:43,120
her,
Fox News has something on it.

1750
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:45,160
Doesn't mean that it's fine.
For sure.

1751
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:50,161
I'm totally with you on the show.
Look into North Korea.

1752
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:54,130
Who's the King of conspiracy theories?
I was shown out stone.

1753
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,240
Do you see him?
He was like,

1754
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:56,020
Yo,
I'm black.

1755
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:01,020
I'm just playing a character man.
Real cause that's what I would say.

1756
01:17:01,161 --> 01:17:02,620
It doesn't take as kids.
Me Too.

1757
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:03,650
I would do it too,
I would say.

1758
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,840
But even he was like,
dude,

1759
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:08,440
I'm just saying some shit to get Mr. 
Jones belongs to a country club.

1760
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:13,010
Mr. Jones is an outstanding citizen and 
he is essentially just a really,

1761
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:14,630
really popular Phil Hendrie.

1762
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,980
He's an animator.
He was like,

1763
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,530
I'm just putting on a performance man.
I don't believe that she has performance

1764
01:17:18,531 --> 01:17:19,760
artist.
He says,

1765
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:23,720
I don't believe that shit.
Say Word for word.

1766
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:28,700
No,
I'm just playing a character.

1767
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:31,360
I don't believe that shit.
That's what I heard you work in him.

1768
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,230
I see what you're doing.
He's working you out.

1769
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,090
I'm just saying the savior of 
conspiracy.

1770
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:36,620
He was like,
it's a performance.

1771
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:38,060
I'm out.
Well,

1772
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,800
I'm just saying,
I'm just saying how fun.

1773
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,600
Doolittle.
Apologize.

1774
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:47,990
Don't be shy for pizza districts like 
that ain't real.

1775
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:48,471
No,
no,

1776
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:49,640
no to you.
They were suing him.

1777
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:51,890
Never going after him.
If you listen to him,

1778
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:54,260
he's reading a statement like,
don't come after me.

1779
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:56,510
They were going after him or trying to 
shut them down.

1780
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,940
That's what's going on.
He totally knows that.

1781
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,690
Anyways,
he's,

1782
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:01,563
he's,
he's watching his ass to come and after 

1783
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:05,290
hashtag tower seven anyways,
anywhere else.

1784
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:08,100
Seven tower towel.
She see gates.

1785
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,413
Did it catch pizza gate?
I'm just saying half look into North 

1786
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,240
Korea.
It's fucking hysterical.

1787
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,200
It's hysterical.
I think.

1788
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:19,610
I think I'm just playing a character can
into it,

1789
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,430
but,
but Eddie,

1790
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,510
this'll,
there's like a Pentagon to test a bill.

1791
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:26,510
Get the shit down North Korean missiles.
I,

1792
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,490
the video is the next video I played the
girl.

1793
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,700
Well,
listen man,

1794
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,950
this is strange time.
The fact that here's,

1795
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:37,784
here's what's strange.
The fact that these people are actually 

1796
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:40,604
doing this.
The fact that you can get people to 

1797
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:46,250
goose step down the middle of the street
and ride a tank and salute the king,

1798
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,260
like this shit's all real.
They don't know what,

1799
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:51,110
you better find a video where they 
worship him.

1800
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,730
Yeah,
that's the greatest shit.

1801
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:54,050
But,
but listen,

1802
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,913
this,
what we're looking at right here is 

1803
01:18:56,121 --> 01:18:58,550
actually happening.
This is not CGI.

1804
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:03,020
So this is either a two levels of weird.
It's either one level of weird where you

1805
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:06,810
have this populace that's so entranced 
by the,

1806
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:07,663
the military dictatorship that they just
act out every day of their lives like 

1807
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:14,930
this and they can't help themselves.
Or two,

1808
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:17,690
this is all bullshit.
And these are all actors.

1809
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,583
So they've got 5 million actors waving 
Korean flags and we find the king and 

1810
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,270
whatever the fuck it is,
you got feet goosestepping let's do it.

1811
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,120
There's a lot of people there.
I don't know how many thousand that is,

1812
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:31,920
but there's a lot of people that put on 
shows for people coming in.

1813
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,040
You come in,
they're going to put a show on for you,

1814
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:35,780
but not everywhere you go.
They're putting on,

1815
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,460
so there's actors,
everyone already,

1816
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,413
but this is just a lot of them,
but they're already understand that she 

1817
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:43,010
deserves like academy award already act,
these people,

1818
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,540
goose step in and doing all those 
things.

1819
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:47,480
Just the fact that they're able to do 
that save this is all fake.

1820
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,710
Let's just,
let's just go deep,

1821
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,553
deep,
deep.

1822
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,140
Let's go deep,
deep,

1823
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:51,621
deep,
deep,

1824
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,454
deep.
What are the odds that you're going to 

1825
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:57,740
get that many actors who don't even have
top billing to stay in line?

1826
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:58,963
What are the odds that you're going to 
get them to perform like that and drive 

1827
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,760
tanks and keep their mouth shut?

1828
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,863
And this one's on.
Everyone's pitching in on it's way more 

1829
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,054
likely that these people are under the 
thumb of a military dictatorship is cut 

1830
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,220
ton of people,
right?

1831
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:17,760
Because we've had a fuck load of 
military dictatorships in history,

1832
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:18,594
but what we haven't had is a country 
filled with actors and who's playing 

1833
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,374
these actors?
Who's giving them that fucking who's 

1834
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,533
throw in North Korea crazy money?
Who's the Goddamn teacher and how do 

1835
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:28,284
they train all of deicing?
Is it one big auditoriums and one 

1836
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,090
episode of fame?
Well,

1837
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,970
look at them.
Goosestepping dude,

1838
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:37,560
this is crazy.
Look how many people there.

1839
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,590
Look how they,
they turn their fucking tops over.

1840
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,630
Whatever they're doing,
the changes to the flag goes.

1841
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,080
It looks like a New Year's Eve parade.
Look at these people,

1842
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:47,770
man.
They're all marching in tune.

1843
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:51,060
Just the fact that they can get anybody 
to do it either.

1844
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:51,953
Either one,
either his regular businessmen right 

1845
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:54,984
there on the side,
because a few people that are probably 

1846
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,120
want you to sing.

1847
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,360
It looks fucking fishy.
The cash is running rampant.

1848
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:01,343
It's all,
again,

1849
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,750
I'm just saying me ask you this,
Mister [inaudible].

1850
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,180
Let me ask you this,
Mr [inaudible].

1851
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,193
What is more likely?
Is it more likely these people are 

1852
01:21:10,051 --> 01:21:12,960
fucking terrified and like many,
many,

1853
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:16,410
many other civilizations in the past 
session like this,

1854
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,180
right?
It's ever existed,

1855
01:21:18,181 --> 01:21:20,190
but I'm sure it hasn't.
China,

1856
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:23,190
I'm sure it has an ancient,
ancient Japan.

1857
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:26,540
I'm sure there's been dictatorship.
We're talking about shit.

1858
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,960
We know for sure.
We know the magazines,

1859
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:29,933
the Mayans,
the aztecs killed 80,000 people after 

1860
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:35,010
they cut and built one of their 
pyramids.

1861
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,860
I mean they did over a period,
probably litigious.

1862
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:39,923
He's probably legit,
but we've been lied to so much about 

1863
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:46,860
like what's a lie to all these people 
were actors and they just live there.

1864
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,040
They're all out on your own.
Just think of how crazy that is.

1865
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,370
Wouldn't it be more likely that these 
poor people are just brainwashed?

1866
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:59,090
Because we know people get brainwashed 
wouldn't be more like craziest when you,

1867
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:03,630
when you're taking into consideration 
all the lies that we've been told,

1868
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,670
the fake moon missions,
all this shit.

1869
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,050
Nothing.
I mean,

1870
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,913
this is nothing.
They put together a bunch of people and 

1871
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:10,254
made a fucking parade,
but they think the moon mission six 

1872
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:14,880
times.
But everybody believes that shit.

1873
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:18,480
But there are real events that happen 
every day that are in the totals,

1874
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:20,420
right?
So this is just too convenient.

1875
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:21,990
It's too much of a distraction.
Eddie,

1876
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,853
this,
my guess is we're not going to war with 

1877
01:22:23,951 --> 01:22:24,591
the Eddie.
This is my,

1878
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:25,424
one of the greatest options.
This will be one of the greatest 

1879
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:27,954
productions in the history of the human 
race and the biggest movie of greater 

1880
01:22:31,831 --> 01:22:36,680
production and the get all these Korean 
people around.

1881
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:38,760
That's a couple of thousand people,
Dude.

1882
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:43,790
No one's wanting to do this.
They have to wait with snitch.

1883
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:47,460
These are not the same people to fake 
the moon missions.

1884
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,100
Find,
find the people,

1885
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:51,923
but don't say it's legit.
These people are these people that are 

1886
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:55,254
stuck in North Korea.
People that have escaped have told 

1887
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,460
horror stories.
Press.

1888
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,080
It's like a giant cult.
It's horrible.

1889
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,050
It's like this is a fucking,
you know,

1890
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:06,370
10 million cult of the monies.
Not saying they're actors.

1891
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:09,050
I'm just saying there's something fishy 
about the whole North Korea thing.

1892
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,290
I'm not saying that they're acting.
It could be anything.

1893
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,280
I'm just saying.
I don't know.

1894
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:13,810
I'm saying it's,
that smells fishy.

1895
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,930
Something is not right about what 
they're telling us about North Korea.

1896
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:21,160
I Dunno most.
Here's the real thing that's most fucked

1897
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:24,550
up about North Korea is it?
Even if you freed them from this guy,

1898
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,840
they've been under the thumb of a 
communist dictatorship for so long,

1899
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:29,770
they wouldn't know what to do.

1900
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,480
Institutionalized.
Yes,

1901
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:32,343
they really are.
It's like a guy who's been into window 

1902
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,130
Fox people's heads up,
man.

1903
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,173
Do you know how many people would be so 
susceptible to some new form of 

1904
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:44,200
dictatorship?
Fuck man.

1905
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:46,150
I mean,
you literally have a whole country this,

1906
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,103
they always do that in these,
these countries when they remove a 

1907
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:50,044
dictator and then there's this power 
vacuum in a way more horrible person 

1908
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:55,270
takes their place and like,
what the fuck man?

1909
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,453
I like,
they got rid of Gaddafi and now it's 

1910
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:00,490
just the crazy isis strong stronghold.
Yeah.

1911
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,050
Libya.
Apparently.

1912
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:03,130
Man,
I don't know too much about it,

1913
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:04,610
but they were saying that it's a failed 
state.

1914
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,270
Wild with that with with North Korea 
though.

1915
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:11,710
They can't even like that.
He controls their media TV like Internet

1916
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:14,230
that they can't log on the certain 
fucking sites.

1917
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,060
Some don't get Internet.
No,

1918
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:19,240
there's no iphone like you being an 
iphone and I got Danny from the future.

1919
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,550
They still got flip phones and shit.
Yeah,

1920
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,610
they're there.
We're living in a really weird country,

1921
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:25,660
a hamburger.
They flipped.

1922
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:26,973
I think the globalists like it.
I think we need villains and they 

1923
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:32,070
probably help him out and fund him.
Well,

1924
01:24:32,071 --> 01:24:33,970
you know what I mean?
They like the shit he's doing.

1925
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:35,500
They,
they need a distraction.

1926
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:36,363
Anything happens.
We don't really boomed the testing 

1927
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:39,940
missiles.
Boom for two weeks we're going to be all

1928
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:42,400
over North Korea a couple of months and 
then it's going to be gone.

1929
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,710
Watch north.
This is like the new Ebola.

1930
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,780
Remember that was Ebola.
Ebola distraction.

1931
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,360
Distraction.
North Korea is perfect to distract.

1932
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:54,130
That's what you think.
Ebola was a distraction.

1933
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,993
You don't think Ebola was a bunch of 
like really smart doctors stopping some 

1934
01:24:58,031 --> 01:24:58,864
shit before it got horrible because 
you've got a hemorrhagic virus is 

1935
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:03,810
escaping out for fat.

1936
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,293
People really got it.
Just because a bunch of shit happens at 

1937
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:11,230
the same time,
it doesn't mean that one of those things

1938
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,064
that happens was a designed to make sure
you don't pay attention to the other 

1939
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:15,274
thing.
Just cause they dropped that mother of 

1940
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:17,074
all bombs in Afghanistan.
Did you see that shit like three people 

1941
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:23,440
killed 99 fucking thing.
Well,

1942
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:26,200
they had to go through it had to go 
through the ground.

1943
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:29,890
The same tunnel system.
What's the story?

1944
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,960
They launched a lot.
Biggest bomb ever created.

1945
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,490
You know,
a number of little drops.

1946
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:35,980
It's the heaviest,
most powerful bomb ever.

1947
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:37,590
It's crazy.
When you watch this footage,

1948
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:39,930
have you seen a jamie?
The blast radius is a mile.

1949
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:43,480
It looks like you're dropping a straight
space ship and it killed at first.

1950
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:44,950
They're like,
he killed 40 people.

1951
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:47,590
That's damn several of our crazy mass 
shooters.

1952
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:50,310
We say 40.
We met in 1990.

1953
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,120
The leanest fucking yeah,
you got it.

1954
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:56,650
They got to drop it.
Parachute a parachute on it,

1955
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,533
son.
I mean it hit and apparently devastated 

1956
01:26:01,061 --> 01:26:04,070
this tunnel system that they were having
a hard time to because

1957
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,580
they said that isis has this stronghold 
out there.

1958
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,250
That thing,
21,000 pounds.

1959
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:12,500
A video of that from the Afghanistan 
hit.

1960
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:15,290
Yeah.
There is from the helicopters.

1961
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,330
Military video.
Yeah.

1962
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,520
I was expecting a little more out of it 
to be honest with you.

1963
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:20,181
Yeah.
It's,

1964
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:21,014
um,
it's hard to tell what's going on 

1965
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:22,544
because it's black and white.
Why did they paint that bitch charger 

1966
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,080
horns,
that bitch know came from America.

1967
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,250
Why did they put fucking rate white 
racing stripes on the system?

1968
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:34,640
It is a crazy little machine.
It's a big ass.

1969
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:37,490
But you're not buying that shit.
Eddie nearly killed me.

1970
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:40,610
Explosion.
It's a chicken explode.

1971
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,440
The bomb bomb went off.
That's what we saw.

1972
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,810
No,
it's the biggest bomb that ever has been

1973
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:50,810
dropped in war outside of a nuclear 
bomb.

1974
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:51,863
All right,
well you don't believe in on nuclear 

1975
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:57,851
bottom grammatically is crazy.
I am.

1976
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,163
Tell me,
I'm trying to figure out what's the 

1977
01:27:03,381 --> 01:27:05,090
angle.
Why are they showing us this?

1978
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,430
That's what I'm thinking.
That's how crazy I am.

1979
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:11,750
I'm fucking so anything when it comes 
to,

1980
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:16,430
when it comes to military shit that's 
blasted on the history channel or CNN,

1981
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:19,580
um,
automatically what's their angle?

1982
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:20,310
I don't.
Okay,

1983
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,690
let me ask you this.
Conversation.

1984
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:24,440
Sanity.
You need to talk crazy entity dinosaurs.

1985
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:25,670
I'm crazy.
Dinosaurs.

1986
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,500
Really not.
I don't trust that shit.

1987
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:28,713
You don't trust too that I love that 
triceratops cause everybody loves when 

1988
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,870
the triceratops fights at the 
tyranosaurs rex,

1989
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:35,743
everybody's rooting for the tricep.
If you're ruined for the Thai Rana 

1990
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,200
source wrecks in that epic battle,
he's a Douche bag.

1991
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,390
Right.
So you did those like we'll do,

1992
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,530
what about wooly mammoth?
Um,

1993
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,360
I,
I,

1994
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,380
I would say a yes.
Oh,

1995
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:53,600
you've got to fucking elephant.
You know what I mean?

1996
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:58,370
It's a fucking elephant.
There's a new one where they're going to

1997
01:27:58,371 --> 01:27:59,660
bring it back.
Tie Rod of sorts.

1998
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:02,000
Rex is a giant kangaroo.
That's what it is.

1999
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:03,283
That's my guess.

2000
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:08,360
It looks exactly the same.
It's got a tail hops around on two legs.

2001
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,343
[inaudible] that's a fucking,
they found the giant kangaroo and when 

2002
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:13,250
they figured it out they go,
dude,

2003
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:15,220
it's a kangaroo.
Skip off sock.

2004
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,810
Well listen,
if it was a giant kangaroo,

2005
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:21,830
be just as impressive with docents.
Hundred foot tall kangaroo.

2006
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,620
How about that one?
Jack Kangaroo.

2007
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:26,770
You see that one Jack Kangaroo that 
lives in a park somewhere?

2008
01:28:26,771 --> 01:28:28,910
He's Jujitsu.
Tenax he's not that.

2009
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,640
He's like the Kevin Randleman of 
Kangaroos.

2010
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,570
You ever seen this kangaroo ridiculous 
on the phone?

2011
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,200
You saw that guy who fought the 
kangaroo?

2012
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,400
Yeah,
the guy's an asshole,

2013
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,660
but here's my thing.
It's like a kangaroo was 100 feet tall.

2014
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,580
Just as impressive as a lizard.
A hundred feet tall.

2015
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,603
Crazy triceratops.
Isn't the fucking look like just the 

2016
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,530
different kind of rhinoceros like Audi?
It is.

2017
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,300
It is.
Why is he like that?

2018
01:28:53,301 --> 01:28:58,301
Dia is body like [inaudible] bitch.
I'm not surprised on the flush.

2019
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,800
Look at him.
I bet.

2020
01:29:01,801 --> 01:29:03,300
Dot.
Kangaroo would fuck us up.

2021
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:05,880
You think?
Oh God.

2022
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:11,510
That's Vito Belfort vein on his bicep.
That's like Mark Coleman and 95 that's a

2023
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:15,504
tank.
Do you think the three of us could beat 

2024
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,520
him up?
No,

2025
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:18,480
man.
We're going to run.

2026
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:22,770
We're going to get that Samurai sticking
his asshole destroy that fucking thing.

2027
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:27,630
That's a scary animal.
It's a big fucking scary animals.

2028
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,470
They can get like seven feet tall.
They're fucking huge.

2029
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:32,520
Is that real?
Yeah.

2030
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:35,680
There's certain ones that that's a real 
kangaroo jack.

2031
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,391
Well,
they're really,

2032
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:37,224
there's two different kinds.
There's Red Kangaroos and gray 

2033
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:40,170
kangaroos.
I don't know.

2034
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,540
Remember which one's the Big One?
I think it's a red kangaroo.

2035
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:45,180
The red tones way more gnarly.
The largest google.

2036
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:48,330
What's the largest kangaroo young Jamie.
I think it's a,

2037
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:53,360
I think it's a 300 pound rip kangaroo 
crushes my good Lord at a video.

2038
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,281
But you,
so Eddie,

2039
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:57,114
what do you,
you don't think that like t rex is a 

2040
01:29:58,471 --> 01:29:59,430
real,
do you really,

2041
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,490
when you look,
when you look into,

2042
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,613
uh,
when dinosaur bones of first discovered 

2043
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,000
them,
I mean it says,

2044
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,590
when you look into dot,
dot,

2045
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:09,510
dot.
When you're looking at the timeline,

2046
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,830
it wasn't just like,
oh,

2047
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:11,880
all dinosaurs were discovered.

2048
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,950
There was a timeline.
There was a lot of,

2049
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,470
there was a lot of fraudulent shit that 
was dude's like,

2050
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:17,520
hey,
look what I found.

2051
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,493
They don't bitch.
That's just a whale bone that I fuck 

2052
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:23,220
ever getting paid.
There was a little hot of fraud going on

2053
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:26,790
in the 18 hundreds when they were 
discovering that the birth,

2054
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:28,630
but was that,
what about like the,

2055
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:29,464
the way the earth is like the layers and
get until certain time periods from the 

2056
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:34,980
layers of the stratus?
Well,

2057
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:35,814
if you're talking about carbon dating,
there's a lot of science that goes back 

2058
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:39,810
and forth.
I could ain't shit or it's real.

2059
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:41,150
Oh,
it's not in the job.

2060
01:30:41,151 --> 01:30:44,760
There's almost universally acknowledged 
a carbon datings effective.

2061
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,950
Well,
not the stuff that I'm looking into.

2062
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:52,040
I don't know all my shit on you,
so don't take my word for thank you,

2063
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:56,423
chase it.

2064
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,750
This shit.
Be Crazy.

2065
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:59,220
Chase your tail with this shit,
man.

2066
01:30:59,250 --> 01:30:59,641
No,
I'm not.

2067
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:02,220
I'm having fun.
Love it.

2068
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:04,800
He loves it.
Figuring out how we're being bullshitted

2069
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:06,600
is very,
I'm obsessed with it.

2070
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:08,370
See how are they bullshitting us?
I love that.

2071
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:12,510
I that like that and he's like,
I just want to eat people like this.

2072
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,790
Like he loves.
This is a crazy idea.

2073
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,990
I think we're being lied to about 
fucking everything.

2074
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,600
Your kids going to grow up just saying 
skeptical.

2075
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,820
Fuck.
I'm already telling him.

2076
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,730
I'm already telling you don't trust 
anything you see on TV.

2077
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:27,630
I'm Martin.
No,

2078
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:30,450
we don't let him watch TV.
We let him watch a little cartoons here,

2079
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:31,440
here,
here and there.

2080
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:32,201
A little bit.
Bunch.

2081
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:35,550
Bob's corrupted,
but I'm going to race him.

2082
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:36,384
Not Trusting TV.
Know I don't give a fuck what anybody 

2083
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:41,240
says.
You can't.

2084
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:45,270
You can't say nobody would ever disagree
with that.

2085
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,600
That does.
E V is not good for kids.

2086
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,150
Why don't you have a show on the Alex 
Jones Channel?

2087
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:53,370
What has happened?
What the fuck?

2088
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:57,090
I went total retard on him.
I wouldn't full flat earth on them.

2089
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:01,721
No,
no,

2090
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:01,991
no,
no.

2091
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:04,150
Most,
most most conspiracy.

2092
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:05,813
Most conspiracy,
they think flat earth is the most 

2093
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:11,950
retarded thing ever.
When joe first just correct,

2094
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,380
when joe first brought it up,
like about eat about a year,

2095
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:15,760
year and a half ago,
he said,

2096
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:16,594
dude,
he was trying to,

2097
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,660
he was trying to basically say how 
stupid people are.

2098
01:32:19,661 --> 01:32:20,494
He said,
do you know people still believe the 

2099
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:23,380
earth is flat and the sun is 3000 miles 
away?

2100
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:24,603
And I remember sitting there thinking,
Shit that what are the amish or 

2101
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:29,920
something like how dumb do have to be to
create the world?

2102
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,940
This is how,
and then again,

2103
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:39,250
you brought it up again like maybe six 
months later.

2104
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:41,890
And I and I said,
and I said on your podcast.

2105
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:43,060
I said,
that's got it.

2106
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:46,660
That is so dumb.
That's gotta be some kind of CIA Cya.

2107
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,180
It's got to be some kind of disruption.

2108
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,013
Go.
Weird lesson.

2109
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,013
And then I was in class and one of were,
we were talking about conspiracy 

2110
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:52,804
theories and my f my buddy man,
he full blown conspiracy shit too 

2111
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:58,240
because he goes,
do you ever do ever my Jujitsu class?

2112
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:00,610
He goes,
we're talking about my youtube class.

2113
01:33:00,611 --> 01:33:02,250
I was conspiracy class.
No God,

2114
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,250
you go to school teachers I teach,
I teach.

2115
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:11,510
People had to kill a brand.
So we managed,

2116
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,660
manny turns me.
Cause did he ever look into flat earth?

2117
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:18,260
This was like eight months ago or 
something and I said [inaudible] he said

2118
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:20,160
that you ever look into astronomy?
Yeah.

2119
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,510
Right when he said Danny did you must 
fourth grade,

2120
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:24,970
right when he said that I dropped you on
your head.

2121
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:29,260
I not smoking I law.
I can't believe anything that ever comes

2122
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:31,220
out of his mouth again.
That's what I stopped.

2123
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:32,373
I'm like Jesus.

2124
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,273
And I'm like,
please don't ever bring this shit up 

2125
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:36,910
again.
You keep that shit,

2126
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,540
dude,
cut to do that.

2127
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,160
The turn.
Another guy comes,

2128
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:42,994
I'm telling you the story and then,
and then earnest comes up to me and he 

2129
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:46,450
goes,
hey man,

2130
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,070
you ever looking to flatter dues?
Jesus.

2131
01:33:49,071 --> 01:33:51,280
God Damn Christ.
So that's a dumb shit.

2132
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:52,301
And he goes,
hey man,

2133
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:54,700
I got a master's in engineering,
look into it.

2134
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,220
And I just wanted to go.
I just went home and I was just going to

2135
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,260
fucking school.
That was,

2136
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,290
we can tell people.
Yeah.

2137
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,850
Phoenix online and shit like,
hey man,

2138
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:05,860
shit,
I'm so crazy.

2139
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,190
I,
I so don't believe you want someone else

2140
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:09,980
to do.
Yeah,

2141
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,050
I,
I tried to,

2142
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,870
I tried to debunk it.
I was trying to debunk it.

2143
01:34:13,871 --> 01:34:14,704
I was mister debunker.
There's a fucking Japanese satellite 

2144
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:21,160
that takes a photo from $22,000 worse 
commodities.

2145
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:25,480
Japanese though,
even if the pixel is all fucked up,

2146
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:30,481
those pictures put up this Japanese 
pictures from 22,000 miles away.

2147
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:36,630
What pictures?
Phone.

2148
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,800
I can't remember when you got a flip 
phone dude and you,

2149
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:41,460
you're the front facing cameras were 
always dog shit always,

2150
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,060
you know,
on the back face.

2151
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:44,370
He Won.
It was pretty legit.

2152
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:45,453
Yeah.
That's how it works for 22,000 miles 

2153
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,614
away.
It's a hard to take that iphone seven 

2154
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,510
have you ever seen a picture of a flat,
hold on.

2155
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:52,730
No,
I didn't say that.

2156
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,130
I don't say that.
The crazy thing,

2157
01:34:54,131 --> 01:34:55,680
I'm not saying it's flat.
I'm just saying,

2158
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,950
damn,
you look into it.

2159
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:57,980
I'm saying we don't know

2160
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,060
what the fuck wrong.
Wait a minute,

2161
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:00,100
Eddie.
That's what I'm saying.

2162
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:02,690
We don't know this Japanese satellite.
Hold on.

2163
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:03,524
Eddie.
This Japanese satellite that all these 

2164
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:10,300
hundreds of scientists worked on for 
like a decade down's this space,

2165
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:14,300
they take moon land picture every 10 
minutes and you can download it from the

2166
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:16,280
website.
CGI composites,

2167
01:35:16,281 --> 01:35:18,830
so constantly making CGI and some sorts 
of,

2168
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:23,660
some sort of a cognitive bank somewhere.
That's what they do.

2169
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:24,494
Why do you think if they have the 
technology to make CGI that looks that 

2170
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:28,184
good?
Why don't they have the technology to 

2171
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,570
shoot a camera into space?
The pictures from Massa.

2172
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,493
How come they don't have any,
they don't have that space kind of 

2173
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:36,350
technology.
No,

2174
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:37,183
they just never did it.
They also don't give a fuck about 

2175
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,433
proven.
That's round those pictures I've seen 

2176
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,070
them put,
they don't have that kind of show me.

2177
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,750
Show me a real quick,
listen.

2178
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:47,150
NASA does not have one of those 
satellites.

2179
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:51,190
Why do you think that's fair?
Why does it look famous?

2180
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,033
Suck.
It looks like something you'd see in a 

2181
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:53,954
movie.
That's because when they do it in a 

2182
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:56,120
move,
they try to make it look like this,

2183
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:57,110
which is what?
It looks real.

2184
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:59,210
If that's real team and you don't think 
it's real,

2185
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,103
they faked six moon man.
Stop saying that because it's 

2186
01:36:02,481 --> 01:36:03,630
irrelevant.
We're not talking about,

2187
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:04,883
that's 1969 we're talking about 2017 I 
think there's some gigantic conspiracy 

2188
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:10,724
involving the Japanese government where 
they put up a fake picture of the Earth 

2189
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,900
from 22,000 miles up every 10 minutes.
High resolution,

2190
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,950
downloadable photo.
You think it's fake?

2191
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,890
Why wouldn't it be your real,
what?

2192
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,743
Isn't it just as likely that the 
Japanese actually did launch that thing 

2193
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:28,110
in this space?
Why would it be fake propaganda,

2194
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,560
man,
they cared that they,

2195
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:31,970
is there a photo of this flat earth?

2196
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:32,990
No,
I don't.

2197
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,150
I like I just said again,
that's is there.

2198
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,590
There's no photo of,
of the flat earth from space.

2199
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,710
There's no photo of the round earth.
That's not true.

2200
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:46,010
That's not true.
Why do you say they're fake though?

2201
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,330
They'll look CGI,
but you're not an expert in imagery.

2202
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,520
Looks fake to me.
Convince you though.

2203
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:54,830
When I watch Avatar,
be an expert to know.

2204
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:58,910
It's like when I watched episode 
advertise at the movies.

2205
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:03,350
When you watch some ridiculous Kung Fu 
video beat a martial arts expert.

2206
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:06,410
If you were sitting next to someone that
told you that their Sensei can't compete

2207
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:07,244
in the UFC because they're too deadly,
wouldn't you get pissed off because 

2208
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:10,514
you're an actual martial arts expert 
that's just like you with no science 

2209
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:17,140
background whatsoever.
Talking about crazy photos.

2210
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:21,740
I know crazy like that,
but why am you that I'm crazy?

2211
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,603
But why not indulge at all?
Why not indulge the foam realm of 

2212
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:30,251
possibilities and not clean to the 
conspiracy every single time it's a NASA

2213
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:31,580
can get pictures.
They've been,

2214
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,790
they've been doing CGI composite but 
pleasing his whole question.

2215
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:37,850
I forget about stating what NASA does.
Please answer my questions.

2216
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,580
Why do you always go towards the 
conspiracy?

2217
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:44,270
Why do you never considered the 
possibility that maybe he's not the same

2218
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:46,800
people?
So everybody's looking at global thing?

2219
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:49,960
Yes.
All the European space agencies like all

2220
01:37:49,961 --> 01:37:51,620
in on it.
It's a global thing.

2221
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,320
I think all governments,
most of them,

2222
01:37:55,321 --> 01:37:56,010
the globalist

2223
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,530
are all working together to,
to control.

2224
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:03,030
There be advantages and the earth is 
crazy.

2225
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:08,430
What's the advantage that it's not round
then if they control you,

2226
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:09,950
bro,
they just want to fuck with us.

2227
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,770
Keep you on up.
There's,

2228
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:12,690
I don't know,
man.

2229
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:17,690
I don't know what it doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense.

2230
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:21,840
You could find the sounds easy.
You put them on a ball because again,

2231
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:23,340
I'm crazy.
You put them on a ball.

2232
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:24,900
My guesses.
You're on a ball.

2233
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,880
You're nowhere.
Don't try to go anywhere.

2234
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:29,790
Just stay down in the world.
Oh Hell No.

2235
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,110
We sat down and said,
you know,

2236
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:34,944
well we got a release of fake math that 
shows that you can demonstrate that the 

2237
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:41,220
earth is round.
We got to earth from space,

2238
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:41,881
man.
What is that?

2239
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:43,920
We just looked at one at,
he stopped saying it was fake.

2240
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:45,900
You don't know that it's fake,
but you're saying,

2241
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:48,480
look,
it's a real problem when you crazy,

2242
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:50,220
but don't say that.
Just stop.

2243
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:51,143
Just stop and think because you're,
you're communicating to millions of 

2244
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:55,620
people saying something that doesn't 
make any sense.

2245
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:58,530
It does make so that you don't know 
anything about imagery.

2246
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:01,230
You don't know anything about what you 
don't know anything about that.

2247
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:04,170
It looks fake to me.
Fake ass pit.

2248
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:06,630
You don't have come on and you're just 
looking at it with the naked eye.

2249
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,580
It looks real to everybody else in this 
room.

2250
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,760
Someone that had made a confirmation 
bias crazy,

2251
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:12,380
right?

2252
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,790
I don't think he made sure he was having
fun with it,

2253
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,170
but you don't direct inclination to 
always go towards a conspiracy.

2254
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:23,150
Does it keeps your a piss anybody off?
It's a disservice to,

2255
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:24,840
that's what you think.
Cool.

2256
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:26,630
My doesn't have to get,
you're getting angry.

2257
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,730
No,
I'm not getting younger.

2258
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,120
Stoners,
stoners.

2259
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:31,380
I'm like,
I don't believe that shit.

2260
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,990
I'm not raising my voice when I'm trying
to do is corner your ideas.

2261
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:34,883
I try to corner your ideas because 
you're saying these things to your very 

2262
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:39,840
influential and you're saying these 
things to millions of people,

2263
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:41,970
but I don't think you're thinking 
correct.

2264
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,170
I'm telling.
I know.

2265
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,240
That's why I've stated many times that 
you're crazy.

2266
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:46,200
But here's the thing,
online,

2267
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,020
when you use it,
when do you think you started losing it?

2268
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,630
I think I was,
you know,

2269
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:55,440
as soon as I found out when I was 11 
that everybody wasn't Catholic.

2270
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,180
That was it.
That's when I started losing my,

2271
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,850
wait a minute,
I'm like,

2272
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,020
everybody's not Catholic.
I thought everybody was Catholic.

2273
01:40:01,021 --> 01:40:03,180
There's other religions and how do we 
know we're right?

2274
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:04,470
There's a bunch of,
what's a Jew?

2275
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,900
Oh Shit,
there's more Jews and Catholics.

2276
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,820
How do we know we have the right 
religion?

2277
01:40:08,821 --> 01:40:09,660
I'm like,
okay,

2278
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,150
you started the West right there.
Yes.

2279
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,380
That's when I started going.
Chris.

2280
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:16,620
So funny.
People to question authority are usually

2281
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:17,454
looked at as crazy conspiracy theorist 
CCIO coining the term conspiracy smart 

2282
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:23,364
dude.
There's a problem in the way you 

2283
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:25,644
approach these things cause you 
approached them all knowing before you 

2284
01:40:28,351 --> 01:40:30,570
even start that there are conspiracy and
telling you what.

2285
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:32,490
So that's confirmation bias.
I'm telling you,

2286
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,530
hey dude,
when you lie so much you've got to prove

2287
01:40:34,531 --> 01:40:36,420
it to me.
Utilize so goddamn much.

2288
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,373
I'm never going to be saying the things 
that a defense but what I'm saying the 

2289
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:43,350
thing I ended the prosecuting attorney 
with solid time.

2290
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,030
That's what I'm saying.
But it's not a good,

2291
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:45,883
it's not a good analogy because it's 
exactly how I look at filled with lies 

2292
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:50,880
then allows governments,
governments,

2293
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:52,720
uh,
on uh,

2294
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:56,500
being accused of lying.
I understand they've been covered line.

2295
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,360
So they're there,
they're in court.

2296
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,940
But here are you saying the government,
not the government.

2297
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,290
Oh whoever,
whoever.

2298
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:05,480
Just in general scientists,
it's all government scientists.

2299
01:41:05,481 --> 01:41:06,314
You think scientists,
you think there's these independent 

2300
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:08,104
scientists come.
It's all government scientists that 

2301
01:41:09,301 --> 01:41:10,230
don't try to,
why would you?

2302
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:13,990
Grants are all the control.
You don't think,

2303
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:14,824
you don't think the globalist aren't 
control having control the science and 

2304
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:22,170
information since day one you think it 
was like a new thing there.

2305
01:41:22,171 --> 01:41:25,270
Name the globalists.
They'd be like,

2306
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:25,841
yeah,
it's flat,

2307
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:26,890
it's flat.
It be like no fuck.

2308
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:30,700
These guys were globalists.
None of the globalist Alex called Eddie.

2309
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:33,220
Let me,
if we just spent like a day together,

2310
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,260
I think he just tried to make fun.

2311
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,700
Hey,
I'm just having fun man.

2312
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:38,250
I like finding,
I get,

2313
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:41,740
I don't trust shit coming from the 
government.

2314
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,590
Does that make me crazy?
Problem?

2315
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:45,463
Problem is this idea of the government.
The government consists of a bunch of 

2316
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:51,070
inner control science with a whole 
history agencies.

2317
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:51,904
Eddie fighting.
Do you know like the CIA and the FBI 

2318
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,170
each other?
Of course there's no one governments,

2319
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,680
a lot of personal shit going on in 
between.

2320
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:01,600
Of course,
that it's not just personal shit.

2321
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:04,720
There's a bunch of different factions 
that you call the government.

2322
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,733
I agree.
Idea that it's all like the government 

2323
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,750
can't be trusted.
I just say that cause I'm not gonna.

2324
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,430
I mean you want me to pick out some 
agencies.

2325
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:13,350
Got Nasa.
I could pick out some sadness deck,

2326
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:18,250
but just in general in general,
it's history,

2327
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,530
science,
education,

2328
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:24,940
energy.
Everything has always been controlled by

2329
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:25,600
the government.

2330
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,433
Since day one,
radio has been used as propaganda since 

2331
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:30,064
the day it was invented.
You think some independent dude just 

2332
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:34,383
invented radio and then he started 
broadcasting that like his favorite 

2333
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:38,770
music and shit.
And he know what his thoughts.

2334
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:39,813
No,
it was the government from day one and 

2335
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:41,764
radio.
It was the government in all countries 

2336
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:46,000
from day one in uh,
uh,

2337
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:48,380
TV and the movies.
It was the,

2338
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:51,130
it was all radio,
TV and the movies.

2339
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:53,170
You remember always been about 
propaganda.

2340
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:55,810
Always in every country.
It's nothing new.

2341
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:59,300
It's old school gangsters.
Are countries the most,

2342
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,250
what does this have to do with the world
being,

2343
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:02,471
no,
no,

2344
01:43:02,471 --> 01:43:02,931
this is,
this,

2345
01:43:02,931 --> 01:43:04,220
this,
this is how gangster are,

2346
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,140
are,
are,

2347
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:06,490
uh,
government is,

2348
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,650
there's a,
there was a war on drugs.

2349
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:11,740
We started on drugs.
Turns out we're bringing it in.

2350
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,400
Then there's a war on terrorism.
Turns out,

2351
01:43:14,401 --> 01:43:15,300
how do we create it?

2352
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:18,100
Al Qaeda.
You understand why I'm crazy.

2353
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:20,140
I'm crazy because of that shit.
I'm like,

2354
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:24,380
you could believe that shit.
You want to believe that I showed you.

2355
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:27,430
You just apply this to everything.
It basically,

2356
01:43:27,431 --> 01:43:30,070
anything comes from the government.
Anything coming from the government.

2357
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:31,630
Dinosaurs don't come from the 
government.

2358
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,350
Just there's so much fraud.
When you look in government,

2359
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:36,850
it comes from science,
so let's get into it.

2360
01:43:36,851 --> 01:43:38,560
Look into it.
But I have looked into it.

2361
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:40,390
Look dinosaurs as a kid,
but this is,

2362
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:41,224
you could,
you could go over these different 

2363
01:43:42,851 --> 01:43:44,530
sections of the earth.
Look here,

2364
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:47,030
we can look at the next one that comes 
10 minutes later.

2365
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,320
Maybe you won't think that one's fake.
Like,

2366
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,360
oh wow.
That was kind of ready.

2367
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,590
It's all fake.
It doesn't look fake to me.

2368
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:52,424
It looks like what the fucking earth 
probably looks like when you're 22,000 

2369
01:43:54,651 --> 01:43:55,800
miles away to you.

2370
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,800
It does not to me agreeing to disagree.
Yeah,

2371
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:04,880
but why think that it does?
Because I don't trust shit.

2372
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:05,743
Why think that?
I don't trust the government does make 

2373
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:11,040
these fake pictures of the earth.
Don't you think that would be that?

2374
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:12,830
We could speculate.
You want to speculate?

2375
01:44:12,831 --> 01:44:13,664
I mean I could show it.
I want to hear you speculate that it's 

2376
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:17,360
easier to control people when they on a 
ball.

2377
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,130
I've been trying to tell people that 
forever.

2378
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:20,870
I don't know.
Like we've got to live in a ball.

2379
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,793
I told it to my wife,
it's a very easy to get the kids to 

2380
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:23,774
listen.
I've just lived on a ball throw ball 

2381
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:28,200
house bull shit.
I don't know what to believe.

2382
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,800
I don't know what to believe.
That doesn't even make any sense.

2383
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:31,783
Why would it be easier to get people to 
listen if they're on a ball rather than 

2384
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:35,474
they fun a plate?

2385
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,790
Because if there's more land people 
gonna want to work,

2386
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:40,940
there's actually more land shit.
What do you mean it's more land?

2387
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:46,330
Who knows if you,
if you exactly what he talking about.

2388
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,960
I don't understand what you're talking 
about.

2389
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:48,794
Like more or less.
If the world is flat and the flat earth 

2390
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:52,800
model is true.
Okay,

2391
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,713
what's the point of it?
What's the point of so all the math is 

2392
01:44:56,901 --> 01:45:01,010
fake like that.
The Earth is going 24 hours in a circle.

2393
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:01,903
Is that all fake?
That it spins and thousand miles an 

2394
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:04,910
hour.
I don't.

2395
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,480
When you look into it works crash,
stationary,

2396
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,550
devin screws.
There's,

2397
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:09,403
if you look into the experiments,
if you look into the experiments to 

2398
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:14,960
prove that the earth is spinning,
all of them failed.

2399
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,170
Look into it.
We've been in doctor.

2400
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:17,991
No,
no,

2401
01:45:17,991 --> 01:45:18,830
no.
That's not true.

2402
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:19,610
That's not true.
Okay.

2403
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,200
I'm crazy.
I get it edited.

2404
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,033
What Jamie would going to say,
I don't have the science in my head to 

2405
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:25,250
back it up yet,
but that's not true.

2406
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:28,010
You can't say things like that.
That's what Eric Dubay says,

2407
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,873
and he's not backing it up.
Where's the evidence that find the 

2408
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:32,054
evidence kids in high school right now 
that can show you the evidence with 

2409
01:45:35,661 --> 01:45:39,430
science if you can't show it to me,
because I'm not in class right now.

2410
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,960
Just not up to date.
I'm doing jre work right now.

2411
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:44,950
You're talking about,
you're talking about some shit,

2412
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:47,480
but he,
you're saying I don't trust it.

2413
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:48,403
You're saying something that people have
been proving for hundreds and hundreds 

2414
01:45:51,831 --> 01:45:55,370
of Nicholas a Mickelson Morley 
experiments.

2415
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:56,373
That was,
uh,

2416
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:59,570
Einstein said it himself.
Einstein said to this day,

2417
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:00,940
Einstein said,
don't worry.

2418
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:02,420
No,
we're moving.

2419
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,630
Did you guys just have them do it?
That's all it is.

2420
01:46:04,631 --> 01:46:06,860
You're watching videos.
There's a difference.

2421
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,810
You looking into it and watching youtube
videos,

2422
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:09,943
so,
so let's say this offer the same 

2423
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,143
channel.
What if it's true that Albert Einstein 

2424
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:17,294
said,
there is no evidence that the earth is 

2425
01:46:19,641 --> 01:46:20,700
spinning.
Would it be safe?

2426
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:22,040
He said,
of course.

2427
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,900
You said that's not true.
I saw it on Youtube,

2428
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:26,720
but what if we find out that it is true?
Then what?

2429
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:30,730
What if they find out leprechauns are 
really but fucking genius.

2430
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,860
And I thought that's what I said.
So you're saying,

2431
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,980
Oh,
do you really look at what may be a 1947

2432
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:40,304
there wasn't much evidence of the Earth 
is spinning because they didn't 

2433
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:42,530
understand it yet.
Okay.

2434
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:45,980
When we talking about something that 
happened more than a half a century ago,

2435
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,630
Einstein is,
look,

2436
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:49,800
he compare all the people that are alive
today,

2437
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:49,980
whether

2438
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,770
it's Lawrence Krauss or Stephen 
Hawking's,

2439
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,090
most famous field

2440
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:57,160
pyramid.
What does this experiment it was under?

2441
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,043
Couldn't recreate it.
It was an 1880s I looked this up and I 

2442
01:47:00,051 --> 01:47:02,610
was watching 5 cents.
[inaudible] know what he just said?

2443
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:05,460
No already.
Exactly.

2444
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:08,100
You keep using that.
Look at the Mickelson like experiments.

2445
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:10,170
I did.
I read up the information on it.

2446
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:12,900
It's an experiment that was supposed to 
be able to be recreated.

2447
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,793
It was not able to be recreated so that 
evidence is used by flat earth 

2448
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,370
supporting people like you just said,
like go look it up.

2449
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:21,960
Go look it up.
Look it up.

2450
01:47:21,961 --> 01:47:23,100
Repeatable.
You can't repair it.

2451
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,170
You don't understand.
That's what you're saying.

2452
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:28,050
I'm trying to tell you that that's the 
evidence you trying to say.

2453
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,060
The experiment showed the earth is not 
spinning.

2454
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:34,060
No one can reproduce that experiment.
That's why it's not real.

2455
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:36,363
So this thing that you keep repeating is
bullshit and this thing that you keep 

2456
01:47:39,281 --> 01:47:41,530
her but don't know.
Where did you get this information?

2457
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:44,530
Jet Shamey where'd you get it?
Where do I get what?

2458
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,090
This information.
What does this come from?

2459
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,910
This is coming off the Internet.
Exactly.

2460
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:51,090
Americans information I'm reading.
Some of them

2461
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:55,963
slowly stopped their sources here.
There's a book called the American 

2462
01:47:58,690 --> 01:47:59,523
Journal of Science.
I'm sure that

2463
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:03,150
which is bought and paid for.
Well maybe it is.

2464
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:04,880
It's part of it.
Here's the thing,

2465
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:05,714
Eddie wiped the Washington Post.
Why would anybody be paying money for 

2466
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:09,264
people to lie about the world at a set 
of very good question that everybody 

2467
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:14,124
asks coming in.
Everybody on stat clinic group have a 

2468
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,960
seat.
They're not,

2469
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:25,350
they're not huge.
Not getting knocked down.

2470
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,273
That's why we just read this thing that 
you've been siting and you didn't even 

2471
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:30,920
understand it when we were reading it.
You read off how Internet,

2472
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,763
but that's how I read many books here.
We're both getting our information off 

2473
01:48:39,691 --> 01:48:40,524
the Internet.
So you were saying is peer reviewed 

2474
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:45,760
journals from sign from American journal
offense.

2475
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:46,790
Come on.
And that is also,

2476
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:51,600
that's like economists.
So you think it's more likely,

2477
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:55,710
more likely that everyone is in on it 
and lying than it is.

2478
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,633
One guy doesn't know what the fuck he's 
talking about and it makes a youtube 

2479
01:48:58,651 --> 01:48:59,484
video and you get convinced and it's 
attractive to you because it seems like 

2480
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,010
it would be an amazing conspiracy to be 
ahead of,

2481
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,083
and you get trapped in the fucking 
rabbit hole and you'd go down to flat 

2482
01:49:08,821 --> 01:49:11,850
earth rabbit hole and you find yourself 
defending things with experiments or you

2483
01:49:11,851 --> 01:49:12,684
don't even understand,
which means you have some shit that he 

2484
01:49:14,911 --> 01:49:17,870
pulled up off the internet and I know 
you like all over.

2485
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,160
I know you didn't understand.
You understand.

2486
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,850
Explain it to you twice.
It doesn't matter.

2487
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:21,773
But I understood it and he had explained
it to you twice and you didn't 

2488
01:49:23,761 --> 01:49:24,790
understand that you are.
No,

2489
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:25,320
no,
no,

2490
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:25,591
no,
no.

2491
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:27,370
This is the proof.
Now I understand it.

2492
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:31,260
There was an experiment to prove that 
the earth wasn't moving.

2493
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:33,960
It was nothing.
And then they proved it,

2494
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:35,490
but no,
but no,

2495
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:36,330
they did.
No,

2496
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:36,601
no,
no,

2497
01:49:36,601 --> 01:49:37,321
no,
no,

2498
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:37,710
no.
I get,

2499
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:38,543
they didn't prove it,
but that doesn't mean that it's 

2500
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:41,100
spinning.
Oh,

2501
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:41,934
Jamie,
I'm sure you can find some evidence of 

2502
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,440
the Earth is spinning.
Eddie,

2503
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,750
people who have known.
It's spinning forever.

2504
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:47,450
That's how you,
that's how the seasons work.

2505
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,630
That's how you see the sun.
We spin around.

2506
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:52,960
That's why it makes a claim.
That's why you can track time zones.

2507
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:53,853
That's why he could put a piece of stick
in the ground asking all the actions 

2508
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,870
that it acts as a Sundial.

2509
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,393
You're saying all the Shit Eddie.
There's where would set has a 

2510
01:50:02,351 --> 01:50:05,290
fundamental problem with the way you 
approach these things.

2511
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:08,440
No problem.
The problem is you do,

2512
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:11,410
but it's not that I trust Shit Eddie,
you know I don't trust you.

2513
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,290
I don't.
It doesn't matter.

2514
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:17,830
It doesn't matter.
That's a flat around all back.

2515
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:20,350
You keep saying that it's a bad fall 
back because what I'm,

2516
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,090
what we're saying is there are 
conspiracies.

2517
01:50:22,091 --> 01:50:24,370
The problem is when you think everything
is conspiracy,

2518
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,383
you act as a cyop guy and you fuck 
people over that want to look at real 

2519
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:31,640
conspiracies because the real 
conspiracies,

2520
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:34,240
the Gulf of Tonkin.
That's what I thought too.

2521
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:38,170
Like the Gulf of Tonkin,
real operation,

2522
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:40,540
northwoods real things that really 
happened.

2523
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,700
When you look at those things and people
explore,

2524
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:43,271
then they go,
oh,

2525
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,440
I don't think they really killed 
Kennedy.

2526
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,240
Are you sure?
Why don't you look at this?

2527
01:50:46,241 --> 01:50:47,140
Look at this stuff.

2528
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,093
There's a lot of really crazy evidence 
when you start thinking that the world 

2529
01:50:52,391 --> 01:50:54,160
is flat,
the dinosaurs aren't real,

2530
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,083
all this nutty shit that you believe and
you just jump into it with the problem 

2531
01:50:58,901 --> 01:50:59,734
is it discredits all these other things 
that you believe that might be real 

2532
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,980
because the other things have some 
validity to that.

2533
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:08,080
You just haven't looked into it.
That's all I used to say.

2534
01:51:08,081 --> 01:51:09,610
The Sandy,
you're talking about the earth.

2535
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,313
I'm signing the same thing.
You can do what you think they're all 

2536
01:51:12,521 --> 01:51:14,230
wrong.
That's so insane.

2537
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:15,730
You haven't looked into it.
I have like,

2538
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,700
oh my God,
how could I not have?

2539
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,653
You don't think I have.
I'm watching you go down the rabbit 

2540
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:22,144
hole.
You don't think I've tried to pay 

2541
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:23,800
attention to what the fuck these people 
are talking about.

2542
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,740
It doesn't work.
I don't think so at any there's websites

2543
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:27,850
dedicated to debunking.

2544
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,770
It is dedicated to showing you the 
science,

2545
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:33,730
showing you the math you can do when you
check the internet.

2546
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:35,530
It's valid,
but when I'm on the Internet,

2547
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:37,240
it's not,
you're not talking about the internet,

2548
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:38,860
you're talking about Ah,
guys.

2549
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:39,850
Youtube.
No,

2550
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:41,860
it's a guy.
There's a lot of guys,

2551
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:44,210
there's a lot of people,
but they're just youtube videos.

2552
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:49,580
No science behind them and is not 
verified by peer review journals.

2553
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:50,913
The science of the Earth,
the Saudi government science that's 

2554
01:51:53,261 --> 01:51:55,180
bought and paid for.
Of course,

2555
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:59,620
you started talking about this,
so on the sizing third is flat.

2556
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,940
I didn't say that.
I said,

2557
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,013
I don't know if it's flat or round.
When I see a picture of earth from 

2558
01:52:05,171 --> 01:52:07,540
space,
what we're sitting on from space.

2559
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:09,910
When I see a real picture,
then we'll have the proof.

2560
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,890
I'm just saying we don't need to have 
neuro that it's round.

2561
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:12,723
No,
we're looking at pictures while we're 

2562
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:14,830
sitting here.
Okay.

2563
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:15,664
You,
you're not even taking into 

2564
01:52:15,971 --> 01:52:20,080
consideration the fact that this is a 
monitor that you look at this,

2565
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:20,530
you're not,
it's,

2566
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:22,240
you don't even get like the high 
resolution.

2567
01:52:22,241 --> 01:52:24,490
I mean they must be gigantic files that 
they get.

2568
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:25,324
You would never be able to see him and 
their actual resolution on a regular 

2569
01:52:27,431 --> 01:52:28,264
monitor in the first place.
You're talking about a photo of the 

2570
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:30,183
earth photo of the Earth from 22,000 
miles away and they take one every 

2571
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:37,951
fucking,
the only way you might look cgi to you,

2572
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:39,680
you'd have to jump in a shape.
We,

2573
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,440
your side could be wrong.
It could be real.

2574
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,650
Too many things could be real,
but they've been faking them so much.

2575
01:52:44,651 --> 01:52:48,800
They look like all those other things.
I've seen so many fake ones that NASA,

2576
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:50,570
a mitts that they're CGI composites.

2577
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,880
There's so many out there,
so when you see this one,

2578
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:55,290
it's like this is the same one I've seen
so many.

2579
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,590
This is another one.
Posits is different.

2580
01:52:58,330 --> 01:52:59,300
I don't believe that.
Eddie,

2581
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:01,880
please,
when you take one of these photos,

2582
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:02,840
these,
what are those calls?

2583
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:05,330
When you fucking do that,
when you do that,

2584
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:06,850
you know what that is?
That's a composite.

2585
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:09,430
You're taking a bunch of photographs and
they piece them all together.

2586
01:53:09,431 --> 01:53:10,264
It makes one enormous photo.
When you see these photos from space of 

2587
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:17,300
the earth from a closer saddle I knob 
the nasa one that Jamie just pulled up,

2588
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:20,210
which does show a full full size image 
of the earth.

2589
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:23,240
What you're seeing is they take a photo,
they take it on the front and they piece

2590
01:53:23,241 --> 01:53:24,920
them all together.
There's no scenes.

2591
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:26,210
It's a composite.
Composite?

2592
01:53:26,230 --> 01:53:26,570
No,
no.

2593
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:30,480
There's an actual CGI artists put them 
together.

2594
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:33,410
It colors everything.
Eddie,

2595
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:37,580
is this CGI quick question for you,
is this CGI because it's,

2596
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:38,773
it was made in a computer and it fits 
the definition of computer generated 

2597
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:45,250
image because that's the compass one 
could easily mean you made this.

2598
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,030
I'll show you.
No,

2599
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:47,271
no,
no.

2600
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:50,210
I'm just saying,
but this could be easily a real picture,

2601
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:53,540
but it is a real picture,
but that's not a hard picture.

2602
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:54,374
Where I wasn't sure of earth from space.
That's where I physically was on the 

2603
01:53:57,231 --> 01:54:00,020
ground in New York City had take that 
with the camera I was using.

2604
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:04,220
That building would not fit in my lens.
I wasn't far enough away,

2605
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:06,110
but that's not what they're saying 
they're doing.

2606
01:54:06,111 --> 01:54:08,870
They're saying they take strips.
That's what they're saying they do.

2607
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,033
They're saying,
I'm going to show you a video of the 

2608
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:13,640
artists who actually did the latest one.
They go,

2609
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:15,970
oh NASA,
here's the guy who did the latest house.

2610
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,040
Tell us what to look at it.
It's awesome video.

2611
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:19,183
Just put NASA artist a CGI picture of 
earth and you're going to hear him 

2612
01:54:24,411 --> 01:54:26,020
talking and he says it did his 
photoshop.

2613
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:26,863
It is,
it is photoshop but it has to be fought 

2614
01:54:28,001 --> 01:54:29,680
a shot.
He says that word for it.

2615
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,620
Can you do,
I was asking you to clarify that.

2616
01:54:33,621 --> 01:54:35,720
I'm trying to tell you that that's what 
I literally had to do.

2617
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:36,583
I had to have been farther away to get 
the photo and one photo of that giant 

2618
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:41,654
building,
but that where I have in order to get 

2619
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:44,534
that distance away coloring with CGI,
there were buildings in a way you're 

2620
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,810
saying it and photoshop.
I put his stuff,

2621
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,110
he's going through the video going,
I got it.

2622
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:52,953
Cause I got,
I was sometimes I put green shades here 

2623
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,120
and I kind of,
I'm not an astronaut,

2624
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,110
I never been to space.

2625
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:58,750
So I have to kind of use my imagination 
to,

2626
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:03,860
to get the taking black whites almost 
picture that NASA releases of earth.

2627
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:06,140
Here's the latest one.
Real nice and tight.

2628
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:08,180
This that day that's a little 
exaggerated.

2629
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:10,040
The dark,
they weren't that dark in real life.

2630
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:11,480
The brights aren't that bright and real 
life.

2631
01:55:11,481 --> 01:55:12,980
So yes,
I added color to it.

2632
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:15,490
I did some artistry to it,
but that's bull shit.

2633
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,760
So we got the fucking building looks 
like,

2634
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:19,150
Oh okay.
Now find that.

2635
01:55:19,151 --> 01:55:23,540
And then the CGI bucketing anything.
Do you believe anything?

2636
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,090
I believe shit that I can prove for 
myself.

2637
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,450
Like I believe the science in like a 
skyscraper,

2638
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:32,060
skyscraper it standing there.
That's true.

2639
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,953
But how am I believe in that?
I have you looked into like the science 

2640
01:55:35,271 --> 01:55:36,104
of space travel?
How much have you looked at how much 

2641
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:40,460
work was done to try to put satellites 
into orbit?

2642
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:43,170
So you'd think we went to the moon.
That's not what I asked you.

2643
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,130
I said,
how much

2644
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,530
did you look in it?
We went to the moon.

2645
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:48,540
Heti answer my fucking talk.
Ridiculous.

2646
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:51,480
[inaudible] circle you talking in 
circles.

2647
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:54,510
They're ridiculous conversations.
Everything is the government,

2648
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:55,440
the government,
the government,

2649
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:57,980
the government's fake pictures.
While I'm just asking you a question,

2650
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:01,140
punch up NASA.
CGI artists.

2651
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:03,110
Picture of earth.
I don't see that up there head.

2652
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:03,983
He's so crazy.
Would you like me to click on any of 

2653
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,040
them?
That one right there.

2654
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:11,640
The second one right there.
I mean,

2655
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,770
I just listened to him talk.
Well,

2656
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:18,840
it's going to get more.
No guys,

2657
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:19,793
Jeff [inaudible] today I want to share 
with you this article that's going to 

2658
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:23,580
seem,
are we allowed to play?

2659
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:24,543
This guy isn't a scientist or are we 
listening to him or the the guy that 

2660
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:28,584
made the video.
You said we're gonna listen to a 

2661
01:56:29,461 --> 01:56:30,840
scientist.
Well,

2662
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:33,010
it looked like the right video.
I,

2663
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:33,853
I dunno,
look,

2664
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,910
but that is the guy that is the artist 
and he has,

2665
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:36,744
this is the,
that's a picture of the video talking 

2666
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:44,190
about how he created the latest picture 
of earth for NASA.

2667
01:56:44,191 --> 01:56:45,780
Okay,
so they're celebrating

2668
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:48,280
Goddard.
It's from the goddard webpage.

2669
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:51,180
So he's doing a recap of something 
that's written on the God or webpage.

2670
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,253
So go to the God or web page,
find that guys page Robert Simmons 

2671
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:55,860
Photoshop.
There it was,

2672
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and we'll see what he's actually saying.
Is that a picture?

2673
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:06,163
What do you think is the most 
interesting that your role here at 

2674
01:57:07,191 --> 01:57:09,470
Goddard?
How do you help support God's mission?

2675
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,310
My role is to make imagery from earth 
scientists.

2676
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:15,020
Science is data.
I turned data into pictures.

2677
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:17,130
I look for new interesting events that 
nat NASA,

2678
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:20,630
NASA satellites have seen or that are 
hidden in the latest data.

2679
01:57:20,631 --> 01:57:24,470
Define anything interesting that shows 
off NASA is unique capabilities.

2680
01:57:24,471 --> 01:57:25,304
Finding things is the fun part.
I rely on engineers and scientists to 

2681
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:29,900
produce the data.
They're reliable.

2682
01:57:29,901 --> 01:57:34,360
Real time stream of 1.7 terabytes a day.
Holy Shit is incredible tale.

2683
01:57:34,370 --> 01:57:38,420
About the same as producing 3000 cds a 
day.

2684
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:39,283
We know where to look for the 
interesting stuff because each 

2685
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:45,230
instrument provides a very specialized 
type of information.

2686
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,060
So if I'm looking for something 
specific,

2687
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,710
I know where to look.
For example,

2688
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,930
recently there was a volcanic eruption 
in the Red Sea.

2689
01:57:50,931 --> 01:57:53,330
The only reliable imagery of this was 
from NASA satellites.

2690
01:57:53,331 --> 01:57:55,910
We basically confirmed the existence of 
a new island.

2691
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,680
Okay,
so where's the,

2692
01:57:57,681 --> 01:58:00,170
let's get to some photoshop shit.
The one where he's talking.

2693
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,093
Okay,
but this guy's talking about science 

2694
01:58:01,821 --> 01:58:03,800
here.
Like some of the science has to be real,

2695
01:58:03,801 --> 01:58:04,550
right,
Eddie?

2696
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:06,620
Like there has to be some subtle,
it's like direct TV.

2697
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:07,970
Direct TV is not fake,
right?

2698
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:09,750
Um,
I don't know.

2699
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,300
I don't know.
But you could do all that with land line

2700
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:13,134
stuff.
You don't need to go bounce anything 

2701
01:58:14,101 --> 01:58:15,370
from space.
You could do audio,

2702
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:16,953
wouldn't you?
You could just put it in space and it 

2703
01:58:17,681 --> 01:58:19,930
just broadcast and shoot it up there and
shoot it back.

2704
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,670
Why would you lie about that?
I mean,

2705
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,250
there's a ton of fucking space.
Junk

2706
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:29,080
satellite,
no faith for satellites,

2707
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,140
no pays for satellites.
The taxpayer.

2708
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:32,080
They,
they get bills.

2709
01:58:32,081 --> 01:58:34,240
We need nude telecommunication 
satellite.

2710
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:36,880
We got to throw it up there so you don't
need $35 million.

2711
01:58:36,881 --> 01:58:37,714
Don't think Niko.
Yeah.

2712
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,620
Okay.
We're going to sign it.

2713
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:41,830
They get the money to tax scam.
You don't think are real?

2714
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,670
I don't think so.
Well,

2715
01:58:43,671 --> 01:58:45,180
Jesus Christ.
I don't think so.

2716
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:46,090
Well,
what's happening?

2717
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,313
What about,
what are those things up there that you 

2718
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:50,860
can watch from the ground?
Have you ever seen the space station fly

2719
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:52,000
over head?
You could see it.

2720
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,280
They can in.
I have pictures of it.

2721
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:55,114
They timed it.
They told me it was going to be 

2722
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:56,740
overhead.
I took a picture of it.

2723
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,050
Everyone was in a high altitude plane.
What's the difference?

2724
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,780
Why would they do that?
Why would they lie?

2725
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:06,340
Why would they pretend it's a space?
How high do airplanes go?

2726
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:09,700
30,000 feet.
Right now they can go hire 59 or 50 plus

2727
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:14,680
commercial airplanes on average,
somewhere in the 30s 30 35,000 right.

2728
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,250
When you're on the ground,
early sealing at 30,000 feet,

2729
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:19,323
barely fucking.
When you're in 30,000 feet and you'd 

2730
01:59:20,851 --> 01:59:21,684
look down,
you wouldn't be able to see a god damn 

2731
01:59:23,351 --> 01:59:24,550
it's true bus or a plane.

2732
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:28,840
Now those satellites are supposed to be 
like a hundred miles up.

2733
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:32,320
Think about that because they're in 
space and there a light.

2734
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:35,230
There are very small pinprick of light 
that moves across the sky.

2735
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:37,090
You could see him with optics.
You want to,

2736
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,083
okay,
but you really haven't looked and you 

2737
01:59:38,711 --> 01:59:39,544
definitely haven't looked with optics.
If you look with like a big spotting 

2738
01:59:41,531 --> 01:59:42,364
scope,
these people get these telescopes and 

2739
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:44,800
they look up and they know exactly 
what's going to be.

2740
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:46,570
You can actually program it into the 
telescope.

2741
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,643
There's things that you can download 
where you could find the coordinates of 

2742
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:50,524
itch into each individual planning the 
way that really super powerful 

2743
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:53,614
telescopes.
You said a amateur astronomers like to 

2744
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:55,714
use you in the key numbers and it'll 
move specifically to a spot in the sky 

2745
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:00,933
where you can tune in to the moon or 
tune into Saturn or into very specific 

2746
02:00:05,351 --> 02:00:06,610
areas of the cosmos.

2747
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:09,580
That change all the time because of the 
fact that the earth is spinning.

2748
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:11,470
We're catching all sorts of different 
shit,

2749
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,760
all,
all sorts of different times.

2750
02:00:12,761 --> 02:00:15,220
Especially no matter where you are,
if you're on the equator,

2751
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,440
you're looking at a totally different 
image,

2752
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:19,300
you know,
at one moment in the sky,

2753
02:00:19,301 --> 02:00:20,134
then you are the next moment so it can 
tell you exactly where the space 

2754
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:24,670
station's going to be,
where the moon's going to be,

2755
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:25,504
where Mars is going to be,
and they punch these coordinates into 

2756
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:30,040
these little computers and they all move
to this thing.

2757
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,230
I mean,
you believe the marvel Mars Rovers,

2758
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:33,064
real man Eddie,
I don't think I'm going to do this 

2759
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:37,870
anymore because it's just like,
I don't see why.

2760
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,720
First of all,
I don't see where's the money for.

2761
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:40,391
Then I'll say,
well,

2762
02:00:40,391 --> 02:00:41,224
hold on a second.
I don't see where the money is to have 

2763
02:00:42,941 --> 02:00:46,700
all these hoaxes that you don't see the 
tax scam with the rovers land,

2764
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:47,980
the,
they get the,

2765
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:52,150
they just got nine NASA got $19 billion,
uh,

2766
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:55,240
for trump gave him $19 billion.

2767
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,720
What tells me possible so that they can 
actually make a rover.

2768
02:00:58,750 --> 02:00:59,583
Tell me what,
tell me what the space shuttle has done 

2769
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:03,154
for humanity.
Tell me all that money that was wasted 

2770
02:01:04,931 --> 02:01:06,280
on spacial and then they just trashed 
it.

2771
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,293
They went up,
I don't know how many times and then 

2772
02:01:08,111 --> 02:01:08,944
they just trashed it.
I don't tell him how all those billions 

2773
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:13,600
of dollars has helped humanity.
Tell me,

2774
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,553
well,
I think scientific innovation is very 

2775
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:21,490
important to us because in our minds we 
constantly want newer bed,

2776
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:23,630
better,
more innovative technologies.

2777
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:26,950
Just a part of being a person in the 
21st century what everybody wants.

2778
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,053
Everybody wants a new computer,
everybody wants new things and a lot of 

2779
02:01:30,131 --> 02:01:32,950
this new stuff comes from NASA 
technology.

2780
02:01:32,951 --> 02:01:37,060
It comes from all the science and 
innovation that goes names a part of me.

2781
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:40,130
There's a list right there.
Why

2782
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,110
do you say this when you don't look into
it?

2783
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:45,050
I just love telling highway safety.
How does that,

2784
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:46,520
how can we can read that down?
Hires,

2785
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:48,290
how can that,
how can we can caddy,

2786
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:49,124
but the,
the massive requirements that you have 

2787
02:01:52,011 --> 02:01:55,190
on the gear when you're talking about 
going through fucking space,

2788
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:56,233
the insane stress of reentry,
they figured out all kinds of crazy 

2789
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:02,000
shit.
The speed in which you land,

2790
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:05,060
they figured out a bunch of crazy shit 
and rich baby food,

2791
02:02:05,061 --> 02:02:06,800
I mean portable,
cordless vacuums,

2792
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:09,440
freeze drying technology.
All of this comes from space.

2793
02:02:09,441 --> 02:02:11,060
There's a shit load of things that they 
figured out.

2794
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,013
Harnessing solar energy.
There's a lot of innovation that comes 

2795
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,313
from the development of either the space
station or the shuttles or a bunch of 

2796
02:02:19,671 --> 02:02:20,504
different things that they've invented 
and they continue to innovate these 

2797
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:24,260
things,
these new satellites,

2798
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:26,660
the shooting on the space are way better
than the humble.

2799
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:30,050
They keep doing more and more,
better and better,

2800
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:33,530
and it's this constant rush to see who 
can get to the,

2801
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:37,520
the furthest point of technology in 
whatever field they're in,

2802
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:41,270
whether it's the field of rocketry,
whether it's the field of satellites,

2803
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,373
there's this massive amount of 
competition between the top scientists 

2804
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:47,870
in the world and to think that that's 
all fake.

2805
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:49,013
Does it make any sense?
Because there are some things that are 

2806
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:54,500
fake.
So why assume that all this is fake when

2807
02:02:54,501 --> 02:02:55,334
you really could see the challenger,
you saw the challenger explode in the 

2808
02:02:57,741 --> 02:02:59,150
sky.
If it's fake,

2809
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:01,820
no one was there to engineer the shit 
that failed.

2810
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:03,020
Who said that was framed?
Well,

2811
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:04,040
any of it,
any of it,

2812
02:03:04,041 --> 02:03:07,610
any space travel because it's going up.
So high altitude,

2813
02:03:07,611 --> 02:03:09,720
you know,
the space shuttle goes up and they'd use

2814
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:10,633
work on fucking satellites.
I do know that the space station video 

2815
02:03:15,051 --> 02:03:20,051
that sheldon and amy hit it,
they do this.

2816
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:22,063
The problem is,
is a lot of these things that you just 

2817
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:27,020
automatically want to fake six moon 
missions.

2818
02:03:27,021 --> 02:03:28,820
Dude,
of course that on trust shows,

2819
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:33,680
even if that was true,
those are people in 1969 they're not the

2820
02:03:33,681 --> 02:03:34,930
same humans.
Uh,

2821
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:37,160
so some people,
they're not the same human beings.

2822
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:41,990
That's just like saying that the people 
who made the movies in 1969 are the same

2823
02:03:41,991 --> 02:03:45,350
people that made fast and furious eight 
is that's what they make the movies.

2824
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,960
They're not the same people.
They're totally different humans.

2825
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:53,080
It's like saying the standup comedians 
from 1969 but the same as the one nine 6

2826
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:55,173
million missions.
How am I supposed to believe those are 

2827
02:03:56,031 --> 02:03:58,190
not the same people?
Even if that was true,

2828
02:03:58,191 --> 02:04:00,710
there's not the same people in rich.
Richard Nixon isn't alive anymore.

2829
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:02,540
Just write them all off though.
Eddie just off.

2830
02:04:02,650 --> 02:04:03,680
Got To prove that to me.

2831
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:04,850
I don't need to believe,
hey,

2832
02:04:04,851 --> 02:04:07,810
but don't need to believe it.
How's it going to add on?

2833
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:09,140
Believe it,
but if it's true,

2834
02:04:09,141 --> 02:04:09,801
I don't give a shit.
Okay.

2835
02:04:09,801 --> 02:04:10,581
It's true.
Oh,

2836
02:04:10,581 --> 02:04:11,510
that's true.
Okay,

2837
02:04:11,511 --> 02:04:12,344
but you got to prove it to me.
Otherwise the problem isn't die handled 

2838
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:16,723
the product.
The problem is there's no proven it and 

2839
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:21,230
you want to always assume that it's 
fake.

2840
02:04:21,231 --> 02:04:22,064
You don't have like this empty,
prove it to me like I'm not assuming 

2841
02:04:24,171 --> 02:04:25,004
either way.
You're assuming it's fake every time 

2842
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:29,330
they faked six moon mission,
but it doesn't matter.

2843
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:32,420
These are not the same people living in 
a different type of people they want,

2844
02:04:32,421 --> 02:04:34,370
they're not going to add all those 
standard logic.

2845
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,590
The logic is just because someone fakes 
something,

2846
02:04:37,591 --> 02:04:40,050
one point in time before you were all 
alive,

2847
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:41,223
doesn't mean that those same human 
beings ever managed to download their 

2848
02:04:45,241 --> 02:04:47,190
brains.
And everybody that ever did that job for

2849
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:49,560
the rest of time,
because they're not the same humans,

2850
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:53,070
but so the scientists that are today,
the generations later,

2851
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:56,100
whether it's NASA or these Japanese 
scientists or the Russians,

2852
02:04:56,101 --> 02:04:56,934
the Chinese,
whoever the fuck is putting satellites 

2853
02:04:57,901 --> 02:04:58,734
and rockets into space,
they're not the same people from 1969 

2854
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:03,270
you can't like look at them.
It's like in one ad,

2855
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:04,170
one blanket,
or

2856
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:06,690
I can't,
I can't blame NASA.

2857
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:09,380
1969 Vena NASA,
uh,

2858
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,233
Warner von Braun at Nazi.
I can't blame today's NASA for all the 

2859
02:05:14,351 --> 02:05:15,930
lies from,
is that what you're saying?

2860
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:16,783
From the early seventies I'm saying,
do you believe that the space shuttles 

2861
02:05:20,201 --> 02:05:21,070
were real?
No.

2862
02:05:21,071 --> 02:05:22,570
I do believe the spacial Israel.
Why?

2863
02:05:22,571 --> 02:05:27,571
Just that I've saw plenty of video of 
them and then they take it on.

2864
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,220
That's it.
Everything else is bullshit.

2865
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:31,703
No,
they made the Saturn five rockets and 

2866
02:05:32,501 --> 02:05:33,281
they launched him.
Okay.

2867
02:05:33,281 --> 02:05:34,810
So do you know where they went into 
orbit?

2868
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,600
I don't know when the orbiter,
I don't know how high,

2869
02:05:36,690 --> 02:05:38,080
how high people are going.
I don't know.

2870
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:39,003
I'm not sure.
Don't know.

2871
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:40,870
I know they're going high,
but I don't know how high.

2872
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:43,000
So why would you assume that any of it 
is fake?

2873
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:44,740
They fake six moon missions.
Okay.

2874
02:05:44,741 --> 02:05:45,501
You keep saying that.
No,

2875
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:46,270
but that's why.

2876
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,103
Yeah,
but we're not talking about the same 

2877
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:49,050
people at ea,
but that's,

2878
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,220
but it doesn't matter.
It's the same organization.

2879
02:05:51,221 --> 02:05:52,054
The problem is worse today.
Turn them into va as soon as you say 

2880
02:05:54,731 --> 02:05:57,190
they,
but now let me ask you something.

2881
02:05:57,790 --> 02:06:00,360
Let me ask you a Brendan,
do you see that?

2882
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:01,273
That how I can't trust NASA because even
though it was different people in 1969 

2883
02:06:06,131 --> 02:06:06,964
to 1973,
even though the p the massive today 

2884
02:06:10,721 --> 02:06:11,554
aren't the ones that fake six moon 
missions and stole billions of dollars 

2885
02:06:14,531 --> 02:06:17,830
from American taxpayer,
just because the guys from today,

2886
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:20,650
somehow they got weeded out.
And then NASA,

2887
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:22,180
I don't know that they got weeded out 
in,

2888
02:06:22,181 --> 02:06:23,780
in Nasa came this,
uh,

2889
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:24,663
honest agency of the government.
But I don't know that I'm going to 

2890
02:06:27,101 --> 02:06:29,800
assume,
I'm going to assume no,

2891
02:06:29,801 --> 02:06:30,640
I think you're the,
you're,

2892
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,030
it's still part of the shit.
I could be wrong.

2893
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:34,953
I couldn't be wrong.
You're good.

2894
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,990
Let's say those six missions were all 
bullshit and it was fake.

2895
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:41,110
You're going off the exception,
not the general rule.

2896
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:43,540
So it's like me coming into your academy
and some guy's a dick.

2897
02:06:43,541 --> 02:06:45,640
I'm like all those 10th planet guys are 
Dicks.

2898
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,340
Like you're just lumping all them in the
same fucking,

2899
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:49,553
that was a big shit though.
It wasn't like side project mass 

2900
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:54,660
employees to roadmap.
This is no,

2901
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:56,200
I understand you saying the same thing 
he said.

2902
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,960
He's saying that just because,
dude,

2903
02:06:59,090 --> 02:06:59,923
that was the mood swings were so 
gigantic and so global and the greatest 

2904
02:07:05,441 --> 02:07:10,441
achievement of mankind and they don't 
even have the records anymore.

2905
02:07:11,050 --> 02:07:12,010
Joe,
you know what I'm talking about?

2906
02:07:12,011 --> 02:07:13,330
We're talking about this earlier,
man.

2907
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:15,820
You were talking about this early.
You know all that moon,

2908
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,460
you're not immature.
Data's missing.

2909
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:20,590
They had an awesome video says,
he says,

2910
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:22,240
yeah,
we don't have it.

2911
02:07:22,241 --> 02:07:23,800
It's missing.
Or maybe it's stolen,

2912
02:07:23,801 --> 02:07:27,670
but even if we did the head of NASA,
even if we did have the tapes,

2913
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:30,880
we don't have the machines to play him 
anymore,

2914
02:07:30,881 --> 02:07:32,770
so it really doesn't matter.
Come on,

2915
02:07:32,771 --> 02:07:33,610
man.
Come on,

2916
02:07:33,611 --> 02:07:36,370
man.
Dumb retard

2917
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:39,790
detective on the planet would would be 
suspicious.

2918
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:42,600
That just smelled like mission,
but you can't just lump all,

2919
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:43,540
all,
it's all bullshit.

2920
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:45,520
Then everyone will the most.
You want to see some Brendan,

2921
02:07:45,521 --> 02:07:47,710
it'll make you think.
This is the most suspicious thing.

2922
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:48,843
One of the weirdest things about the 
moon landing is the post flight press 

2923
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:52,570
conference.
Have you ever seen it?

2924
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,660
It's really weird.
It's real weird.

2925
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:57,350
I mean they can swift.
They did.

2926
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:58,900
Well,
conspiracy,

2927
02:07:58,901 --> 02:07:59,830
hippo,
skeptical.

2928
02:07:59,831 --> 02:08:02,350
Hipaa goes,
what the fuck is going on?

2929
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,940
They're open to it because now you're 
going,

2930
02:08:04,941 --> 02:08:06,710
you're open to the fact that maybe the 
fuck I,

2931
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,553
I maybe they did fake that,
but you can't just lump sum and I'm 

2932
02:08:10,910 --> 02:08:14,690
saying they did the greatest achievement
of the time.

2933
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,780
We got new people now.
Come on,

2934
02:08:19,781 --> 02:08:20,770
man.
That's hilarious.

2935
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:23,113
How can,
how can you see how I can't trust shit 

2936
02:08:24,671 --> 02:08:29,230
from assets?
Maybe they would,

2937
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,070
they they,
they,

2938
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:30,903
you know,
all those bad people have died and 

2939
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:34,900
they're all old and the new NASA,
they're the good mass.

2940
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,573
They can't all,
but there was an agenda or believe in a 

2941
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:41,854
guy on youtube.
It says the world's flat and dinosaurs 

2942
02:08:43,391 --> 02:08:44,224
aren't real.
What's better if that was my space like 

2943
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:45,880
that,
it's,

2944
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,010
there's a lot of people saying it.
All those guys,

2945
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:49,720
there's a lot of people in mental 
institutions,

2946
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:50,583
a lot of people in jail.
So how do people that are child 

2947
02:08:51,761 --> 02:08:52,594
molesters?
There's a lot of people are racist 

2948
02:08:53,731 --> 02:08:54,600
people.
Those people,

2949
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:55,883
if you gave every racist person a video 
camera and put made them a youtube 

2950
02:08:58,331 --> 02:08:58,901
video,
you'll be like,

2951
02:08:58,901 --> 02:09:00,630
oh,
have you watched fit with races?

2952
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:02,800
Have you watched history of flat earth 
by Eric?

2953
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,280
Do I see that?

2954
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:13,500
Don't have an hour for that.
You're asking what is their side?

2955
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,210
What?
What does Eric do?

2956
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:19,870
I fourth grade,
my teacher,

2957
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:22,150
I know what you don't care and that's 
fine.

2958
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:23,830
I'm not going to be mad at you for not 
caring.

2959
02:09:23,850 --> 02:09:25,540
Of course.
Don't be mad at me for carrying.

2960
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:26,383
Then you don't look into what from mad 
cause you don't look into what 

2961
02:09:32,411 --> 02:09:34,510
scientists say.
You don't.

2962
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:39,511
You're just automatically dismiss that.
This fair to say the reason why you care

2963
02:09:39,851 --> 02:09:42,250
so much about Eddie believe in this shit
and you know Eddie going,

2964
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:47,251
I'm crazy cause he said he influences a 
lot of people and you to find enough for

2965
02:09:47,351 --> 02:09:49,750
yourself,
look for the truth and look into it like

2966
02:09:49,751 --> 02:09:50,584
uh,
like you're investigating and just look 

2967
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:54,850
into both sides.
There's a reason why it's becoming huge.

2968
02:09:54,851 --> 02:09:57,910
There's a reason because people don't 
really go to school.

2969
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:02,830
They don't learn astrophysics,
they don't study all these things.

2970
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:03,940
It's hard to learn.
The,

2971
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:07,840
the entry barrier is fucking huge.
If you want to study physics,

2972
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:10,780
you want to figure out,
I can barely pay attention to it.

2973
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:13,360
I listen to these books on tape and I 
have to go back over.

2974
02:10:13,361 --> 02:10:14,194
I'm three,
four times just to understand a 

2975
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:16,204
paragraph.
Try to figure out exactly what the fuck 

2976
02:10:17,951 --> 02:10:18,784
they're quantifying.
They're talking about really intense 

2977
02:10:20,111 --> 02:10:23,380
shit that thousands of people been 
working on in conjunction.

2978
02:10:23,381 --> 02:10:25,180
They all feed off of each other's 
innovation.

2979
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,860
There's so many people working on these 
things.

2980
02:10:26,861 --> 02:10:27,694
Eddie,
the idea that they're all in on some 

2981
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:32,350
sort of a giant global lie is insane.
Yeah.

2982
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,830
That's what everyone thinks.
Okay.

2983
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:36,621
There's no,
yeah,

2984
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:37,990
I mean it's,
there was no women.

2985
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:40,990
No,
there's no one in history of flat.

2986
02:10:40,991 --> 02:10:43,340
I was looking into it.
It definitely can't.

2987
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:48,341
So let me just say why I don't watch 
game of thrones.

2988
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,430
I don't watch breaking bad and better 
call Saul.

2989
02:10:55,610 --> 02:10:57,020
Nope.
What do you watch?

2990
02:10:57,110 --> 02:11:01,400
I watch real shit like first 48 and 
you're not talking about a show,

2991
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:04,100
but if you watch game of thrones,
he knows it's fake.

2992
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:08,780
It's fake.
But you don't,

2993
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,010
I,
I'm just having fun.

2994
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,420
What do you think?
Is the earth flat around?

2995
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:14,720
I don't know if it's flat around until 
we see a picture from space.

2996
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:17,850
They're saying this bitch could be 
squared be around.

2997
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:21,500
It could be willing to a big camera with
fish.

2998
02:11:21,501 --> 02:11:22,301
I fish.
I had done it.

2999
02:11:22,301 --> 02:11:24,380
You guys are fooled by the Fisheye Lens.
C'Mon man.

3000
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,293
Plenty of pictures without the Fisheye 
Lens that you could find this fish eye 

3001
02:11:28,591 --> 02:11:29,424
lens.
You guys buy some basic ass 

3002
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,050
kindergarten.
Do you understand perspective?

3003
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,480
Do you do it?
I do understand for PSI,

3004
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:38,480
if you didn't have a fish eye lens,
you looking at this tiny fraction of the

3005
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:42,370
surface,
the reason why you shied lens of 1946,

3006
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:43,610
how do you know that's real?

3007
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:46,760
Because it's a picture.
I ran it on the net.

3008
02:11:46,761 --> 02:11:51,761
That's why I know he's like this.
Would you,

3009
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:55,700
would you be,
it's real.

3010
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:59,510
That's real to Eddie.
Would you be open to talking to you care

3011
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:01,160
if you believe that's real?
I don't care.

3012
02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:04,670
Would you be taught in to talking to an 
actual astrophysicist?

3013
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:05,720
Yes.
I would love to.

3014
02:12:05,721 --> 02:12:07,490
Like what would you do if Neil degrasse 
Tyson was here?

3015
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:10,850
Same arguments.
You would have some questions.

3016
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:13,100
What would you listen to them?
Like if you had to be told you some shit

3017
02:12:13,101 --> 02:12:17,780
that actually made sense or would you 
just think he's in a total I round earth

3018
02:12:17,781 --> 02:12:19,370
society.
I think,

3019
02:12:19,371 --> 02:12:20,360
uh,
he's,

3020
02:12:20,361 --> 02:12:21,500
um,
you know,

3021
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,603
there's people that they push to be the 
spokespeople and there's really 

3022
02:12:25,551 --> 02:12:28,580
brilliant people that are good at 
talking and their educators like him.

3023
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,620
And then they get on television and 
people love it.

3024
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:34,050
And so he comes back and then he does a 
hit show called Cosmos or re-enacts.

3025
02:12:34,051 --> 02:12:36,380
But Carl Sagan show and everybody loves 
it.

3026
02:12:36,381 --> 02:12:39,440
And more people understand science now 
than ever before because he breaks.

3027
02:12:39,441 --> 02:12:40,310
It's hard.
Eddie,

3028
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:41,173
you know,
it's hard because you didn't go to 

3029
02:12:41,991 --> 02:12:43,820
school.
I'm not mad,

3030
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,350
but look,
I love you man.

3031
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:46,190
I love you.
You know,

3032
02:12:46,190 --> 02:12:47,420
I just don't want,
I'm just trying to,

3033
02:12:47,421 --> 02:12:48,254
I want to,
I want to be able to talk about flat 

3034
02:12:49,191 --> 02:12:50,024
earth and have fun cake,
but it's not fun for me because I think 

3035
02:12:52,041 --> 02:12:52,874
there's some 16 year old kids out there 
that are listening to this and they 

3036
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:56,010
think he makes sense.
And the problem is,

3037
02:12:56,011 --> 02:12:56,781
it's the,
what's wrong with that?

3038
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:58,220
Who cares about,
because those poor kids,

3039
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:00,470
what's happened to me?
Am I am I,

3040
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:02,500
my life was going to wasting time.
No,

3041
02:13:02,501 --> 02:13:02,910
it's heavy.

3042
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:04,380
You're waiting.
You're wasting time.

3043
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:06,050
You fucking come on,
come on.

3044
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:09,430
And he'd go down and shit that you would
consider a waste of time if you don't do

3045
02:13:09,431 --> 02:13:10,264
it.
If someone was all in the pool pool and 

3046
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:13,460
he was obsessed with poor,
you would say you're wasting your time.

3047
02:13:13,461 --> 02:13:14,790
What are you getting out of?
When I hit those?

3048
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:16,970
They're real.
They're real.

3049
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:18,830
Okay.
I hit those balls to go into the whole,

3050
02:13:18,831 --> 02:13:23,270
it takes skill and concentration and I,
it gives me something to occupy my mind.

3051
02:13:23,271 --> 02:13:26,210
It's a game.
It's a mind game and it's a body game.

3052
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:29,810
When you're watching a fake video the 
guy made about,

3053
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,010
you think it's fake nuclear not being 
real?

3054
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,170
I think it's fake.
Okay.

3055
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,090
That's what you think.
Okay.

3056
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:37,223
I mean I just feel like all the people 
that study it at all the universities 

3057
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:49,130
have come to a conclusion and then one 
guy makes a youtube video or 20 guys,

3058
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:52,570
they're saying a thousand Santos Bonacci
good.

3059
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:55,840
Why would you listen to them versus the 
ability to,

3060
02:13:55,841 --> 02:13:56,674
they have free cause generations after 
generations of studying the science 

3061
02:13:59,821 --> 02:14:01,350
behind it.
The science,

3062
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:03,720
there's a lot of repeatable science.
Right,

3063
02:14:03,721 --> 02:14:04,554
but you just told us about this one test
and you paired it out as some sort of a 

3064
02:14:08,041 --> 02:14:11,760
theory that we should look up and when 
we did it turns out it didn't even work.

3065
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,770
It wasn't repeated.
Okay,

3066
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,180
whatever.
Eddie,

3067
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:16,103
I love you,
but I don't like the way you approach 

3068
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:18,774
these things sometimes because I think 
it confuses the fuck out of people like 

3069
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:24,690
I was when I was young.
I was super gullible.

3070
02:14:24,691 --> 02:14:27,390
I believed all kinds of stupid shit and 
I wasted a ton of time.

3071
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,490
Like what?
Especially with successful guys,

3072
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:32,250
all these certain stuff,
goddamned Ufo people,

3073
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:33,020
man,
all those.

3074
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:34,560
I'll Ulu ufo stories that bought it.

3075
02:14:35,110 --> 02:14:35,943
I never got any,
have you ever heard of the law of 

3076
02:14:36,791 --> 02:14:37,830
perspective?
Yes.

3077
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:41,830
You know that's not real.
It's not a law went about it.

3078
02:14:41,890 --> 02:14:42,723
It's that that's the deaf.
They're giving the definition of what 

3079
02:14:44,171 --> 02:14:45,004
perspective is.
I'm trying to tell you though real 

3080
02:14:47,321 --> 02:14:49,780
quick.
There are laws of conservation of energy

3081
02:14:49,781 --> 02:14:50,614
and such in physics.
There are actual laws that they can be 

3082
02:14:52,721 --> 02:14:54,640
translated without even speaking 
language.

3083
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:58,540
It's math.
The law perspective is not one of those.

3084
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:00,543
What is it?
Tell me.

3085
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,040
It's just,
it's just the definition of perspective.

3086
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:05,440
I'm asking you what the law,
what is it?

3087
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:08,750
Cause it's not real well,
well maybe,

3088
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:11,230
maybe.
So you're saying there's no uh,

3089
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:12,303
love.
I'm saying it's not a law as definition 

3090
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:17,403
gravity.
It's a definition of the word 

3091
02:15:18,521 --> 02:15:20,950
perspective.
That's not a law.

3092
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:23,620
Well,
the law is a perspective.

3093
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:24,483
Are the Herat one of the laws is the 
perspective horizon not real to high 

3094
02:15:30,221 --> 02:15:30,530
level.

3095
02:15:30,530 --> 02:15:31,520
That's,
I love that.

3096
02:15:31,521 --> 02:15:34,630
That's not how it always happens.
Always happens.

3097
02:15:34,631 --> 02:15:35,860
Not a law,
but it always happens.

3098
02:15:35,861 --> 02:15:36,790
It's a law.
If it happens,

3099
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:38,710
that's not a law.
That's,

3100
02:15:38,711 --> 02:15:40,930
this is where you don't understand that 
part of the laws of science.

3101
02:15:40,931 --> 02:15:44,020
That's not a law.
That's a definition.

3102
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:46,930
Okay,
and then what is the definition?

3103
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:48,370
Definition of a noun?
It's a person,

3104
02:15:48,371 --> 02:15:50,260
place thing or idea.
That's not a law.

3105
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:52,240
Okay.
That's just the definition.

3106
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:54,343
You know what else is,
I used to call this double lotus for 

3107
02:15:57,881 --> 02:16:00,540
years and years and years.
And it's not double lotus.

3108
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:01,810
It's full load.
It's not a lot though.

3109
02:16:01,811 --> 02:16:03,400
Right?
But it's not,

3110
02:16:03,401 --> 02:16:04,840
it's not double load.
It's not a law.

3111
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:07,060
It's not double loaded.
That's what you're saying.

3112
02:16:07,061 --> 02:16:10,540
You're talking about a different word 
for the same moodle.

3113
02:16:10,990 --> 02:16:15,990
What he's saying perspective Stephanie 
Shot Better because hold on.

3114
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:20,350
It's the same thing because of whatever 
you call it.

3115
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:24,310
You got,
well when you look up this stuff online,

3116
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,890
I try to type in the law of perspective 
cause I wanted to see what your,

3117
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:27,753
what you and Eric Dubay believe.
That is the only thing I ever find with 

3118
02:16:32,111 --> 02:16:34,360
the law perspective is the word flat 
earth with it.

3119
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:35,853
Or maybe there's actually there are 
urban dictionary has a definition for 

3120
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:40,103
what does,
doesn't matter if it's law but it's not 

3121
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:49,150
the same manner but that,
but if the horizon always rises,

3122
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:53,500
that's not a [inaudible] uh,
uh,

3123
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:54,940
uh,
what would you call it then?

3124
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:55,793
Um,
you don't believe in gravity though 

3125
02:16:57,650 --> 02:16:59,980
thing of perspective.
I don't believe in gravity either.

3126
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:02,740
That falls at a constant of 9.8 meters 
per second.

3127
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,720
That is a,
that's a law of gravity.

3128
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:06,850
Gravity is a theory I had.
No,

3129
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:07,270
no,
no.

3130
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:09,100
You guys have this theory of what 
gravity is.

3131
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:11,590
Density,
but that's another scientific word.

3132
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:13,900
You guys said that if it's more dense it
falls,

3133
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:16,000
but why does it fall?
Why was it fall lower?

3134
02:17:16,001 --> 02:17:18,820
If it's heavier,
then why is it heavier?

3135
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,710
Do you know what?
Cause it's 10 [inaudible] shortfalls.

3136
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:26,410
A helium gas.
Helium was a gas.

3137
02:17:26,411 --> 02:17:31,240
We're only heavy then it's because of 
where it's lighter.

3138
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:32,980
It's less dense.
I'll explain.

3139
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:35,500
It's lighter because we're in the 
atmosphere of earth.

3140
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:37,510
Isn't it less dense than if we were in 
space?

3141
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:40,180
There is no atmosphere.
That's why everything floats.

3142
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:41,043
Gases and us were dense too,
but we would float in space just like 

3143
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:46,540
that.
We got in the space.

3144
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:47,800
You're correct.
If we got out there,

3145
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:51,280
so can we not go to space?
I don't know how far we can go up

3146
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,793
the space station.
You said the space shuttle went into 

3147
02:17:54,271 --> 02:17:55,104
orbit.

3148
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:58,400
I don't know how far I want to say hi.
I don't know where it went,

3149
02:17:58,401 --> 02:18:02,270
but I know it took off.
Saw that and then I see it landing.

3150
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:04,300
You see that more?
I went,

3151
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,020
you know when we heard the plane,
right?

3152
02:18:06,710 --> 02:18:07,543
For sure.
Are you not confused on what laws and 

3153
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:10,460
stuff science are though?
Do you not see that?

3154
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:11,720
Okay.
We'll call it definition,

3155
02:18:11,721 --> 02:18:13,220
but it's,
what do we call it?

3156
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:14,540
But that's not,
what do they call it?

3157
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:15,720
We'll call it whatever you want.
In science,

3158
02:18:15,721 --> 02:18:16,554
we call things laws.
We don't call them definitions and 

3159
02:18:18,231 --> 02:18:20,150
science.
There are laws because?

3160
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:22,310
Because so what does that,
that law,

3161
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:27,460
which is most of them called in those 
cases if hold on to,

3162
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,550
in most cases it's math,
the law so that that math,

3163
02:18:31,551 --> 02:18:36,380
then that formulaic equation can go to 
any country and work.

3164
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:38,630
I don't need to speak English to the guy
in Germany.

3165
02:18:38,631 --> 02:18:40,760
That to explain to them what I'm trying 
to get out of it,

3166
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:42,133
he can test it with the same things,
the same variables and get the same 

3167
02:18:44,391 --> 02:18:47,330
thing out of it.
That's why all these things are laws,

3168
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,390
not definitely Cleveland.
Thank you for clearing that up permit.

3169
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:53,270
Does that work?
Do you accept that or no?

3170
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:54,820
People

3171
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:55,653
use as verbose terminology because it 
makes him appear smarter than they 

3172
02:18:58,421 --> 02:19:00,850
really are.
No Eddie,

3173
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:01,743
and they tried to say it in a fancier 
way because they really didn't go to 

3174
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:04,924
school for this shit.
So they say a bunch of shit that's not 

3175
02:19:06,521 --> 02:19:08,890
real.
Like the law of perspective and it's not

3176
02:19:08,891 --> 02:19:09,724
a law and it belies the real problem.
They don't have an education in this 

3177
02:19:12,311 --> 02:19:14,020
stuff and they're just talking out of 
their ass.

3178
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:18,580
That's disrespectful,
disrespectful to the fucking generations

3179
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:20,740
of people that have been studying that 
their whole lives.

3180
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:21,723
That one guy can figure out all these 
different things that dinosaurs aren't 

3181
02:19:24,491 --> 02:19:26,410
real.
Nuclear bombs are real,

3182
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:28,220
the earth is flat.
It's ridiculous.

3183
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:30,770
It's ridiculous.
Satellites aren't real.

3184
02:19:30,771 --> 02:19:31,604
It's ridiculous.
It's one guy is this must be the 

3185
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:35,860
smartest person in the world.
Well,

3186
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:36,793
that one guy,
the guy that one guy that you're pals 

3187
02:19:38,091 --> 02:19:39,380
with,
the love that stuff,

3188
02:19:39,381 --> 02:19:42,230
that guys got videos on dinosaurs on the
fucking earth.

3189
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,260
He figured it all the time.
I had him on my podcast.

3190
02:19:45,490 --> 02:19:47,240
That's too much money.
He makes often flat earth.

3191
02:19:47,241 --> 02:19:48,074
I'd be interested to know that he's 
writing a lot of books off in a lot of 

3192
02:19:50,121 --> 02:19:51,010
youtube videos.
Know,

3193
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,950
isn't everybody making money as a NASA 
making billions and well,

3194
02:19:54,951 --> 02:19:55,784
he's got a youtube account.
NASA lied six times about the moon 

3195
02:20:01,251 --> 02:20:03,760
missions and cat don't believe he kept 
calling back from them.

3196
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:05,390
That's it,
but that's the root of it all,

3197
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:07,730
so don't be mad.
That's why you should understand that.

3198
02:20:07,731 --> 02:20:08,890
That's one of that.
Now,

3199
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:10,413
because of that,
the most preposterous idea available 

3200
02:20:12,741 --> 02:20:16,670
that every photo of the earth is fake 
and there's no photos,

3201
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:20,690
there's no photos,
there's no photos of the composite,

3202
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:21,560
a special video.

3203
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,393
If they don't find a problem that 
there's no photos of the earth being 

3204
02:20:24,261 --> 02:20:25,340
flat,
not one.

3205
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,970
There's no photos of the earth being 
round.

3206
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:30,200
There's planning,
there's no photos.

3207
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,300
NASA will tell you that about CGI 
artist.

3208
02:20:32,301 --> 02:20:33,160
How can we,
how do we think?

3209
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:34,850
We can't think.
We can't get anywhere else.

3210
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:35,693
It can even get a picture.
That doesn't mean that has a meeting 

3211
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:40,060
every week.
Go to the artist was never proved.

3212
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:41,810
It goes back to that for me and say,
Gee,

3213
02:20:41,970 --> 02:20:45,860
they didn't see anything in there about 
the CGI that that article,

3214
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:48,550
he puts together data and make photos 
out.

3215
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:49,453
He puts together data because it has to 
be interpreted because you're talking 

3216
02:20:51,171 --> 02:20:52,004
about 1.7 terabytes.
Treg the video of him talking about the 

3217
02:20:55,011 --> 02:20:58,030
video you told me to try it was,
that was the wrong one.

3218
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:00,003
It's a terrible bunch where he's talking
terabytes like a thousand gigabytes 

3219
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:03,710
isn't word for word.

3220
02:21:03,710 --> 02:21:04,610
He goes,
well,

3221
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:06,000
it is.
It's photoshopped it.

3222
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:07,820
It's photoshop.
It has to be.

3223
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:08,683
It's,
it's,

3224
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:13,820
that's a no shop.
He didn't say it in that article.

3225
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:15,770
He did.
He did said come out of his mouth.

3226
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:16,740
He's got to find that.
Okay,

3227
02:21:16,770 --> 02:21:17,890
but when you're talking to,
you know,

3228
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:20,750
photoshop doesn't mean that they're 
distorting the image.

3229
02:21:20,751 --> 02:21:23,860
It also can mean to the connecting a 
bunch of different images to make it,

3230
02:21:24,590 --> 02:21:25,423
but when you watch him talking about how
we put together the official picture of 

3231
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,823
earth from space,
he's talking about cartoon animation 

3232
02:21:33,261 --> 02:21:36,050
type Shit.
He's talking about his own imagination.

3233
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:36,903
Well,
maybe because he's talking about this 

3234
02:21:38,241 --> 02:21:40,820
insane amount of data,
1.7 terabytes,

3235
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:41,803
maybe we don't understand how the fuck 
that gets interpreted into an image in 

3236
02:21:44,361 --> 02:21:46,910
the first place.
I don't even know if it's possible to do

3237
02:21:46,911 --> 02:21:47,744
it.
You know like to have an in perspective 

3238
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:50,533
when you're looking at it like a 12 inch
screen or 24 inch screen where the fuck 

3239
02:21:52,611 --> 02:21:53,444
your monitor would be and you're going 
to take this 1.7 terabyte image and 

3240
02:21:56,691 --> 02:21:58,130
shrink it down so it fits in there.

3241
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:00,320
I don't understand that messed with some
shit.

3242
02:22:01,070 --> 02:22:03,670
Damn.
That finished product is it admitted?

3243
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,540
CIA,
CGI composite.

3244
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:06,374
It's admitted.
It's not even the Japanese got real 

3245
02:22:09,711 --> 02:22:10,850
ones.
The chaplain,

3246
02:22:10,851 --> 02:22:13,100
he's got real ones but that's again 
figure it out.

3247
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,200
Eddie.
NASA does have one.

3248
02:22:15,201 --> 02:22:16,034
That's what the problem is.
They keep saying they don't from 1972 

3249
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:19,343
saying the only real one that happens 
from [inaudible] 72 I just pulled up is 

3250
02:22:21,891 --> 02:22:22,724
up right now that there's pictures from 
today that discover when you said that 

3251
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:27,110
that on some pictures I'd delete it.
Get rid of that.

3252
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,200
Okay.
You guys,

3253
02:22:28,690 --> 02:22:29,523
that's way cool.
What is it six times to leave in the 

3254
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:35,790
space shuttle,
but you don't believe in anything else?

3255
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:36,653
That's where it ends.
So leaving shadow goes up and flies 

3256
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:42,570
around direct TV on when it does 
dinosaurs.

3257
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,280
I don't know.
Here it goes.

3258
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,780
This is this.
That looks fake as fuck.

3259
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:46,673
April 16th,
2017 anything you guys toss up all the 

3260
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,473
fake ones off.
Do you have evidence that you would 

3261
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:56,004
accept as real?
It looks just like the ones that were 

3262
02:22:58,411 --> 02:23:00,750
admitted that were,
let's say that let's try to thoughts.

3263
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:04,470
They look exactly like the ones that 
were admitted.

3264
02:23:04,471 --> 02:23:09,150
Fakes where you accepted.
We one's real.

3265
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:12,680
Can I send you to space and like what do
you need to fuck with you too?

3266
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:16,313
His ass up.
I seen a bunch of fake ones in the show 

3267
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:21,480
me that one I got that looks like all 
the CGI ones,

3268
02:23:21,481 --> 02:23:23,850
like say I don't believe it.
Let's try to stick this lens.

3269
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:31,250
Tams is a motherfucker of a podcast.
I worry about Yeti.

3270
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,370
I really do.
You don't need to,

3271
02:23:32,371 --> 02:23:34,580
man.
I'm fucking group better than average.

3272
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,513
You're doing great,
but I worry about you going down these 

3273
02:23:37,111 --> 02:23:39,930
rabbit holes and strong.
What's the big deal?

3274
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:42,660
Who cares if the earth is round or flat?
It's entertaining to me.

3275
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,560
I understand.
So what's the big deal?

3276
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,790
Yeah.
If kids started looking into flat earth,

3277
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:50,460
good start questioning shit.
If you look into it and you,

3278
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:52,530
and you have proof that it is around,
instead of going,

3279
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:53,970
oh,
some scientists figured it out,

3280
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,770
somebody figured it out,
somebody figured out.

3281
02:23:55,771 --> 02:23:58,350
But you figure it out.
You try to figure it out.

3282
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:01,020
You know the one thing that all,
we know that we don't need scientists to

3283
02:24:01,021 --> 02:24:02,190
figure out as we know a couple of 
things.

3284
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,350
A compass,
a compass points to north.

3285
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,270
It doesn't need a battery.
And there's this,

3286
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:07,290
you know why?
No,

3287
02:24:07,291 --> 02:24:07,770
I know.
Let me,

3288
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:09,090
let me explain it.
This is all we know.

3289
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:12,080
This is all we know.
It's pointing to the north.

3290
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:12,810
There's,
it's,

3291
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:16,890
it's a magnetic force in the north.
That's all we know that for sure.

3292
02:24:16,980 --> 02:24:19,080
I don't need a scientist to confirm 
that.

3293
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:21,570
I know that there's a force in the 
north,

3294
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:23,910
some kind of magnetic force.
What else do,

3295
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:28,350
what else don't I need a government 
scientist confirmation from uh,

3296
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:30,030
uh,
the north star.

3297
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:31,620
It's right over the north end.
You finish.

3298
02:24:31,621 --> 02:24:32,670
Let me finish.
Let me just finish.

3299
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:35,310
Let me just finish the North Pole.
The North Star,

3300
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:36,144
Polaris is directly coincidentally over 
the North Pole where all the campuses 

3301
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:41,610
are pointing.

3302
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:44,070
All the company companies are pointing 
to the North Pole.

3303
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:48,420
There's this magnetic force in the North
Pole and coincidence polaris.

3304
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:49,493
No,
I'm just saying the polaris is directly 

3305
02:24:50,401 --> 02:24:51,234
over the North Pole.
It's been multiple north stars is 

3306
02:24:54,541 --> 02:24:57,630
Polaris directly above the North Pole.
You know that there's been more than one

3307
02:24:57,631 --> 02:25:00,570
northstar over the history of where'd 
you get that information from?

3308
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:02,340
From the Internet.
Exactly.

3309
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:04,380
So you don't believe that any,
I don't know.

3310
02:25:05,010 --> 02:25:07,980
I mean it's Polaris,
the North Star Polaris because Polaris,

3311
02:25:07,981 --> 02:25:09,540
the Northstar,
let me read this please.

3312
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:10,374
Cause it'll explain.
Right now earth's rotation access 

3313
02:25:12,031 --> 02:25:14,700
happens to be pointing almost exactly a 
polaris,

3314
02:25:14,701 --> 02:25:18,420
but in the year 3000 BC,
the North Star was a star called through

3315
02:25:18,421 --> 02:25:21,060
ban,
also known as Alpha draconian,

3316
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:24,190
and in about 13 years from now,

3317
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:25,053
the procession of the rotation axis will
mean that the bright star Vega will be 

3318
02:25:28,931 --> 02:25:29,764
the north star.

3319
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:33,110
That's according to NASA.
That's according to every scientist that

3320
02:25:33,111 --> 02:25:34,880
studies at Eddie from,
how do you know that?

3321
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:38,300
Because that's why it's still a,
how do you know arena?

3322
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:39,830
How do you know?
You just said,

3323
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:42,310
you know,
I don't know list.

3324
02:25:42,311 --> 02:25:44,060
There's no dispute about this.
I bet.

3325
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:46,610
I bet he jamie could pull up 100 
different fucking things.

3326
02:25:46,611 --> 02:25:48,230
It'll show you the same thing on the 
Internet,

3327
02:25:48,530 --> 02:25:51,710
but it's not just on the Internet and 
it's okay if you get hit the internet,

3328
02:25:51,711 --> 02:25:54,980
but it's not okay if I get information.
That's what it is.

3329
02:25:54,981 --> 02:25:58,040
It's if you get your information,
there's no information on both sides,

3330
02:25:58,410 --> 02:26:01,360
but you don't think that's true.
But now when I look at it,

3331
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:04,130
northstar changes over time.
University of what does that Michigan,

3332
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:07,060
does that make sense?
That doesn't make any,

3333
02:26:07,130 --> 02:26:08,840
that's not science.
Why does that not make sense?

3334
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:09,723
No,
I said it doesn't make sense that the 

3335
02:26:10,521 --> 02:26:13,010
Internet only works for you and not 
familiar what works when you,

3336
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:13,893
when you keep looking at it over and 
over and over again from all these 

3337
02:26:15,981 --> 02:26:20,210
multiple sources,
wouldn't you just assume you didn't say,

3338
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:22,820
you said over and over and over and over
and then you did.

3339
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:25,250
Why you playing games?
This is like you're playing tic TAC toe.

3340
02:26:25,251 --> 02:26:27,980
You're not looking at the truth of that 
sound like a little Jiu Jitsu.

3341
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:32,230
If you want to believe Nasa App,
it's all assets,

3342
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:33,830
government,
psyche.

3343
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:34,693
Why is the,
why are you telling me then why does 

3344
02:26:36,261 --> 02:26:38,870
that compass point towards the north?
I don't know.

3345
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:39,763
We know,
we know there's a magnetic force north 

3346
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:47,690
in the mag in the North Pole and we know
the polaris is right over the north pole

3347
02:26:47,930 --> 02:26:51,560
and the constellations rotate around 
Polaris.

3348
02:26:51,561 --> 02:26:54,680
Polaris is a fixed star and they all 
wrote the constellations,

3349
02:26:54,681 --> 02:26:58,760
rotate around that and it's right over 
the north pole spent.

3350
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:00,023
Oh,
go on striking how much time you've 

3351
02:27:01,581 --> 02:27:06,290
actually spent explaining what,
what did I say wrong?

3352
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,753
You and Eric,
they repeat that over and over again 

3353
02:27:08,931 --> 02:27:10,440
like the sky doesn't change at night.
No,

3354
02:27:10,441 --> 02:27:11,510
no,
I didn't know what I said.

3355
02:27:11,511 --> 02:27:12,980
I never said that.
I said,

3356
02:27:13,010 --> 02:27:13,843
well,
you said the stars don't star Polaris 

3357
02:27:16,370 --> 02:27:17,203
Star.
Stay ahead of the norm over the North 

3358
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:19,273
Pole.
Yes or no,

3359
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:22,010
and do the constellations rotate around 
Polaris?

3360
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:23,030
Nope.
Yes sir.

3361
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:24,200
License don't rotate.
No,

3362
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:25,280
no.
They started around.

3363
02:27:25,281 --> 02:27:27,980
When you look at time lapse photography 
of Polaris,

3364
02:27:28,190 --> 02:27:30,940
you could you go watch time.
All the constellations gone.

3365
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:32,990
Polaris is the fixer.
That's why they didn't go.

3366
02:27:32,991 --> 02:27:33,824
You're not,
you could find your way around and just 

3367
02:27:34,371 --> 02:27:35,720
find the north star.
It doesn't move.

3368
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,333
Explain that

3369
02:27:38,530 --> 02:27:40,930
and if the Earth is spinning like we 
know it is,

3370
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:42,423
what's directly above the earth would 
stay the same because the earth is 

3371
02:27:45,251 --> 02:27:46,084
spinning faster than spaces,
furthest spinning a thousand miles an 

3372
02:27:48,521 --> 02:27:49,354
hour in a circle.
Even though the cosmos suspending the 

3373
02:27:50,951 --> 02:27:54,220
cosmos changes as well.
There's a lot of things that change

3374
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:56,340
and the sky looks different all the 
time.

3375
02:27:56,350 --> 02:27:58,090
Change over the North Pole,

3376
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,013
but if you were spinning and you talking
about a small window of time when 

3377
02:28:02,111 --> 02:28:04,270
they're taking these time,
life time lapse photographs,

3378
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,220
her take him over a few hours.
Yes.

3379
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:07,093
Becky,
what do you understand that that if you 

3380
02:28:08,281 --> 02:28:09,114
are looking up over a few hours and you 
have one light that's directly overhead 

3381
02:28:12,101 --> 02:28:12,934
and the other ones are circulate,
the one light that's directly overhead 

3382
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:17,500
over a few hours is not going to move 
enough to register in the photograph,

3383
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:20,710
but the ones on the sides are,
when you're looking at a timelapse,

3384
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,130
you're at a time lapse over

3385
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,963
a few hours.
If you are looking at a time lapse over 

3386
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:25,484
months or years,
you would see that thing spinning to 

3387
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:30,320
Polaris would still be on the same spot.
No.

3388
02:28:30,321 --> 02:28:31,880
You'd have the procession of the 
equinoxes.

3389
02:28:31,881 --> 02:28:33,980
It changes the rotation of the earth.
Earth Act.

3390
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:38,450
It wobbles on its axis.
They've been tracking that forever.

3391
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:40,100
You got to watch time lapse photography 
on your,

3392
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:40,963
on Youtube.
Do you know you're not listening to one 

3393
02:28:42,411 --> 02:28:47,180
time lapse photography is over a few 
hours and and over a few hours.

3394
02:28:47,181 --> 02:28:52,100
You can see the earth causing a thousand
miles an hour and constellation circling

3395
02:28:52,101 --> 02:28:53,450
around Polaris.
That's one motion,

3396
02:28:53,451 --> 02:28:53,970
right?
You,

3397
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:54,803
you,
you capture one motion and that time 

3398
02:28:56,751 --> 02:28:57,584
lapse photography,
but science is telling us that there's 

3399
02:28:59,481 --> 02:29:01,520
four motions going on.
There are,

3400
02:29:01,521 --> 02:29:02,354
they're just much slower.
You're talking about something that 

3401
02:29:04,611 --> 02:29:05,990
you're looking at.
It's very quick.

3402
02:29:05,991 --> 02:29:08,480
Over a very short amount of time,
year after year,

3403
02:29:08,481 --> 02:29:09,480
decade to decade.

3404
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:11,030
Polar look on the same spot.
Yeah.

3405
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:12,830
None of these stars are staying in the 
same spot.

3406
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,210
You've got to find one,
a polaris specific one.

3407
02:29:16,270 --> 02:29:21,270
They find prolaris which cause that's 
the only one that isn't and everything's

3408
02:29:22,131 --> 02:29:23,300
going around Eddie.
Eddie,

3409
02:29:23,301 --> 02:29:24,134
what are you looking at right there when
you see that that time lapse photo at 

3410
02:29:26,231 --> 02:29:30,260
the SBAC,
Shit spinning the earth and the sky is,

3411
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:32,960
is the sky spinning or as the earth,
what do you think?

3412
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:35,870
I think the sky spinning.
Jesus Christ.

3413
02:29:36,650 --> 02:29:38,650
Why would people be lying about that?
I think,

3414
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:42,740
I think,
I think the light's about Polaris.

3415
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:43,431
Right?
You know why?

3416
02:29:43,431 --> 02:29:44,510
Because it's in the center.
Ready?

3417
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:45,351
Yeah,
exactly.

3418
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:47,810
There's always that no 32nd picture.
No.

3419
02:29:47,811 --> 02:29:48,644
You talking about something that happens
very often as other constellations are 

3420
02:29:50,511 --> 02:29:51,860
moving really quick,
eddie,

3421
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:54,500
if it's the ones directly overhead.
Okay.

3422
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:57,470
If you have a ball and you spin it on 
your finger like Michael Jordan,

3423
02:29:57,980 --> 02:29:58,813
the outside equator of the ball is going
to spin like fucking crazy in this big 

3424
02:30:02,601 --> 02:30:05,750
long wide loop,
but the tip of the ball is going to spin

3425
02:30:05,751 --> 02:30:07,160
in a very short,
tight circle.

3426
02:30:07,270 --> 02:30:08,103
Okay.
Right.

3427
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:09,680
When you see the Harlem Globe trotters,

3428
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,220
you can test it yourself.
Eddie,

3429
02:30:13,221 --> 02:30:14,054
if you just point a camera in the same 
spot out of your window for like three 

3430
02:30:16,401 --> 02:30:17,690
months straight,
take a photo,

3431
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,613
maybe even four or five tests.
I'm talking to you [inaudible] we just 

3432
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:23,170
want to give you an example to test it 
for yourself to show you that the,

3433
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:24,183
the stars,
the stars in the sky that you'll see 

3434
02:30:25,221 --> 02:30:26,054
above your head like you've claimed to 
go out and look out every night will be 

3435
02:30:28,491 --> 02:30:29,810
different throughout the year.
No,

3436
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:30,250
no,
no,

3437
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:31,970
they will.
They won't be different.

3438
02:30:32,060 --> 02:30:33,620
They're moving.
They are rotating,

3439
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:38,100
the are rotating around Polaris and not 
going to be in the same spot moving.

3440
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:40,970
Okay.
They are moving,

3441
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:41,983
but you're always going to see polaris.
Why would you think that this is a 

3442
02:30:43,761 --> 02:30:44,594
conspiracy?
Why would they lie about the earth 

3443
02:30:46,441 --> 02:30:48,580
spinning when it's really the the 
universe spinning,

3444
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:51,090
not stars trying to controls.
I don't know.

3445
02:30:51,140 --> 02:30:52,190
What are they?
I don't know.

3446
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:53,260
People,
led's,

3447
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:57,140
people looking down.
GRANDPA happy people,

3448
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:59,120
their souls.
Angels.

3449
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:01,970
You told me my grandma's up there flying
unicorns,

3450
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:03,530
bro.
Grandma's flying.

3451
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:05,890
Unicorn even told you the crazy.
Oh,

3452
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:06,900
you don't do shit.

3453
02:31:10,430 --> 02:31:11,930
No crystal.
Craziest shit.

3454
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:16,340
Can't tell you crazier than flat.
Why save it?

3455
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:18,023
I don't.
How about you guys are already making 

3456
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:24,030
fun of me for from flat earth.
I'm trying.

3457
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:26,220
I just don't.
I just don't trust mass.

3458
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:27,380
I understand.
I don't trust it.

3459
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:29,640
You're still,
you have a circle of trust once.

3460
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:32,170
Do some crazy shit.
Please promise me.

3461
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:37,310
End On this note.
I want to end up the crazy tee shirt for

3462
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:38,131
next time.
Yeah,

3463
02:31:38,131 --> 02:31:42,150
just don't make it a giant now.
If you drop it now,

3464
02:31:42,151 --> 02:31:45,780
we'll never make it at six o'clock.
I know.

3465
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,450
I just wanted to,
oh shit.

3466
02:31:47,451 --> 02:31:48,300
Yeah,
that's it's a clock.

3467
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:53,040
Unless unless you want to hear it now.
I don't know.

3468
02:31:53,041 --> 02:31:54,240
It should.
It's too crazy.

3469
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:55,540
It's too crazy.
Let's go do it.

3470
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:57,093
Go do some crazy Chris talk.
We'll talk off here about this whole 

3471
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:03,690
crazy.
It will discredit the flat earth theory.

3472
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:07,350
I can't hit my mind.
Can't handle daddy.

3473
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:10,310
Everything is except this one.
You need a tissue.

3474
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:13,040
He says everything is conspiracy.
You make life.

3475
02:32:13,570 --> 02:32:16,770
You will make Alex Jones look like 
fucking like Gandhi.

3476
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:17,633
Fuck.
Like Alex Jones is like Alex Jones is 

3477
02:32:19,831 --> 02:32:21,410
like 90% of conspiracy theories.
Like,

3478
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:22,670
well that's all bullshit.
You know?

3479
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:24,390
But Eddie,
just these,

3480
02:32:24,460 --> 02:32:25,293
fuck you.
You got to appreciate the hustle by 

3481
02:32:27,181 --> 02:32:30,300
Eddie is like a blue belt conspiracy 
theorists.

3482
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:31,440
You'd have.
Wow.

3483
02:32:31,441 --> 02:32:35,770
I can't believe you said that.
Let's end on that tonight.

3484
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:38,230
Everybody much love blue belts are 
fucking batteries.

3485
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:44,250
[inaudible]

3486
02:32:44,810 --> 02:32:45,670
I didn't,
I didn't.
