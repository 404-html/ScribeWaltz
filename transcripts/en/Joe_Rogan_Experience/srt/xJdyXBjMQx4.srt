1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,410
Ladies and gentlemen coming at you live
from Sunny California.

2
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:14,210
It's bright yellow.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,590
how are you brother?
Great man.

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,000
How are you?
Long time man.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,060
I haven't seen you in like what?
A year and a half or something.

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,570
So something like that.
Yeah,

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,690
I see you've got a new place here and
congratulations.

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,340
Thank you sir.
Very nice.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,530
Thank you.
It's huge.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,570
It's a big spot.
Got Big plans,

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,120
big plans apparently when I have a lot
of fun here.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,670
I think a big old fun house.
Yeah,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,940
that's what they were saying.
You're putting games in and all kinds of

14
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,370
crazy stuff.
The virtual heart treating.

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,550
What's the archery game?
Yeah,

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,460
you use an actual compound bow,
it's called techno hunt.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,440
And you ever seen those?
Do you play golf?

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,020
Yes you do.
You know those games where you whack the

19
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:54,140
golf ball into the screen and a virtual
golf ball rolls around.

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,480
They have one of those for archery.
You actually use a regular compound bow

21
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,900
and you shoot it at the screen.
And when the tips,

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,690
instead of using a regular um,
arrow tip,

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,660
you use this flat tip.
It's like,

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,840
uh,
like the head of attack and here it is

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,690
powerful Jamie.
And so you,

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,760
you shoot it at the screen and it shows
you like these animals that you'd be

27
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:23,720
hunting and you use an actual bow and
where it hits it shows you whether or

28
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,690
not it's a good impact.
Like that right there,

29
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:28,430
it was perfect.
Wow.

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,560
And it shows like the Arrow impact,
it shows like how fast the arrows going

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,600
to,
you're getting that practice put in here

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,400
or do you put it in here too?
I'm very nice.

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,720
Not In this room.
Out there in the,

34
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,180
in the whole major.
Yeah.

35
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,380
We're going to do a bunch of shit here.

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,630
I'd figure like,
it's like there's so many,

37
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,150
there's so much opportunity now on the
Internet,

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,500
uh,
to do things,

39
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,210
to do content.
Uh,

40
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm going to do a weekly mma show now
that people know.

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,950
I would decided that that's my new
thing,

42
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,280
weekly,
weekly MMA breakdown every week.

43
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,270
How big is,
how big is your resume?

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,860
How many things you've got so many.
Well,

45
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm not adding the things,
I'm not adding any things,

46
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,980
just doing stuff.
Yeah.

47
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:10,814
But,
um,

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,500
I've told people,
and this is going to sound like I'm you,

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,710
you have been successful at so many
different things.

50
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,000
It's very,
it's quite amazing.

51
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,520
I mean,
you have the standup career,

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,820
successful standup career.
You were on a Sitcom,

53
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,890
a hit Sitcom,
right?

54
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,620
You did fear factor.
Yeah.

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,240
Ratios.
Right?

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,050
And then you do the,
what does a wwf,

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,790

59
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,860
It's pretty,

60
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,510
pretty impressive.
It's not,

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,170
I have mental problems and I've figured
out how to boil them down into a healthy

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,200
mixture of activities that keeps me
friendly and sane and kind and generous.

00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,260

Well,

67
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,100
congratulations on everything.
What's going on with you man?

68
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,330
You still live in Vegas.
You fucking mad,

69
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,190
man.
You're like the nicest guy ever to live

70
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,860
in Vegas.
Everybody in Vegas.

71
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,050
It's like got to Campbell.
I'm fucking going crazy.

72
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,260
I need a Ferrari in la on a bigger
yacht.

73
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,940
Um,

74
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,830
I just,
I,

75
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,510
my kids are in Vegas.
I like living in Vegas,

76
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,270
but I don't really,
I don't really do the Vegas thing the

77
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:30,160
way other people think.
That's a big misconception,

78
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,140
right?
A lot of people believe that they,

79
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,790
like if you live in Vegas,
like you've gotta be like,

80
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,550
oh no.
The gambler crazy person going to the

81
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,450
clubs.
Yeah.

82
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,650
I have white tigers at home
hanging out with Wayne Newton closet

83
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,700
full of Rhinestone capes.
Ooh.

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,020
Yeah.
I'd love to see,

85
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,040
I mean,
I do have that,

86
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,040
but I don't wear them all the time.
You know what I mean?

87
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,430
It'd be awesome if you switched it up.

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,870
I'm going to start that.
My next show this weekend,

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,780
I promise I'll be wearing rhinestone
capes unstable.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,070
Want to see from you?
I want to see abalone shell glasses like

91
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,990
the outside,
just like a real glistening classes and

92
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,800
then just plumes.
Lots of feathers go on stage and do the

93
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,660
same act.
Yeah,

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,660
same.
Amazing.

95
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,510
Once was sprinkles on donuts and go,
is that abalone?

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,090
He's wearing an abalone shades.
Yeah.

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,010
People would take your pictures and be
able to glistening reflection off of the

98
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,870
off of the frames.
I just feel like you could switch it up.

99
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,850
Yeah.
Maybe one day.

100
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,190
Right now I like doing it the way I do
it,

101
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:41,191
but it'll be my ace in the hole.
I love what you're doing because you,

102
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:45,490
you're a guide that has been steadily
performing on a wrecking.

103
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:49,600
You've built this massive following
where you do these like big giant places

104
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:49,730
do.

105
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,010
You did red rock in Colorado.
That's fucking huge.

106
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:58,630
That's a giant place.
I was humbled and honored to be able to

107
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,480
perform there.
It's a beautiful venue obviously.

108
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,710
Have you performed there or seen a shown
that show?

109
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,660
No.
I'm actually in Colorado on Friday and

110
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:12,250
I'm booking red rock for a year and a
half out in the future.

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,120
That's my next gig and Colorado is going
to be red rock.

112
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh,
well it's amazing.

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,770
I've heard it's awesome.
Yeah.

114
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,800
I,
years ago when I was performing,

115
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,860
come on,
look at the fucking,

116
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,220
the beauty in that place.
I mean you're surrounded by these

117
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,560
natural rock formations.
Goddamn,

118
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,720
I fucking love Colorado.
I love it.

119
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,600
And the,
and the stand on that stage and look up

120
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,010
at the uh,
oh,

121
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,170
that's me.
Oh Wow.

122
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,540
Look at that.
You sign your name on the wall.

123
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,510
Do I never signed it big.
See how small it is,

124
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,640
sweetie.
That's why everyone is excited.

125
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,110
Big.
Look at the fucking,

126
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,510
oh my God.
So that,

127
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,560
that was when I was sick.
That's when I was there.

128
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,200
So you don't have assigned seating,
you just kind of jam it?

129
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,490
I don't know.
I think it's assigned seating.

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,620
Oh.
So cause it looks like giant bench

131
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:57,970
seating.
It

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,650
has bench seating.
I was like

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,110
fuck.
That's awesome.

134
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,010
And you did it kind of in the daytime?
No,

135
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,990
it started,
it started in the daytime.

136
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,010
Uh,
I think,

137
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,620
uh,
I think that was joe bolster opening for

138
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,210
me.
Um,

139
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,700
who did this video?
Uh,

140
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,270
it was people who did my webpage,
put the video together.

141
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,950
Jamie,
we need to do something like this for

142
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,080
sure.
So by the time it hit the stage,

143
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:25,400
you can see it was,
it was dark.

144
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,530
Fuck man,
this is amazing.

145
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,780
Holy Shit Dude.
What,

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,040
what does the sound like?
We have it dark because there were only

147
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,640
400 people in the entire venue here.
Look at the size of that place.

148
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,110
That's madness.
That's 9,000 people.

149
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,120
That's crazy.
It's so beautiful too,

150
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,380
man.
It's pretty cool.

151
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,020
There's something about that place and
you could run the stairs and get a

152
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,250
workout before you,
uh,

153
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,930
before you actually perform.

154
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,200
I have some friends who live in Colorado
who go to red rock just to run the

155
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:56,300
stairs.
Yeah,

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
I walked.
Yeah,

157
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,370
we got there early in the day and I
walked like halfway up just to see what

158
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,590
it was like.
And plus it's a high altitude.

159
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,660
I was like out of breath,
just walking up once halfway.

160
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,580
So there's no way I'm running those
stairs.

161
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,400
Did you ever do Aspen,
aspen comedy festival back when they had

162
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:13,700
that,
uh,

163
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,670
years ago they used to give you oxygen
backstage.

164
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,691
Yeah,
I've,

165
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,970
I've,
I've done shows at high altitude areas

166
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,020
where they will point out where the
oxygen tanks are backstage and say,

167
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,730
if you need it,
they're right.

168
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,040
That's pretty disconcerting.
Weird.

169
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,630
You Go,
why would I need that?

170
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:31,640
And they go well,
and then they'll mention artists who

171
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,290
needed it.
Do you know who had to come off stage

172
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,390
and take a hit off it or whatever?

173
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,830
Um,
I've never had to do it,

174
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,990
but I have gotten light headed like,
you know,

175
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,270
Breckenridge,
I think I remember being light,

176
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,200
light,
lightheaded on stall.

177
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,320
Yeah.
I mean that's,

178
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,610
I think Aspen,
I want to say it's like a thousand feet

179
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,760
above Denver.
I think Aspen,

180
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,670
it's pretty up there,
which is kind of a crazy place to do a

181
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,770
comedy festival.
Right,

182
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,620
right,
right.

183
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,520
And also when I used to perform at the
comedy works in Denver,

184
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,770
I didn't realize that alcohol would
affect you more intensely at a high

185
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:06,440
altitude as well.
And I used to drink a couple of beers

186
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,350
before a show and on a three shows
Saturday night,

187
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,170
you know,
and that third show you might have four

188
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,540
or five years in you.
I don't do that anymore,

189
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,050
but I'd be on stayed going lid.

190
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,360
I slurred my punch lines and I'm like,
yeah,

191
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,194
I don't,
I don't,

192
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,780
I don't like to do that.
I want to kind of be in control.

193
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,060
It's not a good feeling.
Yeah.

194
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,860
You know what's nice though,
right before you lose control,

195
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,030
you got to get like right to the door.
You've got a right to the door is a fun

196
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,430
place.
And on the line right on the edge,

197
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,380
it's hard.
You know we need like,

198
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,150
like a,
like a strip that you could like a lick

199
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,130
getting close here,
you know?

200
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,710
Well I know you like to shoot pool.
We shot pool last time.

201
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,890
It's similar to that when you're,
you have a couple of beers,

202
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,070
like for some people,
and I think I'm one of these,

203
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,130
if I'm completely

204
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,440
sober,
I'm not as good of a pool shooter

205
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,070
because I'm too tense.
Right.

206
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,920
Where if you have a beer or two in you,
you loosen up a little bit where you

207
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,280
play better,
but then you cross the line and then

208
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,990
you're gone.
Yet where it's just,

209
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,900
you're not good at all.
So it's that line you're talking about.

210
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,130
I don't play good under alcohol.
I played good on marijuana,

211
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,010
like marijuana and pool to me goes
great.

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,160
But alcoholic just doesn't really,
it doesn't really go that good.

213
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,630
I don't,
I can't even imagine shooting pool

214
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,980
stuff.
Well,

215
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,240
the thing is about marijuana use.
You paranoid,

216
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,590
you get definitely get paranoid.
You gotta think about that for ball is

217
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:38,880
saying something to me.
What's the deal with the why?

218
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,400
Why are the,
why is the two and the seven together

219
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,360
like that?
I would start thinking weird.

220
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,970
There's a message,
a message in this table clearly.

221
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,920
Yeah,
there's,

222
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
there's absolute,
I took a month off,

223
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,154
we did this,
uh,

224
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,760
me and Ari Shaffir and Bert Kreischer
and Thompson Euro.

225
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,920
We did this sober October thing,
ah,

226
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,690
which I'm going to do every year and we
took a month off of everything except

227
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:05,400
coffee.
And we also did 1590 minute beak from

228
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:08,250
yoga classes for the month.
Like you owed 15.

229
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,250
So it was a,
it was an interesting little exercise in

230
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,110
discipline because he had to do the yoga
classes,

231
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,810
you had to get a man.
But it was also interesting for a guy

232
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:20,811
who's been smoking pot pretty regularly
for 2020 years around then for to go to

233
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:23,610
nothing,
zero.

234
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,730
It was very strange and very
educational.

235
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,630
I think very valuable to kids.
Gives.

236
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,960
Give me,
it gave me a real good perspective on

237
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,710
the benefits of marijuana and maybe
perhaps some of the cons too.

238
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,800
Right?
So this past October,

239
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:37,950
yeah.

240
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,390
Yeah.
Completely sober.

241
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,500
No alcohol as well.
No,

242
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,060
no alcohol,
no coffee.

243
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,320
Just coffee.
That was the only,

244
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,330
and even coffee,
it's kind of cheating.

245
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,190
I think next time I'm gonna do it with
no coffee.

246
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,550
I think next time because you know what?
Whenever I would see those Aa guys and

247
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,650
they'd be smoking cigarettes and just
pounding coffee,

248
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:56,520
I'd be like,
hey man,

249
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,500
you're doing drugs,
you know,

250
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,600
something in each hand and they're
going,

251
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,291
I,
I've been,

252
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,600
I've been off the problems for,
uh,

253
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,400
you know,
um,

254
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,650
I think you need advice.
You,

255
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,810
you can't,
you can't.

256
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,040
Maybe there are people who have gone
through this world without having a

257
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,340
vice,
but I think you have to have something,

258
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,500
something that you can go to,
to go,

259
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:26,670
I know this is wrong,
but as long as you're not hurting

260
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,350
somebody,
you know what I mean?

261
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,540
Yeah.
I don't know if it's necessarily wrong,

262
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,290
but I agree with you.

263
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,320
I know what you're saying.
I love that term vice.

264
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,020
It's a very interesting term.
Like I remember when you would see like

265
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:40,020
the old cop movies and they would talk
about like the vice unit,

266
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,490
the vice squad.
Oh,

267
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,750
they'll look at it and then they'd go,
well,

268
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,650
what's your vice?
I'm like,

269
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,860
Shit.
I got to vibe with the vice unit is

270
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:49,190
like,
there should be a booklet of like all

271
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,450
these vices that are available to
people.

272
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,220
You know?
What is the exact term of vice?

273
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,640
Like Google,
the definition of vice.

274
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,180
Like watch the,
the vice president will pop up here.

275
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,260
Pence people.
You forget who he is when that guy's

276
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,520
gone,
but then I completely forget him.

277
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,920
He's appointed but talking about being
shadowed.

278
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,831
All right,
let's check.

279
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,780
You're looking up the definition of
vice.

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,850
He morality,
wrongdoing,

281
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,710
wickedness,
wickedness,

282
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,260
evil.
Inequity.

283
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,120
Hmm.
That's a weird word.

284
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,390
What does that word mean?
Villainy corruption.

285
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,390
Misconduct.
Ms. Deeds more.

286
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,180
There's more.
Click on more was more.

287
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,420
There's more.
Oh,

288
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,030
cinema's criminal activities involving
prostitution,

289
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,340
pornography,
or drugs.

290
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,420
Now I'm on record saying that everyone
should have one of these.

291
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,910
You need more pornography and drugs and
wickedness and badness in your life.

292
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,010
You need more a moral or wicked personal
characteristics.

293
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,050
That's,
I think those words are too strong that

294
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,950
when I think of advice I think of,
you know,

295
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,843
um,
cigarettes.

296
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,983
Yeah.
Having,

297
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,130
yeah,
I'm going to shut it.

298
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:05,400
Tequila.
A weakness of character or behavior,

299
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,300
a bad habit.
Cigars happened in V my father's vice.

300
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,600
But how do you put cigars,
right?

301
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,030
And Drugs and criminal activities
together.

302
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,340
Like how do you put criminal activities
and drugs?

303
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,930
How are and,
and cigars,

304
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,200
how are those cigars doesn't fit in
there.

305
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,570
That's um,
well that's a problem,

306
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,670
right?
Like this is the problem with the term

307
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,850
drugs.
Like drugs could be a cup of coffee or

308
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,410
drugs.
Could be crystal meth.

309
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,180
They're both drugs,
right?

310
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,510
You're going to see a guy smoking a
cigar going,

311
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,630
that guy is wicked.
He's a wicked crypto.

312
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,660
Wicked evil.
I bet cheese into pornography.

313
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,050
But we,
that term vice is a strange term because

314
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,640
we think of it as like a weakness.
And we,

315
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,850
we were very embarrassed of our
weaknesses,

316
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,520
you know?
And if you can get out ahead of him and

317
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,440
then I explain,
oh well,

318
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,300
you know,
coffee's my vice,

319
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,350
I go,
okay,

320
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,831
okay.
You're,

321
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:03,070
you're giving into your letting us know,
hey you have this,

322
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,630
here's your weakness.
Right.

323
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,450
You know,
but coffee is a pretty yes.

324
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,040
The most innocuous witness that someone
can cop to.

325
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,963
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

326
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,280
Um,
and it's probably pretty good for you.

327
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,030
I keep reading so hard to tell cause
you're like read one study that says a

328
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:22,690
cup of coffee a week or a day could keep
you from heart attacks.

329
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,140
Then another one says it takes 10 years
off your life.

330
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,760
It's like it's hard to figure out was
probably the same.

331
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,060
The same line thing.
I like to have a cocktail.

332
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,890
That would be my advice

333
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,080
and a is the wrong word.
Look up.

334
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,860
How many like the idea to have him one
before you go on stage.

335
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,020
I like to have one shot before I go on
stage.

336
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,050
I do a shot of chilled peach schnapps.
Would you give very specific before I go

337
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,100
on stage?
But it's not,

338
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,280
it has nothing to do with the alcohol.
I like the aspect.

339
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,970
So the people I'm working with,
we all do a shot of chilled peach

340
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:57,140
schnapps.
Oh,

341
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,170
that's nice.
For the ceremony aspect of it.

342
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,000
Um,
that's before the show.

343
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,250
After the show I'll have something maybe
a little stronger than a shot of

344
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,140
children,
which knobs to relax and unwind.

345
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,220
I actually,
I don't,

346
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,470
um,
I don't drink that often,

347
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:17,150
but I like to have my occasional night
out with the guys where you go,

348
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,810
where you can kind of go ballistic.
It's fun and I,

349
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,400
and I do it safe,
you know what I mean?

350
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,020
I'm not driving,
you know,

351
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,480
uh,
golf weekends with the brothers and

352
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,850
friends.
We're all in a house.

353
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,890
We're getting lit up.
We're not hurting anybody.

354
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,700
I kind of thing I'm with you.
I don't think there's anything wrong

355
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,900
with it.
I mean,

356
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,330
what's the,
who it was Oscar Wilde who said,

357
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,950
uh,
all things in moderation,

358
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:40,940
including moderation.

359
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,070
Love it.
It's a great term.

360
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,031
Great,
great.

361
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,440
A great quote.
Quote Rather.

362
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,431
Yeah,
I think,

363
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,310
um,
I think there's benefits to alcohol.

364
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,330
There's benefits in joy,
like you pay for it in recovery,

365
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,560
but there's benefits in like bonding,
friendship.

366
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,400
Like some of the most fun times I've had
with my friends has been us hammered.

367
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,180
I remember being in college at a party
and everybody being in a living room

368
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,400
cramped like it was shoulder to
shoulder.

369
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,430
Everyone had beers in their hands and
everyone was screaming at the top of

370
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,630
their lungs.
Like everybody,

371
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,480
like it became like an animalistic
tribal.

372
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:25,481
Like everybody was just
like 60 people jammed together

373
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,650
screaming.
And I remember thinking,

374
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,680
is this just the ultimate and bliss?
It's just a ray,

375
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,630
like an express,
an expression of joy.

376
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,640
You know what I mean?
It was just silly.

377
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:41,510
It was just silly.
It was so unbelievably goofy and silly.

378
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,870
What it's also,
there's the inhibition inducing quality

379
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,240
of alcohol is very important for those
moments.

380
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,074
Right.
Cause he just,

381
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,200
it frees you from any concern about how
you look or how you sound or whether or

382
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,000
not you should be behaving this way and
he could just,

383
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,320
yeah.
Right,

384
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,760
right.
But I wish,

385
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,810
I wish I could do that without the
alcohol.

386
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,950
But you can't like can,
can you get a,

387
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,430
but can I say,
hey,

388
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,020
I need 49 people to come over to my
place.

389
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,590
We're going to have some tea and then
we're all going to get shoulder,

390
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,850
shoulder scream at the top of our lungs.
No one would do that.

391
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,160
No.
You know the,

392
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,010
the alcohol kind of gives you the
freedom and the goofy to be goofy.

393
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,930
Yeah.
And it makes you feel like doing that.

394
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,180
Whereas you,
you wouldn't feel like doing that if you

395
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:29,991
were sober.
You'd be like,

396
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,970
what the fuck is the benefit and
screaming,

397
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,180
but,
but maybe you do feel like it down deep.

398
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,490
Hmm.
You know what I mean?

399
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,730
I wonder maybe there's something down
deep and then the alcohol brings.

400
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,230
Cause why would you do it when you're
drunk?

401
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,910
That there's something,
there's something that you want,

402
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,340
there's some reason why you're doing it.
Tell you.

403
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:50,100
One thing that I did find when I was
sober for month is that I would go

404
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,180
out with people who are drinking and
they would be unknown.

405
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,100
Yay.
Oh my God,

406
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,440
it's this fucking,
it's real hard when you're sober and a

407
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,590
bunch of people around you are just
talking stupid drunk shit.

408
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,760
They're on that vibe and you're not even
close.

409
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,020
Nowhere near that by you look,
hey,

410
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,490
look at the time.
Let's get the fuck Outta here.

411
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,260
I gotta get out.
Cause it's funny,

412
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,710
everybody has to be on the same page.
Yes.

413
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,980
Everybody has to be at the same,
the same level of goofiness.

414
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,470
Yeah.
Like if you're dating someone that

415
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,740
doesn't drink and you're a drinker,
that could be a real issue.

416
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,710
You know,
if you start getting hammered and they

417
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,471
were like,
you're annoying.

418
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:28,901
Like,
no,

419
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:29,640
no,
no,

420
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,360
you're a fucking sober.
I'm not annoying.

421
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,400
No,
I'm not annoying.

422
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,290
I'm drunk.
This is what happens.

423
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,980
You don't even,
you don't even feel this moment.

424
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,930
Like,
I feel this moment.

425
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,890
Play a good drunk man.
I've been there before.

426
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,800
That's good.
That's strong.

427
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,050
Yeah.
The problem is the physical

428
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,730
repercussions are fucking massive.
Yeah.

429
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,910
Well those are now in my calendar.
Oh,

430
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,300
you got them in Britain in Oh yeah.
Like I,

431
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,390
I know when my crazy night is going to
be and I know that I have nothing to do

432
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,070
the next day.
Oh,

433
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,180
do you a have like pedialyte set aside
and I don't,

434
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,540
I don't know what that is about to know.
He's like an electrolyte drink or

435
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,400
something.
I don't do that.

436
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,870
No.
Maybe IV drip.

437
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,870
I go to bed and set up the IB before I
go to sleep.

438
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,733
Go.
Yeah.

439
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,880
No,
nope.

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,390
Just sleep.
Just go to sleep and sleep.

441
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,890
Eat pancakes,
sleep for three days.

442
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,170
That's the other thing too is the food
choices that you get a double whammy

443
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,130
from alcohol.

444
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,400
You get the impact of the alcohol and
then you get the impact of the food

445
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,700
choices that you succumb to.
Waffle house.

446
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,680
Waffle house is good for am fuck yeah.
4:00 AM waffle house.

447
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,860
Talk to me.
Yeah.

448
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,380
When the all American with the,
I get so much food that it can't

449
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,850
literally fit on the table.
They have those little waffle house

450
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,950
tables.
I'll get eggs,

451
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,170
hash browns,
sausage,

452
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,210
the waffles,
you know,

453
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,270
maybe biscuits and gravy.
I don't even fuck with the eggs.

454
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,190
What's why we pretend this is real food.
Just gimme them waffles,

455
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,230
extra butter.
I just,

456
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,430
I don't even start eating until I've
opened like six or seven of those little

457
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:18,690
packages.
Butter.

458
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,250
I'm going to slather that shit all over
those waffles and then drown them.

459
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,143
Yeah,
yeah,

460
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,140
yeah.
But when you got like four guys at a

461
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,120
waffle house table,
it's really,

462
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:33,240
um,
it's a mathematical problem.

463
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,300
The amount of food that the four guys
are getting truly,

464
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,510
literally will not fit on the table that
they're providing for you.

465
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,620
I've had some fucking amazing
conversations with friends after shows

466
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,360
at the waffle house.
Sure.

467
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,740
Yeah.
But always looking fights

468
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,140
like you always look,
look at it can keep a look out.

469
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,290
Anybody can come in anytime and start
kicking someone's ass.

470
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,780
He was going to be looking to run out
the door.

471
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,340
The Wa there's like something about
waffle houses after 1:00 AM where the

472
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,160
possibility of fights,
it goes through the roof.

473
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,050
The graph just goes up.
You always had to be looking for fights.

474
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:12,010
Like at any moment one could break out.
So you have like sizzler steakhouse at

475
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:17,011
6:00 PM to waffle house at 4:00 AM and
the graph just goes through is that

476
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,160
fights at waffle house?
So many of them,

477
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,930
I realized there was actual like web
page dedicated to waffle house videos.

478
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,330
They've seen somebody like,
this guy's got scars all over his face.

479
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,440
See that guy right next to curse Jesus
Christ.

480
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:35,320
He got beat up at the waffle house.
Oh my God.

481
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,930
Yeah.
Waffle house is just something about

482
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,764
that place.

483
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,580
It's 24 hours a day and the alcohol,
right.

484
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,250
The amount of people that are coming in
drunk is through the roof.

485
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,680
I wonder if at some waffle House meeting
somebody propose what we should close at

486
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,740
one 1:00 AM then we're going to cut out
95% of our profits because everybody

487
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,640
comes in after 1:00 AM yeah.
That would be a terrible move this close

488
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,670
at 1:00 AM and see what happens.
That'd be like tiger woods chopping his

489
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:09,040
fucking arms off.
I've got a stupid idea.

490
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,700
Is that,
that's so dumb.

491
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,710
That's a dumb idea.
Yeah.

492
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,710
They,
they must embrace the drunks,

493
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,890
you know?
Yeah.

494
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,430
Hangover remedies.
You know what else is really good,

495
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,600
really late at night,
if you could find a legit Mexican joint,

496
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,380
like a legit one where they barely speak
English.

497
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,080
You know,
I was at a place in Dallas and there was

498
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,610
a late night place,
a Chinese restaurant where they would

499
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:42,580
serve alcohol after alcohol was supposed
to be closed.

500
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,560
Oh.
And everybody sold tea.

501
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,870
Yeah.
This is the cool place to go to.

502
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,380
And you go there and everybody's on the
down low and they serve alcohol.

503
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,960
But like in tea cups.
Yeah.

504
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,340
They call it cold tea.
Right.

505
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,630
Something like that.
Yeah.

506
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,050
And um,
the place was packed and everybody had

507
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,790
booze.
And I'm like,

508
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,290
this is really a secret to the,
to the police.

509
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:10,291
Like the police don't know this place is
packed at three o'clock in the morning

510
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:12,760
and we're all here to drink tea.
You know what I mean?

511
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,750
And uh,
apparently somebody said the cops are

512
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,640
coming,
like arrayed was happening.

513
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:23,641
I guess maybe they saw him pulling into
the parking lot and an old Asian guy ran

514
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:27,580
around all the tables throwing fish on
everybody's table.

515
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,400
And he was saying food saying tell him I
don't want to do an Asian accident cause

516
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,600
it'll sound racist.
But he was saying,

517
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,870
tell,
tell the police you're eating the fish

518
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,630
telling everybody,
tell him you're eating the fish.

519
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,070
Tell him eating a fish.
This big Jane Fish on our plate like

520
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,130
that would fool the cops.

521
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,140
Like everybody has the same giant giant
fish on their plate and a cup of tea.

522
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,310
We just all had a,
I had a craving for this at three

523
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:56,780
o'clock in the morning.
All of us.

524
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,840
It's a social place.
It's amazing.

525
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:01,880
They had that many fish cooked ready to
go.

526
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,330
I don't even know if they were cooked.
I think he was just scrambling to try to

527
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,640
cover what was going on.
Chinatown in Boston?

528
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:08,181
No,
he's had that.

529
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:12,470
We would do shows at like nick's comedy
stop and then we'd go to a chinatown

530
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,720
which is like right down the street and
they,

531
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,660
they serve cold tea.
You can drink beer late at night.

532
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,450
I think I've been in that place.
I say you have quite a few of those.

533
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,590
Comedians will go,
hey,

534
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,060
we've got a place we can go to.
Yeah,

535
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,350
yeah.
I wish I could remember the name of the

536
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,780
places,
but good Chinese food too.

537
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,000
Like real serious,
legit Chinese food.

538
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,800
And you would,
uh,

539
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,400
you would also get beer late at night.
They must've had some sort of a deal

540
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:37,820
with the cops because I knew about it
when I was like 18.

541
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,970
So if I knew about it,
I can't imagine that escaped the police

542
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,940
and the entire police force was
oblivious.

543
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,690
Joe Rogan knows about this,
but the entire police force is oblivious

544
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:54,150
to the fact that this happening in their
town high,

545
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,710
highly unlikely.
It is weird though that there's rules

546
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:58,544
like,
okay,

547
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,720
that's one of the things that I like
about Vegas is that Vegas allows you to

548
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,460
drink whenever you want.
Your grown adult,

549
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,310
if you want to have a beer at five
o'clock in the morning,

550
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,320
it's totally legal.
If you want to have a beer,

551
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:12,200
it's seven o'clock in the morning.
That's legal to decide for yourself.

552
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,010
There's no like magical hour where
alcohol becomes okay.

553
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,030
I agree with that.
But I also understand the,

554
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:24,560
not wanting everybody to get on the road
behind a wheel,

555
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,311
you know,
like,

556
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:27,080
uh,
aspect.

557
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,083
Yeah.
But does that,

558
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,830
does that really save any money?
Because at the end of the day,

559
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,250
like if you're drunk at midnight,
you're drunk at midnight,

560
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,830
how are you going to get home?
You're going to wait till two in the

561
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,420
morning and then drive.
Is that the idea of,

562
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,590
well,
you're still going to be drunk.

563
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,900
You know,
if you're out there driving and you're

564
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:43,880
drunk,
you're driving drunk period,

565
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:48,881
there's no real work around for that.
And if it happens at 11:00 PM or if it

566
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:53,951
happens at 5:00 AM it's really the same
situation unless you factor where you're

567
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,900
going to be more drunk even later.
And what I mean,

568
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,130
yeah,
I guess so,

569
00:25:58,131 --> 00:25:58,964
but I mean,
how,

570
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,840
what percentage of people that leave
clubs or driving drunk,

571
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,610
it's gotta be in the high seventies and
they just drive,

572
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,900
you know what I like today is like lyft
and Uber that people are using these

573
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,490
ride sharing thing.
That's,

574
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,250
that is gigantic.
And I would imagine that's probably

575
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:19,730
saved a lot of people accidents.
That would be good to know.

576
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,510
Yes.
And you've had to listen to a lot of

577
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:28,511
like really stupid stories from drivers
and like had weird conversations with

578
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:29,810
these people.
They,

579
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,170
um,
I won't,

580
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,720
I have not been in a lot of Uber's,
but they tend to like to talk about

581
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:40,280
their ratings.
I'll do that because that's what they

582
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:44,250
survive on is you're going to rate them
so

583
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,640
they,
they want to float the subject that

584
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,500
you're going to be rating them when they
get out.

585
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,050
And they,
I,

586
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,940
I've heard a disproportionate amount of
uber drivers say,

587
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:55,050
um,
you know,

588
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,690
I usually get good ratings.
I had this one person who I thought I

589
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,940
had done a good job for,
oh,

590
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,240
give me a bad rating.
So I think they're,

591
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,620
they're,
they're pumping you to get out and give

592
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,190
them a whatever,
the highest number of stars you should

593
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,510
get ahead of that.
When you get in the car,

594
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:10,110
go,
hey man,

595
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,030
here's the deal.
I'll give you five stars.

596
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,130
Just don't talk.
Get me there.

597
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,610
All right,
I thought,

598
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,950
let's go.
He'll play any crazy music,

599
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,340
right?
You're starting at fivestars.

600
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:21,150
Yeah.
You're,

601
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,070
you're already there.
Just leave me alone.

602
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,750
Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.

603
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,190
Let me be in some of my own head.

604
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,700
If you talk about ratings,
that knocks the star off.

605
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,930
Yeah,
yeah.

606
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,080
It becomes a problem when when there's a
forced conversation always,

607
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,000
and if you're paying for that force
conversation,

608
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:36,780
you're like,
okay,

609
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,300
it's one thing like you want to be
cordial and you want to be friendly.

610
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:39,691
Like,
hey,

611
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,800
how you doing?
Nice to meet you.

612
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,683
All right,
cool.

613
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,700
But then if they start interviewing you
car service people from years of doing

614
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,580
this there,
there's two kinds there.

615
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,030
The kinds of drivers who they don't want
to talk to anybody,

616
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,430
they they,
that's why they liked this kind of job.

617
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,990
They don't have to talk to anybody.
And then you have the type of driver who

618
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,870
likes a captive audience.
Ooh.

619
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,830
And they will not stop talking.
You know what a real problem has been?

620
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,120
If me and my friends,
I say we get a car service in the road

621
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,690
and we're having like a serious
conversation and then they interrupt and

622
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:17,970
start chiming in like,
Hey,

623
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,720
well I think the problem is that women
don't understand what men really want.

624
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,210
Oh,
what the fuck is this guy?

625
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,040
Right?
What are you doing?

626
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,970
And if it's like really,
um,

627
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,840
politically weighted or something like
that,

628
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:34,350
you're going,
you're driving me three miles and I

629
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,330
don't want to get into a political,
it's not tit for tat.

630
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,980
I got an a,
I got an a cab in Las Vegas and I was

631
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,280
going to the Las Vegas Hilton and I get
in the back and I said,

632
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:45,900
Las Vegas Hilton.
I was already on the strip.

633
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,800
And he said,
uh,

634
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,100
I'm not making this up.
He goes,

635
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,120
oh,
that's not too far.

636
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:56,121
That won't be too much of a problem for
my anus.

637
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,910
And I said,
excuse me.

638
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,460
He used the word anus.
I'm trying to think of another word.

639
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,320
He used it.
He didn't say ass.

640
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,690
Is there another word between ass and
anus?

641
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,700
Rectum.
Oh,

642
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,980
my wreck.
I think he said it was something like

643
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,500
rectum,
you know,

644
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,380
forcing me into the following question.
Oh,

645
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,480
what's,
what's with your,

646
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,740
with your rectum now you've got an end.
He said that he had had an operation.

647
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:27,600
He had recently had an operation and
long drives are challenging for them,

648
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,800
but my drive over to the Las Vegas
Hilton isn't too long,

649
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:35,400
so there won't be too uncomfortable.
And I found it quite odd that I had

650
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:40,401
known this man for five seconds and we
were talking about that part of his

651
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,530
body.
Yeah.

652
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:41,980
You got to get

653
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,380
ahead of that.
When a guy like that says something like

654
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:44,950
that,
you've got to go,

655
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,783
okay,
good.

656
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,920
Well I'll go talk,
grow the amount of space for me to drive

657
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,380
or don't have to worry about my rectum
fallen out.

658
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,483
Okay,
cool.

659
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,130
See,
you're better at these things than I am.

660
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,110
I deal with a lot more dumb people than
you do.

661
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,340
I think.
Well,

662
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,390
from doing fear factor for six years,
I got a phd in questionable humans.

663
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,250
Most of them were wonderful people,
but uh,

664
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,930
every show I had to deal with one
person.

665
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,110
Like what the fuck?
Jesus Christ.

666
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,490
Yeah.
So how did you do?

667
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,700
You did that for awhile and then they
brought it back.

668
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,060
They brought it back for seven episodes
but only six aired because the seventh

669
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,110
one week we had people drink calm.
Ah Huh.

670
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,640
And that killed the show.
Second time I was actually happy I

671
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,530
killed the second time because a,
it was a mistake.

672
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,970
My Shit,
I should have done it,

673
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,380
but it was a bunch of old friends like
the people that were producing it.

674
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,830
We're good friends and it was the
opportunity to work with them and it was

675
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:53,500
a shitload of money and it was like I
just got talked into it.

676
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,370
It was like,
come on,

677
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:55,270
it'll be fun.
Like,

678
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,670
Oh,
you talking about the whole experience?

679
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:01,320
I thought you meant the particular
episode where had no,

680
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,910
now the particular episode,
I couldn't fucking believe it when they

681
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:05,620
said that's what they were supposed to
do.

682
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I went,
what human or from a mule mule com we

683
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:13,750
actually discussed this.
That's not so bad.

684
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,030
We actually discussed this yesterday.
Oddly enough with Eliza,

685
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,840
I don't mean to cover,
yeah,

686
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,580
I can't believe it's coming up two days
in a row,

687
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,850
but that happens sometimes,
like subjects come in waves and it's

688
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,250
not,
even if I bring them up for whatever

689
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,810
reason,
they come in waves.

690
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,480
Oh,
I didn't mean to force you into bringing

691
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,500
up that subject again.
Well,

692
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,870
the other problem with the second season
of fear factor,

693
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,520
and I can say this now because it didn't
happen,

694
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,080
is I was worried we're going to kill
somebody.

695
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,320
I was really worried.
It's like it seemed too dangerous.

696
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,430
Like they were ramping up the stunts and
they were making things like way more

697
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:49,480
spectacular and you're,
you're just taking bigger chances and

698
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,460
there,
there was a lot of downtime in between

699
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,170
starts.
There was a lot of preparation,

700
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:55,540
there was a lot of like checks and
balances and they,

701
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,100
they really wanted to make sure that
everything was tested and double tested

702
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,410
and they really mapped it out well,
but it was still,

703
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,440
there were some hair raising things he's
fucking people how to do.

704
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Maybe fear was too far.
Maybe it should have been like mildly

705
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,340
uncomfortable factor where you put
people like in mildly uncomfortable

706
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,590
situations like,
Hey,

707
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,380
I want you to go over and talk to that
woman.

708
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,860
She seems kind of attractive,
you know what I mean?

709
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,860
And so it's kind of a mildly
uncomfortable and the no one's going to

710
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,330
die.
No one's going to,

711
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,240
they might,
if she kills you there,

712
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,780
there's um,
they're doing a new one with ludicrous.

713
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:38,140
It's kind of that way.
There's a new fear factor and ludicrous.

714
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,960
The rapper is the host and like some of
the fears of like forgetting your cell

715
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,600
phone somewhere like for like,
right,

716
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,860
isn't it?
Something stupid like that.

717
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,660
And they don't have to eat anything
gross.

718
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,490
Mm hmm.
Which was a,

719
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,240
it was really dumped and keep that out
because that was one of the most popular

720
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:56,990
parts of the original series that was
gigantic.

721
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:01,310
Like the eating gross shit part as huge.
I have to be honest with you.

722
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,320
That was the,
I couldn't watch that.

723
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,540
That was the hard part for I,
I don't,

724
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,763
I hear you.

725
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,610
You know,
it was hard for me to watch somebody do

726
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:14,540
something cause I wouldn't eat it or
drink it and I don't want to watch

727
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,800
somebody else do that.
But that's,

728
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,940
yeah,
I'm with you.

729
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,550
I mean I wouldn't have won.
Well that's not true.

730
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,890
I watched,
uh,

731
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,930
somebody sent me a clip of Steevo with a
gas mask on and I tweeted it,

732
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,060
some guy farting into a tube and it goes
right in the Steve O's face and he threw

733
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:38,240
up into the mask and I laughed so hard
that I retweeted it

734
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,410
and yeah,
you send it to me.

735
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,010
It was actually quite rude of him,
but it was in response to Eliza

736
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:48,740
slessinger his appearance yesterday on
the podcast.

737
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,180
We'll look at this.
Look,

738
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,070
this guy's got a fart into this tube and
the tube goes right in Steve O's face.

739
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:58,080
Look at this.
He farts and Steve [inaudible].

740
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,500
Oh,
hello.

741
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,500
I liked it.
I almost threw up right there.

742
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:15,260
I almost threw up.
I'd like to bring like a

743
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,830
revived from the dead,
like Edgar Allen Poe or Mark Twain and

744
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:23,950
put them in a time machine and bring
them to now and go,

745
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,470
all the stuff you did was make really
cool.

746
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,280
Check out what we're doing now and then
show them that video.

747
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,620
Well they didn't even what the video
back then.

748
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:37,621
If Eduardo had a cell phone camera,
he might have given up on poetry like

749
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:43,310
fuck all this Raven's stuff.
Nobody's buying these days.

750
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,740
Blackbird poems.
Does anybody have like a gas mask?

751
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,210
You had a fat guy to party to to let's
make some real entertainment.

752
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,500
Oh Wow.
I mean wonder what I mean that's,

753
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,520
that's a real question,
right?

754
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,830
Like what,
what would people have done?

755
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,550
Like some of the great works,
the people that created like amazing

756
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:08,530
music where they composed incredible
music or they wrote great books or

757
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,160
poetry.

758
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,100
There wasn't a lot of outlets for your
creativity back then.

759
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,720
I mean,
it wasn't even stand up comedy.

760
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:16,750
There was no music videos.
There was nothing that you could do.

761
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,170
You know,
that we take for granted today.

762
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,050
It's so commonplace.
Yeah.

763
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,650
I mean,
if you really stop and think about it,

764
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,320
but I mean it's gone too.
I mean,

765
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:28,720
that's the extreme,
but that's like,

766
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,480
how do you go steve o's a fucking
maniac.

767
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:33,490
I mean,
I like that.

768
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:35,560
All different kinds of things that get
explored.

769
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:36,341
I,
I truly do.

770
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,620
I like that.
You know,

771
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:40,290
somebody wants to do that,
but people can be entertained by that.

772
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,910
But it's definitely,
that's sort of the end of the line,

773
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:45,840
isn't it?
Yes.

774
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,430
You know what,
what's,

775
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,263
what,
what,

776
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,370
what could be more outrageous,
steve?

777
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,300
Oh,
we'll find it.

778
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,210
If it's out there further.
Like you,

779
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,020
I was with him in Vegas a couple of
weeks ago.

780
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,500
He came to the UFC and um,
we,

781
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,120
we went to dinner and we were talking
and we're hanging in,

782
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,870
we're hanging out and he's telling me
all these things that he's planning on

783
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,671
doing.
Like I'm,

784
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:08,500
I light myself on fire and then I'm
going to jump into traffic and then I'm

785
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:11,730
going to pop port wire around my deck
and now I'm like,

786
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:12,410
what?
Why,

787
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,210
why are you doing all this man?
And then a guy's going to hit me with a

788
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,400
paddle.
Why those things are written in a

789
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:18,120
notebook.
Yeah,

790
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,850
well he's just,
he's always got to take it to another

791
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:23,850
place.
Know he recently had to cancel shows in

792
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:28,530
Denver because he lit himself on fire
and the,

793
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,920
the burns were so bad that when he went
to the doctor,

794
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,540
you know,
he just wanted to get treated.

795
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,500
He's like,
I'm in pain.

796
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,281
They were like,
Whoa,

797
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,090
Whoa,
whoa dude.

798
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,000
You need fucking skin graphs.
Like immediately.

799
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,300
And so he got to get skin grafts like
all over his arms.

800
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,560
Like,
like look at that.

801
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,430
That's his skin popping and all the
blisters and that's all,

802
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,990
you know,
massive burns.

803
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,700
He lit himself on fire and then did like
fire angels,

804
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,700
like rolled around.
Yeah.

805
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,310
Underground.
And so he had to cancel his gigs.

806
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,470
I think he was at the comedy works in
Denver.

807
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,240
Look at that.
You could see through his skin,

808
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:09,090
look at all the liquid in his skin when
he moves up to that again,

809
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,500
pulled out again.
That's amazing.

810
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,150
Mm hmm.
Oh,

811
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,920
it's an instagram video.
That's crazy.

812
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:18,180
Like how you could see the all the pus
roll back and forth and that's quite

813
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,030
fascinating for whatever reason why I'm
interested in that.

814
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,690
So that doesn't interest you.
What?

815
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,290
You're in a sensible guy,
Brian Regan what you get?

816
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,470
Sell some tickets.
I might.

817
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,120
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

818
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,300
That's his thing.
I'm going to be in San Diego and in

819
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:37,710
between shows I'm going to be a lighting
myself on fire and having like a body

820
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,760
fluids in,
in sacks of pus hanging from my arms.

821
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,680
You're going video tape.
It will sure be hard to just write about

822
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,810
it.
What did he did it until he,

823
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,010
for one fan,
you know it was like a personal

824
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,930
experience like no one else needs to
know.

825
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:55,590
I'm just going to light myself on fire
and then I'm going to get burns and I'm

826
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:59,310
going to do like this little puss dance
just for one person.

827
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,350
It's very intimate and personal.
Let me,

828
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,430
let me think about it.
I'm going to,

829
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,830
I'm going to mull it over.
I'm going to mull that one over.

830
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,840
What do you do for fun man?

831
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,240
Besides play golf.
Do you have any weird interests?

832
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,400
Um,
I like watching police chases on

833
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:16,190
youtube.
Did you,

834
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,100
why?
What bothers me is when they put the end

835
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,930
and the explanation,
oh yeah,

836
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,240
I hate that.
I want,

837
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,000
it's a little drama.
I don't know how it's going to end.

838
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:27,781
Don't put,
you know,

839
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:32,640
police chase ends in shooting.
Don't put police chase ends and crash.

840
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,670
Just put police chase and let me find,
do you remember a few years back there

841
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,090
was a,
there was a thing that they did on

842
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:44,470
television where there was some sort of
a situation where there was a guy who

843
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:48,370
was a,
he was over a bridge and he had a gun in

844
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:51,730
his mouth and it was on television.
Do you remember that?

845
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,830
And then he shot himself on TV and they
had apologized because they showed this

846
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:01,600
guy getting shot on tv and it was like
this really shocking moment for people.

847
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,990
And I was just thinking that that's not
even shocking anymore.

848
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,750
Like the exact same thing today I'd be
like,

849
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,420
yeah,
well now they pull back.

850
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,400
Yeah.
W W when,

851
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,410
when a guy gets out of a car and if it's
unclear whether you know he's giving up

852
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,650
the,
the,

853
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,650
the cameras from the news media will
pull back to prevent people from seeing

854
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:25,210
something graphic.
You hear him go pull back,

855
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:26,770
pull back,
pull back because I don't know if

856
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,510
there's a shooting is about to take
place.

857
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,160
I don't know.
I don't like that part of it.

858
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,800
I don't,
I don't like to see that hardcore

859
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,680
violence.
I just like the drama of,

860
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,500
you know,
um,

861
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm always intrigued with what these
people are thinking.

862
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,240
Are they thinking they're going to get
away?

863
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,560
You know,
and it's like there's 75 cop cars

864
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,560
chasing you.
There's helicopters overhead.

865
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,280
Do you think you're going to get away
nail?

866
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
And it fascinates me.
Has Anybody ever gotten away?

867
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,700
What does this,
some people have though?

868
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,890
I'm in a high speed chase,
bro.

869
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,630
A suspect broadcast on facebook live
this way,

870
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,270
your suit now this is a new thing where
when they're being chased,

871
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,850
they've,
they video themselves.

872
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,150
It's this guy's driving a truck

873
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,860
two and a half hours long this week.
I've seen this two fields and whatnot.

874
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,420
How's he grandma?
I love you.

875
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,160
He says,
how does he have enough gas?

876
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,670
He stopped a few times and unloaded the
ship.

877
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,600
Good move.
The cops tried to get them.

878
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,120
Oh,
that's interesting.

879
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,560
He stopped and,
oh,

880
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,180
he's hanging out of the truck,
but look at,

881
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:32,940
I watch this guy.
Oh yeah,

882
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,050
that was the end.
He was,

883
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,130
he was going up.
There was about a minute of him driving

884
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,350
in reverse prior to that.
What happened?

885
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:41,184
They tase him.
Yeah.

886
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,750
And then he ended up in that little pond
or whatever and he's smoking weed.

887
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,800
I love these people,

888
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,370
guy and that girl with their plastic
faces.

889
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,280
The show live pd that's been on on
Fridays and Saturdays?

890
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,780
No,
it's a,

891
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,340
it goes viral.
Viral.

892
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,010
Is that a weird word to use?
But it's trending on twitter every night

893
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:01,370
because they're technically live with
police like this in five or six,

894
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:03,640
seven different cities.
Um,

895
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,710
but I think Friday and Saturday nights
and they just follow what's happening.

896
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:10,310
If someone's getting pulled over for
speeding or drugs or whatever it is.

897
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:12,350
And they just kind of followed the whole
like cops used to be,

898
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:15,640
but it's literally live.
Here's the question about like is that

899
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,670
currently this is,
we're living in a time where people

900
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,650
absolutely want attention at any cost.
And does this go back to that because I

901
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:26,800
love those fucking people.
Those people pause that for a second.

902
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,650
These fucking people,
these broadcast people.

903
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
Oh it does it make it blurs it out when
you're,

904
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,130
it doesn't matter.
Those people to broadcast news people

905
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:39,680
are so odd today cause they're,
they're like a relic of a forgotten time

906
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,040
and I were,
were talking like this was acceptable

907
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,620
and seems like they're dying.
They just nothing left of that.

908
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:49,340
Like that won't,
that won't exist in 20 years.

909
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,620
It's not,
it's not going to be like that on the

910
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,100
news a because it has already like
evolved away from that with a lot of

911
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:56,240
radio.
You know how that was like the

912
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:00,560
stereotypical [inaudible] and then more
and more radio hosts.

913
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,790
We're going,
this is hacky.

914
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,150
We need to just be ourselves.
Well Howard stern but it hasn't done it

915
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:05,721
yet.
Yes,

916
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:08,000
exactly.
But it hasn't done it yet with

917
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:11,040
newscasters.
They still have the low book.

918
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,550
Howard stern singlehandedly killed the
morning joc voice singlehandedly.

919
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,830
Cause I mean it just seems so
preposterous when you would listen to

920
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,200
him be himself and then you would listen
to,

921
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,480
hey,
we're coming up next with some crazy

922
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,940
Brian Regan's in town.
What a funny guy.

923
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:31,030
Really right back
facts,

924
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,890
you know?
Do you think that these shows though,

925
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:38,450
like this show that you were talking
about Jamie,

926
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,720
don't you think that they kind of
encourage this kind of behavior?

927
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:45,020
I mean,
if there's ever an argument that that is

928
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,590
very counterproductive for our society,
like that's,

929
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:51,860
that's almost like you're,
you're asking people to submit content

930
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,750
for this wacky chase show.
Didn't you say that?

931
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,160
Like it comes on at a specific time,
so how can it actually be,

932
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,630
they know people don't know that chases
are going to take place at a specific

933
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:03,920
time on a specific day.

934
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,330
Yeah.
Because if you made it live,

935
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,310
if you made it a live show,
we're like,

936
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:09,200
it's chase Friday.
Who's gonna run?

937
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,050
Who's gonna ride somebody who's going to
do it on purpose.

938
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,370
Yeah.
And by the way,

939
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:18,371
now they are fucking selling cars that
are so much faster than any cop car.

940
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:24,150
The corvette just released a new zr one
that has 750 plus horsepower.

941
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,340
They think it's going to do an under
seven minute lap of the nurburgring in

942
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:35,300
Germany.
I mean this is a fucking insane car that

943
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,520
there's not a god damn cop car in the
world.

944
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,900
It's going to be able to catch that
thing.

945
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,560
You're going to be able to go into a
corvette dealership by one of those

946
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,100
things and you,
you will be so much more powerful than

947
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:50,570
any cop car on the road,
but it's still not going to outrun a

948
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:51,140
helicopter.

949
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,973
Right,
exactly.

950
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,930
So,
but it is weird,

951
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,730
right?
Yeah.

952
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,570
By one of those and they keep,
here's the thing,

953
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:01,490
like you know what Moore's law is when
it comes to computer processing power?

954
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,330
I do not think so.
It's a law of escalation essentially

955
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:08,030
that you know,
every year computers are going to get

956
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,370
exponentially more powerful and they're
going to keep,

957
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,000
it's kind of like bottom now because
it's really no need for them to get any

958
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,320
more.
Like special,

959
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:18,110
like personal use.
They've gotten more powerful but not,

960
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,410
not that much more powerful,
but it's going to keep going.

961
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,030
It's gonna keep going.
It's gonna keep going.

962
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:25,670
They're going to get better and better
to force consumerism,

963
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:28,040
right.
Force people to purchase these things

964
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,350
with cars.
The problem is you're about

965
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:32,430
acceleration.

966
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,610
Like acceleration is one of the things
that people prize the most like zero to

967
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,300
60 there's cars now that you can buy
right off the lot.

968
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,420
That goes zero to 60 in two seconds.
I get no joy out of that in a car that

969
00:44:46,331 --> 00:44:49,170
that doesn't,
that doesn't thrill me.

970
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Kind of a man of you to be in a car and
see how quickly I could be going fast

971
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,570
and lots of,
I don't mind it being gradual.

972
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I don't mind if it took me
10 minutes to get to six to 60 miles an

973
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:05,910
hour,
as long as I could eventually get to 60

974
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,710
you say that,
but you want to be able to merge onto

975
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,700
the highway.
Tru,

976
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,010
Tru.
I want to be able to function in my

977
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,380
automobile,
but I don't get a rush out of a,

978
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,990
oh by the way,
I did do the Nascar thing where you

979
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,730
drive the cars.

980
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:18,730
Have you ever done that?
No,

981
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,700
I did it where?
Um,

982
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,210
at first I was a passenger,
somebody else drove it and then I drove

983
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:27,930
one that was a rush.
So maybe I do like the zero to 60 thing.

984
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,070
Yeah,
you just haven't done it.

985
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,480
That was on the track in Las Vegas at
the Las Vegas Motor speedway or whatever

986
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,940
it's called.
Most people who think they don't like

987
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,340
fast cars had never really driven a fast
car.

988
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,110
I tell you what,
it was pretty intense.

989
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,170
I was either averaging 135 or top speed,
135.

990
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,480
I forget.
They monitor it.

991
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,420
You do like 10 laps or something like
that.

992
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,730
And uh,
those,

993
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,670
uh,
those stick shifts or is it a pencil?

994
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,280
It's a stick shift and I hadn't driven a
stick and a while.

995
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,510
You know,
it was embarrassing because you,

996
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,970
you do the stick to get out of the pits,
but then once you get on the track,

997
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,740
you're in whatever the the most is your,
it's that the whole time until you go

998
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:09,360
back into the pits really.

999
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,610
So it's just stick to get in and out of
the pits.

1000
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,090
So how many gears is it?
I forget if I forget three four.

1001
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:19,080
And you take a class before and they
show you how to do it.

1002
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,190
But when I was coming out to start,
I was just like all dolling it and the

1003
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:27,210
guy had to run up next to me and like
come in and do the stick shift where he

1004
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:31,590
was so embarrassing.
I'm behind the wheel of a Nascar car and

1005
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:35,820
there's a guy running alongside getting
it in the proper gear for me.

1006
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,230
What was the last time you drove tick?

1007
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,810
30 years ago.
I,

1008
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,330
you know,
I had a datsun five 10 years ago and I

1009
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:47,160
don't like it.
I never got used to it.

1010
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,001
No,
no.

1011
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:49,680
I,
I never,

1012
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,431
you know,
people say,

1013
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:51,840
well you drive it for a while,
then you get used to it.

1014
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,380
I never did.
I used to hate that [inaudible] of being

1015
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,200
on a hill.
You know what I mean?

1016
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,600
And like there's a car too close behind
you and you're like,

1017
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,840
ah,
and,

1018
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,770
and so you've got to switch it into the
gear and then you know,

1019
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,310
you go back like a foot and a half and
then you're just Holland forward.

1020
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:13,740
You just need a break.
You just need a handle,

1021
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:16,050
a break,
and then you hold onto the e brake and

1022
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:18,600
then you slowly,
gently let it go into gear and then let

1023
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,180
go the break.
I didn't know that technique.

1024
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,000
And he has a problem with like modern
cars that are stick shifts.

1025
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,860
They have buttons for [inaudible]
breaks.

1026
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:28,640
And you don't want that.
I was in my,

1027
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,810
my,
my brother was driving me one time,

1028
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:32,360
I,
I,

1029
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,360
I was 15 and he was making a turn on a
dangerous intersection and the break in

1030
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,390
the middle.
Yeah,

1031
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,180
the break.
That's okay.

1032
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,580
I didn't know what it was.
Oh.

1033
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,000
So I,
I did it while he was making the turn.

1034
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,800
I said,
what does this do when I pushed the

1035
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,520
button and hold it up?
And it's the only time my brother ever

1036
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:56,950
punched me in the arm.
He just goes

1037
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,710
sideways.
Cars were coming.

1038
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,540
They had to slam on their brakes.
He's like,

1039
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:08,500
why the hell would,
I didn't know what it was.

1040
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,900
We'll just pull it up in the middle,
you know,

1041
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,330
that's why you're a comedian.
Impulsive buttons.

1042
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,010
Push them and find out.
Yeah,

1043
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,413
there's a,

1044
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,570
so that engineer those into certain
cars,

1045
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,130
like if he know Ken Block is
[inaudible],

1046
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,450
Ken Block is a very famous driver and
uh,

1047
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,510
he has this Mustang called a Hoon again,
is this crazy 1968,

1048
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,020
I believe,
Mustang that has four wheel drive and

1049
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,150
some fucking insane amount of
horsepower.

1050
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:49,530
And there's these incredible videos of
him driving these things around.

1051
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,250
And one of the things that he does is
when he wants to go sideways,

1052
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:57,450
he's shifting gears and he slams the e
brake as he's driving.

1053
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,180
Like here,
you can see the,

1054
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,630
give us some volume on this,
see that big thing.

1055
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,280
He's got two things next to him.
One of them is a shifter and then the

1056
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:09,120
other one is an e brake.
And so as he's driving,

1057
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,270
I don't,
I don't know enough about his,

1058
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,550
his methods.
I would love to talk to him one day,

1059
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,810
65 Mustang.

1060
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,620
It's a fucking crazy car man.
I mean it's like straight road warrior.

1061
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,070
And is this the Pike's peak one?
Yeah,

1062
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,100
I mean this guy's a fucking madman.
I mean a real and a master of the

1063
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:32,160
automobile.
And you watch him as he's driving and

1064
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:37,161
his God damn mesmerizing because he is
on the edge the entire time of this

1065
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:39,780
video.
See that right there.

1066
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,030
The one on the right hand side,
that's an outbreak.

1067
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,020
So he's in,
he's shifting and then he's going to pop

1068
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:48,120
the e brake and then he's going to shift
forward and,

1069
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:51,720
but watch this motherfucker go see right
here.

1070
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,600
If I was sitting next to him,
I would hit the break right now.

1071
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:55,111
Yeah,
go.

1072
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:56,640
What does this do?
Well,

1073
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:59,130
his I'm shifter is a different kind of
shifter.

1074
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,100
It's what's called a sequential manual
gearbox,

1075
00:50:02,101 --> 00:50:05,280
which means you don't have a,
an h pattern where you go up,

1076
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:08,500
down and to the right until the end,
down to the road.

1077
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,180
Instead you're going up for up gear and
down for down gear.

1078
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,370
So you just punch it for,
but look at this shit.

1079
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,660
He's like on the edge all the time.
See how he keeps hitting the brake and

1080
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:21,720
then going sideways.
And then he's fucking mad,

1081
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:23,690
man.
He's a mad man.

1082
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,520
Look at this.
But the control that he has with his

1083
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,460
car,
just insane.

1084
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,170
It's a,
it's art.

1085
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:30,981
Oh it isn't.
You know,

1086
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,350
he's like an artist with his vehicle.
He really is.

1087
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:33,950
I mean,
if,

1088
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,450
especially if you're a person like
myself who's an automobile enthusiast

1089
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:43,070
and you get to watch this guy who's just
on the razor's edge of,

1090
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,690
of control.
I mean,

1091
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:46,520
look how he's going around.
There's cliffs,

1092
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,520
there's rocks everywhere.
The fucking trees and shit.

1093
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,320
Guard rails.
He's sideways.

1094
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,510
I mean,
and this is,

1095
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,100
and is not a long look,
is a two lane road.

1096
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,380
It's fucking incredible.
But the manipulation of the two things

1097
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:04,640
of the e brake wear locks up the back
wheels and then look at it.

1098
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,650
Look at how he's going in between these
cones.

1099
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,440
Are these stacks of whatever the fuck
they are?

1100
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:10,880
That'd be great leg.
If he,

1101
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:14,120
you know,
ask some woman out to dinner and say,

1102
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,880
I know a cozy little restaurant at the
top of this hill and then drive driver

1103
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,520
like that to the top.
Well you'd get timmy seatbelt on,

1104
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:24,410
honey,
you'd get a girl wants to fuck you

1105
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:28,100
immediately and then you'd get a girl
who wants to have you killed.

1106
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,140
He just never wants to talk to you
again.

1107
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,810
And she can't wait to go home and write
a blog about what a piece of shit you

1108
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:33,644
are.

1109
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,450
See,
when I bring a woman to a restaurant at

1110
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:39,230
the top,
I go,

1111
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,380
I don't know if you know,
but this car goes from zero to 60 in

1112
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:44,390
about 10 minutes.
Yeah.

1113
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,850
She's going to die in an intersection
like this.

1114
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,620
Motherfucker can't,
he can't accelerate.

1115
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,510
Look at him driving around cities.
And this is downtown La.

1116
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,550
This is London.
Oh,

1117
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:54,140
okay.
He's done in downtown la too.

1118
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,640
He goes,
he goes into those,

1119
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:57,230
uh,
under bridges and shit.

1120
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,600
So they close off streets for him to do
this.

1121
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,040
He's a madman and that car is fucking
beautiful.

1122
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,100
It's a crazy car.
Tubes get it because he widen the

1123
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:09,800
stance.
A lot of people hate it because he took

1124
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:12,350
essentially,
which is an amazing classic car from

1125
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:15,800
1965 and they butchered it,
changed it,

1126
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,620
put a roll cage in it,
stiffened it up and did all this

1127
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:19,550
different shit to it.

1128
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,720
I would try it just so they would
completely empty all the streets of a

1129
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:26,330
major city for me,
just so can to get where I'm going.

1130
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,540
What kind of car do you drive?
I just got a new car.

1131
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,060
I just yesterday.
Do you know what it is?

1132
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,790
Um,
I think it's written on,

1133
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,460
don't they write it on the sign system?
It's a 18.

1134
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,510
Escolade.
Oh,

1135
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:43,550
those are great.
I rented it.

1136
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,590
I rent those all the time,
but I rented one recently.

1137
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,060
They're great.
I love those things.

1138
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,960
So I just,
uh,

1139
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,170
I just got that they're so comfortable.
Yeah,

1140
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,720
that's a great God damn car.
The guy was showing me all the,

1141
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:57,230
all the stuff and I felt like going,
just stop,

1142
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:58,130
stop.
I don't,

1143
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,160
I don't literally back massage in the,
I'm like,

1144
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,750
I just need the gas and the brake and
the radio.

1145
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,570
You know what else does too and it's
like kind of it.

1146
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,300
If you're about to change lanes and you
fuck if like someone's too close,

1147
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,070
it'll give you like give you like a
vibration.

1148
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,290
I'll let you know that like there's
something on that side.

1149
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,550
He said that if you don't have your
blinker on,

1150
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,740
I haven't tried this yet.
If you don't have your blinker on and

1151
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:25,980
you to cross the line,

1152
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,180
it will automatically pull you back.
Whereas if you have your blinker on,

1153
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,090
then the car knows.
I don't know if he was just bs thing or

1154
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:34,410
what,
but that's what he told to make a quick

1155
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,680
maneuver.
That's what I said.

1156
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,680
So what if?
What if you're trying to,

1157
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,480
yeah,
to get over.

1158
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,730
You know the card is going to take over
that.

1159
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:44,010
I think that's quite strange.
Yeah.

1160
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,190
I'm torn because on one hand I love
gadgets.

1161
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,920
I love technology and I'm fascinated by
that.

1162
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:52,650
But another hand,
like the connection that you have to the

1163
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:56,040
actual mechanical feeling of the
automobile is,

1164
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,440
is very muted.
Also,

1165
00:53:58,441 --> 00:53:59,600
have you heard about,
you know,

1166
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,620
the technology is getting closer to
closer to self driving cars and,

1167
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,550
but now there's the moral component and
they're like,

1168
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:12,450
if you're not in charge of the car and
the car is about to have an accident,

1169
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,750
the human being has the decision to make
a moral choice.

1170
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,883
If there's,
uh,

1171
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,850
a woman with a baby stroller on the
right and there's a cliff on the left

1172
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:24,360
and you have your family in the back,
are you making a left or a right?

1173
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,690
The human can make a conscious decision.
A computerized car can't make a decision

1174
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,890
and they actually are trying to figure
out how to have the cars make moral

1175
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:41,250
decisions and keeping with your own
moral decisions.

1176
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:43,080
You can,
you can gauge it and go,

1177
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:47,070
I'm more for my family or I'm more for a
more altruistic yeah,

1178
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,993
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1179
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,730
Yeah.
So what like what would a car do?

1180
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:51,840
Like if it's like,
well there's a,

1181
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,970
uh,
a family,

1182
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,720
there's an older guy over here and
there's a young woman with a child over

1183
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,120
here and you have to hit one.
Jesus.

1184
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,450
How does a computer make that decision?
Yeah,

1185
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,360
it doesn't.
Or the decision to,

1186
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,400
yeah,
the cliff thing.

1187
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,850
It's a good one.
Like does it run into the child and the

1188
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,610
woman or does it go off the cliff and
kill everyone in the car?

1189
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,200
Exactly.
Or if your bike,

1190
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,500
and it would be different if you're by
yourself or if you have your family.

1191
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,610
Like I will say my family,
but maybe I would go myself if it were a

1192
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,870
baby,
you know what I mean?

1193
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:27,810
Like,
but a human can make that decision in a

1194
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:29,220
split second,
but a computer,

1195
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:30,630
what's it supposed to do?
Well,

1196
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:33,330
one of the things that's gotten much
better that I think is amazing,

1197
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:37,230
it's breaking like your car can brake so
much faster now.

1198
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,560
They have a amazing breaks now in cars.
And though as as technology gets better

1199
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:45,390
and better in that regard,
you're going to be able to prevent a lot

1200
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:48,720
of collisions.
The other thing is that with car to car

1201
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,660
collisions,
there's some talk about developing

1202
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:55,950
technology that literally has cars repel
from each other.

1203
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,960
It's sorta like how magnets do and that
if they could figure out a way to make

1204
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:05,640
that efficient and effective enough,
they can virtually eliminate car

1205
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:08,790
accidents with those two things,
with automated vehicles.

1206
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,340
Um,
and then with the,

1207
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:15,000
the kind of technology that would force
cars to repel from each other.

1208
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,610
A bunch of repelling magnets.
Yeah.

1209
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,640
I mean,
just put repelling magnets on every car.

1210
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:24,190
So they're just the camp.
They can't get any closer than five

1211
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,780
feet from each other.
Then the real question is like,

1212
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,460
what if you get close to a deal with a
pacemaker and you just fucking ice and

1213
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:32,230
taking a right turn?
This guy just drops right there.

1214
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,150
So all the cars are safe.
But this guy,

1215
00:56:35,151 --> 00:56:38,050
he's given a massive heart attack.
That's the thing with pacemakers,

1216
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:38,950
right?
Magnets.

1217
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,520
I think so.
I think magnesium really fuck up

1218
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,010
pacemakers.
Hmm.

1219
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,760
Hmm.
Did you see that Christian Bale is going

1220
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:48,990
to play Dick Cheney?
Speaking of Pacemakers,

1221
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,040
um,
you know Dick Cheney at one point in

1222
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:54,550
time literally is the antichrist.
He had no pulse.

1223
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,910
He had some kind of crazy heart valve
thing where,

1224
00:56:57,911 --> 00:57:00,610
uh,
he had some artificial heart in his body

1225
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,390
that literally was pumping the blood
constantly with no heartbeat.

1226
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,210
So he had no heartbeat.
That's strange.

1227
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,520
It's terrifying when you think of what
an evil,

1228
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:13,600
fuck that Guy Christian Bale looks
almost unrecognizable after putting on

1229
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,790
weight and shaving head for Dick Cheney
role.

1230
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,010
You know what he looks like?
He looks like the guy who designs

1231
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,690
iphones.
You know that God,

1232
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:21,460
the Chris didn't demand who talks like
this.

1233
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:23,800
The amazing oled led screen.
Yeah,

1234
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,830
right.
Am I wrong?

1235
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,640
Did you see what he lama said that he's
a,

1236
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,850
they're making a big announcement this
week about what?

1237
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,830
The semi truck.
Oh,

1238
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:35,920
the going to have an automated truck
blow your mind or pull your head clear

1239
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,300
out of your skull.
Interesting.

1240
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,570
Into an alternate dimension.
Just need to find my portal gun.

1241
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:41,920
He's a weird cat,
isn't he?

1242
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,970
He's got a lot of shit going on.
You talk about guys do a lot of things

1243
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,180
that Elon musk character,
we're thinking a lot of goddamn irons in

1244
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:50,620
the fire.
Isn't he trying to,

1245
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:53,650
uh,
do a manned mission to Mars?

1246
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:54,460
Is there,
yeah,

1247
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,630
he wants to do that.
Yeah.

1248
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,970
Would you go fuck that?

1249
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,210
No.
Here's the thing.

1250
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,270
Space space is infinite.
Space is infinite.

1251
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,060
We are literally in the best
neighborhood in space.

1252
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,560
That's the way I look at it.
When I'm looking at like getting,

1253
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,250
getting to Mars is just like you're,
you're going to a shitty neighborhood

1254
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,320
that you can't return from.
Well,

1255
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:19,060
hopefully you can return from it,
but you can answer.

1256
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:21,310
The plan is to go there and come back.
They're not,

1257
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,690
they're not bringing people there to
die.

1258
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:24,700
There they are.
They're bringing people there to

1259
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,550
colonize them.
Their initial people that go to Mars

1260
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,690
until they figure out how to some way on
Mars to return to earth.

1261
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,600
The people that go to Mars the first
time or just going to stay there.

1262
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,510
I did not know that.
I thought this was get there,

1263
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:39,610
get on his craft and come.
I do not believe so.

1264
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,550
As of two years ago when I had a bit
about it,

1265
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,000
it was all about them going there and
dying there,

1266
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:46,720
Huh?

1267
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,650
You're going to die on Mars and you can
die on Mars with a bunch of other people

1268
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,310
that are so fucking stupid.
They're willing to die on Mars with you.

1269
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,180
You're still in space.
See,

1270
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,550
this is the thing,
we are in space right now.

1271
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,330
We are just in an amazing vehicle for
space travel.

1272
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,940
We're on earth and we're here at
southern Sun,

1273
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,930
sunny southern California where the
weather's beautiful and you've got a

1274
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:10,930
nice starbucks here.
We're sitting here in this beautiful air

1275
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,850
condition studio,
but we're in space.

1276
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,340
Okay.
What'd you send the best spot in space

1277
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,710
to go to?
Mars is just fucking dumb.

1278
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,930
It's a dumb idea.
No,

1279
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,411
no.
We're,

1280
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:25,130
we're we explorers and we will always
want to know what's on the other side of

1281
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:27,520
the mountain.
You know what I think it's like there's

1282
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,350
no stopping us.
I think it's like one of those guys that

1283
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:34,160
creates the very first wingsuit and
jumps off a cliff and then breaks both

1284
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:36,980
of his legs versus you taking a flight
to New Zealand.

1285
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,600
She had to take a fun,
nice flight team.

1286
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,400
You could have a lovely dinner,
catch a nap,

1287
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,530
watch a movie,
land perfectly.

1288
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,360
If flight attendants are all great,
you're a fucking explorer.

1289
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,130
Okay.
That guy's an asshole with broken legs,

1290
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,711
right?
Right,

1291
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:56,530
right.
That guy that did that,

1292
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,210
this the guy that did the wingsuit off
of Mount Everest,

1293
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:02,420
speaking of Youtube clips,
he passed away jumping off some other

1294
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:04,460
mountain.
That's a wonderful way to put it.

1295
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,180
Then he passed away,
passed away.

1296
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,120
He died.
He down.

1297
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,790
I don't know how long ago adventure
athlete dies.

1298
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:14,780
Attempting 22,000 foot wing suit jump.
You know what's uncomfortable about this

1299
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:19,781
to me is one of my very good friends is
andy stump and Andy is a world record

1300
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:24,911
holder in the wing suit jump.
He's a fucking a bonafide maniac navy

1301
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:31,670
seal.
Complete total psychopath who lives for

1302
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:34,010
thrills.
The only thing that's saving andy is

1303
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:35,450
that he's gotten into bow hunting.

1304
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,320
He's now bowhunting constantly and that
is his new thrill ride.

1305
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,980
He should,
he should put on a wing suit,

1306
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:48,550
jump off a mountain with the bow.
He need to be just on,

1307
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,680
I have to go over and fire fire at elk
as you're,

1308
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:57,050
as you're zipping down.
It's totally unethical sir.

1309
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,180
These,
your told that this is a terrible

1310
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:01,820
advice.
This is Andy had the world record for

1311
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:06,440
the longest ever wing wing suit jump.
Is that him flying over the American

1312
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:09,740
flag on his twitter?
He's a maniac.

1313
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,660
Like a legit,
I just people that claim by,

1314
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,140
I'm a maniac man.
Now this guy's a fucking legit maniac.

1315
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,110
So that's obviously a of a plane.
Can't get that high.

1316
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,720
No,
he gets on a plane with an oxygen mask

1317
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:23,390
and shit.
He gets so high that he's,

1318
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,100
you know,
he's in the place where there's no air

1319
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,290
like he would black out if you just
tried to breathe the air.

1320
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,960
What's the craziest thing that you've
done?

1321
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,120
Um,
scary wise.

1322
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,180
You know where you were risking your,
there's him right there.

1323
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,290
It's crazy.
Fuck.

1324
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,330
He's got a podcast too by the way,
folks is very good.

1325
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:41,630
Podcast.
It's called cleared hot with Andy Stump.

1326
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,240
He's a very,
very interesting,

1327
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:45,830
intelligent,
articulate guy.

1328
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,820
So he needs the oxygen cause he's so
hot,

1329
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,820
he's,
I mean he's not just a maniac,

1330
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:51,530
he's a very,
he's a brilliant guy,

1331
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,480
but he's a fucking maniac too.
Um,

1332
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,560
I haven't done anything like that man.
I mean back in my,

1333
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,190
I guess when I was competing,
kickboxing and taekwondo tournaments

1334
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:03,980
were probably the scariest thing is
being in a fight.

1335
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:05,420
Like yeah,
fights are scary,

1336
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,720
you know,
especially the potential to get knocked

1337
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:10,970
unconscious.
You just see a lot of,

1338
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,910
I mean I've,
I've seen a lot of people get knocked

1339
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:18,620
unconscious and all my days I probably,
I probably seen more people get knocked

1340
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:22,020
unconscious then 99.9% of all the people
that have ever lived.

1341
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,120
I think that's a,
that's an honest statement.

1342
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,210
Cause think about all the fights that
I've called.

1343
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:33,060
I've called more than a thousand UFC
fights easily more than,

1344
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,680
I don't know how many hundreds of events
with 10 plus fights on each event.

1345
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,780
And then on top of that,
I've been to so many tournament's

1346
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,870
taekwondo tournaments,
kickboxing events,

1347
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,920
just like just seeing people get
smashed.

1348
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,873
Like,
but that's,

1349
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,980
I've,
I've taken people to fights for the

1350
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:57,981
first time and there's a thing that that
happens when they see like a live fight

1351
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:01,950
for the first time with it.
Just like he see the look on their face.

1352
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:02,680
Like they walk out,
they,

1353
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,410
they're like Jesus Christ.
Like,

1354
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,600
like a,
a good buddy of mine,

1355
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:10,290
Steve Rinella who's a,
he's a hunter is you got a television

1356
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:14,650
show called meter and he's a
conservationist and outdoorsmen and he's

1357
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:19,320
seen a lot of animals die but him going
to see live fights.

1358
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:21,360
They got this,
they have this look on their face like

1359
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:22,830
holy shit.
Like once,

1360
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:26,790
once you see it in your,
their clothes and see the impact and you

1361
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,880
see guys get knocked unconscious and you
see that it,

1362
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:33,150
what happens when someone gets kicked in
the head like right in front of you,

1363
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:34,500
you're like,
Holy Shit,

1364
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,840
I went to one.
Yeah,

1365
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:39,200
you guys were kind enough to invite a
went out with the Hannibal burress.

1366
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:40,070
Yeah,
that was great.

1367
01:03:40,071 --> 01:03:40,910
And,
uh,

1368
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:41,690
yeah,
it was fine.

1369
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,610
That was the first time I'd ever seen
anything like that.

1370
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,380
Hannibal loves it.
Yeah.

1371
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:48,050
And it was like pretty intense.
It was it weird for you?

1372
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:52,160
I thought
he texted me and said,

1373
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:56,190
do you want to go to the fight tonight?
I thought it was,

1374
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:00,020
there was a boxing match cause I live in
Vegas and I thought maybe there's a

1375
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:03,560
boxing match.
So I'm Google boxing matches in Las

1376
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,990
Vegas and nothing came up.
I didn't know what he was talking about.

1377
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:06,891
He goes,
meet me.

1378
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:07,790
What does it,
the MGM,

1379
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,110
yeah,
it was probably the mgm,

1380
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,240
because meet me at the,
we'll call it mgm.

1381
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:13,790
We'll get our tickets.
So I go meet him and he picks up the

1382
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:14,331
tickets.
He goes,

1383
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:17,390
let's go.
I thought we were going into a boxing

1384
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:18,680
match.
We go in the door.

1385
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:22,730
That's the first time I saw the octagon
ring or whatever that is a cage.

1386
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,750
And I'm like,
oh,

1387
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:25,820
it's this.
I didn't even know until I went in

1388
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:27,020
there.
And then,

1389
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:27,531
uh,
you know,

1390
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:32,180
we had good seats close enough.
And so that was the first time watching

1391
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:33,100
it.
It was you guys had,

1392
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,360
you guys got my seats.
You guys were super close.

1393
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:36,710
Yeah,
it was fantastic.

1394
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:41,150
You could see it in a way that it's,
there's something about being really

1395
01:04:41,151 --> 01:04:42,020
close.
It's like,

1396
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,450
that's the way to see it.
Like when you saw it live

1397
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,930
for your very first [inaudible],
if you ever watched it on television a

1398
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,490
little bit here and there.
I'm not a big,

1399
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,080
you know,
fighting guy.

1400
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:53,530
So yeah,
but,

1401
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,910
but live is always better in every,
every entertainment.

1402
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,230
Usually it is,
but there's something great about,

1403
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:00,260
well,

1404
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,340
watching things on television too,
because you watch things on television,

1405
01:05:04,341 --> 01:05:07,820
you get the replays and you get the
commentary that explains true.

1406
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:09,980
Like if things are going wrong or what's
happening,

1407
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,110
um,
sometimes you're in the dark.

1408
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:13,130
If you're in the audience,
you're like,

1409
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:14,090
why?
Why are they stop in this?

1410
01:05:14,091 --> 01:05:15,830
What's going on?
Like you don't really know what's going

1411
01:05:15,831 --> 01:05:16,790
on.
But,

1412
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,880
uh,
and then like the other thing about

1413
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,790
watching it live as you're looking
through the cage,

1414
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:25,090
so oftentimes you catch yourself looking
up at the big screen anyway,

1415
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,630
but you're still there right now.
There's a feeling that you get in that,

1416
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,550
you know,
especially now they do it with a t

1417
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,320
mobile arena,
which is 20 plus thousand people and

1418
01:05:33,321 --> 01:05:36,070
it's just fucking rocking and it's
intense.

1419
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,470
I was impressed with,
I mean there's the,

1420
01:05:39,471 --> 01:05:43,570
the violence aspect of it,
but I was impressed with the chess match

1421
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:44,560
aspect of it.

1422
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,710
There's,
there's two people and it's a mind thing

1423
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,480
as much as it is a physical thing.
Oh,

1424
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:52,150
100%.
So watching them look at each other and

1425
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:55,420
figuring it,
it's a chess match,

1426
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:56,500
if you will,
for back.

1427
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:58,140
Lack of a better analogy.
You don't anyway,

1428
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:01,480
so that's part of it as well.
I describe it as high level problem

1429
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:06,481
solving with dire physical consequences
cause that's really what it is.

1430
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:08,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1431
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,050
I mean you have us,
you have this series of techniques that

1432
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:15,100
you're allowed to execute and then
you're trying to do them on a skilled

1433
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:17,920
fighter.
And then if you mess up,

1434
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,280
if you,
if you don't have the discipline to get

1435
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,560
into the cardiovascular shape that's
necessary.

1436
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,160
If you're not at a camp that has the,
um,

1437
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,880
sufficient technical knowledge and then
pays enough attention to you and someone

1438
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:35,170
who really understands how to train
fighters.

1439
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:39,670
Like there's so many variables and it's
very hard for someone to find the right,

1440
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,040
like the perfect mix of those variables.
Right.

1441
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:43,960
You know,
and,

1442
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,180
and then on top of that,
you have to have enthusiasm.

1443
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,030
Like enthusiasm comes and goes and you
see it,

1444
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,210
you see it leave fighters like there's
fighters are you see like,

1445
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,650
oh,
this,

1446
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,610
this guy should stop.
It's gotta stop.

1447
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,370
I don't think you could do that if you
didn't have enthusiasm.

1448
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:58,900
You imagine go,
no.

1449
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:00,940
See that's where you're wrong.
Yeah,

1450
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:01,480
no,
that's,

1451
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,720
it's comms guys coming at me again,
I just don't feel up.

1452
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,760
I just don't feel up to defending
myself.

1453
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,440
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is like,

1454
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:12,760
there's levels of excitement when it
comes to the exchanges and you either

1455
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,140
are going into it,
there's like,

1456
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:18,040
this is weird.
You should either do it because it's a

1457
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:22,150
fun hobby and you're just trying to
experience a very difficult thing and

1458
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:22,780
try it out.

1459
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,270
Or you should do it because you want to
be the best in the world.

1460
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,540
Those are the only two things.
If you're just a guy who is going to

1461
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,520
take some fights,
I'm not telling you what to do,

1462
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,530
do whatever you want,
but in my experience,

1463
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,710
those are the guys that get hurt.
Like I feel like you should,

1464
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:39,310
you should own because you'll run into
someone who's trying to be the best in

1465
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:43,420
the world and the intensity that someone
has that wants to be the best of the

1466
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:45,790
world,
and somebody who really might has the

1467
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:50,320
potential to actually reach that goal.
Those people are fucking scary and

1468
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,630
[inaudible].
There's a difference between them in you

1469
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,910
that it might not just be physical,
it's enthusiastic,

1470
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:56,450
it's,
it's,

1471
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:00,970
it's enthusiasm and its focus.
What if your goal is to be number 500

1472
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,750
you're fucked because you're gonna run a
[inaudible] 99 four 99 is going to kick

1473
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:05,410
you in the face.

1474
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,210
Well,
just make sure you have a good manager.

1475
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,290
I don't want to fight anybody that's for
99 or higher.

1476
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,310
Oh,
okay.

1477
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,720
You know what I mean?
You could probably pull it off,

1478
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,550
but even then the attitude that would
say,

1479
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,030
I don't want to fight anybody for 99 or
higher you,

1480
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,700
you would like run into someone that
even though they're ranked five 12

1481
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:24,300
there's still more enthusiastic they
want,

1482
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:29,000
they want to get to four 99 enthusiasm
is a big part of it and there's an

1483
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:31,790
intangible quality like you could see it
happen in fighters.

1484
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,790
And for me,
when I watch it happen,

1485
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,670
it's very disconcerting because I
remember it actually happening to

1486
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:40,790
myself.
So I recognize it and I see it happen in

1487
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:41,511
these guys and I'm like,
oh,

1488
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,710
this guy doesn't want to do this
anymore.

1489
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,320
He's got to stop.
Like you got to get out of this because

1490
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,380
you're just going through the motions
and you're hoping it comes out well and

1491
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:51,010
it's not going to like you have to,
it has gotta be,

1492
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:53,870
it's gotta be more powerful,
a more powerful force driving you.

1493
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,720
It has to be a singular pursuit.
I don't,

1494
01:08:56,721 --> 01:09:00,050
I really don't believe that you can be
an elite professional fighter while

1495
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:02,480
doing anything else.
You can't moonlight.

1496
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,370
Yeah,
exactly.

1497
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,460
As a fighter.
It's just too fucking hard.

1498
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,510
I mean,
you can have a day,

1499
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,670
some sort of a day job,
like the heavyweight champion.

1500
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:13,430
The world is actually a firefighter,
steep emile chick.

1501
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,830
He's actually a legit firefighter,
which I,

1502
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:16,970
it makes me uncomfortable.
I would,

1503
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:20,300
I would like him to make enough money
that he doesn't have to be a firefighter

1504
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:23,750
or do anything else on the side,
but he hasn't had like the big fights

1505
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:24,980
yet.
I'm sure he's made good money,

1506
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,350
but he hasn't had like the big,
big fights here.

1507
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,100
Are there any accountants who,
I'm sure there's some that try it,

1508
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,520
get into it.
That's uh,

1509
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,361
that's pretty,
I mean,

1510
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:36,620
obviously you,
you love it,

1511
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,211
you know,
it,

1512
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:38,870
it's,
it's something that I don't know that

1513
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:41,420
much about,
but I enjoyed watching it on that

1514
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:41,600
evening.

1515
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,860
It's intense.
Yeah.

1516
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,980
Have you ever seen a bull fighting live?
No,

1517
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,770
I don't.
I don't agree with bull fighting,

1518
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,400
but I think I would like to see it live
just because I think it's like it's

1519
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,140
going to happen whether I'm there or
not.

1520
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,840
And I think there'd be,
it's like,

1521
01:09:55,841 --> 01:10:00,841
I feel like that's one of those things
that's a leftover cruelty from a,

1522
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,250
from a past era.
Like I don't think if someone tried to

1523
01:10:04,251 --> 01:10:06,620
introduce bull fighting today in North
America,

1524
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,770
there's no fucking way.
No,

1525
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,660
of course not.
Right.

1526
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,750
But it's still exists.
You can go watch it right now if you go,

1527
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:13,730
I guess to Spain or some other
countries,

1528
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:14,841
I,
yeah,

1529
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:18,830
it bothers me that it doesn't seem fair.
The fight isn't fair.

1530
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,480
It's not fair.
You know what I mean?

1531
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,860
100% but every now and then the underdog
wins,

1532
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,530
right.
Every now and then that guy gets a horn

1533
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:32,531
right through the rectum area
and then they've got to drive to the Las

1534
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,573
Vegas Hilton.

1535
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,190
There's some horrible,
you want to talk about videos you could

1536
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,560
watch online.
There were some horrible videos of

1537
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:42,920
bullfighting gone wrong.
It happens quite often,

1538
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:47,330
often enough that there's,
you could spend hours watching bull

1539
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,890
fighters get fucked up.
Yeah.

1540
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:49,830
Eh,
not,

1541
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,120
not for me.
There's a new type of bullfighting they

1542
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,070
do,
they call ethical bullfighting where

1543
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:58,440
they don't actually fight the bowl,
but they jump over the bowl as a bull

1544
01:10:58,441 --> 01:11:01,430
comes at them.
This is a joke.

1545
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:01,761
No,
I'm,

1546
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:02,301
no,
no,

1547
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,820
it's not a joke.
There's a bunch of guys who were like

1548
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:08,750
acrobats and they stand in front of the
bowl and as the bull comes at them,

1549
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:10,940
they leap through the end and they flip
over the bowl.

1550
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,280
Wow.
And sometimes that goes wrong to,

1551
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,460
somebody sent me a video,
said you called it and uh,

1552
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,910
I watched the video and it's like,
dude,

1553
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:22,050
trying to flip over the bull and the
bull catches him on the way up and

1554
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,060
fucking crushes him.

1555
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:28,930
Have you seen on cspan the,
the bull debates with a,

1556
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:34,180
they have two podiums and there's the,
the one person and then the bull is at

1557
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:40,400
the other podium and they debate like a
controversial issue.

1558
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,320
But yeah.
Why would they do that?

1559
01:11:42,321 --> 01:11:47,120
The bull debates that the humans are
always win because they have the human

1560
01:11:47,121 --> 01:11:49,850
brain.
The Bulls are just standing there.

1561
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,270
What is the bull representing?
You know,

1562
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,520
they'll like say global warming and then
the,

1563
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,280
the guy will give his opinion and then
they go and how about,

1564
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,740
how about you bull and it just,
it just stands here.

1565
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,650
What the fuck are you talking to?
Haven't won one debate yet.

1566
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,420
I serious.
No,

1567
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,670
I'm sorry.
I'm so confused as to where you're going

1568
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,700
with this.
I was like,

1569
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,500
what?
I'm looking at you while I'm doing this,

1570
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,710
going this.
I thought this was so clearly absurd.

1571
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,520
It was absurd.
And your weight on cspan.

1572
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,920
Where's this and this day and age,
it's not,

1573
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:30,540
it's not absurd enough for me to
absolutely assume the joking around

1574
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,340
Jamie.
Get a video of that.

1575
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:34,320
Those uh,
acrobatic with the little debates.

1576
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,110
I can't find it.
I was looking at ethical bullfighting

1577
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,210
bullfighting with no hands and it's not
coming.

1578
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:42,120
I remember we just looked it up.
How we see a bull fighting with

1579
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:45,750
acrobats.
I know it was going try that.

1580
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,093
There we go.
Acrobat.

1581
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,360
Yeah.
Acrobats.

1582
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,240
It's kind of bad ass cause these guys
are there.

1583
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,120
It's super impressive what they can do
with their bodies anyway.

1584
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,700
But then you see like a bull coming at
them.

1585
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,690
Check this out.
Fuck that thing is a big animal.

1586
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,560
Yeah,
there are no nothing.

1587
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,560
He's just moved.
Just trying to avoid it.

1588
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,450
Yeah,
but this is a guy just moving.

1589
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,130
But wait til he flips.
There you go.

1590
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,110
Oh,
okay.

1591
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,870
Let me get that.
I mean that it's fucking incredible.

1592
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,100
Conan,
we watched,

1593
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,810
they had picked their hands in their
pockets even.

1594
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:23,190
Yeah.
I mean that guy bounces and does a giant

1595
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,890
front.
That's a bad motherfucker.

1596
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:30,540
But this is Kinda cool because look,
it's still fucked up because you have

1597
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:34,630
this wild animal or you know,
captive animal rather,

1598
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,560
but at least he gets to live.
Yeah.

1599
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,750
It gets to live and then people get to
watch this craziness.

1600
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,850
I've seen this with cars.
Oh yeah.

1601
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,980
I saw a guy get hit.
People jumping over cars.

1602
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:47,010
Like somebody sent me an Instagram,
one of a guy doing that and he got hit

1603
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:48,230
by a car.
Oh my God,

1604
01:13:48,231 --> 01:13:50,250
this guy's on his knees.
Oh,

1605
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:53,160
he's a crazy asshole.
Are they going to show some bad examples

1606
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:55,110
of this?
We can see a few bad examples.

1607
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,870
If you really want to look at you,
you're a cruelty person.

1608
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,560
Acrobatic bullfighting goes wrong.
I'm trying to dissuade someone out there

1609
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:07,560
who's watching this go,
maybe I should do this for a living

1610
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,000
show.
The downside,

1611
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:10,650
yeah,
there's definitely downsides.

1612
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,120
I a video the other day of this car gets
smashed.

1613
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,710
Is this guy going to get smashed?
No idea.

1614
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:16,930
I was just looking,
I guess it doesn't seem like,

1615
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,540
oh my God,
this is like a whole team of these

1616
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:20,374
deals.
Look at this.

1617
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:24,820
This is a new thing,
but I mean I just found out about this a

1618
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:28,570
couple of months ago and there's fucking
a ton of videos and a bunch of events,

1619
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,960
so this is a old papers.
Boy.

1620
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:35,650
This is an incredible how athletic these
guys that says even a six year old

1621
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:37,040
video.
What?

1622
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,660
That's amazing.
Bull leaping dates back to antiquity.

1623
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:43,960
It says 18 century.
Oh my God.

1624
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:46,980
That guy's amazing.
To antiquity that.

1625
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,190
That's old.
Yup.

1626
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,380
For sure.
That guy is fucking amazing.

1627
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:54,010
It's just amazing how good he is.
A dodging and the concept.

1628
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:54,851
Oh,
he got close.

1629
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:59,851
He gets the consequences are awful.
That bolt once.

1630
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:02,290
I'll fuck you up.
Whoa.

1631
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,090
I was a chick.
She's going to get in there too.

1632
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,050
Please don't kill the girl.
Yeah.

1633
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,450
Shit.
Jesus.

1634
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:09,010
Honey.
Get out of there.

1635
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,071
Whoo.
Look at her.

1636
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:11,590
Go.
Damn.

1637
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,320
That's like they showed of her.
Turned their back too.

1638
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,720
They turn to the back hole one.
It's the same club.

1639
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:18,640
Yeah,
it was the same clip gals out of her

1640
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:20,470
fucking mind.
They're all out of their fucking mind.

1641
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,560
Hurry,
get to wear some cool outfits.

1642
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,030
Animals.
Got To be careful.

1643
01:15:25,031 --> 01:15:27,670
Danimals Brian Regan,
do you have pets?

1644
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,713
No.
No.

1645
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:32,960
I was thinking of getting a fish,
but decided against,

1646
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,480
you know,
that tanked company that had the,

1647
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:36,800
the,
the TV show.

1648
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,360
Well,
they're based in Las Vegas.

1649
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,510
I don't think the show is on anymore.
So I had them come out and they're have

1650
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:43,580
a wall where I wanted to have some,
uh,

1651
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,810
fish and we did the whole thing.
We did the structural stuff.

1652
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,320
I can't,
you have to feed fish every day.

1653
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,280
Uh,
I'm not there every day.

1654
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:54,671
And I said,
well,

1655
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,880
the only way I can do this is if I have
an electronic feeder or whatever,

1656
01:15:57,881 --> 01:16:01,780
and they said we can do this and it just
ended up being way too much of a a thing

1657
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,060
so I'm not going to do it.
The real issue with them is you gotta

1658
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,190
clean the tank too.
I would not do any of that.

1659
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,760
I would have people come by and then the
people or by your house all the time.

1660
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:10,620
Exactly,
man.

1661
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:14,200
They have to come once a week and it's
like it's too much of a commitment.

1662
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:16,360
It is a lot to have fish that I don't
have any,

1663
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,820
you know what am I going to look at it
and just go to the aquarium?

1664
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,390
Well since you were in Vegas,
go to Mandalay Bay and that's shark.

1665
01:16:21,391 --> 01:16:22,810
Yes.
Been there.

1666
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:24,280
That sounds awesome.
Pretty cool.

1667
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,410
Have you ever been at Jamie in the
Mandalay bay?

1668
01:16:27,411 --> 01:16:28,820
I didn't.
I actually didn't even see the shark

1669
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:31,130
thing when I was there last time.
It's fucking great because they have

1670
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:35,060
this huge gigantic tank with the sharks
swimming around in it.

1671
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,570
It's been a while since I've been there.
But I think you can go underneath them

1672
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,970
like they can swim above you and I might
have that wrong.

1673
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,840
I Dunno.
I Dunno if that's the case.

1674
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:45,330
You can do that.
Some places I've definitely been Kansas.

1675
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,330
Jim Shark Reef.
Yeah.

1676
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,950
Oh Wow.
That's inquired is,

1677
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,290
yeah.
I mean the amount of effort,

1678
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,260
we did a fear factor in Mandalay bay and
so they,

1679
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:59,130
they gave us this tour of how this all
works and uh,

1680
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,330
the amount of resources that are
involved in running this fucking thing.

1681
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,520
It's crazy.
Do you fish?

1682
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,593
Do you ever go fishing?

1683
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,520
Uh,
years ago one with a bunch of buddies,

1684
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:14,180
we chartered a boat out of Miami and
went out and um,

1685
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:20,110
we were catching nothing and then all of
a sudden we hit this school and everyone

1686
01:17:20,661 --> 01:17:22,010
was going Berserk.
I mean,

1687
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:24,440
pulling them in every 30 seconds to a
minute,

1688
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,680
50,
60 fish flopping around.

1689
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:30,470
It was,
it was amazing to go from nothing.

1690
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:34,550
Maybe it's similar to to hunting where
you just sit there for most of the time

1691
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:36,470
and then all of a sudden there's an elk
or something.

1692
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,220
Sometimes it was like nothing.
And then all of a sudden everybody's

1693
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:42,650
just on fire.
It was pretty intense.

1694
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:45,020
I had that happen once in Mexico.
We went to this,

1695
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:45,860
uh,
we,

1696
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:50,990
we went on a charter boat and they'll
take you to where I think they were.

1697
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:54,530
Amber Jack I think.
I think that's what it was.

1698
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,200
But anyway,
there's this literally like a football

1699
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,860
size,
football field sized school of these

1700
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:05,090
fish fucking up these bait fish and the
water just frothy,

1701
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:06,280
just crazy without it.

1702
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:11,470
Like it was amazing and just cast into
that giant football sized field and they

1703
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:15,110
would just smash the lure.
Like instantly you just pulling fish as

1704
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:18,290
much as quick as you can.
So as long as this feeding frenzy went

1705
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:19,750
on,
you could pull fishing.

1706
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,450
And so then we brought those fish back
to the hotel that we were staying at and

1707
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:26,390
we bring it to the restaurant and they,
they have like this whole thing that

1708
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,880
they do.
You talked to the chef and the chef

1709
01:18:28,881 --> 01:18:30,770
says,
how would you like you prepared w we can

1710
01:18:30,771 --> 01:18:32,930
make some severe,
we can bake some fish,

1711
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,630
we can cook it in a variety of different
preparations for you.

1712
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:38,030
And so they did that.
And so you're eating fish that's like

1713
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,900
three hours old,
four hours old.

1714
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:41,810
So we had it for lunch.
It was incredible.

1715
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:45,680
So good co there's a comedian,
Jim Collin could friend of mine,

1716
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,410
he said he was out with buddies of his,
I don't know if it's part of his act and

1717
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:52,490
if I'm giving him complete credit,
but all of his buddies were on a charter

1718
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,490
charter boat and they all caught fish
except for one guy.

1719
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,480
So one of the guys that worked at one of
the attendance or whatever set,

1720
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:02,450
I'll take care of this and went to the
other side of the boat with a snorkel

1721
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,820
and jumped on the opposite side of the
boat and swim and grabbed the dead fish

1722
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:12,680
that had already been caught when
underneath hooked the dead fish to this

1723
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,100
guy's line and started shaking it like
underneath the boat.

1724
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,300
Oh Geez.
To make it look like it was catchy.

1725
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,220
And the guy like I got one,
I got one and they pulled it up and um,

1726
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,310
they just grabbed it really quickly.
It just through it.

1727
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:27,560
So he couldn't see that it had already
been caught and dead.

1728
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,810
And to this day,
that guy thought that he caught a fish.

1729
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,290
What?
Yeah.

1730
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:31,881
And Really?
Yeah,

1731
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:34,100
they faked it on him.
Wow.

1732
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:37,870
That's elaborate.
It must be something that they,

1733
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,650
for the guide already know this
technique.

1734
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,440
Maybe they do this.
Maybe that's a thing where they make you

1735
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:44,600
pretend like you're catching fish.
How drunk was he?

1736
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,250
A while.
I would factor in,

1737
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,920
I'm sure a bunch of guys on a boat
fishing.

1738
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,380
Of course they're drunk.
Yeah.

1739
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,000
Anyway.
Yeah.

1740
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:56,510
Boat fishing drunk is okay.
Hunting drunk.

1741
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,950
Not Okay.
Not Okay.

1742
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,010
Two very different pursuits,
I would imagine.

1743
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,630
Yeah.
But even fishing drunk yet to be

1744
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,580
careful.
You get hooked in the ass with a hook

1745
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:08,070
and the face catch you in the head.
I've people get their ears

1746
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,020
hooked.
Yeah.

1747
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,190
Someone's gonna cast and the,
the hook just catches you as you.

1748
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,350
Hi,
Whoa,

1749
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,543
ouch.

1750
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,240
Listen,
we don't have to talk about terrible

1751
01:20:19,241 --> 01:20:20,560
things.
Just talk about good things.

1752
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,490
So you're in,
uh,

1753
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,480
San Diego this weekend and Stockton,
two Oh nine,

1754
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,010

1755
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:31,010
San Diego.
Friday two shows Saturday at the terrace

1756
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:33,390

Oh,

1757
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:34,830
that's a good spot to,
yeah.

1758
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,200
And then Sunday in Stockton,
California.

1759
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:42,060
How many weeks a year detour?
I try to do half the weekends of the

1760
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:46,170
year,
so 26 weekends a year and I will do four

1761
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:47,220
of those nights.
Thursday,

1762
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,330
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

1763
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,490
Oh Wow.
So it's about a hundred shows.

1764
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:51,810
Damn.
You hit it hard.

1765
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,940
I love it.
I mean,

1766
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,470
this is what I,
what I do,

1767
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,450
you know what I mean?
And how do you write,

1768
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,583
do you write

1769
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:02,350
and um,
perform in local spots in Vegas?

1770
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,870
No,
I do it in my shows.

1771
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,390
You know what I mean?
I just come up with something and try to

1772
01:21:07,391 --> 01:21:09,610
book,
end it and squeeze it in there.

1773
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,730
So he squeezed it in there between
already established bits and then you

1774
01:21:12,731 --> 01:21:14,380
let it grow.
Sordo yeah.

1775
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:15,483
And,
um,

1776
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,830
you know,
I don't know what my batting averages

1777
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,690
maybe average,
you know,

1778
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,670
in terms of new bits,
you know what I mean?

1779
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,211
Yeah.
I mean,

1780
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,590
some stuff just gets nothing.

1781
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,560
It's always going to happen.
Yeah.

1782
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:29,160
There's the batting,
that's something that people that don't,

1783
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,250
they've never tried comedy really
probably don't understand,

1784
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,250
is that most of our stuff.
It's one of the reasons why plagiarism

1785
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:38,780
is so awful.
It's because by the time a bit become

1786
01:21:38,781 --> 01:21:42,180
something that actually works,
the amount of effort that goes into it

1787
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,560
to get it to work like your,
your Steve,

1788
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:47,820
you're not just stealing this idea.
You're stealing this gigantic process

1789
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:49,050
that created this idea.

1790
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:49,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

1791
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:53,510
It's definitely frowned upon in any
field,

1792
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:55,210
but us being comedians,
it's,

1793
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,100
it's particularly a egregious,

1794
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:59,640
well,
it's also agregious because there's no

1795
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:01,280
recourse unlike,
um,

1796
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:02,910
as sort of as now,
you know,

1797
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:06,390
you can make youtube videos and get
people angry at the person.

1798
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,410
Right?
But you in the,

1799
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,240
like if you have music or literature or
anything,

1800
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:14,340
a movies,
it's very clear.

1801
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,520
Like when someone plagiarizes and people
get fucked music,

1802
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:18,810
it's a giant issue.
Obviously.

1803
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:21,420
There's been massive,
massive lawsuits from people just

1804
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:22,890
stealing rifts,
right.

1805
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,140
With completely different lyrics.
And you know,

1806
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:30,141
they've sued for the entire value of a
song just for using samples and using

1807
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:32,100
pieces of it.
I mean,

1808
01:22:32,101 --> 01:22:35,610
there's a lot of songs that were
gigantic hit songs that the people who

1809
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:38,370
wrote the songs want to making no money
because they were,

1810
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:41,700
it was deemed that they had stolen
chunks or parts of that song from

1811
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:42,534
somebody else.

1812
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:47,910
I liked the fact that they can go after
somebody legally,

1813
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,040
but what if you're wrong?
You don't like the Beatles.

1814
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:56,350
The Beatles are one of the,
one of the Beatles lost a court case

1815
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,590
about having stolen a song.
Oh yeah.

1816
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,390
And I don't remember what the song was,
but you know,

1817
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:08,391
and you can play two songs to each other
and a jury or whoever's deciding can

1818
01:23:09,161 --> 01:23:09,941
just say,
well yeah,

1819
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:12,490
that's so close.
It was obviously taken when maybe it

1820
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:14,200
wasn't right.
Yeah.

1821
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:17,020
Maybe two people thought of the same
thing.

1822
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,750
Definitely happens in comedy as well.
Yes,

1823
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,190
definitely.
For sure.

1824
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:22,290
I've had,
um,

1825
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,090
I had a situation,
you remember Dennis Wolfsburg?

1826
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,910
Sure.
Dennis Wolfsburg used to have a bit

1827
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,240
years ago.
Dennis Wolfsburg,

1828
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:30,340
wonderful comedian.
He's no,

1829
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:31,890
he's no longer with us.
Um,

1830
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,880
and he had a thing about how the terms
imbecile idiot moron are actual

1831
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:39,010
technical,
scientific,

1832
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:42,970
um,
levels of intelligence and a,

1833
01:23:42,971 --> 01:23:44,650
there hired,
there's a hierarchy to them.

1834
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:50,250
And so you could call somebody an
imbecile and it's a compliment because,

1835
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:51,940
you know,
there's,

1836
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,890
there's a,
a dumber level or whatever,

1837
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,510
right?
So he used to do this whole bit about

1838
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:59,500
it.
And then I went out and I started at the

1839
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,580
Comic Strip in Fort Lauderdale,
and then I went out on the road and I,

1840
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,440
I thought I had thought of it,
you know what I mean?

1841
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,450
Like,
so I was doing a similar bit,

1842
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:12,400
and I'm not for not that long.
And I had a comedian come up to me,

1843
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:17,401
and I'm glad that our comedy community
is so tight that this other guy sensed,

1844
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,030
he said,
I just want you to know Dennis Wolfsburg

1845
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,170
has a very similar bit.
He goes,

1846
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:24,730
I don't know if you know that or not.
And I said,

1847
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:28,750
you know what?
I now remember him doing the bit,

1848
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,950
uh,
I now remember it and I think that I,

1849
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:37,600
I thought I thought of it,
but probably the original inspiration

1850
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:39,060
was seeing him do it.
Yeah.

1851
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,500
And I,
I dropped,

1852
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,520
I dropped it like a dime.
Like I was like,

1853
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:44,560
that's it.
I'm never doing it again.

1854
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,520
You know what I mean?
So there,

1855
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,950
there are instances where you can,
I'm sure there are outright themes,

1856
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,500
we all know about that,
but you can also mistakenly come up with

1857
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:55,720
something that you think you thought of.
So it,

1858
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:59,650
it's,
you have to really guard against guard

1859
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:00,670
against that.
It's a really,

1860
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:00,780
yeah.

1861
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,920
Tricky thing.
Yeah.

1862
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:03,240
Well,
that's very honest of you,

1863
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,280
but that's,
I think that is the case with a lot of

1864
01:25:05,281 --> 01:25:06,021
things.
I think we're,

1865
01:25:06,021 --> 01:25:09,690
we're very often inspired by other
people's work,

1866
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:14,850
whether we recognize it,
we recognize it or not.

1867
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,700
That's the George Harrison,
George Harrison versus fonts.

1868
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,100
Yeah.
Um,

1869
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,093
I think,
uh,

1870
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:23,670
I mean everybody's influenced in some
way,

1871
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:27,270
shape or form by other people's work.
There's just no getting around it.

1872
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:31,290
It's just a matter of whether or not
that you made a conscious decision to

1873
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:36,240
copy someone versus whether or not you,
you have been somehow or another

1874
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,100
influenced,
and in your case,

1875
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,710
it's just a,
a forgetting thing.

1876
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,401
I mean,
that's,

1877
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:43,650
that that also happens.
You could just make a mistake,

1878
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,910
you can just forget.
Right.

1879
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:46,290
But I think the,
uh,

1880
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,890
then,
then you have to make the decision where

1881
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:49,391
you go,
all right,

1882
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:50,920
now that it's been brought to my
attention,

1883
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:53,380
what am I going to do about this?
So I'd like to think I made the right

1884
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,340
decision once it was brought to mind,
to my attention.

1885
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:56,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1886
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,390
Well did you definitely did.
You definitely made the right decision.

1887
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,260
Yeah.
It's,

1888
01:26:00,261 --> 01:26:02,420
um,
do you write like on a computer,

1889
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:03,254
like how do you

1890
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,550
just Nah,
I think of something,

1891
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:09,230
I don't know.
I don't know how that happens is I don't

1892
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,420
know how people think of things.
I don't know how I think of things.

1893
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,780
And then once I have it,
then I apply a little bit of a,

1894
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,120
all right,
how am I going to put this to have a

1895
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,200
beginning,
middle and an end?

1896
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:24,670
Say it out loud a few times to try it on
stage tape and then listen and then

1897
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:25,814
sometimes,

1898
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:27,650
okay.

1899
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,980
I always feel sometimes some of the best
writing takes place on stage.

1900
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,720
Like I think you can have something to
qt and clever like if you write it out,

1901
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,260
but when you're on stage there's a piece
of you that goes,

1902
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:44,510
take this and say this a hundred percent
a hundred percent I completely agree.

1903
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:49,511
This is way too wordy and when when
you're on a legal pad or a computer,

1904
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,270
you throw a lot of adjectives and you
get,

1905
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,830
I think you can get to conceptual where
it's like when you're on stage,

1906
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:01,400
something takes over and says tighten
this right now.

1907
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,590
Yeah,
and you get right to the quick.

1908
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,721
Yeah,
isn't it?

1909
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:06,040
It's weird art form.
Like I was,

1910
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,110
I was talking to a friend of mine who's
a musician about this and I was saying

1911
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:12,530
the difference is like you can come up
with an amazing album in the studio and

1912
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:16,880
you can tweak it and go over things,
but we kind of have to do it in front of

1913
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:17,760
people,
right?

1914
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,300
Like to create like I've,
right.

1915
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,560
But what I write down,
just like what you were saying is a lot

1916
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:28,310
of times very different than how you say
it in front of people because once you

1917
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:29,930
start doing it in front of a live
audience,

1918
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:32,600
he just started immediately trimming it
and moving things around on it.

1919
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:34,280
You know?
I think it would be interesting if

1920
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:37,700
somebody tried to create a comedy hour.

1921
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:39,220
Yeah.

1922
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,790
But without ever trying it in front of
an audience,

1923
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:46,750
just like create the hour the best you
can just on the computer or whatever

1924
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:50,500
going,
this is a good hour of comedy.

1925
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:54,670
And then the first time you ever do it
is in front of an audience as the hour.

1926
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,340
I just want to know how much of a
disaster that would be.

1927
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,780
You know,
Carlin used to do that.

1928
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,880
That's what Carlin used to do.
He used to write out his whole special,

1929
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:08,440
like he used to write a new special
every year and he would write it and

1930
01:28:08,441 --> 01:28:09,860
then he would,
he had two,

1931
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:12,580
two different ways of writing.
He would write it sober and they would

1932
01:28:12,581 --> 01:28:17,581
smoke pot and then punch it up and then
he would go and bring it to the stage.

1933
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:21,400
And essentially it was like almost like
a one man show.

1934
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,830
So you're saying he would create the
hour,

1935
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,050
try it on stage,
but then I'm sure he would tweak it

1936
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:29,390
before he was going to make an hbo
special or something like that.

1937
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,310
Like I wouldn't do that wasn't the
finished product,

1938
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:32,660
I think as T.
Right.

1939
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,240
I see what you're saying.
Like I think as time went on,

1940
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:37,520
the bits would get better.
He would tighten them up,

1941
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,870
but he essentially never worked as
material out and he would abandon all of

1942
01:28:41,871 --> 01:28:43,690
it every year.
Uh,

1943
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,290
he's amazing.
He was amazing.

1944
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,110
Yeah,
that's,

1945
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:47,870
that's a crazy way to do it.
Right.

1946
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,660
You know,
I hear stories like that and I like,

1947
01:28:50,661 --> 01:28:51,030
you know,
I,

1948
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:53,000
I like to think I'm adequate at what I
do.

1949
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:54,440
And then you hear something like that
and you go,

1950
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,130
if you put a bar graph of,
you know,

1951
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,600
people talented.
And so yeah,

1952
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,830
I'd be like a blip.

1953
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,310
You know,
George Carlin up here.

1954
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:05,400
Well,
he was an intensely creative guy.

1955
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:10,430
Like he didn't have to do a whole new
hour every year and do a whole new HBO

1956
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:13,680
special every year.
But that was his schedule.

1957
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:17,100
And I think the rigidity of that,
like the discipline of that is one of

1958
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,860
the things that kept him so creative and
so focused.

1959
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,240
Hmm.
Yeah.

1960
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:24,330
Well,
he was a genius.

1961
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,680
I almost saw his last show,
Dan,

1962
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:30,240
or one of his last shows,
he was performing in Las Vegas.

1963
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:34,440
I was married at the time and my ex and
I were trying to figure out something to

1964
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,300
do that evening.
I said George Carlin's in town,

1965
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:40,770
and there was also a Neil diamond
impersonator.

1966
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,260
So we saw,
we saw the neil diamond in person.

1967
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,590
No.

1968
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:51,460
So my story isn't,
I got to see one of George Carlin's last

1969
01:29:51,461 --> 01:29:56,461
sense as a human being.
I get to say I saw a wonderful meal time

1970
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:02,470
impersonator.
Oh Christ Jesus Christ.

1971
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,750
Is it good?
It was a good Neil diamond impersonator.

1972
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:07,510
He was like,
yeah,

1973
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,150
it was like that.
It was like really?

1974
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,810
I was really happy to be there.
Vegas is one of the few places where you

1975
01:30:13,811 --> 01:30:18,811
can see a lot of impersonators there.
There was one hotel and I saw in Las

1976
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:23,320
Vegas and I saw the signs for all the
shows and I realized everybody was a

1977
01:30:23,321 --> 01:30:26,710
fake something else.
There was like the rat pack and there

1978
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:30,140
was like a Neil diamond impersonator and
then it was the guy that dresses like

1979
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:32,350
all,
you know the women stars and stuff like

1980
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:33,184
that.
I'm like,

1981
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:38,310
none of the actual people are here.
These are all impersonators of other

1982
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:39,154
famous people.

1983
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,070
Yeah.
So,

1984
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:43,300
so the people can be famous and then
people pretending to be,

1985
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:45,340
those people can also become famous.
The weird.

1986
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,193
Yeah,
right.

1987
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,980
Yeah.
And they get really good at it.

1988
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:52,210
And that was everybody in that casino
was a fake something else.

1989
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,350
Have you ever seen that?
Uh,

1990
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,770
Frank Marino guy that,
that's one of the guys I was talking

1991
01:30:56,771 --> 01:30:57,241
about.
Yeah.

1992
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:59,110
I've never seen a show,
but I hear he's really good.

1993
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:02,890
Yeah,
he's got like a whole show where he does

1994
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,540
famous women.
Yes.

1995
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,493
He's like,
uh,

1996
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:07,330
are you allowed to call them drag queens
anymore?

1997
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:08,350
I I'm,
I'm,

1998
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:12,370
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say that.
I'm afraid to say any term about anybody

1999
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:13,323
anymore.

2000
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:18,040
Have you had,
have you ever had even off person is

2001
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,020
offensive.
I don't even like to use the word person

2002
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:23,410
cause I'm sure somebody out there going
who you calling a person black diamond

2003
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:26,110
the best neil diamond tribute on the
planet.

2004
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,720
It wasn't him.
No.

2005
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,040
I would've remembered,
um,

2006
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,320
or maybe he did.
Maybe black diamond was so good at it

2007
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,050
that I didn't realize during the show
that he was black.

2008
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,800
Don't you feel like that this,
I mean as far as like comedy,

2009
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:44,290
having a bunch of landmines that you
could accidentally step on,

2010
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,740
this seems like the most fraught with
peril time ever.

2011
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:50,890
Absolutely.
What do you make of this?

2012
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,620
I don't know.
I Dunno.

2013
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:55,270
It's definitely,
um,

2014
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,570
it's definitely an interesting time,
you know,

2015
01:31:58,571 --> 01:32:00,580
with everything been going on.
Um,

2016
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,830
and,
and what's weird about comedy too is

2017
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:10,720
that part of what makes it interesting
is pushing the envelope and be,

2018
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:15,960
and people need to be willing to cross
the line to see what's over there.

2019
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,030
I don't really do a lot of that kind of
comedy,

2020
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:21,460
but I liked that there are people that
do that kind of comedy,

2021
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:27,150
but that in conjunction with a
politically click correct world is a

2022
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:31,750
very strange place.
Yeah.

2023
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:35,710
It's a very strange place and people are
looking for someone to step over those

2024
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:37,510
lines so they can attack them.
Yes,

2025
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:40,720
yes.
There are forbidden subjects.

2026
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,770
There's forbidden words.
There's forbidden takes on things.

2027
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,100
I'm in.
This is going to sound like I'm

2028
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:51,520
plugging,
I'm in this TV thing that Peter Fairly

2029
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:54,160
is directing called loudermilk and it's
such a plugin.

2030
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,830
That's the plug.
I'm glad I'm done with the plug.

2031
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:59,950
It's about milk.
Loudermilk it's a valley brothers from

2032
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:01,090
dumb and dumber.
Exactly.

2033
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,920
Fucking geniuses.
Yes.

2034
01:33:02,921 --> 01:33:06,430
And I'm honored to be in the show and I
have a tiny little part in a thing and

2035
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:07,840
uh,
it's about substance abuse.

2036
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,470
Ron Livingston plays the main character
loudermilk and it's about substance

2037
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:13,060
abuse,
but it's done in a very funny way.

2038
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:18,450
So one of the first reviews that I read,
then I read a comment about it and

2039
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:22,720
somebody wrote,
how dare somebody make fun of substance

2040
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:26,650
abuse.
There's nothing funny about substance

2041
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:27,610
abuse and it was just,
you know,

2042
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:32,611
some person out in the Internet and,
and it just bothers me that people draw

2043
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:37,720
these lines.
Like there's something funny about

2044
01:33:37,721 --> 01:33:38,950
everything,
everything,

2045
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:41,930
everything that he said.
It depends on what you want to say about

2046
01:33:41,931 --> 01:33:43,600
it and what your point of view is.
You know,

2047
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:46,240
every subject is fair game as far as I'm
concerned.

2048
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,270
You know what I mean?
It depends on what your position is.

2049
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:50,640
What's your point of view on it?
Yeah.

2050
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,350
The idea that there's,
there's subjects that cannot be breached

2051
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:54,850
is preposterous.
Crazy.

2052
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,620
I agree,
but it just,

2053
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:57,700
what is it?

2054
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:02,020
I think it's that there's more people
that have the ability to complain about

2055
01:34:02,021 --> 01:34:04,300
things now than ever before because of
social media.

2056
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,660
You can be in your underwear now.
The fact that you can be in your

2057
01:34:07,661 --> 01:34:09,580
underwear and feel like you're a
mouthpiece,

2058
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:11,440
you're literally at home in your
underwear,

2059
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,050
you know,
typing on on and I'm like this.

2060
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,860
Yeah,
but you could write some great shit in

2061
01:34:15,861 --> 01:34:16,990
your underwear.
Like,

2062
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:18,820
I don't care what you're wearing.
I just care.

2063
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,280
No,
I'm talking about a critic.

2064
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,400
Anybody anywhere saying,
oh,

2065
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:23,840
right,
right.

2066
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,920
You got to be a great critic and your
underwear and write a brilliant,

2067
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:28,690
that's true.
Peace on something that's true.

2068
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:29,890
I don't really care what they're
wearing,

2069
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,990
but I see what you're saying.
But I'm just,

2070
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:35,110
my point is,
anybody anywhere can have an opinion

2071
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:37,120
about anything at any time.
And it's,

2072
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:41,320
and in a way that's good,
but in a way you're going to get some

2073
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:42,880
under qualified opinions.

2074
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,730
You definitely gonna get that.
You're going to get a lot of opinions

2075
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:48,700
from people that you would never choose
to talk to in real life.

2076
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,970
You just,
you would weed them out,

2077
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,670
but you can't weed them out online
because everyone's just text.

2078
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,250
You know?
And,

2079
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:01,260
and comedy is weird because everybody,
everybody has what their sense of humor

2080
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,040
is.
And,

2081
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:06,930
um,
so everybody thinks that the,

2082
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,520
I've always been amazed that people
think that their sense of humor is the

2083
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:13,760
correct one when people make these
absolute statements going,

2084
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:17,630
he's funny.
She's not funny.

2085
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,940
She is funny.
He's not funny.

2086
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:24,680
[inaudible] who made you the comedy
barometer?

2087
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,800
You know what I mean?
Whereas other art forms,

2088
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:33,440
most people are wise enough to go.
Like if somebody that goes to a ballet

2089
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,600
and doesn't like it,
you know,

2090
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,640
at least you're wise enough to go.
I don't,

2091
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,110
I don't appreciate the ballet.

2092
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,260
You don't walk out going that Ballerina
socks.

2093
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,770
There's gotta be some critical Ballerina
critics.

2094
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:46,730
I,
I'm sure,

2095
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,620
but,
but just because you don't like

2096
01:35:48,621 --> 01:35:50,630
something doesn't mean it wasn't good.
Right.

2097
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,150
But it's not good to you.
I mean that's the case was fair Isaac.

2098
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:54,470
But isn't that with everything,
right?

2099
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,670
Music,
movies,

2100
01:35:55,671 --> 01:35:58,280
there's a lot of things that people love
that it's fair,

2101
01:35:58,281 --> 01:35:59,870
but if you,
if you qualify it that way,

2102
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,940
if you say,
I don't find that person funny.

2103
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:02,930
Okay.
Right.

2104
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:06,110
But to put,
to make the blanket statement that he's

2105
01:36:06,111 --> 01:36:07,520
not funny.
He's not funny.

2106
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:11,150
It's not up to you to say comedy is a
weird thing too,

2107
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:15,680
in that it's one term that applies to a
bunch of different styles.

2108
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,610
Whereas music,
you can go to see country western music,

2109
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:21,260
you could see rap,
rock and roll.

2110
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:23,490
There's all these different genres,
right?

2111
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:24,620
Comedy is not like that.

2112
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:28,460
It's just is it funny or is it not?
That's why it was always weird when

2113
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:32,360
comedy clubs started exploding around
the country and there would be this

2114
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:37,390
building that said comedy club on it and
Pittsburgh or de Moines and music.

2115
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:42,080
Like you say,
a subdivided,

2116
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,770
you don't just,
you know,

2117
01:36:43,771 --> 01:36:46,070
just go to a music club.
Hey,

2118
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:48,410
there's the music club.
Do you want to go hear music?

2119
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,480
Yeah.
Well everybody likes music,

2120
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:52,700
but not everybody likes the same kind of
music.

2121
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,270
Comedy is not subdivided.
Not,

2122
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,160
not that I'm saying that it should be,
but,

2123
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:02,620
but to just go into a room that says
comedy on it and think that you're

2124
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,330
automatically going to be entertained is
kind of ludicrous.

2125
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,820
Yeah.
But it's hard though if you don't know

2126
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:09,080
who the comics are,
right?

2127
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,960
It's like you don't know what their take
on things it's going to be.

2128
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,240
And that's one of the things about a
nice local club.

2129
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:16,560
Like say if you live in Nashville and
you go to Zania,

2130
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,391
like,
oh,

2131
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:19,460
I never heard of this guy,
but he's been on comedy central,

2132
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:22,280
let's take a chance.
You literally have no idea what this

2133
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:23,570
person's take is.
Right.

2134
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:26,180
You know,
and it's great that you can go to a

2135
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:28,970
place like that or you can go to the
Improv and Hollywood and you'll see like

2136
01:37:28,971 --> 01:37:32,060
10 different comedians one night or the
comedy store or where have you,

2137
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,900
but you know,
you don't know what you're going to get.

2138
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:40,400
Correct.
Which I think would be part of the fun.

2139
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,330
Right.
For sure.

2140
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,370
But you know,
for some people who like,

2141
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:44,871
yeah,
you know,

2142
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:46,970
want to draw a line and go,
well that person doesn't funny so

2143
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:48,590
therefore I didn't have a good time.
What's like,

2144
01:37:48,591 --> 01:37:51,470
well you just took a chance,
one of the great parts about something

2145
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:54,080
like the comedy store where you get a
new person every 15 minutes,

2146
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:55,830
you know,
he's constantly new people.

2147
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,560
You know,
when you writing over that,

2148
01:37:58,561 --> 01:38:01,850
Jamie,
you've written emails to Miami,

2149
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,600
people would always hit me up during the
show.

2150
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:09,210
Um,
what like when you see comedy today,

2151
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:12,240
do you think that you would have,
oh,

2152
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:13,890
you think about like when you first
started,

2153
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:16,550
do you think you,
you would feel the same way about stand

2154
01:38:16,551 --> 01:38:18,420
up?
Have you had to start out today by

2155
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:22,230
seeing how it's all fraught with peril.
Do you think you would have jumped in

2156
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:23,580
any way?
I Dunno.

2157
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,750
It feels different,
right?

2158
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,050
It does.
And there's a,

2159
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:30,530
um,
there were a lot fewer people doing it

2160
01:38:30,531 --> 01:38:33,740
when I started.
And to me it was just this internal

2161
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,560
quest that came from within myself that
I want to do this.

2162
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:40,610
Um,
and comedy evolves and now there is a

2163
01:38:40,611 --> 01:38:44,810
lot of autobiographical kind of comedy
and a lot of people really going into

2164
01:38:44,811 --> 01:38:48,410
their heart and soul and talking about
how they feel and stuff like that.

2165
01:38:48,411 --> 01:38:50,480
And,
and I love all comedy,

2166
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:54,050
but my comedy kind of comes from a
different perspective.

2167
01:38:54,051 --> 01:38:56,750
It's more observational and you know,
I,

2168
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:59,900
so I don't know if I were to watch all
of the comedy now,

2169
01:38:59,901 --> 01:39:01,970
if I would go,
I want to jump into that pool.

2170
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,730
I'd like to think I would,

2171
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,680
but I dunno,
you know?

2172
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,660
Well,
I'd love your comedy and your comedy is

2173
01:39:06,661 --> 01:39:09,810
very observational and very silly,
but I always wonder,

2174
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:14,811
like I wonder
today it seems like there's way more

2175
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:18,900
uncensored comedy then there was when
you started on your me also,

2176
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:21,780
you're one of the rare guys where are
fucking hilarious.

2177
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:23,910
Like anybody can go see you.
Anybody.

2178
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,650
Thank you.
Can you can bring children,

2179
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:28,770
old people,
young people in the middle.

2180
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:29,971
Anybody.
I mean,

2181
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:31,410
you,
you're your comedy reaches,

2182
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,240
you're probably,
in my opinion,

2183
01:39:33,241 --> 01:39:36,060
the most hilarious guy that reaches to
the widest audience.

2184
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:38,670
I appreciate that.
It's an amazing thing that you've

2185
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:42,360
figured out how to do.
Like you just figured out how to hit

2186
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:47,361
this middle,
like this area where you could really

2187
01:39:48,001 --> 01:39:52,920
bring anybody to your show.
But everybody that I know really thinks

2188
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:54,790
you're a very funny comedian.
Like it's,

2189
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:56,040
it's,
it's very unusual.

2190
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,900
Like a lot of times when a guy's like
squeaky clean,

2191
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,090
like a,
he's,

2192
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:02,420
it does not for me,
but everybody thinks you're funny.

2193
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,620
So it's,
it's a weird thing.

2194
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:05,690
I'm very honored by that.
Truly.

2195
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,430
It means the world to me.
I mean,

2196
01:40:07,431 --> 01:40:09,710
I love,
I love making audiences laugh obviously,

2197
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:14,390
but to have comedians like what I do for
you to say nice things like that,

2198
01:40:14,391 --> 01:40:16,580
other comedians,
you know,

2199
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:18,020
it's,
it's a tremendous honor.

2200
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,670
What is a,
is a real,

2201
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:22,620
um,
there it's a feat.

2202
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,410
And Gaffigan's done it too.
Like Africans,

2203
01:40:25,411 --> 01:40:28,650
another guy who's just goddamn hilarious
but squeaky clean.

2204
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,630
Anybody can go see him,
you know?

2205
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:32,790
And it's,
it's very admirable and a lot of ways,

2206
01:40:32,791 --> 01:40:35,070
it's not a lot of guys like you guys
anymore.

2207
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,560
It's like,
it seems like people are either squeaky

2208
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:41,250
clean or they're really dirty and they
don't necessarily appeal to people.

2209
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:43,680
Like both.
I was like very dirty comedy.

2210
01:40:43,681 --> 01:40:46,140
I love of look extreme uncensored
comedy,

2211
01:40:46,141 --> 01:40:47,250
but I also love your comedy.

2212
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:50,180
Thank you.
I feel the same way.

2213
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:55,230
What's weird for me is if somebody comes
up to me after a show and say,

2214
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:58,570
hey,
I liked your show.

2215
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,430
So great,
thank you.

2216
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:03,130
But then they want to like lean in and
go,

2217
01:41:03,131 --> 01:41:06,100
I'm glad you're not like,
like them,

2218
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:07,761
you know,
it,

2219
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:12,550
it's an us against them.
And I feel like saying I like them.

2220
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,840
I like what they like,
what they do too.

2221
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:19,120
And I like what I do.
It's the old,

2222
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,600
remember when a stove top stuffing came
out,

2223
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:27,130
stove top stuffing and the ad was,
wouldn't you rather have stuffing as

2224
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:32,250
instead of potatoes and as a kid,
I used to think I want stuffing as well

2225
01:41:32,321 --> 01:41:36,040
as potatoes.
I don't want one over the other.

2226
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:39,760
I want both of them.
So why can't both kinds of comedy exist

2227
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:42,830
and be valid instead of,
I don't know.

2228
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,910
I wish they'd stopped doing that.
Well there was a bunch of comics like

2229
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:48,940
bill cosby.
Bill Cosby was always saying that the

2230
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:51,520
comedians that did dirty comedy,
there's something wrong with them.

2231
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:54,430
Like he was one of the big ones there
was pushing against it.

2232
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,290
See I,
I don't feel that way,

2233
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,310
I feel,
but I will say that I think there are at

2234
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:05,311
least some comics who work blue who know
that pushing buttons,

2235
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:11,110
we'll get a response.
I would hope that it's a truthful

2236
01:42:11,111 --> 01:42:14,890
organic message that you want to give as
the comedian and if happens to be dirty,

2237
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:16,300
if it happens,
it happens to be Raunchy.

2238
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:18,820
Great.
But if you're onstage going,

2239
01:42:18,821 --> 01:42:22,660
I know if I say fuck,
they'll laugh,

2240
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,720
then it gets to button pushing.
Yeah.

2241
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:28,900
And I find that to be a little like less
interesting to me.

2242
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,340
Of course.
Yeah.

2243
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:33,940
It's all about whether or not it's
really authentically that person's

2244
01:42:33,941 --> 01:42:36,100
interpretation of life,
you know?

2245
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,830
And some people like whether it's Joey
Diaz or something like that,

2246
01:42:38,831 --> 01:42:42,930
it's just a very uncensored person.
Like talking to him offstage,

2247
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:46,420
talking to him onstage.
Pretty similar.

2248
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:50,230
Same Guy as far as how he views the
world and it just figured out a way to

2249
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:52,510
turn that into an art form and then
they're,

2250
01:42:52,511 --> 01:42:53,620
you're right,
there's other people that are,

2251
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:56,830
it's almost like,
it's almost like they could have been a

2252
01:42:56,831 --> 01:42:59,730
plumber,
but instead they decided to be a comics

2253
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:00,271
like,
hmm,

2254
01:43:00,271 --> 01:43:01,780
how,
how do I make this work?

2255
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:03,300
You know,
it's,

2256
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,410
you know what I mean?
Nothing wrong with being a plumber,

2257
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:10,411
but what I'm saying is that what they're
doing is manufactured and sort of just

2258
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,440
artificial.
It's putting the audience first.

2259
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,120
You know what?
What will they laugh at?

2260
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,140
Oh,
I see that.

2261
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:19,360
They'll laugh if you talk about this,
that and the other.

2262
01:43:19,361 --> 01:43:22,570
So therefore I will talk about this,
that and the other instead of it coming

2263
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:23,404
from inside you.

2264
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:28,930
You mentioned earlier about me figuring
out a way to read,

2265
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,230
reach a wide audience,
which I appreciate the kind words,

2266
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:35,950
but I never went that route.
I,

2267
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:40,570
I just want to do what I think is good
and wherever it lands,

2268
01:43:40,571 --> 01:43:43,750
it lands and the fact that,
okay,

2269
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:48,780
maybe a 10 year old kid can you get into
it and maybe a 78 year old woman can get

2270
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:50,950
into it.
Great.

2271
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,320
But that's not something,
I mean,

2272
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:54,020
I don't lie.
I don't try to figure that out.

2273
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:54,771
Right?
I didn't go,

2274
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:57,020
well,
what can I do to get this wide range?

2275
01:43:57,170 --> 01:44:00,680
I just do what I do and whatever happens
happens,

2276
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,440
and I'm just fortunate that,
that it ended that way.

2277
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,341
Yeah,
no way.

2278
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:06,020
You can tell that when you're on stage
too.

2279
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,250
You know,
aren't you a,

2280
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:08,630
you're getting ready to do another
special,

2281
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,770
I just did a special Jesus that's going
to Air November,

2282
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,570
November 21st it's called.

2283
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:18,530
Oh Jesus.
What's an errand on Netflix?

2284
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,550
Oh,
awesome man.

2285
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,520
I have a,
I'm doing two specials for Netflix.

2286
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:26,210
The first one comes out November 21st
and then I'll be doing another one in

2287
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:29,150
2019 oh wow.
Are you planning that far ahead?

2288
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:30,920
Yeah.
Wow.

2289
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:33,860
That's Kinda of what I already have to
like move away from the material I've

2290
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:35,210
already shot.
You know what I mean?

2291
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,070
It's hard to doing it.
Hey,

2292
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,500
that's me.
Why you got two mikes?

2293
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,360
No,
those are nun chucks.

2294
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,810
Oh,
the name of the specialist nun chucks

2295
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:48,260
and flame throwers.
What a bizarre name.

2296
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:51,620
First question is why?
It's a punchline from one of the jokes

2297
01:44:51,621 --> 01:44:53,360
and it's too long of a joke to try to
get into,

2298
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:57,650
but a
record that at the paramount theater in

2299
01:44:57,651 --> 01:45:00,080
Denver called man,
that's awesome.

2300
01:45:00,081 --> 01:45:04,400
That's where a thompson garage just
recorded his special same theater.

2301
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:05,660
Yeah,
it's a great,

2302
01:45:05,661 --> 01:45:06,494
great theater.

2303
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:08,750
I'm pretty sure.
I love the crowds in Denver.

2304
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:10,850
Denver's a shit.
I'm there Friday night.

2305
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,990
Yeah,
I'm at the Belko.

2306
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,550
Oh yeah.
Cool.

2307
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:14,384
Cool.
Love Denver.

2308
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,740
Yeah,
so,

2309
01:45:15,741 --> 01:45:16,401
uh,
two shows,

2310
01:45:16,401 --> 01:45:18,500
by the way.
A second shows almost hold out.

2311
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,710
Don't sleep
then.

2312
01:45:21,711 --> 01:45:23,360
A,
I'm doing phoenix on Saturday.

2313
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:24,980
The COMERICA.
You ever done that place?

2314
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,920
Yes.
It's big,

2315
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,740
big and fun.
Yeah,

2316
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:31,730
it should be good times.
Good Times.

2317
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,880
I haven't seen you performing well.
I want to come see your show.

2318
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:39,080
What are you doing tonight?
Where are you performing tonight?

2319
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:41,540
Comedy store.
Maybe.

2320
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,930
Come on down fucker.
Let's have a cocktail and adult beverage

2321
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:46,790
as it works.
It's not October,

2322
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:47,481
isn't it?
No,

2323
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:49,640
it's not.
We can keep it in November.

2324
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,810
I had a couple of shots last night.
Is November the 15th?

2325
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,060
Are you building?
Are you there tomorrow night?

2326
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:57,111
No.
No.

2327
01:45:57,111 --> 01:45:59,270
Tomorrow I'm not.
I'm not because we were thinking of

2328
01:45:59,271 --> 01:46:00,620
maybe going over there to morning.
Oh,

2329
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:02,560
maybe I will.
I will.

2330
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,640
I will.
I will definitely consider it either

2331
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:06,200
way.
We'll do it some other time and if not

2332
01:46:06,201 --> 01:46:07,160
tonight,
then soon.

2333
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:08,360
Definitely.
Definitely.

2334
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:10,461
Well,
thank you for coming,

2335
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:11,151

Joe.

2336
01:46:11,151 --> 01:46:12,350
Thank you.
My pleasure.

And November 21st Netflix.
Yes.

2338
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,030
And uh,
I'm sure it's going to be awesome.

2339
01:46:17,031 --> 01:46:19,970
And then this weekend,
Santa Barbara?

2340
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,140
No,

2341
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:22,760

2343

Beautiful.

2344
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,060
Thanks brother.
Thank you.

2345
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:29,691
Joe.
Brian,

2346
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:30,530
Regan,
Ladies and gentlemen.

2347
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:35,710
Woo.
[inaudible]

2348
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:45,790
okay.
