1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
The Joe Rogan experience mean he could
if you wanted to,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,160
but he thinks that it complicated.
I feel bad for the Dalai Lama because

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,890
Richard Gere always wants to hang out
with.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,990
You can see the Dalai Lama like a
pulling Richard Gere aside one day

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:15,490
going,
hey Richard,

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,060
have you ever considered scientology?
You imagine the conversations that Dalai

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,680
Lama must have with like Sharon stone
where he's like,

8
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,600
yeah,
yeah,

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,690
I can't believe they chose her either.
I mean,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,010
you look,
yes,

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,450
I don't watch a lot of movies,
but you are amazing zing in basic

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,610
instinct.
I thought you were amazed and they

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,260
didn't think you could pull it off in
the second one.

14
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,560
You pulled it off in the second one.
Did you see this basic instinct too?

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,990
It's a horror movie.
It changed.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,690
It changed from an erotic film when
Sharon stone was young too,

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,080
like like a panic moment.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,620
Fuck yeah,
I did sign.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,930
I'm a diligent worker when it comes to
watching stupid shit that I might be

20
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,400
able to make fun of.
She's in it right?

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,140
But she was like 50 and I'm not joking.
She show anything like that.

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,560
But the whole leg thing,
but there's a feeling that you get when

23
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:08,370
a 50 year old woman who's trying really
hard to be sexy.

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,560
Like I don't know if she was directed in
that way.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,940
But when you're 50 you realize by the
time you're 50 you realized it's mostly

26
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,930
all bullshit.
Okay,

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,370
what are we doing here?
You know,

28
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,660
if we're gonna fuck,
we're going to talk.

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,530
But all this like sultry shift that you
might get away with when you're 20,

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,810
it's because you,
you're,

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,410
you're a a spell when you're 20.
When a woman is in her young twenties,

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,260
she.
The reason why they have this idea of

33
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,240
themselves,
it's so inflated like really beautiful

34
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:36,690
girls is because they're like magic.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,470
Like you were around him in your,
like your mood changes,

36
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,630
you draw towards them,
you soften your personality to or,

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,460
or pick it up or whatever.
You need to get me to like you a little

38
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,800
bit more.
It's like a drug.

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,510
It's like a fascinating erotic draw.
But then when they get 50 and they're

40
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,670
still doing the same thing,
then it's like,

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,740
oh shit,
what's wrong with her?

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,500
Oh fuck.
So when you see her cross her legs,

43
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:06,090
just like a real moment of panic,
where I would think about me in my

44
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,860
younger days,
if I was in that scenario,

45
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,760
I would.
I would say,

46
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,190
okay,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

47
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,120
It was that moment with a 50 year old
lady shows you her gapper and then

48
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,980
closes the legs over and they're like,
nope.

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,360
I gotta go right now I am going.
That is not the way.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Like a healthy sexually confident 50
year old woman would would fuck you.

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,890
I can't believe they just had her do it
again.

52
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,860
That's the lane or two lanes.
It's the unknown.

53
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,000
Necessary.
It was so unnecessary,

54
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,100
you know?
I mean,

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,460
what's the Hollywood unnecessary ideas?
Well,

56
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,880
I think it's like someone who's never
done standing up trying to craft a joke

57
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,260
on this is going to work.
You know,

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
you don't really have a chance to vet
it.

59
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,020
You just have to put it out there as a
movie and hope that people get it in the

60
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,350
first basic jeans to instinct was really
fucking,

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,270
you know,
it was well received.

62
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,710
It wasn't the best movie in the world,
but it was kind of fun.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,570
I
took your your interest and she's sexy

64
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,404
as fuck,
man.

65
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,600
Old Sharon stone is sexy as fuck.
That will miss structurally perfect,

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,390
beautiful,
beautiful woman and a powerful actress.

67
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,970
But when you 50 keep keep your gap or
shut.
