1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,100
I mean with Rohn, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a cluster fuck of a podcast,

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:08,280
but it's going to be awesome.
Or this is a lot of fucking people here.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,120
But this is a fight companion podcast
brought to you by on and go to o n and it

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,850
used Kohler rather save 10% off
any and all supplements. Oh Shit.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,120
Human optimization time. Listen, we got
to fucking Stackhouse house to my left,

6
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:23,590
the master, my brother from another
mother, Mr Eddie Bravo's here. Ian Mccall,

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,030
his friend, Kemal Corinne,
Corinne Gamal, Abdul Jabbar.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,910
I knew it was one of those, uh, just
met him. Uh, Ian Mccall, of course,

9
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,370
one of the baddest motherfuckers
on the planet earth next to him.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,980
Big Brown is in the house.
Bitches. What, what? No,

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,610
no, no. Just in the fucking world.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,700
Preparing for his next big
fight with Travis Browne.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,170
Gotta be very confused and calling
that groundless. Pick Brown. I mean,

14
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,100
Travis Browne is her and next to
him, of course, my other brother,

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,940
Mr Abi Marcus Warrior, poet
us on Twitter. Follow him.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,110
He puts out great links and
his Gal Whitney right below,

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,040
she's here at fresh off
of a Jujitsu lesson, just,

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,330
just competing in a turn of herself
pretty and fucks pitches up. And uh,

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,270
we're about to start the very first fight.

20
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:18,100
If you've ever heard one of
these podcasts before, um,

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,600
don't expect any like deep insight
to the nature of the universe.

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,330
Most of it is people getting
drunk watching fights. So we did,

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,710
we got off the plane all up in his
bitch. We got boxes, son. We got,

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,090
we got God damn. Look at that
booty. You just get a half a brain.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,200
You would get a fucking mad rush of
human neurotransmitter's. All right,

26
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,970
first rounds about to start.
They just touched gloves, man.

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,830
The good shit time says four 55 right now.
So if you're sinking up,

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,510
the thing about the internet, if you're
watching it on the internet, it's, um,

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
we're about maybe 10 or 15 seconds
slower because there's a lag between

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,540
uploading to Ustream and a,
we're watching it right now.

31
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,810
So it's very first round
of the very first fight.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,380
It's Diego for what is
the fight Diego for rarer.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,140
Hold on a second. I'll tell you
any minute now ladies and gentlemen

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,680
do, do, do, do, what's that? How much?

35
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,690
What did you,

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,960
these mother fuckers are gambling Diego

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,050
and Ben Neale dairy. You wish, uh,

38
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,310
I do not know much about these gentlemen.
Ben. He's a bad ass. I've rolled,

39
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,430
I've had the privilege of rolling with
him a few times. Uh, Ben [inaudible].

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,280
If you go on Benny Benny and who was the
gentleman in the black shorts here is

41
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,620
undefeated. Yeah, I've seen Diego
for air fight before monster.

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,000
He's got very good Jujitsu to very good
Jujitsu. Good striking too. Like throws,

43
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,110
throws hard shots but nasty
Jujitsu. A couple of years ago, he,

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,160
Benny went up against a chron

45
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,900
and lost by decision by advantage. I
think you saw the fight. If you saw it,

46
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,210
you would have seen that would
be advantage given wasn't,

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,070
wasn't a legit advantage.
Uh,

48
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,070
there was a sweep that was that he
wasn't given that Benny wasn't given the

49
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,280
points to a really, really
good fighting. Real quick.

50
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:19,960
My boy and Neil Magnum won his
fifth straight TK the gazelle.

51
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,290
That's five this year, five in
a row. That's pretty amazing.

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,290
He's just not as flashy.
So a lot of people don't talk about them.

53
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,010
Like you said you, you didn't even know
any of that is, I mean, I, I don't want,

54
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,960
I barely keep up with anything now I
know why. The why is the smell on it?

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,220
I'm going to hear him. Check, check,
check, check. It wasn't, oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,700
Were you saying that he
didn't know what I think, uh,

57
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,520
I think that there's a chance that now
it's really loud reason why there's two

58
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,150
maturation of the UFC.
I think that was done on purpose,

59
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,630
so we wouldn't watch anything else.
I can barely keep up with the UFC.

60
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,090
Why the fuck?
How the fuck am I going to watch Bella?

61
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,270
No, you know what it is. I'll
tell you exactly what it is.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,330
There's only a certain amount of fighters.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,470
There's hundreds and hundreds of fighters
and if you just let those dudes just

64
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:06,590
run free, they get scooped
up by other organizations.

65
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:09,530
And the reality is there's
a lot of fucking top talent
out there. There's a lot.

66
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,310
If you want to have an organization
that has 300 fighters on contract,

67
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,390
you've got to have an ass load of
events press plus the ideas just keep

68
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,130
spreading this shit everywhere.

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,750
But on fights everywhere for the
card international two at a time

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,570
we'll talk about on the Internet all the
time. It's, it's a known subject. Uh,

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,430
what's up with the, the saturation
with the over saturation in America,

72
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,160
in America internationally,
it's growing.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,730
So it's like this is it good?

74
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,070
Was there a plan to oversaturate

75
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,690
because not that they don't believe it's
oversaturating the spot. No, they don't.

76
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:48,170
They don't believe it's oversaturating.
They're putting on good fights.

77
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:51,870
So just trying to put on as many fights
as they changed it and it's tougher for

78
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:56,820
them to get famous fighters to the
show man show. Look at Conor Mcgregor,

79
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,540
the motherfucker got famous to me. Now
you're talking about the exception, right?

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,150
Neil Magni, we go five years ago,
he's five and no, he, you know,

81
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,910
he's on the front cover and
fighters only doing shift managers.

82
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,800
Good decision every time he know
he just walked by t killed tonight.

83
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,080
He won his last fight by Tko

84
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,760
talking about five [inaudible].

85
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,570
He's got mad skills cause he was a
train part of mine. Other than that,

86
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,453
I wouldn't be doctors.

87
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,480
And I'm saying it's like
him who's been winning.

88
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:32,040
How come he doesn't get as much as much
like John Fitch?

89
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,060
Don Fitch was on popular fighter.
I mean it depends on what he was.

90
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,330
He was successful. You still
probably a little tough for a title,

91
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,220
strong walkout song, but you don't have
very strong rusty chains. Come on son.

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,000
But he wasn't exciting so, so people
want to see him lose. I like to stock.

93
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,780
Well I let you, that's what I like about
it. The staff style test people, you know,

94
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:58,010
he's unbelievably tough.
He fucking on guys.

95
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,090
He grinds. Dana White said though.
Ooh, let us move a bunker. Lewis is,

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,390
he lost his eyes.
Got Your cut.

97
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,350
Craziest thing that Berkman bout
him is how nasty. This is a good,

98
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,900
a good top gay man. Real
good balance. Oh Shit.

99
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,230
He trains a standup with Hafael. He's,
he's awesome. How about Damien Maia. Dan,

100
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,320
John [inaudible], John
Fitch. He John Fished Donkey.

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,820
John Fitzjohn fit true.

102
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,310
Holding onto monkey fucking a
football. Oh Shit. He'll hook.

103
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,640
You won't get caught in that
forever as good say never son.

104
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,820
Yeah,
his knee is so flexible.

105
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,710
All I would go for knee bars like walked
all day on him. He's twist out there,

106
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:48,110
be twisted so far back and his
coach a text. Right? Crazy.

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,310
What is up with dudes who have like super
flexible joints? I don't know, 20 years.

108
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Whaler I think told that you remember
when oiler Fuck Sakharova arm bent the

109
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,790
fuck behind his back.
You're for sure it is.

110
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,520
Or 100 years and years of Jujitsu.
Is it like starting as a baby?

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,910
I think Jujitsu helps. Like Eddie
Bravo. I mean your show like you're,

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,720
you're so flexible down there.
Don't you think you were born that way?

113
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,380
Were you born flexible? Whom? I disagree.

114
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,890
Everybody's born man. You look stiff,
walked by and you are not born.

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,780
You look super stiff
rocking then I'm with it.

116
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,250
I think all babies are born in flexible,

117
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,890
but some just keep using it and some
don't use it and they lose it. It's about,

118
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,120
it's how you grow up. If you
don't use it, you lose it.

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,430
We gotta be real careful about not talking
over each other. Sorry, and for me,

120
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,630
I used to like my, my toenails with my
feet. That was my bad habit I did that.

121
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,530
Kept the flexibility while all the kids,

122
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,340
I did the exact same
thing when I was a kid.

123
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,430
Being a disgusting Tufts private
though I don't do it anymore. My mom,

124
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,800
because my boys didn't have locks.

125
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,010
You have to make sure your
mom's not going to walk.

126
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,060
We're both hands on your feet or like,
did you Bria? I bite my toenails.

127
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,740
Flexibility, flexibility,
something you can achieve.

128
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,510
Flexibility that a lot of people,

129
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,010
a lot of people don't work hard
enough at it turned into this son.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,120
I agree with that jumps out at the
same time. That's a little bit,

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,280
some guys are freakishly,
he's been doing it forever though.

132
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm not that flex.
Not like explosive.

133
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,760
It's not like that and that's
a different animal and brand.

134
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,370
Anybody can get flexible if
you stretched rubber guard,

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,470
he knows that when you walk
into a kickboxing school
you can't kick to the head

136
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,343
to

137
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Das and eventually you'll be able to kick
it ass to that fucking shot was sweet.

138
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,330
You roll with that guy, he just
doesn't quit. It's freezing.

139
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:47,790
It's supposed to stop good isn't
it? You know, but I think man,

140
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,830
I think there's people that just don't
put in the effort and they just accept

141
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,710
the fact that they're not flexible.
Remember that dude that we had,

142
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,980
the big player guy who

143
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,920
got stupid flexible over the course
of the year. He had terrible flood.

144
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,810
He would some stuff stretching
and he got mad flexible in a year.

145
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,320
He was like a soldier.
Some people get get to load.

146
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,270
The goal is to get to the huge, he
was built like you said, giant dude.

147
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,810
He's like two 50 we used to call it riding
the ball when we were in fucking roll

148
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,644
with that guy

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,850
and you were going to take
him under your wing and, and,

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,290
and you hooked him up with a kick boxing
trainer and he came up to him, said, hey,

151
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,380
I can't kick to the head man. I don't
know what to do. What would you tell them?

152
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,273
Retire.

153
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,340
He's the pessimism of dude.
Oh.

154
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,480
Oh

155
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Damn. I would say beat it. Nerd Benny
just cracked him with that neat dude.

156
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,390
He was dominating them on the ground too.

157
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:45,380
I was really surprised by how he took
them down and then got his back and was

158
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:49,820
hanging onto him. Where's
this kid from? With the son?

159
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,860
He started with the Bruno.
Matt mood at a health Gracie.

160
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,440
Nice half grace. He makes
a lot of killers. Yeah.

161
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,080
He's got a lot of killers up
there in northern California.

162
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,660
You had Cameron real up there.
He had a lot of dudes up
there. Right. David Tarell,

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,850
he's out of there. Dave camera.
Rio De Camera, animals, animals,

164
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,680
animals up there. Dude.
Gumby Scott Mouth. Well,

165
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,200
how was mad at Bj when Bj left
and went to Nova Uniao right.

166
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,670
Remember that column? A trader
details of that. Hopefully. Yeah.

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,730
Hopefully they worked it out,

168
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:27,500
but I'm talking about the one in his
body kick off Tustin. Oh, where's,

169
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,250
Oh, who's teachers there? That?
Bruno Mahmud. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,380
But he also trains at the Hafael
now I had a king. Oh, okay.

171
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,810
Hockfield Cordero yeah, he's a
good guy, man. He's so, yeah,

172
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,700
I tattooed him and his wife a bunch
of times. Awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,710
He better be otherwise it
just says something vulgar.

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Then his wife have been
a weird [inaudible].

175
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,800
You got to keep that shit quiet.

176
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,100
[inaudible] information.

177
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,000
You gotta fucking be a little shy
about that. Hey you do you guys party

178
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,950
being great.
You're death to host absolutely nothing.

179
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,620
She had no idea what that meant.
And we were at,

180
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,120
we were by ourselves at a club
and Taco and some couple comes up,

181
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:16,920
all cook out of their board and you
guys party, you want to have fun.

182
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,680
And I'm like, no, no, no, we don't.
We don't party. That's a diff rather.

183
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes,
50 with it just just perfect,

184
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,890
just perfect. Cemented like five year
old tits with a tiny little dress on

185
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,640
the trade off. Never works.
It never works. And then,

186
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,900
and then of course later we look at him
at another table and there have swapped

187
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,120
and another couple with women on

188
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,010
cocaine makes things happen.

189
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,740
Just does she want to switch
strong because they're all,

190
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,040
they don't a fuck dude.
When I

191
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,873
was in Tampa

192
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,610
I was doing stand up in Tampa and they
were all ugly. There was like 40 of them,

193
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,370
this couple, 20 on each side, 20 guys,

194
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,730
20 girls and they were all swingers
and they wanted to take us to a swinger

195
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,580
place is me and Maddie Kirsch
and we were like, what?

196
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,160
Look at you fucking monsters. This is,
it's like that scene in the fucking,

197
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,270
you're still ugly.
Fear and loathing in Las Vegas.

198
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,200
When Hunter Thompson's on assets checking
into the hotel and the lizards are

199
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,380
fucking blood on the floor.
Tell me about the golf shoe

200
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,690
ever. One of the best things that
I think when your dad, you know,

201
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,860
you're fucked up and you're old and
you're a swinger, like you're just a mess,

202
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,130
you'll just fuck anybody. Anybody's
fucking these put lipstick on. Good.

203
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:36,560
We're good.

204
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,560
We're good pile drive my wife for
30 years so it doesn't want to fuck.

205
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,260
You know, there's like 10 years where
you, you might be thinking about it,

206
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:51,430
but you won't pull the trigger and
then after like 20 years like dude,

207
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,900
they shit on it.
That'd be like a fuck someone else.

208
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,520
All I gotta do is let
her bang or the dude's

209
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,140
sick of bang in their life.
There's

210
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,130
the regional motion,

211
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,520
the books you get to keep your
wife and have sex with others.

212
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,000
You heard about the key party,
all you got to do

213
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,730
these to do those in the 70s everybody's,

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,460
everybody puts their 20 years in a pile.
You guys,

215
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,990
you guys don't have headphones on,
right?

216
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,800
So you don't realize what
a cluster fuck this is.

217
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,720
This two separate conversations going on
at the exact term is about a key party.

218
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,700
Second Party,
he saw swingers,

219
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,730
swingers party. They would all throw
keys into a a a bucket and whoever got,

220
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,630
you know, you just pick whichever
person going home with. Yeah.

221
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,370
Well tell people the keys. Just
some gay warlock like yeah. Tough,

222
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,550
tough actions. Life. Hopefully it hurts
her pussy. She doesn't want anymore.

223
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,440
She goes back to your regular deck. I'd
act sick as sick when you look at that.

224
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,680
Wow. Who's that? Oh Damn.
They got someone with boots.

225
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
Had Brazilian girl.

226
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,710
I have to have an ass to be a
presumed Jenny Andraj Allie,

227
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,100
she's built correctly. Number true. Yes.

228
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,090
Mouse and that left die
man like seven years ago.

229
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,290
She had a beautiful body look
at is look at his left eye man.

230
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,050
What Ha what had he caught a bunch
of shit in that round, right?

231
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,120
Did he get tagged a good, a couple
of Nice, good defense to man.

232
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,700
Oh came over the top there.

233
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,910
But that was a lot of energy and not
a lot of results. Good. Good defense.

234
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,470
And he landed a vicious fucking
leg kick right before that. Flory

235
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,540
those kicks are way too
slow. Powerful. Ian,

236
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,930
Ian Mccall hummingbird like speed
cause might be a little fatigue.

237
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,800
Yeah, well for I just went
of for a big, big charge. And

238
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,740
how'd he say his last name?
Darvish. Deruge. Yeah he
blocked. Most of that is nice.

239
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,370
Is Nice Cardio with guys.
Fucking incredible. Ooh,

240
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,750
nice knee to the body by error
for how do they keep going?

241
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,350
The pulsing, breathing coaches,
those are so important.

242
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:25,830
Those moments right in the scramble
and it take down to the guy lands,

243
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,270
the hard shots.
Yeah.

244
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,520
Like especially those hard knees to the
body if you could time it just right,

245
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,480
right, right. Yeah. You know
there's going to be that opening,

246
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,720
you know this is going to be that brief
window to get something in scrambles,

247
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:41,721
everything scrambled and it tells like
who is in like really tip top shape and

248
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,660
fucking is really driven and wants it and
who is looking to take a little bit of

249
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:46,494
a break,

250
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,640
who's looking to like maybe not push
as hard to capitalize on those moments

251
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,310
because those moments are going to
gas you and if you're tired already,

252
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:56,760
it's a mad scramble. And is that
pause? Do I take a breath here or boom,

253
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,490
do I fire the shot and then a
high level in those scrambles,

254
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,370
you're going to have this small
window attacked or die. Yeah,

255
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,650
you're never too good. And
Anderson Silva, Stephan Bonner,

256
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,580
there isn't that scramble.

257
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,760
He landed that fucking vicious
need of the body and that was it.

258
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,810
Most submissions you see at a high level
or during the scramble in the Ama guys

259
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:18,430
have that good point. He fucking knee. The
body knows. Got a really good one. Okay.

260
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,460
Oh boy. Yes. Cowboy. He's got a
beautiful one off that left leg.

261
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,850
He keeps guys from coming in.
You know as you're charging in,

262
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,180
he's pawn actually with the jab and you
come to close that distance that catches

263
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:33,530
you with that body. Knee, boom. Over.
He's got a vicious one. Two troughs.

264
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,460
Brown's ain't bad either. It's
not bad, dude. Overeem is just,

265
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,910
it seems like he's just having the
hardest time taking punches these days.

266
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,490
It's just not the same guy forever.
They hit in his face too. It hurts.

267
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:47,540
It just puts him out. It's crazy.
Well, the only against Ben Rothwell.

268
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,280
I never defend Ralph over him ever
because he's done so much steroids.

269
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:57,080
However, when he five Ben Rothwell, he got
hit behind the ear. So people that, oh,

270
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,910
his chains out of control. When a two or
six five pen man hitch behind the air,

271
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
it's going to fuck you up man.

272
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,740
He just is so I don't think it's
a matter of a chin in that fight.

273
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,660
Look up Cain Velasquez takes bombs. Junior
carnival right behind me. He went down.

274
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,280
He wobbles you. They're not now,
but they're wobbling and get Tko.

275
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,810
Yeah, I, you know,

276
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:21,980
I just feel like you go back to Overeem
versus Brock Lesnar and you are looking

277
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:25,250
at may be the scariest fucking
heavyweight of all time. Right?

278
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,340
What I 100% of the pounds of just 263
he weighs in at two 63 and he looks like

279
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:37,310
our God damn cartoon he
does. And he was like, yeah,

280
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,860
it just doesn't even look like a real,
you can't respect that though, man.

281
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,770
You and now now give all of us
the same supplements he was on.

282
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,930
Let's see what's up.
That's what I'm proposing.

283
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm proposing everybody of
this nature get bullshit, bro.

284
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,720
Why don't we all go back to not training?
Well,

285
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,680
what the fuck are we talking about?
Don't try to get better. We all go. Yeah,

286
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,660
I'm done. I'm talking about everybody
being on steroids. I fuck it.

287
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,300
Let's just do this. Don't
make this a fucking, uh,

288
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,480
main page article and when you're goofy,

289
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,500
fucking 100 websites and pretend I'm
being broken ones don't believe that

290
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,660
everybody should be on steroids were
already you were drinking. You said it.

291
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,420
I would like to say that on a broadcast.
So fucking everybody get on steroids.

292
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,850
Obviously.
I work in pride.

293
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Vandelay Silva is banned for life.
That's fucked up. That's fucked.

294
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,990
What he's done for the sport.
Crazy. Unbelievable, ridiculous.

295
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,490
You can't run from a drug test,

296
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:35,700
but I can't support that
spending first benefit here,

297
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,740
spending for a year
without even testing them.

298
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm a hundred percent down with that.
That sends a very clear message to guy.

299
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,800
Can't earn money fighting for a year.
He's got to go and do seminars.

300
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,730
All that said,
oh,

301
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,780
for where we're going to tag that
same eye to his hand was on the mat

302
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,960
touching out.
I was already swollen up,

303
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,980
but I just think that a year, a year,

304
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,860
a year, and maybe a hundred
thousand dollars fine. If
you want to make it Steve.

305
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,100
Wow. That's steep. Yeah. Well
he got 60 grand and Brandon,

306
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,700
you boy fucking Beny Beny,

307
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,780
Beny derash through.
He's a bad motherfucker.

308
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,280
And this is his first UFC fight, huh? How
many other guys got like four or five?

309
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,210
No,
no.

310
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,910
Last year I was at an event corner and
he loved it and he was on a smaller show

311
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,960
is the headline and a small show.
Yeah. He's done for these. This is a,

312
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,030
this is a fourth one in the UFC. He, um,

313
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,580
he's, he lost wants to ram key. Oh Wow.

314
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:45,620
He got killed by Ramsey. I mean, I'm
so impressed with this guy, man. I'm,

315
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm surprised that Ramsey got him. What's
his overall record? How many has he won?

316
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,730
Good question. He is, uh, six,

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,620
eight one and o eight one and, oh, so
Ramsey's, you only got to beat him. Wow.

318
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,180
I'm,
I'm fucking super low brother.

319
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,460
Did my reflexes are still
busted with celebrations and

320
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,200
everyone's getting busted. Do you think,
uh, very few guys are doing steroids now.

321
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,370
Uh, I think it makes it tougher
but it listen professional sports,

322
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:21,090
it's part of the game. With
your, in the Olympics, NFL, NBA,

323
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:25,070
it's a part of the yield.
It can be up.

324
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,340
How many fighters do you think,

325
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
do you think that there's that 10 UFC
fighters that just got off it because they

326
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,150
didn't want to get busted
and now quite a bit.

327
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,750
And I wish I knew anything so they got
off. I think that, you know, there's,

328
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,673
they got busted.

329
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,230
I think some guys were just getting off
to get off because that's like you said,

330
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,100
that was part of the game.

331
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,590
A lot of fucking people just
air rights in every sport. Like,

332
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,550
I mean you go to any sports. Do you
think it is personally in MMA? MMA maybe

333
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,450
turned off. Sorry, I get distracted
that she called that bitch.

334
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,690
She's a beast. She is she fun? Sacramento.

335
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,940
She's got those 50 tree trunk legs.

336
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,100
50% don't do starlets I lead.

337
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,640
Depends on weight class it true.
I wasted it cost all the way.

338
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,750
The storage is a prominent 85

339
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,670
why the weight class has an issue
with Lacey? Why that would be, I mean,

340
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,690
I mean look at the guys. If you just
look at people who've been caught,

341
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,970
it's usually the heavier weight class.
It's true when that,

342
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,660
when that Allie bug attain off got caught.
That Russian dude on EPO.

343
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,260
What the fuck? You're 125 pounds.
What are you going to take?

344
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,800
Anybody with mighty mouse and he's,
his game is very kinetic.

345
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:43,270
If you don't have the cardio at 125
pounds, you got to a GPO for sure.

346
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,460
Just go do something and
you know what it is. Oh Man.

347
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,920
I think it's first fight that
he's fighting five rounds.

348
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,710
Probably worried about that
and also he's very physical,

349
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:55,440
like everything he does like hundred
percent where mighty mouse is loose.

350
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,500
Fuck, I know. I hear you. I get all
this. These are all great points.

351
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,830
You're 125 pounds. Yeah,
you're right. You're right.

352
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,750
100 apps audio four days

353
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,820
and I don't give a fuck if you're 300
pounds or 200 pounds or you're not

354
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,920
supposed to cheat. Okay? So
he cheated. He fucked up,

355
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:16,270
he did a bad thing and he
cheated. And when you're
cheating, it's not just that a,

356
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,680
everybody's doing it.
Here's the deal.

357
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,020
You're going to be able to do damage
that you wouldn't have been able to do.

358
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,990
Let's just be honest that your opponent
is going to suffer if you cheat.

359
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,610
The reality is it's not like football.

360
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,440
It's not like you're getting
across the line quicker.

361
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,950
You're going to land shots that you
wouldn't have been able to land. I mean,

362
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,400
all speculation aside about individuals
that we can see pre and post getting

363
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,890
popped when we visited.
Plenty of examples to draw from.

364
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,940
We don't need to talk about any of them,
but the reality is they're,

365
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,240
they're bad because your opponent can get
hit when they might not be getting hit.

366
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,260
But this is the problem is the training
like Vituro, Belmore spinning heel kick.

367
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,100
Well, if he's on steroids, he's
gonna be able to practice that. Yes,

368
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,130
500 times more thousand times before.
So it's going to be in his wheelhouse now.

369
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,720
Now it's well in his book of tools.
So what was crazy on steroids?

370
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:05,740
My patio one a hundred cards.
He got legal testosterone,

371
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:10,120
which is so squirrely. The fact
that they allowed that for so long.

372
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,870
So squirrely. Look, the shit works.

373
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,130
And especially when you're on like
[inaudible] de Devito or had 1475 was his

374
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:21,994
blood level.

375
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,230
A normal person's like 600
that's like a healthy man.

376
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,270
Not In training. When you're in training,
you're worn out. You're beat down, man.

377
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:36,250
200 300 yeah. So when you're
jacked up like that, yeah man,

378
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:40,550
you can make some gains. You can
make some shit out. Welterweight now.

379
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,400
I love the train would be sort of good
guy. He looks like you're welcome.

380
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,100
[inaudible] not count them out. Hell no

381
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,620
striking. It's nasty in the
fucking head is striking is nasty.

382
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:59,010
What if he goes down really
easily? Afraid to death. Terrified.

383
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:03,500
Then they'll drop. They're going to just
say, I'm going to stay on. If I get off,

384
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm going to get crushed.
So I'm gonna stay out of trouble man.

385
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:11,030
Cause Weidman's not on that shit.
And Wyman is a fucking monster.

386
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,640
He's a total match up. Even if
he was on steroids, so horrible.

387
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,110
And now you've been fighting on steroids,

388
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,600
you're off of them and you've got
to fight five rounds with kids. Why?

389
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:20,270
There's any guys that are on steroids,
but they're really,

390
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,740
really vocal about being anti steroids.
Oh Scott.

391
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,040
Because most guys that are on,

392
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,540
that's like gay dudes who
are anti gay preachers.

393
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,030
They always exist.
Exactly.

394
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,650
Mother fuckers.
Most one of the fighters are almost all,

395
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,910
have you seen the African?
I'm like God,

396
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,220
Awful Macaque. Oh man, look at that.
Macaca was in this dude's corner.

397
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,860
Macaca was still rocking
it after all these years.

398
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,960
Macaca knocked out Jocko Ray
and Jack Gary's first MMA
fight, man. Yeah, that too.

399
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:12,950
It's been all round.

400
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:17,870
He had wars with Palae back when Paleo
was the fucking man with Paleo was the

401
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:22,430
shoot the box man palae
brought in Anderson Silva.
Apparently that's the word.

402
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,430
He was a bad ass back then. Wasn't
married when he knocked out Matt Hughes.

403
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,150
That pains. Goddamn Palae
was, he had vicious moy.

404
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:32,620
Tai Vicious does that. Drake, Jake,

405
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,490
Jake is, his name is Lucas
Martine's. Both of these,

406
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,340
both these guys are tough as shit.

407
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,320
Darren Elkins is just fucking
country tough straight countries.

408
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,090
He's one of those dudes. You fucking, you,

409
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:51,020
you meet him in some dirty honky tonk
with saw dust on the floor. Come on man.

410
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:55,290
You to do this. Do this outside. I'll
be right back. I'm gonna knock this

411
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,110
first part. He hit him in the forehead.
You're handbrakes. He smiles at yellow.

412
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,080
You still wanting to do this,
didn't you?

413
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,340
Doesn't get tired. It takes
bombs. But he's got fight. Drake.

414
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,890
Drake makes shit rhyme. Really
good. 25 sitting on 25 mil.

415
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,710
He's a good wrestler to those wrestlers,
man.

416
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,380
Get guys who have that background in
fucking amateur wrestling is so used to,

417
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,630
I went into a wrestling room the other,
uh, the other day, my kickboxing coach,

418
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,220
Jennie part in Rumiyah Danza,
he's got a handful of titles are shit.

419
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,420
His daughter's a freshman
and we're sitting at the pool
and bell rings. I'm like,

420
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,700
oh, this has got, you know,
wrestling practice. And I was like,

421
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:42,720
what the freshmen at the fucking high
school so about like we're going to the

422
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:44,580
room and go in there and
check all these fucking kids.

423
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,510
And I realized why I'm so fucked up.
The wrestling,

424
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,080
that's what fucked up your
head. Oh, it just made me crazy.

425
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,340
Sitting some hot ass room, fucking
getting tortured and getting beat up. My,

426
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,830
my coaches are world champion and
17 from Iran and then he left.

427
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,280
He left the country and then
couldn't wrestle in the Olympics,

428
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,380
which she probably would have won
because he didn't have his green card.

429
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,820
So he would bring in all these super bad
ass as to just kicked the shit out of

430
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:12,810
me. My whole high school career, they
have a deep, deep background in wrestling.

431
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,650
Man, they fucking tortured me. Iran.
It's just, remember the iron sheik?

432
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,623
Yes.

433
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,110
She legit wrestling.
She was legit wrestling.

434
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,360
I had them in a car. Not Kidding
you man. He was a world class.

435
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,950
He's a good dude, man. Is he came on
stage with me in Toronto. I did this.

436
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,980
We'd start this. We'd show
in Toronto, they do the show.

437
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,840
It's like the underground comedy show.

438
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,610
They do it in a weed store and the the
weed store is up like a bong shop in the

439
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:51,170
front and a comedy club in the bag.

440
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,130
And you go into the back and you
can't see 10 feet in front of you.

441
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,730
You are in the clouds. Man. I'm
not joking. It's ridiculous.

442
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,570
It's the worst hotbox ever.
No ventilation whatsoever.

443
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:06,020
Every now and then again they opened up
the back door so nobody dies. That's it.

444
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,090
There's no air. You're breathing, you're
breathing in, breathing out weed. It's,

445
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:13,460
the whole room was filled with wheat
and the iron sheik was in there getting

446
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:17,020
high as fuck.
And he came on stage while I was up there.

447
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,300
He came in and he fucking this,
this is all your video of it online.

448
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,160
It's hilarious.
And me and him

449
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,370
talking on stage, but yeah, Iranians.

450
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,660
So imagine me at 15,

451
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:33,460
16 cut weight and I fucking Sana and
I have some 40 year old Iranian dude

452
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,241
massaging me,

453
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,790
read my backend and credit card down all
my sweat and people looking at us like,

454
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,950
what the fuck?
Why is that man

455
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,390
making a choice?
Sweat boy cracks him sir.

456
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,530
You can't buy him that way.
He'd be muttering to meet the Farsi.

457
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,510
You can't just scan him Sir national
clash over. If you want to fuck him,

458
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:54,770
you're going to have to hold him down.

459
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,190
I realized the same 24 hour fitness we
always went to in Aliso Viejo was a gay

460
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,760
hangout hollow. This is
getting ready mapper. Eddie,

461
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,900
Eddie and I worked out at 24 hour fitness
and there was this dude who was the

462
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:11,740
manager. There was a cool guy.
We just talked to him and uh,

463
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,720
they had sent him over from
the Santa Monica Place.

464
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:19,070
He was like a real personable, real
friendly guy. Like he, you know,

465
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:21,200
real easy to like. And so, uh,

466
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:24,920
the Santa Monica police brought him in
because they needed to get that place

467
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:29,921
cleaned out because it had basically
become just a fuck house closed the shower

468
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,790
hose him down everywhere.
It'd be common condos,

469
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,040
all mark comm. But my buddy up
working, that's how I find out

470
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,640
I, but I ended up working at the same
place and they used to have to trap dudes,

471
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:50,050
gay dudes that were fucking in the sauna
and stuff and raped the cops told you

472
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,610
until the cops came because there was
[inaudible] stations. How people die, Bro.

473
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,940
Don't trap me in the assignment.

474
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,350
So
are you ready?

475
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,810
You Ready? You Go. Let
me out of here, man.

476
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,280
Take a picture of you with the meme.
Don't make me fuck my way.

477
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,340
It me,
me of that place.

478
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,153
Just a blurred out.

479
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,710
Oh Shit. That's funny. Oh
Shit. That's funny. Fuck

480
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,350
this dude is doing such a good guy.

481
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,380
And he was telling us that basically
the gay guys had just had a run on the

482
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:43,370
place. They would just dominate in the
place there was cause it was all of them.

483
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,080
And they realize,
I don't think he's an administrate here.

484
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,410
Rock out with their cocks out.

485
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,820
I mean,

486
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,610
I guess they had probably had some gay
managers and they had to clean that shit

487
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:53,510
up and they brought in our friend.

488
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,570
I had to work out there once.
The gym that I normally worked out,

489
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,390
they closed it for filming
and I was with Larry.

490
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,600
This is back in the Larry
Days and let her go do,

491
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,380
let's just fucking go to the West
Hollywood when I don't do it,

492
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,310
I'm not going to the West Hollywood one.
I've never been that.

493
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:09,410
You just hear the story.
I heard these stories.

494
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,850
I had to get that workout in and then
he talked me into it and go, fuck it.

495
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,810
Let's just go in there
real quick. This, this,

496
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,300
this guy our chest on and get the fuck
out. I swear to God, I was standing there,

497
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:24,260
me and Larry were working on were like
benching like a 45 player on each side

498
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,520
and a guy next to me had nothing. I just
had the everywhere and he asked me, no,

499
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,320
he just asked me this.
What is this for?

500
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,490
I go to for your chest and your packs.

501
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,890
Why does it make my boss
wanting to be filled

502
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,100
your chest? I'm like, okay, fuck, this.

503
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:48,610
Just sounds like they're having a good
time and someone fucking hated on him.

504
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:52,800
He's a snitch, man. So, well, there was
one straight dude who worked out there.

505
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:56,580
They're like,
can we get his dick sucked in the sauna?

506
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,900
Bullshits my fucking home jam up.

507
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,340
I'm just looking at this apartment
is a gym right next door.

508
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:05,880
The guys from Wisconsin that doesn't
know shit about fucking Santa Monica

509
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,200
Boulevard here. It looks really
fit. I guess I'm in a fit community.

510
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,360
Everyone's walking
around with Jean shorts.

511
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,990
Jean shorts is, might be the case thing.
There's a million things right here.

512
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,150
You have to,

513
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,940
you have to be sucking a dick while your
roller to make it carrier Darren Elkins

514
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,843
probably happen.

515
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,410
Yeah, it's happened for sure. Someone
sucked a Dick while rollerblading.

516
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,240
100% a hundred percent yeah.

517
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,790
There's probably been a dude that
was mounted on a dude's face,

518
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,290
like he's a flying triangle

519
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,420
while they were
open his face,

520
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,220
whether we're rolling
down Venice Boulevard,

521
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,200
it's probably happened in all the years
that there have been blowjobs and roller

522
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,110
blades. It's for sure it happened.
What percentage of flights,

523
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,440
domestic flights have
gay sex going on him. 1%

524
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,440
they're all gay during
which ones?

525
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,560
Cause I got a day love fucking anonymous.

526
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,220
You know what? If, if we were all gay,
we would all be under the same shit.

527
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:18,221
Gets guys were guys would
be [inaudible] be as tight.

528
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,000
What are they known for?
Anonymous sex in bathrooms and,

529
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:34,760
and uh, uh, bath houses and all
that. That's totally normal.

530
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,460
That's how we would all be if
we were all good. If I was gap,

531
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,560
probably be doing the same.
My question is even if you're not

532
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,660
getting down to that kind of stuff,

533
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,890
here's a few gals out there that just
don't follow the rules and a lot of women

534
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,290
give rules.

535
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,820
I don't think I'm with you buddy.
I'm not trying to cock block here.

536
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm just trying to let you know how the,
how the gals were looking at it.

537
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,000
I would take one of these bitches
is fucking ruining the curve.

538
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,890
That's why legalize prostitution moves
into a country. Chicks just get married.

539
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:19,730
Like look, we just kind of lock this down.
We just, let's just, this is what it is.

540
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,290
Lost value

541
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,620
about to legalize prostitution.
The,

542
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,230
the overall consensus of women that
might have been worried there on the,

543
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,820
and understand like some
girls don't even care.

544
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:37,130
Like I don't care what it cause
don't you see what this means?

545
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,150
Do it start calling

546
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,030
Debo of horse. They just locked
up. They be like God damn it.

547
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:50,031
Like hey do not want to
see daisy chain like crazy.

548
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,340
Zero power and countries like in Argentina
they're just, they have zero power.

549
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:59,870
There's nothing. Well that's not a
good thing. Conquering countries.

550
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,360
That's what it was like the
back of the Gingiss con days,

551
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,100
feminism is what's keeping prostitution
is illegal because of who came illegal.

552
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,380
We just blocked them all on Twitter.

553
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:14,381
We'd never have to hear a word
of [inaudible] over there.

554
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,860
Why are feminists listening to your shit?
Cause I got,

555
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,330
I got talk shit to you for awhile by
some feminists. You know what man,

556
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,470
I'm a homophobe or jam.
Not, no, you're not home.

557
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,410
I'm not into anybody WHO's only
into one gender. Look at this.

558
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,980
He shouldn't go with Ninja trick right
there from the top. They're like, oh,

559
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,350
I get it around. He had his elbow like
in front of it instead of behind it. I,

560
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,690
you know what I feel like,
man,

561
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,330
I'm not into dudes who are
in the men's rights either,

562
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,540
but guys who identify themselves as
really beat, he's going for it again.

563
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:49,400
And the other side of you guys who are
really into men's rights, like I'm,

564
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,640
what do you mean this
groups? Men's rights. Happy.

565
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,420
I was insulted by feminist and
commodity an Mra and I did it.

566
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,020
I didn't even had a conversation with her.
She misconstrues my point.

567
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,440
I'm not a men's right. I didn't even know
what a Mra was, so I had to look it up.

568
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:07,170
I thought it was like one of those meal
packages you get when you were in the

569
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:12,120
army Mre. Yeah. But it was a, um, it's a
fucking bomb that hasn't been exploded.

570
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,780
It was the fucking men's rights
advocate. And I went, no way.

571
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,250
Is that what she's saying?
And then I'm like, wow.

572
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:22,200
How ironic is it that a feminist would
be mocking a guy who's into male rights?

573
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:25,200
Like are you telling me that the men
don't have any, like what does that mean?

574
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,170
Men Don't deserve rights? Like how
could you be mocking someone? Oh,

575
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,830
you're one of those dumb dumb Mri or
Mra is cause some of the shit that

576
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,980
[inaudible] very sexy to that picture.

577
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,683
Qut.

578
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,310
Good day on the Camry stud
muffin look perfectly bronzed.

579
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,920
Yeah, man. You know, I'm, I don't,

580
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,130
I think that a lot of feminism feminism
is women who identify themselves with

581
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,570
being a feminist and as soon
as you start doing that,

582
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:04,680
it becomes like a thing you do. Like
I'm in the car. Yeah. I in the fucking,

583
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:09,660
I love bowling. You know, find something
like feminist blogger. Okay, well,

584
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,160
you know,
I like to play pool

585
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,040
now. It creates, it's like you're
trying to like break that wall down.

586
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,500
Now you're creating a wall, a
door and shit like that, you know?

587
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,260
Or it lets you know not hanging out
with her. It's just too much work.

588
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,550
Boyfriend, no guy's gonna
put up. Yeah, those guys are
put it flopped you there. No,

589
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,413
no guys.

590
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,630
I know there's a lot of social with
it called social justice warriors.

591
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,190
These social justice warriors. Yeah,
White Knights. It's, it's all men that,

592
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,670
you know, under normal circumstances
would starve to death. They would,

593
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,230
if we were all in the hunting parties,
we would there be limping back there.

594
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,010
We'd send them when people
like that should be fucked up.

595
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,140
There was something bad would
happen if I'm eating it, but

596
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:58,010
they don't cities
about

597
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,490
good or bad. It's good. Right?
Good. Stop. And why isn't,

598
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,320
why isn't vitamin water?
Cause they used to get,

599
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,490
why didn't they blasting
that for some reason?

600
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,390
No one knows that you Stevia,
Stevia,

601
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:20,390
the sugar to other stuff too.
But they use Stevia but they don't.

602
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,820
You would think that they would set, man,
we're missing a good fucking fight, man.

603
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,910
For sure. I was getting
blown up. It's not good.

604
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:34,080
It's got good shots. Yeah. No he will.
He's landed. He can take it, man.

605
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,180
That's part of the style.
Oh, that head rocked him.

606
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,790
And that was behind the ear to
oh on the chin with that one.

607
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,210
He's just so damn tough man.
So hard to finish that dude.

608
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,270
That was why it was so impressive
when he, uh, he lost a Mendez.

609
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,610
Mendez lit him up, man. Mendez look like
a monster in that fight. Who's taking men?

610
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,240
Does anyone taking Mendez?
Nope. I like you guys' style.

611
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,820
Going to have a coffee you guys style.

612
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:04,290
He says it's a little bit like a
drag racer though. Fucking well.

613
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,760
So it was all done by the way.
All those are three round motherfucker.

614
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,720
And then the last two rounds he like
Ricardo Lamas was on top of him.

615
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,990
I'm beating his ass in that fifth round.
And that's reality.

616
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,620
The thing is they say all the strides
he's made, which done him wrong. He has,

617
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,640
he's not TJ. He's not going to move
like that. Beat his more power.

618
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,480
I feel like though. Oh, she
definitely does, but I just don't see,

619
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,360
I think all those two good.

620
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,000
And I think although has always
been better than Brown anyways,

621
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,720
technically because he's so,
he's so precise, you know,

622
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,430
or browse on moral child and good.
But I think that I don't, yeah,

623
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,640
I don't think Chad can
eat, although I think it's,

624
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,240
I just think that, uh, that, you know,
he's, he's, he doesn't move like Tj,

625
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:46,070
he's not gonna. He's not gonna
outstrip all though, which I think he,

626
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:49,860
he thinks he's got a master splinter
in his corner though I was wrong.

627
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,070
I was going to get beat
up so I wasn't on there.

628
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,830
What do you think about fucking Dominick
Cruz? God Damn. Did he look like a beast?

629
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,150
Proud of him, man. Oh my
value on the Steven Bro.

630
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,460
I brought in Daniel Cormier eight, then
my camp. Yeah, I saw the photo. Yeah.

631
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,020
And he brought in a, uh,
Dominic Cruz with them.

632
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,570
How much trying to show us this footwork.
He's like the shop.

633
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:13,390
This is what you gotta do is show
me in DC like real quick, man,

634
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,700
your waist smaller than us.
That stuffs,

635
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,780
it's just not going to fit our wheelhouse
because it's trying to do that shit.

636
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,610
Travis. Travis moves a
lot like that, I guess.

637
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,160
I mean that's like saying yeah and I
throw a right hook like Mike Tyson.

638
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,340
Yeah, we both throw right hooks, you know
what I'm saying? It's like, Geez man.

639
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:38,110
Paul said it's pretty good at that
Dominick Cruz thing. He's all right. Oh,

640
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,090
I mean it's a far cry from the original.

641
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,180
Dominick Cruz took it to another
Dominick Cruz level the other day though.

642
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,740
I've never been so happy for another
fight of that. That's I don't train with.

643
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:51,100
I was so happy for him.
That kid showed zero hesitation too.

644
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:55,210
He came out guns blazing.
Just got them tough guys too.

645
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,770
That's all east.
I know you're Riaa finished him,

646
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,680
but he got his back and choked him and
you know Mitchell [inaudible] and not

647
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:06,620
just not the same kind of grapple you're
riding and it was all pro bring in DC

648
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,580
into the camp. Don't look
at that fucking Combo. Yeah,

649
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,500
I'm sure. I'm sure it's here. La. Yeah.

650
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,000
What is it like working out
with him and how's his knee?

651
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,560
Because he's 100% yeah,
it's this pressure he brings.

652
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:26,800
I've never seen anything like it.
I've trained with a, you know,

653
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,010
I've trained with a ton of guy.
That's cane dude. The pressure,

654
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:33,190
he just keeps coming and keeps coming.
Keeps coming. That's him and came man.

655
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,400
Those guys. Two werewolves. Yup. Who
keeps coming fucking seeking each other.

656
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,080
I brought core man for my camp and he's
a monster. Watch them spar. No, I wish.

657
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,770
I'd love to see that. I've
seen some videos and them
spar is goddamn ridiculous.

658
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,020
Watch is for war chaos,
eating each other's style,

659
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,460
the same style,

660
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,050
knowing me get ground the same style and
both guys are going 100% I mean they're,

661
00:41:57,051 --> 00:42:00,920
they're fucking going to war and I
wonder about that man. I don't, I don't,

662
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:04,160
you don't. There's obviously
you can't fuck with the results.

663
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:07,250
Cain is the best heavyweight
next to fade or ever. Right.

664
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,110
I mean there's fate or him and that's it.

665
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,170
And I would love to see
the two of them together.

666
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:13,940
And who knows what the fuck would have
happened. I didn't. You know, who knows?

667
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:17,180
If you watched the two junior dos
Santos fights since the first fight,

668
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,040
you wouldn't think that
junior could knock 'em out.

669
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,340
But junior knocked him out and anything
can happen. Fader was a risk taken.

670
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,470
Motherfucker feto would,

671
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,850
he would get wild on your ass and bricks
on the end of his hand through those

672
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:32,630
casting punches. Yeah, he was.
He's never scared, never scared.

673
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:34,940
He waited in ferocious.
So that guy could,

674
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,290
he mean he literally could have beaten
anybody when he was at his badge. Okay.

675
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,380
Keynes injuries. It's kind of like, yeah,

676
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,460
well he keeps beating the
shit out of his body. No,

677
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,110
100% they're going a hundred percent man.
I,

678
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:52,010
I've told my sprawling down in my career,
I'm 30 now and I'm old,

679
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:54,890
but I've just been fucking injured a lot.
Well,

680
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,090
there's a lot of people to think that
the sparring is one of the unnecessary

681
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:03,230
aspects of strength and conditioning
that people overdo because you're so,

682
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,780
you're beating each other up so much
and there's so much trauma that you,

683
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,150
if you just as you reach a
point of diminishing returns,
like yeah. Are you tough?

684
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,790
Yeah. Can you mentally deal with it?
Cause you're dealing with a regular basis.

685
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,680
Yes. But could you be 2% better if he
didn't do that? Could you be three,

686
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:22,280
maybe five? I don't think you can
take it completely out, but you can't,

687
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,760
you can't take completely,
nope. No Way. No chance.

688
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,970
You can do like a Manny Pacquiao spars.
Only the last four weeks of camp,

689
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,050
a really, really spot or the last
six weeks of camp. I do a, we cannot,

690
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,060
we only spread the last six weeks of camp.
And how much,

691
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,420
how many times a week do you spar?
Once, once a week. That's that.

692
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,090
Once a week we're bringing
some hell raisers, man.

693
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,620
As long as you launch the songs,

694
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:46,940
you're simulating scenarios using
techniques that are going to come up in a

695
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:51,200
fight and win them over. You know,
Eddie always talks about this,

696
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,200
about how if you just fucking,
everybody loves to roll,

697
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,270
but if you just drilled more,

698
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,910
it would make you so much more
successful at your roles and it's really

699
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:00,950
essentially the same way
with any martial art.

700
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,640
I mean with kickboxing you if you just
beat the shit out of each other all the

701
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:05,600
time.
Yeah,

702
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,460
I guess you're probably going to get
better because you're putting a lot of

703
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:10,310
attention to it,
but if you work out with a really good,

704
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:15,200
like rob came in type coach or Duane
Ludwig type coach who takes you through

705
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:16,640
very specific drills.

706
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,610
Once you're actually sparring and
you land that left to the body,

707
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:22,430
it's like your right leg is coming around.
Whether you think about it or not,

708
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,040
it's just there.
It's just a part of your,

709
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,150
your your body's memory and I think that
we still don't know what the right way

710
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:31,320
to do this shit.
You guys are.

711
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:35,220
Do you two guys are like experimental
projects 10 years from for Real, right?

712
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,090
You guys are the new breed of them.
Amazing.

713
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,770
Yeah.

714
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,980
Little spider man.
He's jacking off and shit.

715
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:51,090
Not every shop you like one of those
fucking killer chimpanzees they found in

716
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,660
the car in the Congo,
six foot tall dick

717
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,040
trying to fuck me. See the same world
as you know about those no devil nuke.

718
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,630
They have these over the last like since
like the 90s they found these chimps in

719
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,280
the Congo that they've
always talked about.

720
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:08,510
They had a photo of one that was shot
and like the early 19 hundreds they call

721
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:11,890
him the Bondo ape.
It's an enormous chimpanzee,

722
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:13,710
a completely different genus stands up.

723
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,580
They stand up and they have a crest on
their skull just like a gorilla does,

724
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:22,340
but their chimps and they
sleep on the ground. They
don't give a fuck. No. Locals.

725
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,720
Locals call him lion killers.
They say there's two.

726
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,000
They have a video of one
apparently eating a leopard.

727
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,500
They have two different types of chimp.

728
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,090
They call them tree beaters and lion
killers and these align killers and there

729
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:34,020
are giant six foot tall,

730
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:37,710
350 pound chimps and they
sleep on the ground like this

731
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,670
lump in there,
Dick,

732
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:45,120
why they pass out and everything just
fucking steers clear of these crazy fucks.

733
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,810
Thank, I think of a chimp how strong a
chimp is and they're like 150 pounds.

734
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,600
This is double the size,
six feet tall, super smart.

735
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,480
They have pictures of them all
over the Internet, like walking,

736
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,850
like walking like a person there's,
or this Carl Armand is ago,

737
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,400
Swiss wildlife photographer.

738
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,570
And he found photos of them and
like spent years looking for them.

739
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,170
But apparently it's an incredibly
remote part of the Congo that's super

740
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:08,160
difficult to get to.

741
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,760
But just now these people that are
fucking risking their lives in this crazy

742
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,560
shitty part of the world, these
aggressive, oh, of course they are.

743
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,191
One of them.

744
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,220
There's a fucking great story about
these scientists that went down there and

745
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:24,120
one of them made a fucking a bluff charge
at them and it just, they didn't move.

746
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,190
You can't move.
You're dead anyway.

747
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,180
So just you got to stand your
ground because if I move back up,

748
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,610
if you do back up there for sure. Gonna
fuck you up. They rip your nuts off first.

749
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,230
Oh yeah. They know the
genitals base. Yeah.

750
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,710
They know what works. They know
what you like. Early UFC rules,

751
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:45,820
they're smart as shit.
They're like halfway between
a person and an animal, but

752
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,220
ripping balls off. You had, if you
had a monkey, there was 150 pounds.

753
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,740
He wanted to fuck you up.
You'd be in a giant problem.

754
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,290
He would probably kill you
most likely to rip you apart.

755
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:03,650
Imagine something twice that big twice
that big and super aggressive and the

756
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:09,690
locals call them lion killers and we
just barely know about these things.

757
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,020
They have DNA from them. They have
some photographs and some videos,

758
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,880
but they barely know these fucking things
exist in a very difficult spot to get

759
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,950
to.
It ended up as the pet

760
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,550
training partner. That
monster, well I your mom,

761
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,530
Bondo Abe's to train with
next podcast.

762
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,770
He trained with Bondo a take babies
and then train them and bring them up.

763
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,870
They can't take them. If they're
already adults, forget it.

764
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,580
Hannibal Lecter masks on their face.

765
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,210
I get crazy in the middle of
training time. He doesn't buy it,

766
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,470
but what he bites it would be a hammer
fist and a wheel kick at the same time.

767
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,370
Can you imagine if you taught
a chimp how to do a gay teen?

768
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,430
Pop your head off, especially with a big
giant ones. Dario, throwing a decision.

769
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,980
Holy Shit. Brazil. It's stuff to do. Wow.

770
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,250
We were barely paying attention.
Now let's be honest.

771
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,450
We're talking about a month
is biting dicks off son. Yeah,

772
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,200
I still thinking of that.
You tried to fuck everyone.

773
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,700
You're trying to fuck that bondo way,
but who's going to get,

774
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:26,170
who have failed those son Joseph Havi.
Who's he fighting?

775
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:30,650
He's fighting someone good. That's right.
Nate Diaz coming back in at that shit.

776
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,200
Nate Diaz coming back. Joe
Sanchez is a monster. Yeah.

777
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:37,570
He's tough as shit, dude. I can't
believe knocked out Henderson.

778
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,740
That was fucking nab cowboy. Yeah, he
beat kicked about it, man. He's a beast.

779
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,530
He beat a couple of guys.
He's beating quite a few really good guys.

780
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,710
But knocking out Benson,
this fucking huge man.

781
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:52,210
Fabio Maldonado was always fun to
watch Human Zombie history before.

782
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:57,040
I see this is paper view. The old
body shot, Maldonado don't play.

783
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,960
He's got really good left hook man.

784
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,140
Look how smooth his boxing
and he's a perfect example.

785
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:05,950
The the exact opposite of a guy like
boggle teen off. He's a big guy.

786
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:07,420
I mean he's fighting,
you know,

787
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,890
two oh five but yet he's like super
light and relaxed with his punches.

788
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,930
He made a big mistake. Fucking Steve
Bay though. Boy Did he have a choice?

789
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,640
No, I'm saying he asked for that
animal. Look at that picture up there.

790
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,563
That's the bond.

791
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,290
That was one that they found that was
one they shot in like the early 19

792
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,510
hundreds so you can get a picture of that,
a better picture of that.

793
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,510
Cause they show like it's whole body.
But if you look at the other one, Jamie,

794
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,060
there's one that they shot
at an airport recently,

795
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,010
these two guys and they're
standing in front of it.

796
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,150
So you get a perspective shot.

797
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,330
Thing is in that picture you're talking
about and the airport. Well there,

798
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,450
that's a different one. That's one
of the caught on the camera trap.

799
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:45,010
But this picture of one that they shot,

800
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,910
it's actually dead and these dudes are
standing with this thing and you look at

801
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:51,810
it and you go, they kills that. I
probably could have. They could.

802
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,040
I mean they were living in the Congo.
They eat Champps there.

803
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,930
They eat whatever kind of meat they
can get. I saw you're a real sports.

804
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,920
No, that's, that's another image in
one two. You have the real sports? No,

805
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:07,000
there's just look up Bondo ape. And if
that doesn't work, look up [inaudible] A,

806
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:11,420
B I. L I a Bondo. A shop
training partner. You'll see one.

807
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,280
There's an image search.
You got it.

808
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,700
The one with the does a dead one.
There it is.

809
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:20,110
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

810
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,850
Look at the size of that fucking thing
back up so you can see it's balls.

811
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,180
Back up a little.
Look at that Stack Zack and

812
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,010
cock.
How'd they kill it to shatter your,

813
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,410
they didn't kill it with a fucking
wiffle ball bat. I'll tell you that.

814
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,060
You better shoot that thing. Look at this
fucking muscles on that goddamn thing.

815
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,440
It's gorilla. He's smiling
to deliver. Are they bigger?

816
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,130
Grills are bigger,
but that's,

817
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,160
that's the real aside for a
chimp that is fucking enormous.

818
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:54,020
That's like a really big man. That's a set
of tits on him. He's got his arms, dude.

819
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:55,760
Those are like your legs.
Just Dick.

820
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,060
He can look at that fucking package.

821
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,840
It's just all but solver.

822
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,200
That's all up in your face
thing like his leg to the left.

823
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,720
That fucking picture. She
frees me up, man. Left stomach.

824
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:18,580
That's his CAC at this cap
rate. That's easy. Well,

825
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,310
they don't have big dicks like
people do, Bro. People that have

826
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,110
big balls because the ball's side,
this is actually scientific fact.

827
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:30,560
That ball size of directly proportionate
to the amount of promiscuous females in

828
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:34,700
the region includes human beings and he
in villages where human women are more

829
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:38,630
slutty. The human men grow bigger
balls. Swimming. That's your huge

830
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,580
ego balls
important.

831
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:50,630
My girlfriend, I just, I was
like, you know what, to call
this out of state. Exactly.

832
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:55,040
Go out of state.
Small town girl.

833
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,580
Well, there's too many people in
Orange County. They have to fuck.

834
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:01,400
There's too much traffic. They just
do it. It's true. It's just fuck.

835
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,510
Can't wait for my boyfriend to get here.
Come on over.

836
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,040
He's stuck in traffic
for the next two hours.

837
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,620
So Fabio Maldonado versus Han stringer.
Anybody know anything about stringer,

838
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,260
stranger, stranger to know in the UFC?
Is it strange with the Black Zillion?

839
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,140
He's about to get punched.
The fucking another lens.

840
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,420
It's going to be a standup boy for sure.
He has a couple kids,

841
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,430
a victory over a fence and Mark
Barroso and one of the fight nights.

842
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,250
Third round decision. Hmm. Well done. Not
was a fucking bad ass. Oh, he's a beast,

843
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,650
dude.
His boxing is really slick.

844
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,620
Remember when he clipped Glover
Glover's lightened him up, dude.

845
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,370
Lighten them up and then he catches him
with a left hook and as Glover doing the

846
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:46,580
chicken dance. But he's
just so tough, man.

847
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,730
So this is a guy you don't want to
have a conversation with when he's 70

848
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,120
was too tough. He, those guys are too
tough where they take them postman,

849
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:56,800
you're like stop this.
Yeah.

850
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,280
When he's 70 and he's drunk and you and
him are sitting there and he puts his

851
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:03,950
hand on your need to tell
your story and does that clamp

852
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,850
the clamp on your knee when they
spent time, Bro, I fucking told him.

853
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,830
I told him I'm not going down. I'm not
going down. Tells the same stories.

854
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,730
Are there any,
are there any legends have speech.

855
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:22,750
No comment.

856
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,910
Or it could be like that old dude that
beat the fuck out of that young boxer

857
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,930
with the long hair.
Like

858
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,430
you never see that video. Oh my God. I

859
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,640
was like 16 he fuck with a old man back.
He had old man back

860
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:48,210
hunch shrimp,
shrimp and I was like,

861
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,900
Oh fuck this guy screwed. Screwed.
Yeah. When he slipped the Jack,

862
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:57,480
the Jack God damn world. Ah, Ooh.

863
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,171
There's that.

864
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:02,010
That level of boxing you get to where
your eyes are open as the punch hits.

865
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:04,290
You ever seen those
pictures of like old school?

866
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,680
Roberto Duran is a photo of
him as a punches hitting him.

867
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:11,370
His eye is wide open and he's throwing
a counter shot cause the punches hitting

868
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:14,460
him. He's turning his head
and planned. I mean those,

869
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:18,630
when you hit that level it's just
you're so relaxed. And that old man,

870
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,540
old man was used to getting punched.
It wasn't a new experience.

871
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,800
Fuck hey did.
He didn't have to one out.

872
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:30,750
He was going out and bad boys been around
for fucking ever and it hadn't seemed

873
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:32,310
like they've really,
you know why?

874
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,590
Because so many dudes tattooed on their
body to go look, we've got to keep kids.

875
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,840
Are they making any Mary
Horn as a bad boy tattoo? And

876
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,870
you know what,
if you think about it,

877
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:49,290
that really is like the coolest thing for,
I'm a bad boy.

878
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,860
Everybody wants to be a bad boy.
Girls like bad boys

879
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,460
coming to Jitsu or like a Brazilian thing.

880
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,940
Cause I remember in like 88 I remember
I had like a pair of shorts and it was

881
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:01,070
rude.
Boy

882
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,950
got with like spiky Johnny Bravo here.
Come with like a spiky like this. Probably

883
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,440
those bands back in the 80s.

884
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,600
Rude boy that I remember.

885
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,240
Do you remember when that was
first and that was born in the 80s.

886
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:22,980
So I don't know how he gets all fucking
old Dan. Daniel born in the 80s.

887
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,720
Fuck Pussy. When you were coming
out of pussy. Yes. Hollow.

888
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:31,590
I be your father
speaking.

889
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,640
It could be your father
if school I made 84 84.

890
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,080
It was when I was just starting to get
fussy so I could have fucked up and shot

891
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,810
one into my girlfriend. Jesus
Luisa. Speaking about shooting one

892
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,670
powerful genetics. Here
we go. If anybody's to us,

893
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,630
they take our don't like Brazil
and that's why I'm not there.

894
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:57,150
It couldn't be more further
from the truth. I love Brazil.

895
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,260
Escalate the ground right away.
I love going to Rio. I just,

896
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,840
I didn't have the time this week
and I had family obligations.

897
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:08,190
I just couldn't make it. I had to how to
stay in town. Damn kids. Well it's that,

898
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,270
um, there's no things I can't talk
about, but a lot of stuff going on

899
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,840
out on the grounds. Got a bad ass
hole dudes. Was that judo video?

900
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:23,470
Real amazing.
Mine too.

901
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,350
Have you seen that video? I took your
fucking mind Jamie. Pull that shit up.

902
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:30,130
That old dude video of a,
the old dude doing judo.

903
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,910
These guys are trying to toss him and
he's moving like water just flowing around

904
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:37,090
them and he's like in his sixties and
other old dude in his 60 when you know

905
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:41,070
you're almost dead, you give zero
fucks. You're not protecting your ACL.

906
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,270
He's just out there letting it hang,
you know? And I tried to fucking,

907
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,140
I got to fucking rotator cuff injury. I
just going to let this dude take me down,

908
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:54,610
wipe off my back more times in a row.
It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing.

909
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,710
The guy's technique is just
stellar. It's also, there's,

910
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,630
this is a potential of watching that
video that they're his students and

911
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:03,700
sometimes when you row with your students,

912
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,980
the students almost have like a give up
on the Quito death touch and have those

913
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:13,410
guys and just like flipping this is
different. Yeah. What are they about?

914
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,690
They're all crazy. Don't brainwash.
Totally brainwashed. Yeah.

915
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,590
How about your boy hunt getting the
title shot? Fuck yeah. Do you know why?

916
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,900
Do they make an agreement like Bunko with
it and do they talk about it or is it

917
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:31,150
unfold
or these like a cult thing.

918
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:31,670
You know what I'm saying?

919
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,670
Drink this Koolaid so never
really sat to [inaudible].

920
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,270
Cool. Right. I don't even think I've
ever talked about that. Let me think.

921
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:48,640
You have to do that.
That's an important fucking seminar.

922
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,980
Again,
good right off the guys that would do it.

923
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,120
You can't go back to the fucking check.

924
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,890
You call up the assholes
who are going to fall down.

925
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,970
I would never be able
to pull that word off.

926
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:07,210
I don't even know what I knew what you
meant. Like right when you said I go,

927
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,170
I seen that online.

928
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,640
I never really played that game.
I mean I did a few times,

929
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:20,370
but not enough to call her Duke and Fabio
is getting tagged with that elbow at

930
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,740
the top. Big Old Dutchman.
Brazil is not happy. Big Brown.

931
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:26,290
When you get into half guard
position in this spot here,

932
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,120
do you ground and pounded you try to pass.

933
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,200
I looked for submission from half guard.
Most most guys,

934
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,440
most guys like to ground and pound here,

935
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:38,200
especially wrestlers cause you can
really control. Got To half guard.

936
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,250
Especially in MMA. True. I agree.

937
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:43,730
I like,

938
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,890
I like to give them this Sunday like I
did with metro and I give him the under

939
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,060
hook and I looked for my doors.

940
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:54,210
I looked for the neck or that come up
now his dark especially at heavy label.

941
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,980
Look at this, look at this. Nice with
the hooks man. Nice with the hooks.

942
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,610
Oh beautiful job. Beautiful
job. Good control.

943
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,090
Yeah.
I don't care.

944
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:13,150
I think mounts overrating them and
man I'll show some amount of you.

945
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:15,970
You'd be fine.
100% just slide data was Shankar.

946
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:18,580
When did you try to regain half guard?
Yes.

947
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,740
Why or or create a scrambled number.

948
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:24,110
Why would you try to regain half
guard if cause I can get up.

949
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,690
Even the viewer and how the model
was a deep half. He would stay,

950
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,850
he was pacing is on top,
get out and I don't know what it meant.

951
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,150
What I'll do is I'd create a scramble.

952
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,510
I give him the under hook to a
scramble to get their neck or and all.

953
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:36,230
You hear what I'm saying?
I see what you're saying.

954
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,070
If you don't want a mouse because it's an,

955
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,440
it's worse than being in someone's half
guard. Then if you were being mounted,

956
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,030
why would you put them in half guard?
You would. You should just leave it.

957
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,060
I think it depends on the style.
Depends on who.

958
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,160
It depends who you're fighting too.
That makes it fighting for doom.

959
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,870
You don't let that
motherfucker mountain know.

960
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,200
I don't think he let anybody fucking
mountain you ever when you're in the

961
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:59,060
mountain, naturally as a fighter
you want to recover half guard.

962
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,200
At least it depends. It depends who
you're fighting. So there's guys,

963
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:06,200
guys mouth to create
scrambles, but you, you have a

964
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,860
pretty good just for awhile.
So if you were mounted on a purple belt,

965
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,880
you'd be pretty happy with it. Right?
If you were mounted on the guy who just,

966
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:18,770
maybe he was a notch below you,
you would take that and you'd stay there.

967
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,600
It was an MMA fight, right? Yes.

968
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:23,270
So the difference between that
and the guy was really good.

969
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:26,570
Is it that your mount is not
good enough or is it, no,

970
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:30,710
I think in MMA because when the strike
in the show, because your grape vine,

971
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,920
right? And you find the guy out if
you're not going to get heavy strikes in,

972
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,250
right. So you were kind of just sitting
there or if you're of a doom guy,

973
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:39,920
you're looking for some issue
that cross your feet underneath,

974
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:42,530
like a guard from the top amount,
like a mouth guard.

975
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,620
If you're doing guy, you'd
go for selection. Okay,

976
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:53,390
let's listen to Ian because everybody,
what's your philosophy on it?

977
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:57,740
I'm just better at punching and passing
and everybody else in my division.

978
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:02,330
So it's, it's not, it's easy for an amount
pass mount. You're trying to recover.

979
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:05,310
I'm going to try them out again. Try
and Matt again. Why do you want it?

980
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:06,440
Why are you trying to get to the mountain?

981
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,060
It's a dominant position and I can punch
you from there and I can get you to,

982
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,130
the person gets tired, you know, they,

983
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:16,880
they start to panic and they start a
square and I take their back and do

984
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,980
whatever, but I can kind of
float above somebody in the,

985
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,780
in the belly punch elbow and I mean they
get that guy to work so much when you

986
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:27,740
can float over him and hit him with needs
of the body or whatever it is you're,

987
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:31,130
you're hitting the guy that you can't
do that from half guard. He can,

988
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,890
you said you couldn't scramble
that amount. You're on neon belly.

989
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:38,150
You let them turn. I'll do
like the, you know, the, the,

990
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,860
the cross my feet,

991
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,980
if I get locked them down a lock
them down and then just punch him,

992
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,210
elbow him and look for a submission.
But I don't mind it that people are,

993
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,980
if they're starting to scramble
like that and I'm on top of him,

994
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,550
it's such a dominant position. I can
just, I just hold people down. I agree.

995
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:55,610
And they just said no. I'm saying when
you, when you place your feet like that,

996
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,620
you're not finishing and guy was strikes.

997
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,280
You mean when you butterfly or when you,
when you bring up finishing

998
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,280
high level grappler from mountain.
He's going to get out guys. But dude,

999
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:08,750
there's some guys when you grapevine,

1000
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,080
there's things that have like a
crazy hyperextension in their back.

1001
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,320
I've seen guys who flattened guys
out with great flatten them out,

1002
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:18,730
but they can still fucking blast
from the top. There's a few guys,

1003
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:22,320
lot of games when there's no nasty,

1004
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:27,600
you gotta be able to sit up. You got to
have a calculated game going on. I agree.

1005
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,800
Like what are you doing when there's
not punches in the mountain? Big Brown.

1006
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:33,180
Why are you not trained with Eddie Bravo?

1007
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,640
You need to get your fucking ass over
to 10th planet. Get a couple of lessons.

1008
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:40,160
Just talk. Don't talk about it. Be
about in Venice, man, he can't make it.

1009
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:44,430
That's incredible dude.
It's a total drunk.

1010
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,000
He can't be expected to Lawrence County
a wrestling reign training center.

1011
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,420
That was the first time we met.
I was still hanging out.

1012
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,700
There's a lot of 10th
planet Jiu Jitsu down there.

1013
01:02:56,701 --> 01:03:00,610
Tony Ferguson transcend a header a heater
on, right? Everyone knows this. Yeah,

1014
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,620
I got a crush on him to do it. How to
do it with you. I got a question. I'm,

1015
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,740
I don't want to go down to Orange County.
Listen what you're saying.

1016
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,550
Everything you're saying about
the Verdomme guy. Yes, correct.

1017
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,290
But everyone should strive
to be the Verdugo guy.

1018
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,260
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm striving to be the redeemed guy.

1019
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:18,530
I'm with you. Jujitsu is
my passion. I moved here.

1020
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:22,160
When you get out on Travis Brown,
he's not getting that.

1021
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,370
He's not a Brendan shop on the ground,
but to do that to everybody. I agree,

1022
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:29,520
but it like whoever Brazilian,
why everyone. I'm still,

1023
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,200
if I'm going against a high
level Brazilian and I can
get them out, I'm like,

1024
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:37,650
if you've got damn mountain and go, Holy
Shit, I'm dominating this fucking with,

1025
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:39,990
you know, if it's there, but I,

1026
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,210
I'm never going to stay in half
guard if I can get them out.

1027
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,290
I want to get to the mount because you're
in some deep shit and the mountain.

1028
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,420
There was a lot of games with
your brother. But what happened?

1029
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:51,270
Punk Shit in half guard. Well,
you're just nasty. Overall.

1030
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:53,310
The overall and MMA have
you look at all the fights,

1031
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,760
not that many fights and from you
put all the time a fight is in,

1032
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,100
in half guard, top happen. MMA most
of the time nothing's happening.

1033
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:05,700
It's at the boring shit. And that in
that respect, in that same argument,

1034
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:09,650
most of the time when you're in guard,
it's bullshit. And I agree with nasty.

1035
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,770
I agree with his half guard. His fucking
top game from half court is very good.

1036
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,900
He's a very shift. That's a beautiful
thing. His is, he put material on asleep.

1037
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,660
That's a beautiful thing. You know,
half guard, Doris, half guard, uh,

1038
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,530
Japanese Necktie, half guard
guillotine fuck your half guard.

1039
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,900
That knee bar to hell. Yeah. Hell yeah.

1040
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,280
But also all sorts of gain from
side control. There's a whole,

1041
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,010
for sure the loves and the
whole system from the mouth.

1042
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,000
And then the back is a whole nother book.
No fights.

1043
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:43,350
All that in front of Dina and he's not
watching. He's watching the Monitor.

1044
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,770
It's a weird thing. He's watching the
Monitor. How dare you, Eddie Bravo.

1045
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,320
But it's weird thing you do.
Sometimes the fight is on in front of you,

1046
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,500
but you're watching a monitor in front
of us and three screens and we're talking

1047
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,080
about we're talkers in Argentina,
but we're still watching it.

1048
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,160
I'm still watching it. Still awesome
chance given to punch people.

1049
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,570
Maldonado is just fucking excels.
I understand what you're saying.

1050
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,360
Sneaky take sexually strong.
He's got a little extra,

1051
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,590
especially at heavyweight other,
you know what I'm saying?

1052
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,590
The show exposed to that heavyweight.
I, I would say they're less explosive,

1053
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,190
happy way.

1054
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,680
I disagree with the explosive guys who
guys, I can't, well, I completely agree.

1055
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,150
Like really know because guys his size,
how many I'm playing football.

1056
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,570
I'll do a solid zero.
How many of them to play football?

1057
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:32,310
He was like the star people
destroying,

1058
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,990
destroying it.

1059
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,470
Fucking weight shop.
When I'm with the back to the mouth talk,

1060
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,170
I've got a question about cops,
man.

1061
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,450
They outlawed those tie steel cups in
a lot of grappling competitions. Right,

1062
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:53,890
because you can fuck a dude up with a cup.
So why can't you do training in MMA?

1063
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,820
It's an MMA.
Like when I remember one time I will

1064
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:02,660
pause that was wearing a man. What
the fuck? Maldonado's given some big

1065
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:07,450
look how calm

1066
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,500
you got to shoot. You got to shoot the
perfect devil's pool on top of you.

1067
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,560
And then when they come back with that
wizard, you come up with them right to,

1068
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,960
he's not looking to do that.
So I need to have that skill set.

1069
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,420
Maldonado was looking to
just fucking fire ups.

1070
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,270
Anderson Anderson up there with them
Anderson's in his corner. Come on,

1071
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:35,200
come on son. Dude. Bald to know. But
you know, you could learn something.

1072
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:39,760
Watching him punch like everything was
very precise and it like 70% power.

1073
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,640
Whoever the fuck he wants, he can
do whatever you want. He's in Rio.

1074
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:43,690
They give suck each other's dicks.

1075
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,490
He his,

1076
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:52,990
his striking from any position
is so fucking pinpoint and
it looks like it hurts.

1077
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:58,310
He had extra snap on it. Like the timing
was right, the main boobs. He just smooth.

1078
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,590
So here's the question.

1079
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:03,310
If you could fuck a guy up with a tie
steel cup in a grappling competition,

1080
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,350
like it's a, it's an extra lever.
Like if you catch a guy on a knee bar,

1081
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:11,220
two inches, it's metal and it hurts.
I was rolling the Amir Renovar,

1082
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,200
he's the only guy I've ever rolled
with that rolls with a tie cup on it.

1083
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:18,740
He would mount you and stick that fucking
tie cup right in your solar plexus in

1084
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,200
grapevine years death. Cause it's
terrible. I never thought of it that I,

1085
01:07:22,201 --> 01:07:24,370
I've always worn one. Yeah.
Well this won't be the nuts.

1086
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:28,510
You're going to fucking kick it. Have you
ever fucked with those? My question was,

1087
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,280
have you ever fucked with those
like diamond cups? You ever,

1088
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,060
what do you think about what's better?
Diamond or like a steel?

1089
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,510
I wore it once and I liked it.
I just,

1090
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:41,470
I think it broke and I never want
another one was how long ago was it?

1091
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:45,670
Um, a while ago. They better
at it now. They did it,

1092
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,950
but they've done a bunch of changes
to them. They're pretty dope,

1093
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,700
but they were awesome. But
I, and I actually put a steel
cup inside of mine. Ooh,

1094
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:55,240
that's very smart because I liked the way
it's set up, but I don't trust plastic.

1095
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,470
Plastic.

1096
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,010
Give a fuck about shaped in a steel is
a little bit different and especially

1097
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:02,620
like they'll say like, oh look, there's
a video of someone kicking you. Okay,

1098
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:05,500
we'll let Melvin Manhoef
kick you in the nuts. Let's,

1099
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:07,960
let's let someone who knows how to kick
cause I'm watching this kick and I'm

1100
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:10,330
like, I'm not that impressed. Yeah. Fuck,

1101
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:14,620
let me kick you got proofs that
and let me get you. Exactly.

1102
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:19,610
I'm only 125 pounds.
Yeah.

1103
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,230
There's a lot of people that say like,
hey man, I eat low. Kicks her out.

1104
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:26,420
He kicks like you'll eat some kicks,
some kicks you can eat,

1105
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,030
but a Pedro. Yeah, exactly.

1106
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:33,380
That's the perfect guy to bring up
breaking my coach homework with him.

1107
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,350
He was a patriot as though striking
coach said he kind of hold myths.

1108
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:39,800
One can have bad from it kicks on,
so you just have to put them on a bag.

1109
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,130
I sent her warning him,
kick a bag at Beverly Hills Jujitsu,

1110
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,870
fold those motherfuckers Yurts uh,

1111
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,560
Marco and Marco studio on Oneso just
says the guy who folds fucking bags.

1112
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,300
And this is true. Yeah,
I can do that shit too.

1113
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,460
That's why I'm telling
you she had a normal,

1114
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,750
there's certain dudes that just
have a weird power and you,

1115
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,410
you've either and shit. No,
your hips. It's a little bit
of, it's a super flexible.

1116
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:06,980
So it's his own size too,
dude. It's a weird, it's shape.

1117
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,650
And that's one of the main problems that
I have with transgender fighters that

1118
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:13,280
fight over in, in women's MMA
I should say. Only if they let,

1119
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,070
if they don't let them know, like that
was the issue that I had with Foul Fox.

1120
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:16,420
Shouldn't,

1121
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,370
shouldn't divulge because she didn't
think she had to because it was a medical

1122
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:19,940
issue.

1123
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,330
If you know that a chick used to be a
dude but it's now a check and you fight

1124
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:26,360
her up to us on board,
I think it should be legal to ride bulls.

1125
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,330
I think it should be
illegal to jump the Umax.

1126
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,750
You should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

1127
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,200
I think 135 pound chicks, she'd
be able to fight 135 pounds. Dude,

1128
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,740
I'm think of Ronda Rousey
and Bryan caraway talked to
nef shit and they decided

1129
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:40,040
to go at it. I don't, I don't
have any problem with that.
If they both agree to it,

1130
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,890
I'll go up and wait and fight Ronda,
but there's,

1131
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:47,900
there's the size of the body. It's the
shape of the body that's different.

1132
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:52,820
It's not just the density of the bone
because black women have the same density

1133
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:57,050
of bone as white men. It's very
similar, almost the same. Very similar,

1134
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,280
but you know,

1135
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:02,360
obviously pro athletes and the guys who
strength training are going to have more

1136
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:04,980
density in their bones and the
average person, if they're measuring,

1137
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:06,410
it's a significant difference.

1138
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:09,320
But the big difference is the
mechanical advantage of the male frame.

1139
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,080
You don't find a female
with super wide shoulders,

1140
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,900
narrow waist and the same
size hips and the same shape.

1141
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:17,420
Hips is a man and when you
have that kind of body,

1142
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,740
you could just generate more force.

1143
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:23,140
I can look at a dude and tell you whether
or not he could be like a man hoof.

1144
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,930
There's some dudes that just have that
just stupid fucking power and you could

1145
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,180
look at them and go, well
he might, he might not like,

1146
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,860
there might be like a Bobby Lashley.

1147
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:35,960
He looks like a fucking brick shithouse
but he's not like a shame car went true.

1148
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:37,060
But Shane Carlin's,

1149
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:42,061
a Shankar Shankar when had that stupid
fucking power can't tee up course

1150
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,620
Jesus Christ.
Fuck with a wig on.

1151
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:53,570
She fucking bitches. Soon as he
stopped when he was in three, four,

1152
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:55,460
five in a row and regular MMA like,
dude,

1153
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,730
I'm going to lose weight and
fucking chop my balls off.

1154
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,520
You maximum the that bed,
all you would have to do is Holler,

1155
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,650
dive Schick and punch her in the
back of the here and it's over.

1156
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,470
His hands are not going to shrink
and then if they do shrink,

1157
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:11,570
what are they going to shrink in 10 years,

1158
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,070
all the champions in
women's MMA will be former.

1159
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,903
Dude,

1160
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,800
that's so true. Just a
stoner question. What do you,

1161
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,350
what do you, what do you
think that's, I like this.

1162
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,380
Do you think aliens each
strictly Gmos or are they vegan?

1163
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,590
Oh, good question. What do
you, what would you think?

1164
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,440
They'd come down and we find
out aliens are really hang down,

1165
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,440
come flying through space.
Would they laugh at vegans?

1166
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:45,090
Do they have planets within, are there
are designated for organic farming?

1167
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,290
Do they have like planets? Oh the, I think
they bring like farms, like in their,

1168
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,150
in their ships, do they just absorb
energy? You know what I mean?

1169
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,940
What would they say? What would they say
was wrong with the Vegan thing? They go,

1170
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,200
listen,
this is the truth.

1171
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,710
As long as you're getting all the
vitamins and minerals and essential fatty

1172
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:04,720
acids and amino acids in a pill form,
whatever your weight,

1173
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:08,340
your body's going to adjust. These
bodies can, we can digest anything.

1174
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:12,360
It's all about the vitamins, minerals,
amino acids, and essential fatty acids.

1175
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,291
That's it.
You're,

1176
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,410
you're discounting the possibility
that they might not even be biological.

1177
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,770
I mean, we're getting so close to
coming up with artificial skin.

1178
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,350
They're talking about
artificial intelligence,

1179
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:25,160
the ability to download someone's
consciousness. Who knows when,

1180
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,020
I mean a hundred years from now,
a thousand years from now,

1181
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:31,800
whatever the fuck it is, but downloading
your, your, your mind is a computer.

1182
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,520
So you think you were looking at these
aliens. We're assuming they're biological,

1183
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,630
but they could easily transcend biology.
If you talk,

1184
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,870
if you talk about people that
lived a million years ago,
like, Oh, uh, you know, uh,

1185
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:45,840
was Australia piff guess, right?
Yeah. The oldest version of human.

1186
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,420
If you took one of them
and showed them an iPhone,

1187
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:49,840
they wouldn't know what
the fuck to do with it.

1188
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,550
It would basically be as
ridiculous a comparison,

1189
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:59,580
the way they live to an alien being
some sort of a biological creation or no

1190
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,780
artificial creation.

1191
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,890
If they come up with fake cells and then
they come up with fake body parts and

1192
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:05,700
eventually fake Bot,

1193
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:10,700
and eventually maybe it won't enact the
same biological processes as a brain or

1194
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,470
as a, as a, as a Human Bonnie.

1195
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,280
But it might be something that replicates
it in a way where it can be just as

1196
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:18,810
conscious and justice productive.

1197
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,880
So consciousness would have
to be something that could
be downloaded in a sense,

1198
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,730
right? A replica. Yeah. Replicated. So
you'd make, once you figured that out,

1199
01:13:27,731 --> 01:13:29,850
she said you'd make
fucking copies of yourself.

1200
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:33,580
Like you didn't make at least 20
copies mail him. You're fucking your,

1201
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:35,750
your relatives about
this look like aliens.

1202
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,600
They all look the same because the
hard drive, what are the files?

1203
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,430
Get corrupted then that's how you die.

1204
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:45,660
That's how you kill ever seen alien who
got to get their fucking master file.

1205
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,630
Well, the thing about
the killer, everybody's,

1206
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:51,240
everybody's version of the
alien is essentially the same.

1207
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:53,370
It's always a big gray
thing with black eyes.

1208
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:57,000
Like what if they just all agree
like, look, let's just all look ugly.

1209
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,180
No one's allowed to be hot. We don't
have Dick's anymore. So who gives a shit?

1210
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,560
It just the warm that we
won't even one pussy one.

1211
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:07,980
Let's just go.
Because after a while people hold onto it.

1212
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:13,030
You can hold onto the the to hold.
Let's do a real fight and we should,

1213
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,710
we'll fight. That happened yet so we
can still touch Phil. Yeah. Phil Davis,

1214
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:19,270
this fight and go is this homemade?

1215
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:24,280
Slowly you want to shut that
hormone off if you don't,

1216
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,600
that's the thing that kills everybody.
That's number Whoville. How fucking life.

1217
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:31,800
I'll take this live with the food, but
you know what? You could turn it on,

1218
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,630
turn it on every now and then.
Every now and they can go in there,

1219
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,330
turn on the sex drive, boom. And they're
like, damn, I want some to alias alias.

1220
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,750
You turn it off. They can figure
out a way to transcend sex.

1221
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,370
I mean we say if they don't have sex,
fuck them,

1222
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:47,440
but what if they come up with
some shit that's way better than

1223
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,960
just thinking about what five your
mouth and not as doing tonight.

1224
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,570
There's no way you want to transcend that.
That's going to be beautiful.

1225
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,030
What he's doing, he's going to do a
hundred times and keep forgetting he it.

1226
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,270
Did I do that? Yeah. The over under on
sexual partners for Fabio Maldonado,

1227
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,440
very payment. I've known, I know
famous Brazilian, very famous,

1228
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:15,610
not going gonna name any names,
but they're crazy. Buck wild.

1229
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,630
They'll just disappear in your,
there'll be with you in an airport,

1230
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,360
don't meet her chicken airport
and just get another flight.

1231
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,150
Take off with this chick
and be gone for a week.

1232
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,240
This guy is super hardcore and he also,

1233
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:31,690
you gotta think like MMA
fighters for the most part.

1234
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:36,620
You guys could testify to that
very impulsive, wild fucking mean.

1235
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:39,520
They're not entering into the cage
because the fucking accounting gig didn't

1236
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:43,870
work out. I get time off. I get
tattoos. I do weird shit. I buy cars.

1237
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:50,300
I do weird. He's got a
muscle car. American muscle
cars drive. Prius's I just,

1238
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:52,720
I know you have a portion of
BMW we tell talking about.

1239
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,870
I'm getting an American
muscle cars. Yeah, I dunno.

1240
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,730
Thinking been thinking a lot lately.
I'm thinking I'm missing that in my life.

1241
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,400
Get a cobra will. I used to have
a Shelby Shelby gt. $500 there.

1242
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:03,330
Fucking real quick.

1243
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,020
I'm just trying to figure out what
you got a new one or an old one.

1244
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,370
Will real dolls or fuck
robots ever gets so good.

1245
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,200
Better than the records actually
pimped have one and that have never,

1246
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,090
you know what it does.
It's going to be so good.

1247
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:19,900
It's not going to be this dude's house.

1248
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:23,380
You go dude's house and his girlfriend
is in lingerie and she's cleaning up and

1249
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:26,240
you go, gee, we'll

1250
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,640
go outside

1251
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,850
due to pick up $2 million.

1252
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:39,330
Did you get like the ultimate one where
you can tell I gotta write that down.

1253
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:42,720
Stepford wives go admin.

1254
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,780
If the the robot wives and they clean
and do everything they want them to do,

1255
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,880
look it up,
but look it up,

1256
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,300
it's going to get that
what's going to happen.

1257
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,900
Women Joe's while I
watch all that bullshit

1258
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,900
that like three d simulation thing
eventually change the porn industry.

1259
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,860
It already is.
They're already starting to do them.

1260
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,830
First person porns with those things
aren't supposed to be insane hold or right

1261
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,700
after the show and he's like,
I'm in.

1262
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,050
Where does this for research
purposes or knowledge?

1263
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,020
Well,
it'd be Eddie.

1264
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,680
You could do Jujitsu with that that you
could put on an oculus rift positions.

1265
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:29,470
You could go through positions.
What is the dog?

1266
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,930
I'm teaching girls Jujitsu.

1267
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,080
I got to do this with a girl and the
only way the cameras pick it up as is

1268
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:40,970
everyone's naked by clothes
and this is a triangle series.

1269
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,100
The lighting has to be good for him.
Yeah.

1270
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,110
We're working on the north
south position right now.

1271
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,220
Fun Green suit with all
these electrode balls.

1272
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,820
There's no one there. Do you see
anybody there? There's nobody there.

1273
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:59,910
There's nobody that I look up taking
pictures. There's nobody there.

1274
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,550
There's nobody there.
Have you been on that Joe?

1275
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,110
Developers? Can I say the new
way, the alien game on that?

1276
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,660
They haven't been to the new one.
Terrifying.

1277
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,780
I heard the alien game is so scary that
people think that it should be illegal

1278
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:25,340
and you're, you're in the world and pay
apparently that worried, legit concern.

1279
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,550
People are going to have heart attacks.
I'll give you, you're an old man. Okay.

1280
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:32,000
If you're in your fucking seventies
and your video games, there's a lot of

1281
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,320
big brown again. Why?
But they're fun, man.

1282
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:42,230
If your fucking wife doesn't
want to have sex anymore,

1283
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,700
I playing video games,
put me down,

1284
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,750
fucking retired. We had
mad good. It can leave.

1285
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,530
You got to go and it Brown.
If you don't,

1286
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,590
I'll give you $500.
It alien comes at you and you just,

1287
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,030
it just mean mugging
fucking give you $500.

1288
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,380
I want to do it trustless ass.
He's got back to this kid,

1289
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:11,210
this aliens and when the alien,

1290
01:19:11,211 --> 01:19:14,570
when your gun fucking jams like minded
and the alien comes at needs your fucking

1291
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:19,100
throat, like your body
just reacts. It's crazy.

1292
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,080
No, you're full in full on just the
whole story out on with the game. How?

1293
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:24,740
How's it work?

1294
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,500
But you get nauseous as fuck cause
there's some kind of delay so you get bad

1295
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:31,370
motion sickness. He can't play
long, but that Shit's scary.
Too intense for me, man.

1296
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:35,010
That's serious. Too much.
Come on. 500 bucks to

1297
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,550
take the challenge and the x now. No
more hard. Oh he's to do the heart.

1298
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,830
He gave him the x now.
Shit.

1299
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:46,040
Here we go first round.

1300
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:51,950
Yeah, those are dope. Right? Pro Bars.

1301
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:55,100
I found out about those a couple of
weeks ago. Jesus Christ, they're awesome.

1302
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:59,370
You should try the, there's a superfood
one with like soup Greens and shoulder.

1303
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,770
He wrestled. Can Dude jumped
around? Phil? Phil's my boy too.

1304
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,950
And Gloria has some really good
fucking hands, man. Fuck yeah.

1305
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,890
Wow. Clover looks good. Scary guy.

1306
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,290
Phil had a real problem with rumble man.

1307
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,980
Rumble Johnson matches up poorly
with a lot of people. I agree.

1308
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,410
But talk to take everybody.
Yeah.

1309
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:27,270
Tough to take down and fucking
throws ball. Essentially. Phil Davis,

1310
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:30,600
we'll have six striking and
he got in there. You just
got to keep going way back.

1311
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:33,760
Actually he's going to, he's going to
figure it all out. It just takes a years.

1312
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:37,080
Well he looked great.
He met glass and he's in,

1313
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:39,230
he's got someone that's fucking
scary in front of them. So yeah.

1314
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,880
Hesitating event and so tough man.
Man Trains with Chrysalis and though,

1315
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,030
well you know that whole camp man
alliances, how great fucking camp.

1316
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,220
There's so much talent down there.
He coaches two.

1317
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:54,810
Fuck yeah dude and good dudes too.
A lot of good dudes down there.

1318
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,030
Yeah. I need to go down there more like
friends of mine so I need to go hang out

1319
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,660
trained,
keep moving and Phil Dude clover,

1320
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,530
it looks real was one of the guys that
just keeps coming forward. Man. Holy.

1321
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:13,350
Two of yours just land one of his,
it's weird. He looks really good too.

1322
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:16,110
The ways of seeing everything.
Just slide right out of it.

1323
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,820
It's like Phil's throwing the shots.
He's getting just offline. Just offline,

1324
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,600
but looking for his openings.
Super patient, right.

1325
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:27,630
It's trying to get them against the cage.
Keep moving sale like that.

1326
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:31,440
Daddy's gonna be tough to take it
down, man. Look at this, ma'am.

1327
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:34,020
Bill Davis might have to pull guard.

1328
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,920
It's crazy to see these like super
high level wrestlers like Phil Davis,

1329
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,850
like as you know,
you're working on your overall MMA game.

1330
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:45,210
You're not doing as much wrestling
and it's not just a wrestling match.

1331
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,980
When you start throwing
in punches and stuff,

1332
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,520
there's some guys you just haven't
have a really hard time taking down,

1333
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:53,370
even if you're as good as rested
at wrestling. As David says,

1334
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:58,200
he's so fucking good. The distance is
different. Is that what the big thing is?

1335
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:03,810
Damn. Front kick and a punch
behind it. Slowly. He's going
to be an amazing strike.

1336
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,920
Oh, hey, here's a really
good, good team, man.

1337
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:12,030
That's not as hurt shoulder
either. Come on, do this.

1338
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:16,920
Phil's Phil might habits to old defense.
Oh shit son clovers.

1339
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:20,320
Got some dope defense. Look,
give me just, Oh shit. No,

1340
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,470
you walked through that to 40,
bringing into the camp. I mean,

1341
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,410
chuck used to bring in so many fucking bad
ass dude. So glad we got so good. Yeah.

1342
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,170
We uh, well he was the guy
who like for six years,

1343
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,990
everybody wanted to get in
the UFC but his visa problem,

1344
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,540
my rounds while he's
getting ready for Mitre,

1345
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:39,840
where Leo Machida and Glover Teixeira
whatever would come in and he was 240

1346
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:44,760
pounds shilling. Holy Shit. For sure.
If I look at this slide and get this,

1347
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:47,700
look at this, look at this, look at
this and you're this or that. Go.

1348
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:50,570
He'd let it go. But look
at them. They get slipped.

1349
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,870
This is how it feels going to win.

1350
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:55,950
He's going to wear them out when
by decision cause well, you know,

1351
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:56,970
I know that I've just been fighting.

1352
01:22:56,971 --> 01:23:01,950
You see it's also a lot of people were
wondering who glow over was training with.

1353
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:06,130
Oh, he's getting hard. Hard shots by
hard shot. Oh he's, he's eating. He's

1354
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,390
trying to get her right here
too. He's hurt man. His hurt,

1355
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,350
his caliber on your back, man. David's
through Samba bombs right there.

1356
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,720
He's a bad ass and he's not
put the hooks in and chuck,

1357
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:22,810
he likes his condition. Can't you
can't eat those shots man. Yeah,

1358
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:27,010
he's going to get wrestler
upper cut it the fuck up.

1359
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:31,520
He's getting wobbly. Look, I know who
Ian Mccall is rooting for my friend.

1360
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,240
I like feel too, I'm just better
friends with Glover, whatever, bro.

1361
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:37,990
I called you out,
get up Bro.

1362
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,870
Going for clover.

1363
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:48,720
How many times have you
heard about someone that you
thought was your friend and

1364
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:53,980
they're rooting against you because oh
of cause they're one of their buddies.

1365
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:56,290
It's like I take it personal and I,
it's super personal.

1366
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,840
Is it happened a few times.
Oh yeah. Cause it happens.

1367
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:01,140
I'll find out like a certain media guys.

1368
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,020
So you think are your friends and
then for a reason I have to fight.

1369
01:24:04,021 --> 01:24:04,690
They're like,
yeah,

1370
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,750
why didn't we call it picked mitre owned
to Wayne or Travis Brown and when I'm

1371
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,340
like, cool, I won't do
interviews with them anyway.

1372
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,760
Have either one of you guys trained
with Eric Dolphy Arrow? Yeah.

1373
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,280
What are you thinking about him?
And I've known Eric for,

1374
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:18,520
I fought for total combat, a
lot of shows. Great coach smart.

1375
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:22,480
The whole group is a really smart guy.
He tried to put it down to do Phil.

1376
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:26,110
It's good at, and he keeps
Dak tagging him. Look at this.

1377
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:30,050
Oh Shit to fill.
This is how you feel you're wearing.

1378
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:34,780
His head is getting rocked back on
these shots. He's a serious shots. Yeah,

1379
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:39,220
it feels hit him hard. He's going for
it. Even if go over, gets to this round.

1380
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,810
He's taken a lot of punishment,
man.

1381
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,810
Really hard shots to the head
wearing them out. I mean he's, he's,

1382
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:47,980
he's blocking these
oh shit.

1383
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:52,090
Big Round. Phil Davis,
huge round. Oh Shit.

1384
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:57,520
I feels gas tank pretty fucking good.
Totally exhausted.

1385
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,480
But he comes out strong then you
know he's done his cardio right?

1386
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:04,900
Cause he looks totally exhausted.
Even if he is in phenomenal shape,

1387
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:06,940
you're gonna be tied that first round.
You're supposed,

1388
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:09,040
he's supposed to be talking
100% and try to fuck him up.

1389
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:12,100
He's supposed to be tired. It's all
about recovering. Yup. That's recovery.

1390
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:15,730
How fast in this would be a big
victory for David's man. Dude,

1391
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:18,250
if he beat the old machine in Brazil,
let's say he wins this fight.

1392
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,600
Glover Teixeira in Brazil, the hell
you also be Fabio in Brazil. We,

1393
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,740
I think we were at that fight
for the Stephan Bonner. Oh,

1394
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:28,230
front kick up the hand behind it. That
was cool. Matt. These are bad though.

1395
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:31,060
Those are heavy. There was a few of
them that really snapped his head back.

1396
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,050
That one. One of them we really
got wobbled in the second exchange.

1397
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:40,060
Look at powerful Vito Belfort. He's
not mad at his wife. Never happened.

1398
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,390
Ever happened acting. Yeah.

1399
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,980
Well she's like talking about the
Brazilian Pam Anderson or something.

1400
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,960
Something like something
along those lines. So

1401
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,100
these ridiculous Ham Anderson it. She
did a fuck load of squats on a staircase.

1402
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,850
Yeah,
I'll blow out as just off the charts.

1403
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:04,270
Bootae those chicks have big acids
there and they're getting fake

1404
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:07,590
asses. If was in those, that's your
books to just a modern necessary.

1405
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,340
Eventually they will be, I don't
like him. Eventually they will be,

1406
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:18,250
but right now no guy is
accepting. Fake out. No, no,

1407
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,110
not right now. It's too early. I do not.

1408
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:28,360
I would not have a flat no ass
having crossover conversations folks.

1409
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:33,970
Sorry. Big fucking fight going on. How
about acid? Sorry. Yeah, fake asses.

1410
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:40,340
He comes up to the front. Kick to the
face. Good. I don't keep moving Phil.

1411
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,980
You got to keep moving, man. I
don't think women are aware of that.

1412
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:46,700
That we will not accept that. You better
hide that shit. You can't fail nobody.

1413
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,534
It ain't like cities.

1414
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:51,710
I can tell you a whole factory by your
dad will help you with the down payment

1415
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:55,070
and all that. Good shot. Good shot. Asked
you about to keep that. Wait a minute.

1416
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,040
Whose Dad's going to help her?
Chick with a down payment.

1417
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:58,940
What are you talking about?

1418
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
[inaudible] how many
times at the Strip club?

1419
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:15,040
Orange County. It's beat. You're
here all the time but not now.

1420
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,510
Big Switch.
You got to respect the dam.

1421
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:25,870
I don't know. It doesn't look like
he's got a justice grip. Right?

1422
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,380
What kind of grip does he have
here? Nothing. Kung Fu grip.

1423
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:34,350
Oh Nice. It didn't look like he
totally had a gripped up. Right.

1424
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,890
How many more gay teens you think we'd
get in the UFC if we had no gloves?

1425
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,340
How many more submissions? A lot
more. A lot more submissions, right.

1426
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,290
Is I brought this up before it.

1427
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,940
Do you think that it would be actually
be better if he fought with no gloves?

1428
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,793
You think about what you can

1429
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:55,420
elbows, those rubber gloves
and the doctor's like, why
have anything? If you think

1430
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,970
about just gloves,
dishwashing gloves,

1431
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:03,600
so I've been thinking of what's the big,

1432
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:11,130
you still have no ankle support, no
wrist support, no gloves, no nothing.

1433
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,410
I think if you fought with no gloves,

1434
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:16,350
we would realistically know
what punches do in a fight.

1435
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,380
Right now we don't because right
now we have padded up gloves,

1436
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:24,270
have hands that are wrapped up together.
We have, they do enough changes.

1437
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:27,390
It's enough that most people would
wear them if they had the option.

1438
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,210
It helped bring your hands,

1439
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:33,450
you break your hands way easier
with without gloves here.

1440
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:37,560
I think it makes a big difference too in
what's effective striking because your,

1441
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:40,230
your your knuckles like
they don't dig it as much.

1442
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,030
Your risk buckle a little bit on shots.

1443
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:44,550
Whereas if you're wrapping your
wrists up and taping it down,

1444
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:48,900
you're making it like artificially
stiff and it allows you to get, yeah,

1445
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,950
it allows you to punch harder.

1446
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,430
I think we get an unrealistic sense of
the value of punches because of that.

1447
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,240
I don't think people are wa I see what
you're saying but I don't think people

1448
01:28:57,241 --> 01:28:58,280
are watching it for that.

1449
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,990
I think but I don't know if
talking about people watching it.

1450
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,010
I'm talking about for

1451
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,420
the majority of the sport,
exactly.

1452
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:07,770
Talking about the spirit of the
emotional brain make grappling better,

1453
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:12,200
hyper analyzing everything and I always
do that but I mean like he was getting

1454
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:13,350
rear naked chokes man.

1455
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:16,880
Getting rear naked choke is a big
difference between clothes on and stuff.

1456
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:21,660
That's an MMA that's pretty Dang.
This is retarded.

1457
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:23,280
Like go home you if you touch,

1458
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,660
if you touch the ground that you can't
need the face, that kind of stuff.

1459
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,210
There's so many laws that just won't.

1460
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,400
They never change them and just like you
can't wear tight. You can't the laws,

1461
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,200
you can't have your calf
covered because it actually,

1462
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:43,470
it's so dangerous. It's crazy.
It's illegal. Phil is tired.

1463
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:46,850
You have to have the pope to the eye.
Damn.

1464
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,540
I was just about to say that Phil.

1465
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,150
He blew out so much energy
in that first round.

1466
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:55,970
He's beating the brakes off of him. He,
well, he did a lot of fucking damage.

1467
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,440
Rick Inglis's. Right. Then

1468
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:04,510
you sent the Fernandez when he was 27
Mcgregor's got a pink shirt and tie.

1469
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:08,650
Of course he does. I love
him. My new favorite fighter.

1470
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:13,590
She likes cockiness. Wow.
Powerful Aubrey. Good choice.

1471
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,070
Oh God. Right in the eye
with that. Got It. Hate dogs.

1472
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,410
She's going to be bidding against
them. I hope it. Here's another thing.

1473
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:29,790
If we're going to have gloves with them,
if we're going to have gloves,

1474
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,860
why the fuck don't they cover
the tips of the fingers?

1475
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:35,240
Why don't they figure out a way to
do that? Because if you're putting,

1476
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,640
it's kind of help the fingers, man.
It's not that much. No problem.

1477
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,030
It's a big problem, man.
I think it's a huge every,

1478
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,940
how many John Jones fights have
there been? I pokes fuck everyone,

1479
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,260
but even if the fingers were covered,

1480
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,410
can't you still poke someone's
eye but the nails not there.

1481
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:52,820
John's pinky fingers,
little hover condoms.

1482
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,990
You're not going to be
able to dig in one condoms.

1483
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,110
They'll still fuck you up. Let me look
and see me. I would have finger condom on

1484
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:04,290
open up point. You'd be like, damn,

1485
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:08,070
I know he got fingered
conduit or somewhere to,

1486
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:11,580
my daughter accidentally poked him in
the eye the other day and I saw sparks

1487
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:18,150
gloves on. Like, what's the fucking
difference? If they grab their balls,

1488
01:31:18,151 --> 01:31:21,110
if that grabbed their ass, what the
gloves on and they wouldn't do that.

1489
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:24,480
They're or, Whoa, Phil
Davis is a big takedown.

1490
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:29,330
Take your gloves off the rear
naked. Every order. New Glucose.

1491
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:34,520
Nope. Too High. It's the sink got too
high. She's got to drop his hips done,

1492
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,750
but he doesn't want to lose a position
when it doesn't wanna get fucked off.

1493
01:31:36,751 --> 01:31:40,020
Standing end of the round
two there a short time.

1494
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,630
I thought it was going to do
nothing for Phil. Yeah. Fuck yeah.

1495
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:47,040
Emma May takes off the gloves.
Football takes off the pads and helmets.

1496
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:52,090
[inaudible]

1497
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,590
you guys see that rugby thing with a dude?
Kao The dude on the field.

1498
01:31:58,591 --> 01:32:01,480
He grounded him.
Did he hit him with a right hand?

1499
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:04,600
Dropped him and then fucking
pounded them out from the mouth

1500
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,890
at a karate tournament.
Who takes out both competitors?

1501
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:11,440
He's the RAF and he's tried to break it.
He's trying to separate them,

1502
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:16,330
but like a Russian rep
dude, he made karate, looked
beautiful. It was a real fight.

1503
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,320
He was trying to separate them and
then you just want blah, blah, blah,

1504
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:21,070
and then he kicked the guy.
Look days. It's amazing.

1505
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:26,071
Name of the video of nursing that
maybe if you youtube search karate,

1506
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:31,260
karate, Raf. Fight Ref
everybody, right? He's in my,

1507
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:34,990
it's like a three second video. It's
amazing. Okay, then watch this real quick.

1508
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:39,820
This is about three seconds.
Fucking truck.

1509
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:44,050
Camera Guy.
Fucking nuts.

1510
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,320
Where was Jenny's ass? They were
fucking screaming in the headphones.

1511
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:51,910
Why didn't you show Jenny's ass? You
showed her face, you her walked down.

1512
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:54,150
She's very beautiful.
If you had an opportunity to shore up,

1513
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:59,860
we need that for a Camaro.
American needs that Phil Davis two rounds.

1514
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,490
He got clipped right though.
Oh Damn.

1515
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:08,680
Clover knows it's [inaudible]
took over is on fire right now,

1516
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:10,210
but he knows it's do or die,
man.

1517
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:15,240
These two rounds in the
whole damn big push.

1518
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:20,670
Big Push a Louis and sham. Well,
he's built like a goddamn superhero

1519
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:26,470
is his back. His legs are retarded.
They're just so goddamn big.

1520
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,760
Go full screen on that shit. We're going
to watch a fight look like, hold up.

1521
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:34,990
Positive, positive, positive, positive.

1522
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:38,950
We'll watch that shit after
this fight that's happening.

1523
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,530
We'll need some downtime while there's we,

1524
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:47,880
I want to fucking kill an animal to
someone to take their clothes off.

1525
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:51,760
Take that whole big takedown for Phil
was the best light heavyweights in the

1526
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:55,810
world. A cue up that rush and beating
the shit out of these two guys from 1982

1527
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,400
that's fine.
As long as he had those shiny pants on.

1528
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:04,150
I used to love the kickbox and pants
that lace in the front like a sneaker.

1529
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:07,860
I remember that Shit. Chuck Norris. She
used to wear them. I have those pitches.

1530
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:12,280
I had those. I love Chuck Norris so much.
I wore those for my taekwondo pants.

1531
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,970
Oh look at this. Phil Davis
gave it up. Oh look at that.

1532
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:18,790
I like how you hook the leg. That
was nice. That was very nice.

1533
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:23,760
Cradle baby. Phil Davis,
10th grade wrestling man.

1534
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,910
And my big brother used to do that to me.
I hate it.

1535
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,980
But you remember how Bas Rutten used to
tap guys with some fucking crazy cradle?

1536
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:32,960
He would,
he would be in that bar chart.

1537
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,620
Press the bar. I still use. Yeah.

1538
01:34:36,621 --> 01:34:40,330
It's not that I'm asking assisting gay
headlock on one side and he hooks your

1539
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:44,680
leg and the other side and he fucking
flexes and just separate the head from

1540
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:47,000
your body sharp machine.
He's

1541
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:51,520
so God damn strong.

1542
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:55,990
But especially in his prime boss was
so damn technique dash to make you shit

1543
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:59,100
yourself can make you shit
yourself. Yeah. We almost,

1544
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,970
well almost saw wants in the UFC.
I forget who was gone for it,

1545
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,750
but I almost forgot it
existed. And then, uh, Joe, uh,

1546
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,660
Joe Silva actually reminded me that's
that Bas Rutten thing. I was like,

1547
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:12,980
that's right.
Damn Phil Davis run in it.

1548
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,580
That's insane. Running it, man.
Another dog. This is a big job.

1549
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:19,520
Big Punches man.

1550
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,280
Phil Davis looking as good as ever
against a fucking legit killer. But yeah,

1551
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,100
best performance of, yeah. Well, you
know what? He came off that rumble fight.

1552
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:32,150
He knew he had to take it to the next
level. I, you know what? I'll be honest,

1553
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:36,890
I would like to see him going
for the finish. He's trying
man now. I mean submit,

1554
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:40,090
submit duties. Sylvie's beat
the shit out of him. I mean,

1555
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,340
he's got two minutes ago and he's
beating the shit out of Glover Bat.

1556
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:46,890
Did he mean he's hit him with
30 or 40? Done. Answered Shock.

1557
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,520
I'd still one handed the one harm.
Comoros was him wanting the wonder bar.

1558
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:57,350
Very high level. What
he's doing to Glover, man.

1559
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,190
I know he's making it look at these,
but this is not,

1560
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:06,240
this is sick dude.
Glover's an animal animal straight.

1561
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,470
I wonder how much of an effect,
if any,

1562
01:36:09,471 --> 01:36:11,640
and I'm just throwing this out there
because I have to look at that.

1563
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:14,570
He's on his camp to the camp in Danbury,
Connecticut.

1564
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:17,900
Had as opposed to doing like
American top team, you know,

1565
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:20,180
like what kind of sparring partners
is it yet? And I don't know.

1566
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:22,890
I mean maybe he had a bunch
of guys flying in tomorrow.

1567
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:26,750
This is an awesome wrestler though, I
would imagine. Yeah, no, Phil is awesome.

1568
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,490
Oh there we go. Look, it's still going on.

1569
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,730
Glover could still catch them when one
20 to go. I wanted to finish. Right.

1570
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,890
Deep breaths hearing cause this going.
Ooh.

1571
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,580
Ooh. Tude over the top. Oh, you heard him?

1572
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:44,240
He heard him with that one man
that was clean on the jaw. Whoa.

1573
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:49,150
If he comes back now. So there
you go man. Nice dropdown.

1574
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,720
That single kicks chasing them new.

1575
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,760
He's just to stay on that dude.
Yeah.

1576
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:59,090
And if he drags me to the ground and
shit is all his, oh he came over,

1577
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:02,750
he recovered. He
recovered. Look at that as

1578
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,060
his grappling. Cardio is different than
striking cardio cause it's striking.

1579
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:11,090
Cardio's more labored. So when you
see him standing up and he's tired,

1580
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:14,780
he's still like moving, kind of labored.
But when you see him on the ground,

1581
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,060
he looks fucking sharp as shit.
Even when he's tired,

1582
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:21,060
he's gassing all over the place and
recovering all over the place. Gassing,

1583
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,370
recovering, but his wrestling, like
he doesn't gas when he's grappling.

1584
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:26,723
I mean he's,

1585
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:32,570
he's breathing while he's doing it.
I mean,

1586
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:35,480
you could tell he's taking some big
ass deep breaths. His mouth is open,

1587
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:38,600
but he's fucking dominate.
He can do this all night.

1588
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,750
They could go five rounds of
this. He didn't do this. I
mean, he's got a burn hot.

1589
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,480
You have to burn hot in order
to where a guy out in the open,

1590
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,720
I mean he's got to wear himself out.
So we're,

1591
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:50,150
we're getting a view of his
cardio over putting his hand up.

1592
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,910
That's called an ass whooping.
So

1593
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:56,130
what happened is that San
Diego about swooping in

1594
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:00,750
Brazil, that was pretty good. Now that
was crazy. I'm strong, real concrete.

1595
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,570
Three rounds, three
rounds, three rounds a day.

1596
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:05,660
Look like that after the
first round. Remember? Yeah.

1597
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:07,170
That's a big victory right there.

1598
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:11,700
I'm just calling a big victory is huge
because if he looks I fucking quit.

1599
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,480
Quit my MMA, Bro. I'm going straight
to pro wrestling. Dan, what's up?

1600
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:21,540
Power bomb everyone. Big fucking loss
mentality. You need to get to that point.

1601
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,660
I Phil Davis is that cap?
Yeah. Tressler coming off

1602
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,660
it again. Damn. That was a nice move.

1603
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:34,290
That front kick right hand he does and
he throws the right hand like a jab.

1604
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:37,620
His right leg is forward when he throws
it, but he's got a lot of pop behind it.

1605
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,910
He catches you like it cracks you with
it in the end he and you're gassing all

1606
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:45,810
over the place constantly and recovering
constantly. Right. That's just gas cook.

1607
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,840
If you went gassing all over the place,
you ain't pushing yourself hard enough.

1608
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:53,820
Exactly. That's how you break people.
Yeah. That's just, yeah. We just saw,

1609
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:57,150
we just saw a film,
break him shit about cardio my whole life.

1610
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,670
I always heard people talk about cardio.
Tito Ortiz,

1611
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:01,520
we talk about Cardio Radica too.

1612
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:06,120
They're talking about cardio and I always
thought cardio was how long can you go

1613
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,030
before you get really tired,
like your like huffing and puffing.

1614
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:12,050
That's your cardio. I've got like
eight minutes of Cardio I got,

1615
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:15,090
that's what I always thought it was.
No one really explained it to me at all.

1616
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,740
I never trained like a
professional athlete until
Metamorris. Yeah. And once I,

1617
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,510
once I, I decided this, of
course he, of course you weren't.

1618
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:28,820
So I just decided what am I going
to do for Cardio? I was, you know,

1619
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:30,640
I was lifting weights,
I was doing a lot of Jujitsu.

1620
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:33,360
I was training with John John
and I just decided, fuck,

1621
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,000
I'm going to do sprints and
I'm gonna go to the pool,

1622
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:38,700
the 24 hour fitness and I just,
I'm going to figure this out by myself.

1623
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,910
I just drove to the fucking pool.
They had a big clock and I just,

1624
01:39:41,911 --> 01:39:44,010
I never did this. I'm
not a professional. I go,

1625
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:47,940
I'm on a sprint 20 times across the pool.

1626
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:52,470
I've done sprints before in the past
20 times and as soon as the clock,

1627
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:56,340
the big clock in the pool hits the 12th
that's when I'll take off and then I

1628
01:39:56,341 --> 01:40:00,300
might finish at 25 or 30 and I'll stay
at the other side of the pool until it

1629
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:03,330
hits 12 again.
It hits 12 and go boom sprint again.

1630
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:05,580
I just made this up and I did it 20 times.

1631
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:08,430
The problem with doing cardio and the
pools that you don't get to read your

1632
01:40:08,431 --> 01:40:12,780
heart rate. Do they have like a cardio
monitor that works? This is what I did.

1633
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:13,560
I kept it simple.

1634
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,100
I just wouldn't fast as I fucking can
and I didn't even know the coaching me

1635
01:40:17,101 --> 01:40:18,240
because cause I,

1636
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:23,270
my law was I'm only going to arrest until
it hits 12 again so I better bust ass.

1637
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:27,480
So I was racing across the pool
so I can get that time to rest.

1638
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:29,970
And what I learned about
myself is holy Shit.

1639
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,870
Every time I on a across I got really
tight. The first three were easy,

1640
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:38,470
but when I got the 10 to 12 my plan was,
I just said 20 cause metamorphosis,

1641
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:39,271
20 minutes.
I go,

1642
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:44,271
I'm going to do 20 and do that at 10
1112 I was dead just on the edge of the

1643
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:47,220
pool.
Barely Gal was dying.

1644
01:40:47,221 --> 01:40:49,200
There's all these old people
at the pool and should they go,

1645
01:40:49,201 --> 01:40:52,650
what the fuck is this guy doing? I just
made the shit up, but what I learned,

1646
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,680
I learned it.

1647
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:58,630
You could be dead tired and
recover within 30 seconds. Yeah,

1648
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:02,410
that's what I was learning and I'll be
dead when they hit the nine I'd be like,

1649
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:06,730
we're at the table, but when it,
by the time we have to 11 I'd go,

1650
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:11,080
let's go again. Another sprint.
The Ama, you get across, boom.

1651
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:14,230
I ended up with 30 seconds of rest.
Same thing.

1652
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:19,240
So you learn that Holy Shit,
you can recover over and over.

1653
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:22,750
If I didn't know this, when I'd get
to that point in grappling, I would,

1654
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:26,910
I would go, I'm done. I would break. I go,
I'm done. Understand I have to do more.

1655
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:27,744
Yeah.

1656
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,380
Oh,
someone needs to talk to them.

1657
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:33,390
They already know you're the
champ taking the beaver effect.

1658
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:36,200
When he put that shit on, everyone
goes, knowledge is great, man. Yeah,

1659
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:39,710
look good man.
Let's show that karate video.

1660
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:44,670
Let's shut up karate video calling
out Anderson's our full fill.

1661
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:48,950
Did he call it airs and sold on Anderson
Silva? He did. That's what he said. Yeah.

1662
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:51,890
He goes, I'd be like resistance, but
there's only one I want to fight next.

1663
01:41:51,891 --> 01:41:56,280
That's a mind. God is fighting
Nick Diaz. Why is he saying that

1664
01:41:58,170 --> 01:42:03,110
now? He talks a lot. He's got a got a
triple, not in that time. Think it's fat.

1665
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:04,303
He knows what he's

1666
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:12,950
talking about. It's watch this shit. So
the dude's or karate, Duke in and out.

1667
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:14,550
Watch the raft once the rough.

1668
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:19,100
He's just a fucking each other up
and try while they're gone off. Man,

1669
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,450
where is this taking place? Check
this out. Where's this taking place?

1670
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:28,370
It's a gymnasium for sure,
Dale.

1671
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:35,570
Oh Shit.
Took out that guy to fucking went like

1672
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:40,400
cop. No one. No one's
stopping him either man.

1673
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,940
Genes at the circus where the
animal just goes fucking crazy.

1674
01:42:43,941 --> 01:42:46,100
So he tries to push and
what they don't push away

1675
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:50,950
fake guy and look at this guy.
He gets caught.

1676
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:55,500
This guy is tore to [inaudible] is
tore up. That's insane. He fucking

1677
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,930
camera crew that will, they're filming
today. That's why we're watching it.

1678
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:05,900
The competitors like what the, like this
is someone's memory. That was a sketched.

1679
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:10,920
Maybe somebody was filming in the
making of a movie. I don't know. Wow.

1680
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,760
That looked like a real fight, man.
It was a movie that was a real fight.

1681
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:16,460
Those guys were really hitting each other.
That was a good technique to,

1682
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,490
where'd that take place Jamie?
Looking at?

1683
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:21,050
It doesn't necessarily say it
looks Russia. Russia. Yeah.

1684
01:43:21,051 --> 01:43:23,930
That looks like something would happen.
Have you seen that?

1685
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:28,020
The amateur boxing fight that the guy
after the fight it takes you to off and

1686
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:31,890
goes over. Beats the shit out
of the raft. It's bad. Yeah.

1687
01:43:31,891 --> 01:43:34,040
I think and watch that.
It's an old guy.

1688
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:37,850
It's fucked up and you see a chase the
guy out and they get a fucking shit.

1689
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:42,640
Help the old man, but he's fallen over.
It's like, oh fuck. Yeah. It wasn't funny.

1690
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:45,490
Now looking at the graphics on
these Games, I know that looks good.

1691
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:50,810
That looks like a real dude.
Look at this. By the way.

1692
01:43:50,811 --> 01:43:52,090
It doesn't like that when you play,
it

1693
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,830
just doesn't,
I mean it looks close,

1694
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:57,650
but this is the [inaudible] enough
clipping and weirdness to it.

1695
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:01,380
The frames per second that they can
achieve and these previews they do,

1696
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:04,310
they can just make it look a lot
sweeter where a couple of years from

1697
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:07,250
indistinguishable from reality
though probably on those games.

1698
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:12,520
Well you're going to be able to have games
where you use the oculus rift and you

1699
01:44:12,651 --> 01:44:14,030
play out like a video.

1700
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:18,410
You make a video of things that are
actually happening and instead of a game

1701
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:19,040
engine,

1702
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,880
just have them do it like a hundred
different fucking ways where you know,

1703
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:26,120
have them repeat the same scenarios over
and over again from all these different

1704
01:44:26,121 --> 01:44:28,880
angles so that no matter where you are,
where you're moving,

1705
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:30,800
it feels like you're actually doing it.
You know,

1706
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,990
you could turn to your
left and the fucking, it's,

1707
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,880
it's really just like as
if you turn to your left,

1708
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:38,000
like there'll be able to program those
in the same way they do it with like stop

1709
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:41,210
motion animation where you have
to do each individual frame.

1710
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,910
They'll just have different
possible scenarios that they have.

1711
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:47,930
People actually act out to the point
where they cover the whole room, like a,

1712
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,760
like a fan,
like one of those folding fans.

1713
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,730
Every ounce of the room gets
covered with a possibility.

1714
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:57,830
And then you have these head headset on
and you're in this room and you can take

1715
01:44:57,831 --> 01:44:58,700
these possibilities.

1716
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:01,580
It's already been planned out as
a video and then you watch it,

1717
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,960
you play it out and you fucking shoot
aliens like in real time and you fuck and

1718
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:10,290
you Siri ships every everyday
you get it going to happen. Man,

1719
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:13,700
that has that electro stem you down
when you put electric stem on it,

1720
01:45:13,701 --> 01:45:17,930
like causes collapse, you know? So if you
get hit somewhere, it'll just cramp up.

1721
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:22,600
You know, they don't have it yet,
but it's going to happen. Yeah.

1722
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,810
So that frees you up one side.
You have to like limp through.

1723
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:29,810
They have those things already.
Those, those stem machines,

1724
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:33,380
people use them already. They supposed to
help recovery. Yeah, the complex machine.

1725
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:36,020
Yeah. If you added that
shit too, like a suit,

1726
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:43,060
something bites you, you feel
it. Teeth clamp in your body.

1727
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,250
You could have a virtual
lab on your pants.

1728
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,070
What's given us give up
some predictions here.

1729
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:52,900
What do we think is going to
hold Kot though? Mendez decision.

1730
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:57,260
Although when you say Aldo, like how
quickly a first round, second round,

1731
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:01,010
third round, third round Mendez
decisions has been says second round.

1732
01:46:01,011 --> 01:46:05,570
Tko second round. Tko says for
your poet he gives zero fucks.

1733
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,710
He's making calls. Yeah.
Eddie Bravo. I'm going to say

1734
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,510
dammit. Dammit. I don't know. I'm going
with them and I don't know as well.

1735
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:22,400
Kareem Abdul, check them all. What do you
think? I don't know man. It's a tough one.

1736
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:26,210
It's a tough one. Great Pink
stolen. It's really fun. Yeah.

1737
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:28,240
This side of the table takes zero chance.

1738
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:35,420
Here's, here's my take on it. Aldo is
fucking incredibly difficult to take down.

1739
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:38,990
Like one of the most difficult
to take down until he gets tired.

1740
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:42,380
The problem is by the time you get
him tired and you take him down,

1741
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:45,860
you are eating some of the fastest
fucking leg kicks in the business.

1742
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:50,700
That combination, the Duchy, the left
hook to body, and then the right leg kick.

1743
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,210
He throws that motherfucker as good as
anybody that's ever walked the face of

1744
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:57,660
the planet. If it Mendez is throwing
that against pads every day,

1745
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,430
that's part of looking at things.
It is.

1746
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,550
It is possible that Mendez can win
this fight. Don't get me wrong,

1747
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,450
Mendez can knock out anyone on the
fucking planet if he connects the way he

1748
01:47:06,451 --> 01:47:09,300
knocked out Clegg Weda the way
he knocked out Darren Elkins,

1749
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,810
if Mendez cracks you,
he can fucking put it on you.

1750
01:47:12,811 --> 01:47:15,570
It's the hardest hitter in
this unbelievable athlete.

1751
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:20,310
Ridiculous Freak athlete hits
hard to it's, it's a wild fight.

1752
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:25,320
I don't, I don't know what I say earlier
that I have no idea. I have no idea.

1753
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,900
Mendez can win this fucking
fight. Don't, don't get me wrong.

1754
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:29,820
No doubt about it and
he can win by knockout.

1755
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:31,110
I think he could do that to anybody.

1756
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:35,280
The question is if you watch their first
fight and you watch their second fight,

1757
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:38,430
how much has he improved and that's the
only thing that we're going to find out

1758
01:47:38,431 --> 01:47:41,610
tonight. We're going to find out how
much he's improved and whether or not,

1759
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:46,100
although is in any way regressed, you
know, whether or not his injuries,

1760
01:47:46,101 --> 01:47:49,500
he's had a bunch of injuries.
He said like a nagging neck injury.

1761
01:47:49,501 --> 01:47:53,040
He said all sorts of different things
that have you know, fucked with him.

1762
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:56,820
He's had kidney stones that
he's gotten that either are,

1763
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,710
it's weird who you talked to.

1764
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:02,340
It's either it's genetic or it's from
weight cutting. There's a lot of,

1765
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:03,620
a lot of people that believe it's,

1766
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:08,270
it's an either or thing that you might
be genetic and you get it get exacerbated

1767
01:48:08,271 --> 01:48:10,260
by the way. Cutting huge. He's a big guy.

1768
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,980
He's a big guy and he struggles to make
that one 45 and I think that's one of

1769
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:18,240
the reasons why he's been having a hard
time in the later rounds. But God damn,

1770
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,670
to get through those fucking rounds,
you've got to go through hell son.

1771
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:25,290
That beating he put on your
ride favors leg. Holy Shit Dude.

1772
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:29,010
He's something. He something
man, he's a lightning fast,

1773
01:48:29,011 --> 01:48:32,700
ridiculous striker who was
also world class at Jujitsu.

1774
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:37,720
His jujitsu game is fucking real good.
You just don't see it. You know you,

1775
01:48:37,721 --> 01:48:41,610
but occasionally you do see it like in
the Mike Brown fight when he got brown on

1776
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:46,611
his back and he sunk those hooks in and
that is a legit black belt back mount to

1777
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:50,580
smashing. You know, he's, where were
you at that your I fight with him.

1778
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,740
That was, I was out there. It was fucking,
when all that came out to the, uh,

1779
01:48:54,741 --> 01:48:56,220
I'm going to run this town tonight.
Yeah.

1780
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:00,890
That was the only person in
Sacramento going, Oh my God. Like,

1781
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:05,570
what are you doing? I'm like, he's
going to fuck your boy up. Wait,

1782
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,160
ed sores told me about that before. He
was so excited. His manager is like,

1783
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:13,730
he's got to come out to that Jay z song.
I've run this town tonight.

1784
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,280
And we were like,
Oh shit.

1785
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:21,590
He's going deep expressions in Sacramento.
It needs to be a scamming combo.

1786
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:26,930
Gary Combo with the elite wrestler with
Chuck Liddell striking like that was a

1787
01:49:26,931 --> 01:49:29,990
nightmare. Like what the fuck are you
going to do? You might get shut off,

1788
01:49:29,991 --> 01:49:33,350
there's a good chance tonight you're going
to get shut off. You know what I mean?

1789
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:38,590
But the Combo of black belt in
Jujitsu and vicious striker,

1790
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:40,990
damn, that's a whole
different dimension. It is,

1791
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:43,760
right is the ground game
is a more dangerous ground.

1792
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,140
You're trying to get this guy to
the ground, but he might choke you.

1793
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:48,040
There's a very good that he's better than

1794
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,560
you on the ground. So
what now? And it opens up.

1795
01:49:50,561 --> 01:49:52,330
You're going to do now it opens up pos.

1796
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:56,440
Wrestlers in this day and age are not
really just rustlers pretty much everybody

1797
01:49:56,441 --> 01:49:58,690
has some ground game knowledge,

1798
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:03,400
but you'd be amazed at how many guys
are fighting in the UFC that you know,

1799
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:05,770
they really don't work
on certain positions.

1800
01:50:05,771 --> 01:50:08,950
Like they never work on
being on their back. Yeah, I,

1801
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:13,951
I've rolled with some people that are
in the FCM like I'm fucking tiny and I

1802
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:17,740
just followed you up like, and it's
you guys and I've been, I've been,

1803
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:20,260
everyone talks about my wrestling,
but I'm not a world class wrestler.

1804
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:22,600
I'm just go to that main wrestling.

1805
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:25,840
I mean I do beat up kids in college and
stuff, but I never accomplished anything.

1806
01:50:25,841 --> 01:50:30,580
Yeah. But it's all, it's a shit. I've
been doing Jujitsu for just as long.

1807
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:34,270
I'm only a purple belt, but that's
because my coaches, my coach and he won't,

1808
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:39,310
I don't wear a ever. Yeah. Well
that's probably, Jeeva is very like,

1809
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,920
he's amazing. You know. And she did
too. But you can put it on a Gig.

1810
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:43,210
That's how you,
that's how you get your belts.

1811
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:47,340
Don't get a bravo started
on the game please. I'm

1812
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:52,670
safety. It's got a comma
where you came from. I know.

1813
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,590
I just love the fact that we were in a
fucking hoists Gracie tee shirt after all

1814
01:50:56,591 --> 01:51:00,150
the shit you guys have been talking to
[inaudible] you haven't talked to any

1815
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:04,940
shit? No. I'll put some in.
Somebody comes up, I'm like,

1816
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:07,000
I talk shit.
In a funny way.

1817
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:10,220
Those meetings are shitting in the angry
when he's really mad at he hates me.

1818
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:13,060
Get Mad at you man.
And a funny one.

1819
01:51:13,061 --> 01:51:16,480
You've been nothing but fucking
praising of him from the jump man.

1820
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,960
I mean we both said that
if it wasn't for voice,

1821
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:23,270
we would have never been in any Jujitsu
in the first place. He just needs to sit.

1822
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:27,960
He's also, he's a proud guy and just
he needs to sit down and realize with,

1823
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:30,640
with uh, with Eddie and just
get the two of them together.

1824
01:51:30,641 --> 01:51:33,660
If they spoke for more than half an hour,
hoist would realize like Eddie,

1825
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:36,990
he's never disrespectful. No, he
would never realize he's beating.

1826
01:51:36,991 --> 01:51:38,510
Your brother never realized that

1827
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,400
he needs an Iowaska
trip more than anything.

1828
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:47,020
It's unfortunate because a lot of people
were upset at him for this whole thing.

1829
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:50,950
I mean, I've read a lot of forum threads
about people with like legit arguments,

1830
01:51:50,951 --> 01:51:51,784
like the,

1831
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:55,060
I used to be a hero to them and then you
hear him saying shit like this is like,

1832
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:57,850
this is just not what my hero would say.
Like why are you saying that?

1833
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,180
Even the MMA websites
we're talking about that.

1834
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:04,470
I understand what he was saying
about pot. I, I, you know,

1835
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,490
crazy way. I know this isn't a
sound insane, but I appreciate it.

1836
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:13,600
Like he's, he's thinking about me.
That's fucking nuts. That's crazy.

1837
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:18,730
I'm going to see saying my man. That's
crazy. Yeah. It's the ultimate use legend.

1838
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:22,400
I think it's, I think it's pretty
cool. It's flattering. I wouldn't even,

1839
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:24,221
I like it.

1840
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:29,221
I'm like [inaudible] he thought he would
punch my nose if I looked at him and

1841
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:34,480
rubber guard. He would punch you in
the nose. Moist with Beltour. Yeah.

1842
01:52:34,481 --> 01:52:37,870
He signed with belts or he's
going to do not as a fighter.

1843
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:40,810
He's going to be Alexa ambassador.
You know,

1844
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:44,110
Scott Coker is a friend of uh,
the UFC.

1845
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:46,220
He used to own strike force.

1846
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,320
I think it's going to be different
relationship with Bella tour.

1847
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:53,120
And I think fuck yeah, it's, it's
always good for the sport. Look,

1848
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:54,830
they know what they're doing.
You know,

1849
01:52:54,831 --> 01:52:57,920
they know that they have a
B level organization is not,

1850
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:00,140
there's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong with having a beat.

1851
01:53:00,141 --> 01:53:03,440
They have some great fights, a
lot of fun fights. But you know,

1852
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:07,190
they've got a manual Newton,
the UFC has John Jones,

1853
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:12,270
John Manual. Newton is a very
good fighter, but he's not
John Jones. And you know,

1854
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:13,130
they had uh,

1855
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:17,210
they had fucking Hector Lombard who
might be the mother fucker at one 70.

1856
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:20,790
He might be the motherfucker scare.
Yay. He might pay every month to talk.

1857
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,550
Everybody's scared of that.
Too Tiring with,

1858
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:26,420
uh, really interesting. Thanks. Anyway,

1859
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,710
I want to do it.
I'm just going to take some time off.

1860
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,670
Thank the sober and you know who's
scary than Woodley physically.

1861
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:33,990
Woodley's a fucking beast.

1862
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:38,720
They're Lombard. Exactly. Can
you take a scan? We take a sale.

1863
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,400
It looks like a centipede.
He's got dudes

1864
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,960
a bigger scarier that like a buff dude
in a real old old cartoon where that'd be

1865
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:51,160
just like a dude who just like
really buff and it looks fake.

1866
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,980
His ass legs just don't talk about
this as a tail piece on them.

1867
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,490
I thought it was brushing
bodybuilding spray painted sweats on.

1868
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,090
I'll do.

1869
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:05,850
I was like the ass on that cows.

1870
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,290
He's just all judo the fuck out.
Yeah. We haven't had asked for days.

1871
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:15,100
We did have some gay talk. Okay. We did.
Okay, so we're all a little bit town.

1872
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:15,940
Just the tip.

1873
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:18,250
Remember we said that if we were
okay with this place would be a mess.

1874
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,710
We'll be having an orgy.
There wouldn't be no fight companion.

1875
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,410
We'd be under an orgy
watching the fight to win.

1876
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:30,890
You'd pull your dick out and be like,
what? Darren Elkins one right back

1877
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:37,720
be like loads.

1878
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,840
You got another one.
Your neighbors

1879
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:48,150
when you look [inaudible] bro quit.

1880
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:52,180
He called Quinten. Is that but
someone got called them out mountain.

1881
01:54:52,181 --> 01:54:55,480
There's 10 minutes left. I got another
one bro. Let time pass per, okay.

1882
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:00,390
Let's hear what it sounds
like when they introduced it.

1883
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,960
I can't go higher than you want
to hear what it sounds like.

1884
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:06,520
You thought you said light cause
you're a volume button on that.

1885
01:55:06,521 --> 01:55:07,960
I want to hear this when they introduced,

1886
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:10,480
although that place is going to
go fucking Shit House insane.

1887
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:16,500
Give it a good crank Jamie cranked
up bitch. Where the fuck up?

1888
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:22,350
Look at the size of that place.
Jamie gold. Craig it up Jamie.

1889
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:29,360
I just love hearing the
Brazilian fans scream.

1890
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:32,570
You ain't seen Aubrey's been there dude.

1891
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:36,170
It's like no other place in the world
when it comes to the enthusiasm of the

1892
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:37,004
fans.
It's

1893
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:41,960
clearly the charts. Listen,
listen, listen. Here is

1894
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:52,530
so far.
Sounds like fucking Stephan bottles.

1895
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:01,160
He never it

1896
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:08,340
from, he grew up on the outer side but
Conor Mcgregor in Rio and then I fought in

1897
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:12,960
Dublin and Dublin was in Rio was amazing
but Dublin was it fucking insane.

1898
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:17,370
They're just drunker. Oh
they're drunk rather wild. Wild.

1899
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:20,690
At first I got the, and I was kind
of like, fuck this kid Connor,

1900
01:56:20,691 --> 01:56:22,020
like kind of annoying.

1901
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,230
And then as I'm sitting there watching
him like psycho analyzing the whole thing

1902
01:56:25,231 --> 01:56:27,530
and just kinda just
watching it all unfold.

1903
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:30,210
Like this motherfucker is crazy and
everywhere you go in Ireland they're like,

1904
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,530
oh you're already here for Connor.

1905
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:38,580
Yeah, I guess so, right? I guess
that's why I'm here. Here we go.

1906
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:43,610
Mendez moving forward and as
they kicked me this Mendez,

1907
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:48,810
he did his face right away.
Boy. Dwayne movement there.

1908
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:53,250
Look at this. Nevermind.
He does look like Tj.

1909
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:58,000
I lied again to good, good shots. Totally

1910
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:04,290
dude. Aldo demendez looking at, Ooh,

1911
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:11,160
I live in all. Look, it's ghetto like that
kicked by Mendez right there though. Oh,

1912
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:14,340
you still might not go to the snow.
This is going to,

1913
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:18,540
someone's going to sleep I think.
Oh check that one.

1914
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:23,220
So that one coming to come after.
Good Jab, right hand by Mendez.

1915
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:24,960
The more it can make all the work,

1916
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:27,600
like this man man has got a little
bit of a mouse in that left eye.

1917
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:30,780
A little bit of a mouse.
And if men

1918
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:37,710
he's rocked. That was a big
that. Who? Who's wobbly son.

1919
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:43,160
Left Hook
uppercut.

1920
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:48,060
Holy Shit
going south pawn.

1921
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:49,770
I'm occasionally fearless.
Good.

1922
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:54,060
Jen Mendez looking to get this
fucking title man. Are you kidding me?

1923
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:57,360
This is fucking exciting.
Fuck yeah, it is.

1924
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:00,870
Ooze on looking at uncork right
there in that right hand. Oh,

1925
01:58:00,871 --> 01:58:05,100
I'll throw lands one. You don't want to
let with creating monsters. Seriously.

1926
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:07,110
Well we kept but look now
Mendez is right in front of him.

1927
01:58:07,111 --> 01:58:10,860
He doesn't want to do this guy
days until it got you there.

1928
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:12,810
Got To get on your bike, man.
Yeah. Well you know what?

1929
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:16,170
You get that feeling like you might finish
this fucking guy and you're standing

1930
01:58:16,171 --> 01:58:19,290
right in front of her.
No catches people.

1931
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,450
That's how although catches people,

1932
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:24,960
you don't want to be
standing in front of them.

1933
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:28,080
You want to go right back to
what got you to that spot.

1934
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:29,970
I mean he's definitely recovered by now.

1935
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,310
You've got to assume he's recovering
the fly flying near right,

1936
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:37,170
but he hasn't been recovered.
Maybe it doesn't look the same hard.

1937
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:40,290
Maybe Mendez knows he heard him like
right there and I didn't look like it was

1938
01:58:40,291 --> 01:58:43,060
like boom, body shot. Nice.

1939
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:47,910
Oh like kick.
He's going to go high with it.

1940
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:53,750
Eight eight 11 looks like it hurt
him a little bit. I left her son.

1941
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,920
Good defense by Mendez to although so
goddamn sudden he could just end shit and

1942
01:59:00,401 --> 01:59:03,190
everything he throws is perfect.
Perfect technique,

1943
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:08,490
Mendez just standing
right in front of all the,

1944
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,860
who the fuck would have
thought this vicious left

1945
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:16,420
dude.
Nice Jab by Mendez.

1946
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:21,870
How much better to his fucking striking
get wait mode when fucking Ludwig is a

1947
01:59:22,721 --> 01:59:25,600
wizard.
He really is a goddamn wizard.

1948
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:28,030
A crazy OCD wizard.

1949
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:32,920
Nice left hook. God Damn. Oh,

1950
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:37,930
oh, oh, oh,

1951
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:38,950
okay.

1952
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:41,770
Damn. He was like, no more knees. Please

1953
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:48,880
kick. Oh, chow on the
dude. All those lit up.

1954
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:53,590
Look at his face. Oh, I'm
chuck over the top again.

1955
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:56,483
It's awesome.

1956
01:59:58,230 --> 01:59:58,830
Oh

1957
01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:03,080
Shit. One 37 to go. Damn.

1958
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:08,000
Holy Shit. What a fucking
fight. That's it in the crowd.

1959
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:12,800
Now just miss with that advocate.
They're screaming at you. Oh,

1960
02:00:12,801 --> 02:00:15,420
you can't just heat that kick.
He just ate that one thing.

1961
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:19,550
The crowds ate a jab right
there too. I bloke. Come on,

1962
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:25,560
man. They worked it out. Don't
give them a chance again.

1963
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:30,500
Back to the foot work son. Yeah,
he's got it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1964
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,570
I hope Duane Ludwig screaming that out.
I'm right now

1965
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:38,240
trying to stay on him, but you know,
although deserves his fucking rest.

1966
02:00:38,241 --> 02:00:42,230
If it's a legit, I poke. Let's
take a look at it right here. Yeah.

1967
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:48,140
Kinda hit his eyebrows in Aurora,
Colorado. That's not an iPod.

1968
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:51,260
Okay. So let's look the, the consensus,

1969
02:00:51,261 --> 02:00:52,970
he's probably taking a little
bit of a break right here, right?

1970
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,790
100% veteran move 500% right? Yep. And
there's nothing wrong with that, right?

1971
02:00:56,791 --> 02:01:00,010
This isn't his first Rodeo. Yeah. And it
look, it legitimately did go in his eyes,

1972
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:03,160
so he's taken a little bit of a break.
Maybe it hurts more than me. He's like,

1973
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:07,550
yeah. And he's allowed to say if he's
allowed to. It's not really cheating.

1974
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,860
Did I get poked in eye? Yeah. He's
probably not even say anything. Huh?

1975
02:01:09,861 --> 02:01:13,970
It went my eye. Are you
okay? When my eye. Ooh,

1976
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:15,523
right back at it.

1977
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:18,980
Oh my hand. Oh, I love her clip.

1978
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:22,980
Let's take some down. Look
at this. Scramble matches

1979
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,413
keep down.

1980
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:36,640
Lot of times we'll have shit finish and
finish him. Oh Man. You got to finish.

1981
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,470
Got to get that knee across.

1982
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:45,483
Oh,

1983
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,780
18 seconds to go.
I've got

1984
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:01,330
no heart attack.
Or they say

1985
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:07,500
Mendez work. Oh my God. For some awesome.

1986
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:08,523
Oh good.

1987
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,500
Holy Shit. Covered. He'll recover.

1988
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:29,270
What a fucking round. I mean things
like a movie coming out of this bucket.

1989
02:02:29,271 --> 02:02:31,840
Two gyms together just turn into amazing.
Oh my God.

1990
02:02:31,841 --> 02:02:34,840
What a fucking round Bueno says.

1991
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:42,610
Oh look at the end of the fight,
boom at the buzzer.

1992
02:02:42,611 --> 02:02:45,270
He relaxed.
Just beat,

1993
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,980
beaten up the first and the minute you
see the girl in the background shaking

1994
02:02:47,981 --> 02:02:52,690
her finger. How has that
made you? Let me know.

1995
02:02:53,410 --> 02:02:57,450
She's going to get on a, on Twitter. I've
got fired. Watch has got to be mended.

1996
02:02:57,490 --> 02:03:00,160
His girlfriend.
Yeah.

1997
02:03:00,161 --> 02:03:04,970
No Brazilian check's going to be wagging
her finger or if she is she saying you

1998
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:09,820
showed her message shit. He recovered.
He's fine. Yeah, you said it fine.

1999
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:15,470
You crazy, dude. That guy's a
fucking the fine. Fine, fine.

2000
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:18,560
He might be concocted outside
birdies. Dude, look at him right now.

2001
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:23,380
It's not the only one. No knows right
now. Right now it's Chad. That's it.

2002
02:03:23,381 --> 02:03:28,210
He's the only one who knows. Look
at is, I know he's glazed over.

2003
02:03:28,211 --> 02:03:30,520
Even if, yeah. Even if
he does recover well,

2004
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:33,070
that was a stunning patch of the footwork.

2005
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:37,250
I sometime I look at him dancing
around like an angel dude,

2006
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,060
like a tiny little Buffy angel.

2007
02:03:40,061 --> 02:03:43,890
He took a bunch a bunch of fucking
punches off of his clock right there.

2008
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:48,340
It looks beautiful. Look at that.
If he gets, if he gets hit again,

2009
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:50,980
he's going to be for sure his Chin's
going to be diminished by that.

2010
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:55,990
Are you crazy? Look at that as
a slip and slip. No rock though.

2011
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:58,690
Eddie Bravo's given up
on doing commentary.

2012
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:06,070
Chad just looks better. He's not moving
on that left everyone at every level.

2013
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,520
He's buying time with his footwork.
Oh.

2014
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:18,150
Oh No. He could hear that. He
was trying to hit it with a knee.

2015
02:04:18,151 --> 02:04:23,100
He was trying to catch the jab.
There we go. Yeah. This one does.

2016
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:27,420
Yeah. Unless the fight ends here. No,

2017
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:32,910
weird shit's happened before. Let's
take a look at it. Oh, split wrong.

2018
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:36,840
Strong foot tables. Okay. Now Ian,

2019
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:41,580
if he's got a metal cup on,
how much difference is it for the front,

2020
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:44,400
the deck and the ball's bees and
for beans, frank? Yes, it's fine,

2021
02:04:44,401 --> 02:04:47,700
but it's the undercarriage. The called
the table shots still hurts. That hurts.

2022
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:49,550
That one sucks. I wasn't. Yeah,

2023
02:04:49,551 --> 02:04:52,650
in the teen area and then underneath you
still go up into your junk and it hurts.

2024
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:56,760
I got kicked in the Dick the other day.
I align brews down half my deck.

2025
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:00,570
And what circles is that conversation
come up? I got kicked in the Dick.

2026
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:05,540
I called her. I'm like, well you
got something to tell me. Like

2027
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:09,360
I got hit in the Dick one so bad.

2028
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:12,540
I just went and started wearing
a cup for Jujitsu cause my Dick,

2029
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:16,710
I took my jacket off and it
was filled with blood. Oh yeah.

2030
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:18,540
And so I was thinking,
God damn it,

2031
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:21,180
do I go to the emergency room and
then I decided what would I do?

2032
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,090
That was my nose. I like it was
my nose. I wouldn't go anywhere.

2033
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:29,520
So I just went home and I jerked off
cause I w I figured dash got hard.

2034
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:33,500
I didn't have to worry and it was okay.
It's weird how we're on the seafront.

2035
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:37,490
I piss blood for a few days though.
Oh,

2036
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:41,020
it was just a guard pass to
somebody was passing my garden.

2037
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:43,140
He shoved his knee
right into my dick hole.

2038
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:48,000
So as a girl I get nervous about that.

2039
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:51,960
I just wish y'all would wear cubs all
the time. I made kids after that though,

2040
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:52,950
so it's all good.

2041
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:00,870
Back to this fucking awesome
fight. Shit. Oh there's a hard one.

2042
02:06:00,871 --> 02:06:03,050
That was a hard one.
And he shook.

2043
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,490
What did he shake his finger because
he checked. Checked it. Yeah.

2044
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:07,850
Yeah.

2045
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:11,520
Tell us.
Well this is the thing about Aldo.

2046
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,230
Everybody knows that in the second,

2047
02:06:13,231 --> 02:06:17,910
third and fourth round he starts to slowly
begins to taper off and oftentimes in

2048
02:06:17,911 --> 02:06:20,820
the fifth round is just not the same
fighter for the first couple of rounds.

2049
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:23,420
He's a motherfucker. Ooh, that
rocked him. But there was,

2050
02:06:23,421 --> 02:06:26,670
this was a crazy first round and
here we are in the size of body care.

2051
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,990
If Mendez might be start
wold, I wasn't going, man,

2052
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:33,120
this might start to think that
he's, uh, he's getting into him.

2053
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:38,161
But you know what?
Men Is,

2054
02:06:38,161 --> 02:06:41,240
has not been known for his cardio
either because he's such a Beasley dude.

2055
02:06:41,570 --> 02:06:42,740
You know those Beasley guys,

2056
02:06:42,741 --> 02:06:46,860
the lombards and the Woodley's and
there's so much muscle involved,

2057
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,670
so much fast twitch too. It's
not that slow. Endurance runner.

2058
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:54,020
Nick Diaz type muscle. Yeah. That
guy. You never see him tired.

2059
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:59,570
This is a fucking great fight though,
Huh? Cause this is where it gets weird.

2060
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,780
It gets weird if you can get into
the third, fourth and fifth round,

2061
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:07,100
especially if Mendez starts getting
loose. Who won the first round? For sure.

2062
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:10,910
Share fucking crazy round. But I've got to
say, although, although had them almost,

2063
02:07:10,911 --> 02:07:14,950
how cold? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got
a job twice instead of one. Yeah.

2064
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:20,300
The last one was giant. The
last one was just Jen. Oh,

2065
02:07:20,301 --> 02:07:24,380
nice body kick. Oh Shit.
Mendez getting loose.

2066
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:29,490
Oh Shit. Oh ooh. Check.

2067
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:31,760
We owie Owie owie

2068
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:38,010
right hand over the top to
the body by all them. Wow.

2069
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:43,120
All the loves that left Hook.
He's got a fucking nasty whipping one too.

2070
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:46,180
No matter how much adrenaline you have,
when you get,

2071
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:49,560
when you check a leg kick like that shit
in the shit, it's still hurts, right? Oh,

2072
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:51,510
the fight.
Well,

2073
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:55,540
unless you're on one of those tie dudes
like Malheur pet that just see ever seen

2074
02:07:55,541 --> 02:07:58,870
Malpais fight where it kicks guys shit in
the Shin on purpose to break them down.

2075
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:02,110
We just had Yeltsin client or at our gym,
God,

2076
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:05,590
145 pounds kicking a bag. Like, oh my God.

2077
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:10,530
He's a ferocious guy, man.
One of my shitty partners
just beat Mallee pet reeling.

2078
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:13,690
Shane Blonsky fighting boy shit dude.

2079
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:19,570
Yachts and Clive fought in Lyon fights
recently. Holy Shit. Is he good?

2080
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:23,040
He thought whether that Indian guy,
yeah.

2081
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:27,400
I love watching pure tie like
those short typewriters like him.

2082
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:32,140
Like mammopad Yeltsin cries the mother
fucker though, man. He's got like,

2083
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:35,980
he's 30 years old, right? And he
has like some ungodly my fights.

2084
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:40,630
Some that's so crazy. Him Sand shy,
super bond guys like that. Yeah,

2085
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:43,030
because then when they all come over
they come and stay with him and like hang

2086
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:46,270
out in my coach.
Oh do they really amazing rules.

2087
02:08:46,271 --> 02:08:49,020
The most hardcore they allow them.
Yeah.

2088
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:52,870
Well they allow you to clinch up and throw
each other on the ground as it pretty

2089
02:08:52,871 --> 02:08:56,720
much on the, on the ground.
You could throw him and shit.
He had left foot drop on.

2090
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,890
How does that bedrock old
fights. Yeah. Draco they used to,

2091
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:02,590
they used to have [inaudible]
Draka these to have a takedowns.

2092
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,300
Most Smith fought and that shit is that
those Ho taste them again at the end of

2093
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:10,530
the week since sweeps and like kind of,
it's the most hardcore Mendez. Strike it.

2094
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:14,230
I'm thinking about the taking
the time I oh, drag him into the

2095
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:20,590
hole. Punch and kick it
still be more hardcore. Yeah,

2096
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:23,360
I think so. I think it should
be more Tyrell's. Yeah.

2097
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:26,460
I like my lion fights better rules.
They'll allow

2098
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:31,000
more tide. They clinch up, they
hold onto each other for awhile.

2099
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:34,300
They ragdoll each other and
needed a body elbow over the top.

2100
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:39,490
They don't even have elbows and glory.
Glory is all kickboxing, like Dutch style.

2101
02:09:39,570 --> 02:09:43,030
And we have some amazing Americans right
now. Yeah, I mean you got Kevin Ross,

2102
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:46,630
Joe Schilling, Romeo,
Don's a chi and back like,

2103
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:49,480
and these are all guys that are
up, you know friends with. It's,

2104
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:51,100
it's to watch him fight as fuck.

2105
02:09:51,101 --> 02:09:54,330
How bout shillings fucking
fight in golden glory again.

2106
02:09:54,331 --> 02:09:58,300
So what does his name Marcus,
oh my God. And then he fought.

2107
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:02,650
So that was an extra rather fight
fight. Another fight. Three rounds.

2108
02:10:02,651 --> 02:10:06,340
And then he went and fought in the
finals and fought in Fatuma decision.

2109
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,550
Incredible. With arm and arm to
quit fucking bad ass mother fucker.

2110
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:11,410
He's so talented.

2111
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:16,590
You see that spinning and spinning
backhand that he hit him with the slip.

2112
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:20,110
I just loved the way he fights too with
his hands down. It was like a snake. Ooh,

2113
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:23,530
Mendez coming at him. Now this is the
round. You pick it up. Yeah. This is the,

2114
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:26,160
look at this. He's already, he's got
to show the, she you. That's the game.

2115
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:32,140
It's a soup now.
Things are looking way better for Mendez.

2116
02:10:32,141 --> 02:10:34,190
You digging into the third,
fourth and fifth rounds?

2117
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:39,840
Traditionally you're dealing
with a different Aldo. Oh No, no,

2118
02:10:39,850 --> 02:10:42,290
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2119
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:48,330
That's the anywhere where we are a sad
group of fucking non fuck AA or gee

2120
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:52,570
haven't dude. Have you had
someone cut their, your,

2121
02:10:52,571 --> 02:10:54,830
your eye with their finger of your
budget. Cut your eye before. No,

2122
02:10:54,831 --> 02:10:58,220
but you've Winkeljohn
story, right? Yeah. My Shoe,

2123
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:03,380
the great trainer from Jackson's
academy went blind because the guy,

2124
02:11:03,381 --> 02:11:08,060
he was holding pads for his toenail went
into his eyeball slices eyeball but it

2125
02:11:08,061 --> 02:11:12,740
was like Ooh. Oozing out into his
hands. Like fell out. Yeah. Oh Man.

2126
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:17,450
So it's like a bad one. You ever ever
hear of Sean Sean bias, Sean bias,

2127
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:19,730
crazy fucking fighter from nor cal.

2128
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:23,480
We were wrestling season tickets back and
he would just grab my head and skipped

2129
02:11:23,481 --> 02:11:25,740
his finger up my eyeball.
I was bleeding.

2130
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:29,540
That was one of the scariest moments ever.
But also it hurts so bad.

2131
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:35,450
Okay, here we go. They're back. They're
back. Cause he going to take a point away.

2132
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:37,870
No, I said next time. Next
time. Just take a point.

2133
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:43,520
Let's see. Mendez, good
defense. Oh, tagged them.

2134
02:11:43,521 --> 02:11:48,290
He tagged him tagging with
that left. Whoa. What the left.

2135
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:51,700
Oh,
right hand of all those.

2136
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:55,820
So Dan is such a sweet right hand.

2137
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:59,780
That's the one he heard him with the
end of the first router. Yeah, Dude.

2138
02:11:59,790 --> 02:12:02,840
Although still here man. Great,
great endurance. And the shark,

2139
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:05,670
I wish men does get through
his wrestle a little bit. Yeah,

2140
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:11,180
they show it to him like can you
make them work?

2141
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:13,610
But I think he's worried that
if he makes them work like that,

2142
02:12:13,611 --> 02:12:16,970
then he'll be too tired to do what he
needs to do to stay safe on his feet.

2143
02:12:17,390 --> 02:12:19,970
Right. He burned a lot of energy
earlier and that he knows,

2144
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:24,750
but he wants to definitely be able to
have the speed and movement. This is the,

2145
02:12:24,751 --> 02:12:27,710
the Duane Ludwig style strategy stuff.

2146
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:30,500
You know what's most interesting
about this Duane Ludwig approach?

2147
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:32,320
He didn't use it.
No

2148
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:40,330
toilet. Straight floor drains the
first guy to slow it straight.

2149
02:12:40,890 --> 02:12:42,500
Dwayne had nasty counters.

2150
02:12:42,670 --> 02:12:47,360
No this and no fucking no slop
in any of his movement. Yeah.

2151
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:50,540
Like when he knocked out Jonathan Goulay
with that right hand. That's shit.

2152
02:12:50,541 --> 02:12:53,510
He's backing up and that right
hand comes off like a piston.

2153
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:57,860
That's how great Dwayne is.
If he knows oh shit.

2154
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:02,150
Oh Shit.
He knows that uh,

2155
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:06,440
the best possible style will be
stuff that he doesn't, isn't, oh,

2156
02:13:06,441 --> 02:13:09,800
hard ice chat tude although fucked
him up with that Jab. Nice inside.

2157
02:13:09,801 --> 02:13:14,801
Like Carlos Mendez is trying to win this
fucking fight he got when he gets hit,

2158
02:13:17,481 --> 02:13:22,370
he's getting angry and he's like digging
his heels in and say no, not tonight,

2159
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:23,353
not tonight.

2160
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:28,010
And she's a couple of times been tagged
and then come back and rocked all though

2161
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,630
because he's just determined to
win this fight. Straight title.

2162
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:36,990
But man, that's where you gotta be
careful when you're moving towards Aldo.

2163
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:40,860
Those counters come so sharp.
Who Do you thinks winning so far?

2164
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:44,670
That's a good question. I think
all those up, all those, yeah,

2165
02:13:44,671 --> 02:13:45,990
I'll definitely when the first,

2166
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:49,590
I think in the second round
I would say it's close,

2167
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:54,850
but probably all though, right? I
would have to go over that again. Oh,

2168
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:59,640
that was definitely sure.
Yeah. She knows it all.

2169
02:13:59,690 --> 02:14:02,250
I don't know about for sure.
What about this 100%

2170
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:13,250
although he's hurt. Wow. He's, he's,

2171
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:14,550
he's throwing the cut.

2172
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:21,450
He got hurt back and forth. Oh,
that Meagan. They heard each other.

2173
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:27,860
Oh,
he is fucking tired.

2174
02:14:27,861 --> 02:14:31,730
But he's still dangerous as
shit. It throws so hard. Oh

2175
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:38,790
God. Damn Dude. Good
sprawl by Aldo too, huh?

2176
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,620
And now man is head shots.

2177
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:46,150
Just trying to recover her. I
keep punching him. What did,

2178
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:47,430
I don't know why you're
fucking stolen out.

2179
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:52,350
Doesn't want him to complete that
single right. Oh, lefthand. Oh,

2180
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:59,390
he's bad son. Look at this.
Wow. Mendez is in the cruise.

2181
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:04,760
Shit. Foot stops looking at, he's going,

2182
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:08,590
Marco, who? I wonder why more people
don't do that. Does that hurt Brendan?

2183
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:12,490
I, yeah, don't do it to
me and I want to do it.

2184
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:20,880
It's kind of like, damn man, come on.

2185
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:24,630
It's the split stop.
And then the front knee kick is horrible,

2186
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:27,030
but he's not putting much
into these needs. Right.

2187
02:15:27,031 --> 02:15:29,700
Because he doesn't want to
commit. Oh, those are hard house.

2188
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:32,290
I love those who he's getting missing.

2189
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:40,650
Oh, that's a hard one, man. It's okay.

2190
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:43,350
You're going to break my boat there,

2191
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:47,280
right in front of each other and pinky
talking and talking shit talking. Oh Shit.

2192
02:15:47,281 --> 02:15:50,310
I wonder what he said. Oh yeah,
they're laughing at each other. Oh,

2193
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:53,220
that dropdown now plumbed the plum
baby. Look out for that. Nice.

2194
02:15:53,221 --> 02:15:56,130
I said fight of the night.
Oh,

2195
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:01,860
he tagged him with that
left Hook. Wow. Ooh.

2196
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:06,253
I'll go

2197
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:11,640
back and forth around the Mendez
because of that. And then the,

2198
02:16:11,641 --> 02:16:12,980
because of the end and the end,

2199
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:15,420
the fact that he got that
takedown got ahold of them,

2200
02:16:15,421 --> 02:16:18,480
but 10 although did crack him right there,
but Mendez recovered.

2201
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:22,950
Is that all of a fight is
a hell of a fight, man.

2202
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:26,430
It's close like that. Ron
was close. Forgot about huge,

2203
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:28,770
although dropping him there,
it's close.

2204
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:32,140
But I think Mendez was controlling the
end of the fight and tag them at the end

2205
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:32,680
of the fight.

2206
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:35,800
I give a lot of credit to the end of
a round or not the end of the fight.

2207
02:16:35,801 --> 02:16:39,040
The end of a round. I'll give a lot
of credit to the end of the round.

2208
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:41,590
I give a lot of credit to the end
of a fight because I feel like,

2209
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:44,770
and this is a stupid way to look at it,
but in a street fight,

2210
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,750
it doesn't matter if
it got kicked your ass,

2211
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:51,370
if the teachers pulled you off of him,
you won. You know what I'm saying?

2212
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:54,460
A guy can hit you with like a one
two punch kick you in the leg,

2213
02:16:54,461 --> 02:16:56,950
punch you in the liver,
you're getting fucked up,

2214
02:16:56,951 --> 02:17:00,160
and then somehow know that he slips and
you want up on top and you punched him

2215
02:17:00,161 --> 02:17:03,250
in the face and the teacher pulls you off.
Most people are gonna think you want,

2216
02:17:04,390 --> 02:17:07,120
right? Yeah. Who was on top of the
end? Oh, Danny was on top, Bro.

2217
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:11,370
He was going to kill that kid.
You fluctuate their guard. Yeah.

2218
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:14,030
Sometimes Pete.
Well that's a different one.

2219
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:17,560
It depends on who's watching the
fight. Yeah. Damn all it looks big.

2220
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:21,490
I put a lot of muscle on Disney. I was
about to say it looks skinnier than usual.

2221
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:25,270
I thought he looked real muscular.
All right, here we go. Dig Deep.

2222
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:29,970
My friend Goldie, the homeless
had an aneurysm right there. He

2223
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:36,530
switching up a lot, man. A lot of
a southpaw movement. That's again,

2224
02:17:36,531 --> 02:17:38,840
Dwayne, Dwayne, Aka Dominick Cruz.

2225
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:45,120
Fourth Round is deep water for all though.

2226
02:17:45,121 --> 02:17:47,950
This is where shit gets weird with him.
Super Bad.

2227
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:52,380
I swear mark than ever to mark
harmonic was on top of all of those.

2228
02:17:52,381 --> 02:17:55,020
I'll never forget that.
And Mark Hall make a very good striker.

2229
02:17:55,050 --> 02:17:58,590
That was the fifth round, right?
Yeah. Very good. Well, yeah,

2230
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:02,090
a mouse living in his house. I didn't
know. Mike's been a hard iced tea.

2231
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,530
It's like someone's store,
a can of pineapples and his forehead.

2232
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:13,950
Oh, Mendez is still sharp
though, Dude. Mendez still sharp.

2233
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:17,070
He's in good shape for this
fight. That's a fact, man.

2234
02:18:20,730 --> 02:18:25,620
Good head movement to still
switching up a lot, man.

2235
02:18:25,621 --> 02:18:29,220
And he's not backing off his pace either.
They're both.

2236
02:18:29,221 --> 02:18:32,510
These guys are like not committing though.
They're getting real close with their,

2237
02:18:32,511 --> 02:18:35,820
they're touching, touching. They're
looking for that fucking burst.

2238
02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:39,023
Favorite.

2239
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:44,200
Right hand over the top. I Mendez
almost mint. Maybe it wouldn't. Again,

2240
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:46,930
leg kicks off, shade way down,
although just shook his head.

2241
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:52,390
They're talking and he's mad
because that's sweet. Upper cut.

2242
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:56,380
Oh, he's fucking him up, man. He
fucked him up at that left hand too.

2243
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:02,070
What was the last time we saw all
those face busted up like this?

2244
02:19:02,670 --> 02:19:06,990
This is unusual.
Barely missed that.

2245
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:11,760
Holy Shit. Dillashaw style. Fifth
Round head kick. K. Oh well listen man,

2246
02:19:11,761 --> 02:19:14,910
he's putting a pace on, although in this
fourth round and although his coasting,

2247
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,380
he's not doing anything and this is
where all those usually been in control.

2248
02:19:19,410 --> 02:19:23,700
He caught him with that left hand
over the top. What is he doing?

2249
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:27,920
He's complaining that the heads are, oh,
he can't complain. That's a weakness.

2250
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:31,910
He knows he's getting fucked up. You
can't, can't complain over Shit like that.

2251
02:19:31,911 --> 02:19:35,660
You know what's going on, man?
All the look and the wrestling,

2252
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:37,370
all I was going to get ghetto.

2253
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:42,210
He just starts throwing fucking wild heat.
You know what?

2254
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:46,250
What he's throwing is not hitting. He's
getting them on the end. This shit.

2255
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:49,880
It's not having the same impact and
Mendez has had in this round. I mean,

2256
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:53,210
look at the faces,
although is broken up, man.

2257
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:56,470
Mendez is doing some
fucking damage. Oh, guns.

2258
02:19:56,570 --> 02:19:58,860
When you see your opponent
has blood, yes, it does. It

2259
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:09,020
bleeds. We can kill it. It's
fine. It's so fucking good.

2260
02:20:09,870 --> 02:20:13,550
We'll move movies. A Predator.
Predator, Bro. I don't sports a nigger.

2261
02:20:13,551 --> 02:20:18,050
He just did a swap.
Synagogues all equipment.

2262
02:20:18,051 --> 02:20:21,530
The right at the very end of the
punch though. Look at all those faces.

2263
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:25,800
Fucking bloody. Oh God.
He throws, I think. Wow.

2264
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:31,070
Yeah. Oh, he got poked. He got poked,

2265
02:20:31,071 --> 02:20:34,040
man. Okay. He's just going to go right
back in. I was out there. I see it.

2266
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:39,160
He's got better. Oh, back to the leg kick.

2267
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,720
What if he gets leg kicked it down?
That would be hilarious.

2268
02:20:41,721 --> 02:20:44,900
That would be hilarious.
But then it's too late for that.

2269
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:48,260
Then you've got to do some real groundwork
and those fucking first few rounds.

2270
02:20:50,510 --> 02:20:54,920
Or are you just go out and Edson
Barboza. I'm here. Edson Barboza he hit,

2271
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:58,460
might have one of the nastiest leg kicks
in all of the UFC right now. For sure.

2272
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:03,290
Oh, by far. Nasty. He's one of the only
guys who stopped to people by led cakes.

2273
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:10,370
He stopped a Hefei Alo Olivera and he
stopped, uh, one of his earlier opponents.

2274
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:13,580
Oh Man.
Hard right hand by Mendez.

2275
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:19,850
U of c seven. Yeah, man. He was
the one who showed everybody.

2276
02:21:19,851 --> 02:21:23,450
What's up Paul Varland son
chopped down the polar bear.

2277
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:27,110
Remember that shit? Oh yeah. 17 Marco,

2278
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:30,800
who was the king of the foot stomps to
Paul violence. Hit me up on Facebook.

2279
02:21:30,801 --> 02:21:33,230
Weird message. No Shit. Weird message.

2280
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:41,870
What's up bro? Yeah, we had met. That
was a hard check. Heart check there.

2281
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:47,510
He setting up something.
Javin that chest trap fighting

2282
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:50,313
to him.

2283
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:56,030
I don't want to hear about that weird
message from a 359 dude lives in Alaska.

2284
02:21:56,460 --> 02:22:00,560
Oh,
this round.

2285
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:04,390
Just buy shit like that. He's so fucking
athletic. It's crazy. Although, although,

2286
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:09,230
yeah, it's so violent and awesome.
Oh, much at FIS. 10 seconds.

2287
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:11,330
Go the right hand over the top.
I'm Chad.

2288
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,860
They must be yelling at
him to turn it up here.

2289
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:18,770
I wonder if he can hear Wayne and
his fucking crowd. I got it to two.

2290
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:22,580
I think it's, I think it's a,
I think it's too too as well.

2291
02:22:22,750 --> 02:22:26,130
You think it's three Ronaldo?
Three one Aldo.

2292
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:32,070
Oh look at that upper cut shit son.
So you think all the one this round,

2293
02:22:32,071 --> 02:22:33,930
how did it all the last round Chad one.
This one I

2294
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:37,640
know about the land.

2295
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:40,800
The last one was kinda close but I think
the last one she had definitely one.

2296
02:22:40,801 --> 02:22:41,191
This one.

2297
02:22:41,191 --> 02:22:43,740
I think the last one they're going to
give it to all though cause he rocked him.

2298
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:45,780
And you said the end of the round.

2299
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,330
I think all those going to
win that round in Brazil.

2300
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:51,690
But the end of the round was
Mendez winning the round hit him.

2301
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:56,670
I mean I dunno.
I Dunno either which Strunk talking shit.

2302
02:22:57,210 --> 02:23:00,780
That's so folks at homes that a
fucking like you like, Ooh, well good.

2303
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:03,420
I could do commentary.
Guess what? You could

2304
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:08,270
at least have exactly like you watching.

2305
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:11,040
This is fucking Ian Mccall,

2306
02:23:11,041 --> 02:23:15,660
one of the best flyways on the planet
earth spinning through space and he does

2307
02:23:15,661 --> 02:23:19,570
commentary just like you. I don't
fucking know what, we're not that cool.

2308
02:23:19,571 --> 02:23:23,910
We're not that smart. This, there
was a couple times, this is on air.

2309
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:28,740
You know there's a couple of times
I'm also sober though. Oh Man,

2310
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:33,450
look at all those eyeball, Bro. Holy
Shit. There's a lot of limited visibility.

2311
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:36,990
This is the fifth and final
motherfucker wins this round ones.

2312
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:41,220
The fights might be APP. I swing in
Brazil to see some crazy shit, man.

2313
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:44,940
Some crazy shit. You Jazz. You
know Chad's going to bring it.

2314
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:46,980
I'll just got to turn this shit up.
Oh,

2315
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:51,960
Mendez would've left hand switches
up to sell hard left. Fuck God damn.

2316
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:57,270
Woo. We got any punch
final fuck numbers, dude.

2317
02:23:57,271 --> 02:23:59,740
I don't want numbers.
Oh,

2318
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,760
love her sneaky left hook as
a writer out of the guard.

2319
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:09,480
Yeah, he whips it. You know he
whips it to the body as well.

2320
02:24:10,850 --> 02:24:13,650
They like each other, man.
They're having fun now.

2321
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:16,380
It's a lot of respect now
after this fucking crazy war.

2322
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:21,540
I mean these dudes know each other like
nobody knows each other. Take Down, take,

2323
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:26,730
take it down and he's fucking tired too,
man.

2324
02:24:26,731 --> 02:24:29,820
This is going to be hard to shift to get
back up from here. He does get back up.

2325
02:24:29,821 --> 02:24:32,010
He's exhausted.
Now you strike someone.

2326
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:36,540
Mendez is go Roulo strong at
one 45 that dude is a beast.

2327
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:40,770
Who the crowd bill. This
is the, if he wins, dude,

2328
02:24:40,771 --> 02:24:42,930
this is the last Brazilian
to hold the title. Yeah.

2329
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:47,300
Every fucking champion will be American
if he wins. So she does she show?

2330
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:49,980
Say they should know better.
Don't be a terrorist.

2331
02:24:49,981 --> 02:24:54,540
Everyone chant USA Corvette Corvette's
should just send them all cars.

2332
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:59,250
Just that'd be say American as fuck, but
it's the dry run. The core of Epi again,

2333
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:04,050
she chaired Hellcat. How do you like it?
It's dope. I love it. So doe love it.

2334
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:05,760
707 horsepower.

2335
02:25:05,761 --> 02:25:09,480
Fucking Chrysler [inaudible]
drove it when I was in Denver.

2336
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:12,390
She drove for the whole weekend.
They gave me one of those. I might,

2337
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:13,630
I might get one of the only like let's,

2338
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:15,870
I just want to get an American muscle car,

2339
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:19,060
but I'm thinking about in 1969
Mustang. Yes. Nothing's been in your,

2340
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:22,770
nothing's going to be better to drive.
It's not going to handle the same,

2341
02:25:22,771 --> 02:25:25,480
but it'd different. Oh Shit. Yeah.
They'll know. Pushes him off.

2342
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:28,300
That was my brother's first cause
of 69 Mustang. It's a great car.

2343
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:31,750
So pretty aesthetics. The way it looks is
a, you're onto something with corvette.

2344
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:33,480
They take all the,
the UFC champions

2345
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:38,350
put commercials together and American
as, fuck. That's a commercial.

2346
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:45,220
Oh Shit. Just go dude.
Although connected here,

2347
02:25:45,221 --> 02:25:48,040
man, this isn't good.
This is not good at all.

2348
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:54,130
Let's see that associate. So what about
that, you know, finished them here.

2349
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:58,300
What if he uses was usually so we could
stick on him to finish here and my

2350
02:25:58,301 --> 02:26:02,410
friend was to planning time two 42 40
and he's used to having your eye are

2351
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:06,910
crawling around on him taking the
bat. That's true. And up up again,

2352
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:08,860
get out since that's the
thing about those guys,

2353
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:13,240
they all have fucking wicked
guillotine defense. Oh,

2354
02:26:13,241 --> 02:26:16,660
kick knockout are still in front of
each other. Different 75 each other.

2355
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:20,080
Anything can happen in this kind of
fight and that's why I just stepped back.

2356
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:24,250
Stepped off. Oh yeah. Step off
again. Keep moving. Keep moving.

2357
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:28,870
Light on the toes of really thrown that
money. Leg. Resting an hour, one hour,

2358
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:33,490
he says over, you did a lot of
training. Oh vicious over the top.

2359
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:37,000
And left to the body first.
Oh Shit.

2360
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:42,160
Oh my goodness.
Oh Shit.

2361
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:47,800
Oh,
fucking Pez dispenser.

2362
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:51,670
Jesus.
Oh Shit.

2363
02:26:55,090 --> 02:26:57,730
Buckle up.
That's so sad

2364
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:02,260
though with that left. Right. Again,

2365
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:06,040
although being very conservative
with the kicks to men,

2366
02:27:06,041 --> 02:27:09,340
very conservative with the kicks.
Oh my God.

2367
02:27:09,341 --> 02:27:12,880
Who the fuck is going to win this fight?
This is this 90 seconds might be,

2368
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:17,530
here's the fight. I just looked up at
the clock. This might be left hand,

2369
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:21,310
but he was moving away from that.
He was sliding to his left.

2370
02:27:22,530 --> 02:27:27,140
This law. Ah, fuck again
with the knee. No, no, no,

2371
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:30,270
no. It's incidental.

2372
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:35,650
Oh my God. What time? He can't. He
can't be taking any breaks here.

2373
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:39,850
They're going to give it to all
though. They might not. Amen.

2374
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:43,540
This is a goddamn close round.

2375
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:46,900
Anybody they give it to all
the high agrees. 50 seconds.

2376
02:27:46,901 --> 02:27:48,250
Anybody could win this round.

2377
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:51,490
Anybody wins this round with one
successful friends right now.

2378
02:27:51,810 --> 02:27:56,680
Been a big hit. Yeah, I mean, but,
but nothing stunning. If all know,

2379
02:27:56,681 --> 02:28:00,490
stunned him here with something and
had them wobbly. He did when he did.

2380
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:04,600
It just happened. But not like
before. You know what I'm saying? Much

2381
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:08,440
cause he stunned Aldo too.

2382
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:12,460
He snapped his fucking head back with
that jab and he's looking at that upper

2383
02:28:12,461 --> 02:28:17,110
kind. I loved that. And
Saba shit. 20 seconds, man.

2384
02:28:17,111 --> 02:28:20,320
20 seconds. Oh body kick. Come on.

2385
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:26,570
Breaking out. 1515 oh check
it. You're fucking crazy.

2386
02:28:26,571 --> 02:28:30,200
You think the Brazilian judge was going
to give us the Oh, right here by all go.

2387
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:33,500
Go, go, go. The exchange. Right
hands. Oh Jesus Christ. I sweet.

2388
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,330
Oh

2389
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:41,770
Man.
I don't know.

2390
02:28:41,771 --> 02:28:45,410
I do not know you give
it to all still around

2391
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:50,300
then more of these probiotic things
out there that does a bunch in the back

2392
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:52,990
because you're fucking delicious.
They're really good. They're really good.

2393
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:57,910
I love it. God Damn
valuable fight. Oh my God.

2394
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:01,110
What do we think here?
Although I think all of those goals,

2395
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:04,290
everybody thinks all though one.

2396
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:10,720
I think if I had to give anybody the
last round, I'd probably be Aldo. Yeah.

2397
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:15,210
You know what? I think men does this.

2398
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:16,420
When he snapped his head back,

2399
02:29:16,421 --> 02:29:18,780
that was one of the most significant
show going to give it to all dumb.

2400
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:20,620
It was close enough where they were like,
you know what,

2401
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:23,140
I'm just going to give it to them. I
would like to see the numbers, you know,

2402
02:29:23,141 --> 02:29:27,340
cause we're watching it and having
fun. That took, that was early.

2403
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,850
That was the first round. We get the
numbers. It's all though all day.

2404
02:29:30,970 --> 02:29:34,290
If you look at the number, but she looks
up damaged. Yeah, that's true. Right?

2405
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:36,400
You significant strikes.
It's going to be all to all day.

2406
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:40,450
Oh look at that right here. Oh
my goodness. Oh my goodness.

2407
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:44,410
He walked back more seconds. I could have
been a finisher left hook to the body.

2408
02:29:44,410 --> 02:29:47,800
So fish and replies, you know how
powerful the replies are for the judges.

2409
02:29:47,830 --> 02:29:50,710
They're looking at the replay. That's
looks like three rounds to all though.

2410
02:29:50,711 --> 02:29:54,340
Right? Faster. The crowd
sways judging Mendez.

2411
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:58,750
Oh Jesus. Critics at the replays and
go, if that's what they're showing,

2412
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:00,910
they thought, okay,
but let's look at this.

2413
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:06,310
Look at the mean that that is a big
goddamn round. So that was around three.

2414
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:09,340
So round three was definitely Mendez,
right?

2415
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:10,510
That was the one he really heard them.

2416
02:30:10,511 --> 02:30:14,660
That was the clearest round for Mendez
round around three rather around four.

2417
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:15,910
It was like,
who the fuck knows?

2418
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:19,270
So round three was definitely Mendez
Brown Ford was, who the fuck knows?

2419
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:21,880
And round five.
You know

2420
02:30:26,130 --> 02:30:28,770
Ralph, I was so close.
Who fucking knows man?

2421
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:34,610
Who the fuck knows? Great fight though.
So you guys think all Dubai decision,

2422
02:30:35,010 --> 02:30:39,840
their bias, right? Whoever won,
whoever won what a fucking fight.

2423
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:42,300
Yeah. Jesus Christ was amazing. Amazing.

2424
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:48,080
Wow.
Unbelievable.

2425
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:49,243
What a fight.

2426
02:30:51,990 --> 02:30:55,550
You know how much shit Conor McGregor
is going to talk after this fight.

2427
02:30:57,050 --> 02:31:01,100
I don't think he wants any idea what some
of this you got picked up by a midget.

2428
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:07,520
Imagine what I'll do. Tiaa
split decision. Hold on.

2429
02:31:07,550 --> 02:31:11,740
I imagine what I'll do to you.
I'll do, what did he say? He's out.

2430
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:13,220
He'll knock his head clean off.

2431
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:17,750
I'll knock his head clean off
all the way back to Dublin.

2432
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,820
Ananymous decision. Yeah.
They're very happy in Brazil.

2433
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:29,320
Very, very, very, very good
fight. Great by fun. Wild fight.

2434
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:31,600
You know,
that's like everything you want to fight.

2435
02:31:31,601 --> 02:31:35,110
Two elite fighters going at
it. Uh, changing direction,

2436
02:31:35,111 --> 02:31:38,680
changing the tide back and forth.
Both guys get tested.

2437
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:42,640
Both guys have to overcome
fucking amazing fight.

2438
02:31:46,150 --> 02:31:50,320
Powerful, big, handsome Brian Dan with
a napkin coming out of his pocket.

2439
02:31:51,430 --> 02:31:53,850
They tried to get me that shit.
I'm like, put that God damn Napkin.

2440
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:57,790
It's not going in my fucking pocket.
You haven't where it sits though? Yeah.

2441
02:31:57,791 --> 02:32:00,040
I don't wear the jacket though.
I gave up on the jacket.

2442
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:04,450
They used to make me aware of the jacket.
They got me all these beautiful suits.

2443
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:08,020
They had them custom made from my bridge.
Troll body.

2444
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:15,400
They fit great. You always have to
wear long sleeve shirts. No, I just do.

2445
02:32:15,450 --> 02:32:17,890
I don't know. It's just, I
don't want to be distracting,

2446
02:32:18,490 --> 02:32:21,550
so I don't want to show tattoos.
That's why I wear long sleeved.

2447
02:32:21,551 --> 02:32:23,980
Mostly on stage too.
It's just distracting.

2448
02:32:23,981 --> 02:32:27,460
It's one more thing for
people to think about. Damn.

2449
02:32:28,390 --> 02:32:31,960
What's he saying? He's all caught up
to look at it and left eye. Holy Shit.

2450
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,433
I go,
no.

2451
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:40,553
Wow.

2452
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:44,760
Well, Hey folks, uh, what a fucking
fight. What an awesome card.

2453
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:47,490
So a powerful,

2454
02:32:47,491 --> 02:32:51,600
Phil Davis does a big victory
for Phil Davis. Yeah, I was huge.

2455
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:54,690
He looked like a monster. That was
like the best Phil Davis of all time.

2456
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:58,160
Especially after that last
performance with that. Yeah.

2457
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:02,670
Fucking amazing.
Returning really throwing leg kick fan,

2458
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:06,660
although did not throw that many. I
mean he got lit up, but some of his own,

2459
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,690
I mean of a Mendez is right off the back.

2460
02:33:08,691 --> 02:33:13,691
But this was a fucking test man
and he survived a really motivated,

2461
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:17,520
really well trained Chad Mendez.
But what a fucking close fight.

2462
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:18,720
What a great fight

2463
02:33:24,110 --> 02:33:25,280
it just stained division,
man.

2464
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:28,570
I don't even know how he can say he
thinks he deserved to win, you know?

2465
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:30,800
I mean he won.
You know what,

2466
02:33:30,801 --> 02:33:34,550
why I say I think I deserve to
win your you fucking one man.

2467
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:39,920
It wasn't based, I guess so.
I mean, it was a close fight,

2468
02:33:39,921 --> 02:33:43,110
but Connor, everybody in this
room thinks that he wants. Right.

2469
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,940
But isn't that kind of a common
thing when someone walks away?

2470
02:33:46,941 --> 02:33:50,120
Way more damage than
the other. Yeah, sure.

2471
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:54,670
But you know that damage can come from one
exchange, right? Yeah. Like, um, Chris,

2472
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:58,100
Jerry, when he beat that,
uh, that provide Niqab Guy,

2473
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:00,770
he got lit up in the first round closed.

2474
02:34:00,860 --> 02:34:04,780
I almost completely shut and then outboxed
him for the remainder of the fight.

2475
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:08,750
You sit in a tremendous, tremendous job.
And some people have more scar tissue.

2476
02:34:08,751 --> 02:34:13,130
Some people take damage along. Worse
than now. There's from Leiter's strikes.

2477
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:20,130
José although mother fucker right there,
that's the motherfucker.

2478
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:22,570
What do you guys think in
the pound for pound thing?

2479
02:34:22,571 --> 02:34:25,660
Like he used to get tossed
around as being as possible.

2480
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:30,550
Do you still think he is after this fight?
Number one pump them. Really? Yeah. No,

2481
02:34:30,551 --> 02:34:33,940
that's what you think Joe. No, no.
I think it's probably mighty mouse.

2482
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:38,530
I really do. I mean, I think mighty mouse,
yes. She's better than mighty mouse.

2483
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:41,230
He hit my car might be better
than mine if you beat him.

2484
02:34:41,231 --> 02:34:44,020
I really think that you probably
deserve pound for pound best.

2485
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:47,770
I just think that if I look at
technique for technique, okay.

2486
02:34:47,771 --> 02:34:50,170
And I look at what he's been
able to pull off in title fights,

2487
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:55,480
he's like flawless. You know, I think
there's other guys fighting tougher guys.

2488
02:34:55,481 --> 02:34:56,920
He might be right. And
there's, that's the,

2489
02:34:56,950 --> 02:35:00,370
that's the thing about like 2005 and
that's why Jones comes into Jones.

2490
02:35:00,610 --> 02:35:04,870
Jon Jones, Jon Jones, he
is maybe it real quick.

2491
02:35:04,871 --> 02:35:08,110
You put all those guys in the room and
came back and twist everyone's heads off

2492
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:11,860
and don't even don't, I hate when people
put Rhonda in their pound for pound.

2493
02:35:11,861 --> 02:35:16,240
God will put Ron's house category.
It's hard to do it with a woman.

2494
02:35:16,241 --> 02:35:19,300
I don't agree with that at all.
I think pound for pound,

2495
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:20,800
she's number one of all time.

2496
02:35:20,830 --> 02:35:25,050
And then how about women ever to walk the
face of the planet? She's number one on

2497
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:27,923
the list.

2498
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:32,230
There should be anyone else is probably
some crazy Mongol bitch though from like

2499
02:35:32,231 --> 02:35:33,064
1220

2500
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:41,140
pound for pound bales there
a few males and females.

2501
02:35:41,141 --> 02:35:43,780
That shit ain't fair.
Ronda Rousey's the ultimate chick ever.

2502
02:35:43,781 --> 02:35:46,480
And I agree that puts her on that power.

2503
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:50,500
The pound for pound means that weight
doesn't matter. You know what I mean?

2504
02:35:50,501 --> 02:35:54,430
But I but male put Ronda
Rousey in there with Hanan.

2505
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:59,140
Barao he was so crazy. Do you have any
idea what TJ would do to her? It's silly,

2506
02:35:59,210 --> 02:36:00,043
man.

2507
02:36:01,810 --> 02:36:06,630
And so this is about, but we're
talking to and morale would beat.

2508
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:10,150
We're talking around about pound for
pound. They're the same weight. Yeah.

2509
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:14,260
Do you see that fight would be,
there would be a ruthless wife beating,

2510
02:36:14,470 --> 02:36:17,420
which would be

2511
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,700
horrible if you go pound for pound.

2512
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:23,200
Are you talking about the
toughest man in the world?

2513
02:36:23,201 --> 02:36:26,430
It's usually the heavyweight champ,
which Jon Jones, I rolled with Rhonda La.

2514
02:36:26,470 --> 02:36:29,740
Oh No, no, no man. They had to roll
together. It's a different scenario,

2515
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:30,670
but they don't,

2516
02:36:30,671 --> 02:36:34,480
they have to MMA fight and when you're
talking about kickboxing Hanan Barao can

2517
02:36:34,481 --> 02:36:39,310
do shit you can't do,
it's not going to go,

2518
02:36:39,311 --> 02:36:40,750
but look,
he's a man.

2519
02:36:40,810 --> 02:36:45,490
He's a strong man and he can
fucking kick ridiculously hard.

2520
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:47,770
He can punch ridiculously hard.

2521
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:51,130
He can hit you with a standing
knee like a front kick.

2522
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:52,330
He can see you in the face.

2523
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:56,610
She might or she might wake up
with a flashlight in her face. Be

2524
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:02,670
Stupid to include women.
And she says that by on,

2525
02:37:03,070 --> 02:37:04,480
Rhonda says that,
by the way.

2526
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:07,690
I know they asked her and she's like a
woman fighting a man. It's ridiculous.

2527
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:11,380
It's just stupid and it is stupid.
It's solely no hanky.

2528
02:37:11,381 --> 02:37:14,410
Brian Stann Hanky Goldie
wins goes. No, no, I see.

2529
02:37:14,411 --> 02:37:17,090
I give Brian Stann the wind cause
Goldie has that three piece suit on.

2530
02:37:17,091 --> 02:37:20,300
I hate the three. Which one
has more makeup? That's the
real question. Go. Sure.

2531
02:37:20,301 --> 02:37:24,350
Goldie. Oh the three pieces. She
needs a nap in a drink of water guys.

2532
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:30,600
Conor McGregor is next
while now ever, right? Yeah.

2533
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:32,930
If he beats Dennis Seaver
and Dennis Seavers.

2534
02:37:32,931 --> 02:37:36,740
No fucking pushover tennis sneakers. Got
that sneaky front. Like roundhouse kick.

2535
02:37:36,741 --> 02:37:41,330
Good match for beats frank.
Yeah, it's shorter. It competes.

2536
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:42,200
Look,

2537
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:47,200
if cub beats Frankie by substantial
margin or Frankie beats cub by substantial

2538
02:37:47,631 --> 02:37:51,410
margin, like whether by decision
submission or knock out,

2539
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:56,170
they probably, in my opinion are
ahead on the ladder. Dylan profitable.

2540
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:58,940
Miss Connor puts ass is in seats.

2541
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:02,180
That's why you saw his fucking picture
and he's hanging out with Dana white down

2542
02:38:02,181 --> 02:38:05,870
there in Brazil and a lot of people like
that. Here we go, Swanson and Edgar.

2543
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:09,080
This is my opinion.
This is the real number one,

2544
02:38:09,081 --> 02:38:11,450
number two title fight
and a contender fight,

2545
02:38:11,451 --> 02:38:14,270
but it doesn't mean that I don't think
that McGregor is up there with them.

2546
02:38:14,271 --> 02:38:17,780
I think he definitely is. But here
we're looking at a guy like cub Swanson.

2547
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:22,840
It has a fucking litany of broken
bodies in the UFC to his career.

2548
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:25,550
I mean, he's looking at what
he did to Dennis Seaver.

2549
02:38:26,470 --> 02:38:29,300
If Connor Beats Dennis Seaver. Okay,
that's great. That's a good fight.

2550
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:34,370
Look up what cup did to Dennis Seaver
cub lit Denisey were on fire come most

2551
02:38:34,590 --> 02:38:36,980
[inaudible]. I know. He's fantastic.

2552
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:42,380
Frankie Edgar's a motherfucker and he
never stops moving. He cuts crazy angles.

2553
02:38:42,381 --> 02:38:43,760
He's got ridiculous wrestling.

2554
02:38:43,970 --> 02:38:46,730
He's got more heart than any fucking
human being that's ever walked the face of

2555
02:38:46,731 --> 02:38:47,450
the planet.

2556
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:49,940
He workcover's covers better from a
beating than anyone I've ever seen in my

2557
02:38:49,941 --> 02:38:53,210
life. It's not about that though, is
it's not about Connor's entertaining.

2558
02:38:53,211 --> 02:38:55,610
People on seem fight.
So then he just had the title shot.

2559
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:58,280
But how about this in New Jersey,

2560
02:38:58,430 --> 02:39:03,430
Frankie Edgar versus Conor Mcgregor for
the number one to 10 that's slam dunk.

2561
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:12,950
That shit.
Do that Shit in New Jersey or even better.

2562
02:39:12,951 --> 02:39:16,700
You do it in Dublin, you
know, fucking soccer stadium

2563
02:39:18,530 --> 02:39:21,740
dub. They didn't even have to fight
for the title. You know what you do?

2564
02:39:21,741 --> 02:39:24,750
This is what you do, man. You'd
go to Josie. Aldo don't go. Uh,

2565
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:29,040
I heard you hurt your foot.
Fucking

2566
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:33,500
thousands. Can you just
say, Hey, listen, my film,

2567
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:35,420
we're talking about an interim title.

2568
02:39:35,421 --> 02:39:39,680
We're not talking about the
real title is peeling off cash.

2569
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:42,820
Can Juliana white should fucking shit
everybody throw your cell phone in the

2570
02:39:42,821 --> 02:39:45,160
bucket and we'll go into
this room and shut that door.

2571
02:39:45,890 --> 02:39:50,720
Joey Diaz doing Conor McGregor was a cock
sucker. I'm the number one contender.

2572
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:52,940
I put asses in seats.
I'm the guy.

2573
02:39:53,230 --> 02:39:57,920
Nobody wants to see you fucking
faggy. So cal Caltech tools. Oh,

2574
02:39:57,921 --> 02:39:59,780
I like palm trees.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2575
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:05,630
I'm from Dublin motherfucking
island. Okay, you're from California.

2576
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:07,700
He's sitting in the fucking Hov Lane.

2577
02:40:07,701 --> 02:40:10,630
And Electric car got stuck
on a horse on a horse.

2578
02:40:11,150 --> 02:40:13,620
It's raining out all day and I'm drunk.

2579
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:18,700
I'm a number one contender dog, or I'm
going to fucking fill up a soccer stadium.

2580
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,490
That's what he would say. But Joey would
be, he would leave after he said that.

2581
02:40:29,491 --> 02:40:33,030
Why you were laughing? Fuck this
shit. Fuck up the door. He would,

2582
02:40:33,031 --> 02:40:34,230
we would be hanging
around the comedy store.

2583
02:40:34,231 --> 02:40:37,010
He would say some shit like that and
they just walk away on the punch line.

2584
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:40,620
Just walk away. He's like, you just,

2585
02:40:40,621 --> 02:40:44,360
it was just a such a master showman.
Walk away on punchlines.

2586
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:49,470
Well this fucking podcast is over
folks. Yeah, Josie all goes to shit.

2587
02:40:49,471 --> 02:40:52,530
Chad Mendez is a motherfucker
that was a goddamn awesome.

2588
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:57,820
Phil Davis came back strong tonight.
You'll Bagby five in a row,

2589
02:40:57,830 --> 02:41:02,560
son. Okay. What do you guys think about
hunt and verb? What about that shit?

2590
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:04,210
Doom.

2591
02:41:04,210 --> 02:41:09,210
The deadly and elevation 7,500 feet.

2592
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:14,340
If you remember when any UFC fight ever,

2593
02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:17,520
and if you remember mark cut fight in
Denver and we fought Rothwell yeah.

2594
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:19,470
Might have been the worst
heavyweight fight in history.

2595
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:23,740
They won't come back to
Denver, but heavyweights on
the car do so bad. Wait, title,

2596
02:41:24,010 --> 02:41:27,660
heavyweight title hold. You have
three weeks. Oh, you weigh 305 pounds.

2597
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:31,140
That's everybody division right now.
He's got to lose so much weight to,

2598
02:41:31,141 --> 02:41:34,050
he's got to lose 30 pounds.
You're crazy.

2599
02:41:36,300 --> 02:41:39,230
Just fucking,
I like just seeing hunting when well,

2600
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:43,050
but also like every day
if we're doomed wins.

2601
02:41:43,051 --> 02:41:45,660
He speaks really good Spanish.
They reschedule it again.

2602
02:41:45,661 --> 02:41:50,010
He fights in Mexico against
Kaine. I mean, God, Hey,

2603
02:41:50,011 --> 02:41:53,610
if King Cup comes back, they're
going to get my mail again with cane.

2604
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:58,080
I think they want to learn to gamble.
It depends on how well this card does.

2605
02:41:58,110 --> 02:42:00,960
This card does really well in Mexico.
It sells really well,

2606
02:42:00,961 --> 02:42:03,750
but now the problem is canes,
not the headliner anymore.

2607
02:42:03,930 --> 02:42:06,370
They even said like Dana
White said publicly like,

2608
02:42:06,390 --> 02:42:11,100
we can't go to Mexico without cane and
Diego's hurt to go to the big draw this

2609
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:15,720
out. So Diego's out by Amazon.
The other, the Mexican kid.

2610
02:42:15,810 --> 02:42:19,160
What's his name? Eric Perez. I don't know.

2611
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:25,680
I went, God, is he out too? I
don't think he's that bomber,

2612
02:42:25,681 --> 02:42:29,490
man. All these guys getting injured,
but it's just the weight division. Oh,

2613
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:33,610
big ball. He travels Brown.
What's up? What's up?

2614
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:36,810
This is what I wanted to ask you
guys about you two guys especially.

2615
02:42:36,811 --> 02:42:40,220
What did you think and get the soft,

2616
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:45,370
what did you think about the only thing
that's a situ situation that was really

2617
02:42:45,781 --> 02:42:50,430
weird. I got popped allegedly
for high growth hormone. Right.

2618
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:54,660
And then they say that
the test is ridiculous and
there's a bunch of people who

2619
02:42:54,661 --> 02:42:58,140
weighed in on it that are apparently
experts in the protocol and the way

2620
02:42:58,141 --> 02:43:02,010
everything was handled and then the UFC
for the first time ever rescinded it.

2621
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:03,930
If it doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

2622
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:09,060
It's tough enough to really get that
picture of come lean like, oh wow. Yeah,

2623
02:43:09,061 --> 02:43:11,230
you're not on protein in,
you know what I'm saying?

2624
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,410
Cause he's in his forties and he never
looked for them. We've seen that picture.

2625
02:43:14,411 --> 02:43:15,244
It's insane.

2626
02:43:15,490 --> 02:43:17,440
He makes like one of those grill as
they should brought up there and all of

2627
02:43:17,441 --> 02:43:21,640
those aims jacked and shredded it.
Just pause for the HGH.

2628
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:25,980
But he also got his ass whooped, but he
didn't get to do have you work for HGH?

2629
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:30,430
He tested for elevated human growth
hormone levels and they don't have a

2630
02:43:30,431 --> 02:43:32,380
baseline for him.
That's the problem.

2631
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:35,530
They don't have like people have weird
and dodginess levels of all sorts of

2632
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:38,760
hormones. There's certain people that
like, like if there was a reason why Pete,

2633
02:43:38,761 --> 02:43:40,360
some people were depressed,
why are they depressed?

2634
02:43:40,361 --> 02:43:42,460
They have a bad low levels of serotonin.

2635
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:46,000
You know some people that have had head
injuries have low levels of testosterone,

2636
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:51,190
so he might just naturally have some
weird thing when he hits 40 gets super

2637
02:43:51,191 --> 02:43:55,360
shredded. It's on 20 pounds of muscle
and that's how it goes like it's true.

2638
02:43:55,361 --> 02:43:58,060
I'll look at the pictures of him.
See that's normal.

2639
02:43:58,061 --> 02:44:01,180
That's when he hit 40 we
all look like that man.

2640
02:44:01,210 --> 02:44:05,920
He does look retarded coming in the
next expendables live. He's done.

2641
02:44:05,921 --> 02:44:08,440
Kung Fu since he was three.
That doesn't look like a real APP.

2642
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:11,800
If I had an APP like that,
I would quit working out forever.

2643
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:15,260
Just take pictures and shit.

2644
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,030
I did it. It's tiny. Made the best
tabs of all time. Suck it. I'm over.

2645
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:27,010
That's a best abs maybe ever. Right.
I'm not mad at him. He's a cutie pie.

2646
02:44:27,650 --> 02:44:32,020
No, but no bullshit. Have
there been better abs? No,
there's been different ABS.

2647
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:33,760
I agree. That's a set of ABS. That's not,

2648
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:38,150
that might be the best abs and MMA
fighter is ever exhibited. And Lee,

2649
02:44:38,151 --> 02:44:41,830
because he's such a kicker like that's
kicking is all your core and your abs.

2650
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:46,510
Your obliques to help them though. Did
it great if it's the Olympia. Yeah man.

2651
02:44:46,511 --> 02:44:50,320
Dude, he hasn't fought in a
couple of years and he fought
Bisbing who is a cardio

2652
02:44:50,321 --> 02:44:54,100
machine. Bisping has a 34 till you
have like a 38 beats per minute.

2653
02:44:54,690 --> 02:44:57,610
Look at that big brown,
a heavyweight with a 38 beats per minute.

2654
02:44:57,611 --> 02:44:59,440
Resting heart rate.
Same as Michael Phelps.

2655
02:44:59,510 --> 02:45:03,140
What was me in the pool swimming though?

2656
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:05,870
That's why his heart rate's so low.
Exactly.

2657
02:45:05,871 --> 02:45:09,060
He's just not even sure it's taking
a test. I hate that one. Happy.

2658
02:45:09,130 --> 02:45:13,060
But I was 37 yesterday, yesterday,
two days ago or 100 pounds. My friend.

2659
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:20,890
He just kept me. Nah, that's impressive
man. How much do you walk around that?

2660
02:45:20,891 --> 02:45:25,300
Seriously and not in fight shape.
Like 50. Oh that's not that small.

2661
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:29,590
So one 15 you dropped down
to one 25 how much water,

2662
02:45:30,130 --> 02:45:32,980
how much of his water with 10 12 pounds.
That's a lot though.

2663
02:45:32,981 --> 02:45:34,540
Your body weight per percentage.

2664
02:45:34,541 --> 02:45:36,180
You've got to think about it as
opposed to like a heavyweight.

2665
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:40,330
10 pounds ain't shit. But when you
get down to like one 25 10 pounds,

2666
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:43,900
I'll do
okay.

2667
02:45:43,930 --> 02:45:48,930
Got to Ireland at 18 over I think
high e but it was just like,

2668
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:53,070
it was the easiest kind of her hat
cause my diet and all this stuff.

2669
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:56,740
I mean I've got my super
tuned in everybody. This
company makes all my meals,

2670
02:45:56,741 --> 02:46:00,000
it's called the gorgeous mix.
My buddy makes all my meals fit.

2671
02:46:00,001 --> 02:46:04,760
It's 15 meals a week that are vegan and
then I eat meat because I am not um,

2672
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:09,980
Vegan, Vegan. I was going to make a
root cause they use sexual use. Gluten.

2673
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,920
I hear there's a lot of gay people
that like hot dogs. So I don't think,

2674
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:16,990
Oh shit I can do you.

2675
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:22,110
But do you eat gluten? I try not to. You
try not to. You try not to too, right.

2676
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:25,250
I uh,
I did gluten free from my last camp.

2677
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:28,810
I can feel that much of
a difference to the guy.

2678
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:31,460
Like you were either one of
you guys is burned off so much.

2679
02:46:31,461 --> 02:46:33,920
God Damn Glucose in a day.
You know,

2680
02:46:33,921 --> 02:46:37,280
you're burn off so much sugar that I
don't think it would hurt to have like a

2681
02:46:37,281 --> 02:46:38,540
little pasta in your diet.

2682
02:46:38,570 --> 02:46:41,720
I just don't think we're talking
about a regular person. Yeah.

2683
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:45,380
It's not that I think about a hippie.
I get some pasta maker gummy bears.

2684
02:46:45,381 --> 02:46:46,131
Before I hit miss thing,

2685
02:46:46,131 --> 02:46:50,510
I was like fucking Anderson Silva for
reals man and a bag of gummy bears.

2686
02:46:50,511 --> 02:46:53,330
Someone gave me a small bag of
gummy bears, right. For training.

2687
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:54,230
I don't know what it is.

2688
02:46:54,230 --> 02:46:58,160
Where their marijuana gummy bears or
where they gummy bears that like my candy

2689
02:46:58,190 --> 02:47:00,490
gummy bears, gummy
bears. I don't know. Oh,

2690
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:06,980
for before someone
gummy bears.

2691
02:47:06,981 --> 02:47:11,970
So just the sugar. You
need sugar sugar avenue.

2692
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:15,890
It's not bad to have some simple sugar
if you're working out the way you're

2693
02:47:15,891 --> 02:47:18,800
working out cause you're burning
off so much fucking calories.

2694
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:22,730
You got to think about just grappling
workout what your body feels like when

2695
02:47:22,731 --> 02:47:26,120
it's over it and they say the best thing
to drink is chocolate milk because it

2696
02:47:26,121 --> 02:47:28,830
has so many different things.
It has the case in the

2697
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:34,910
armory would know the ratios, especially
if you've got raw chocolate milk.

2698
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,740
Then you have the enzymes in
there to help break down the milk.

2699
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:41,810
Where do you get Rami Khouri response
because it's hard to break down when it's

2700
02:47:41,811 --> 02:47:43,300
pasteurized.
Yeah.

2701
02:47:43,301 --> 02:47:46,610
When you had raw chocolate milk that would
be so he's saying if I had a cow suck

2702
02:47:46,630 --> 02:47:47,463
the

2703
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:54,080
get you can get raw milk from some health
food stores like sprouts has pitch and

2704
02:47:54,081 --> 02:47:58,400
just take some on it. Protein now dude,
I'm telling you raw raw milk if you've,

2705
02:47:58,430 --> 02:48:00,590
if you're like a non a
non milk Trican person,

2706
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:03,670
I have a totally different reaction
between drinking regular milk and drinking

2707
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:06,230
raw milk. Totally different reaction.
I don't like any of that shit.

2708
02:48:06,350 --> 02:48:07,550
Raw milk just seems to have no,

2709
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:11,780
my body has no problem with
it and just digest milk.

2710
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:14,390
Milk is not milks weird fucking water,

2711
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:18,560
but it's not bad for your milky ass if
it's sweetened, unsweetened almond milk.

2712
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:20,600
Oh, that's sweet and gets
a lot of sugar. Dude,

2713
02:48:21,050 --> 02:48:23,240
Duncan Trussell call me up the
other day. He's like, dude,

2714
02:48:23,241 --> 02:48:27,890
I found the best thing almond milk. It's
so healthy. It's so good for you. I go,

2715
02:48:28,220 --> 02:48:32,510
I goes, it tastes really good.
He goes, yeah, I go, that's
sugar. And he goes, really?

2716
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:35,270
I go, look at the fucking look at
the label and he goes, oh my God,

2717
02:48:35,271 --> 02:48:38,740
18 grams of sugar per serving.
I go, yeah, sweet. Yeah,

2718
02:48:39,050 --> 02:48:42,050
you're drinking water like it.
Yeah, but usually if it tastes good,

2719
02:48:42,051 --> 02:48:45,040
it's sweet version.
Unsweetened tastes like ass.

2720
02:48:45,041 --> 02:48:49,370
Hold milk tastes like they just get a
little sour, but you can make your own.

2721
02:48:49,371 --> 02:48:52,490
It's really easy. All it is is you just
take raw almonds and you blend them up.

2722
02:48:52,491 --> 02:48:56,130
Same with making hemp milk. You take how
much you eat. Almonds and drink water

2723
02:48:58,370 --> 02:49:02,270
ossification actually creates the mill.
Right, but is there a benefit in that?

2724
02:49:02,271 --> 02:49:04,110
I'm also vacation like they better health,

2725
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:07,560
but I mean if you're making a smoothie
or something and you need the liquid and

2726
02:49:07,561 --> 02:49:08,550
you want to get that flavor

2727
02:49:10,060 --> 02:49:11,980
time than blaming up
all means on your own.

2728
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:15,070
Being one of those weird owns it's soaks
almonds and tries to get some of your

2729
02:49:15,071 --> 02:49:19,990
own almond milk. No benefit, no benefit.
Is this going to make you dig, wrote no.

2730
02:49:20,020 --> 02:49:23,260
It's going to make you smarter. No. Is
it going to help you recover faster?

2731
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:25,750
It's gonna remind you how awesome milk is.

2732
02:49:27,170 --> 02:49:29,470
Some coffee and cocoa pops at that shit.

2733
02:49:29,570 --> 02:49:32,270
It's raw milk guy like my
daughter has rheumatoid arthritis.

2734
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:33,673
Would it be good for them?

2735
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:37,340
Raw milk and milk or raw goat's milk
would probably be even better. Okay.

2736
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:41,000
You shouldn't pasteurize goat's milk is
way easier for your body to digest and

2737
02:49:41,001 --> 02:49:43,010
cows.
Yeah,

2738
02:49:43,011 --> 02:49:45,890
you want to limit the inflammatory
response and the problem with anything

2739
02:49:45,891 --> 02:49:49,130
pasteurized is it kills all the natural
enzymes that help you digest it.

2740
02:49:49,131 --> 02:49:52,910
So it's going to cause a greater
inflammatory response. So rob,

2741
02:49:52,911 --> 02:49:53,661
we'll help you out with it.

2742
02:49:53,661 --> 02:49:57,260
Is it about goat's milk that makes it
even when pasteurize more digestible.

2743
02:49:57,570 --> 02:50:00,860
Why goat's milk? Yeah, something with
the composition of the actual milk,

2744
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:05,990
human milk, goat's milk, human milk and
goat's milk or more closely affiliated.

2745
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:10,780
Then bovine milk, it's just a little
bit closer for whatever reason,

2746
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:15,620
come on down to the level of growth
hormone in it. Somebody was like, Yo dog,

2747
02:50:15,621 --> 02:50:17,260
can I get that breast milk?
You know what I'm saying?

2748
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:23,090
You'd think that'd be huge.
It's into the supermarkets,

2749
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:27,800
the human mouth.
This big ass last room is really great.

2750
02:50:27,801 --> 02:50:30,860
You mentioned that we were really taking
a hard look at that because that's the

2751
02:50:30,861 --> 02:50:33,050
first milk that comes out and
that's the most nutritious.

2752
02:50:33,051 --> 02:50:36,590
Every mammal produces colostrum and she
loses though when it breaks down into

2753
02:50:36,620 --> 02:50:37,640
like a powdered form,

2754
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:41,150
cause I know they sell like powdered
claustrum need to pour into smoothies and

2755
02:50:41,151 --> 02:50:43,370
shit,
but like what is that even really,

2756
02:50:43,730 --> 02:50:48,470
it's like a freeze drying process usually.
So I think you lose some,

2757
02:50:48,530 --> 02:50:52,520
but you still get a lot of you to do.
Right. Even with Greens or with anything,

2758
02:50:52,521 --> 02:50:55,340
once you break it down to a powder,
whatever benefit you get,

2759
02:50:55,341 --> 02:50:56,330
it might be substantial,

2760
02:50:56,331 --> 02:50:59,900
but it's definitely less than it would
be for fresh destroys nutrients more than

2761
02:50:59,901 --> 02:51:02,950
that process though. So it's
better than, you know. Yeah.

2762
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:08,840
That's rising it. So, so powdered is
better than heated generally. Yeah.

2763
02:51:08,841 --> 02:51:13,040
For most things. Wow. That's
weird. Right? Let's go eat.

2764
02:51:13,970 --> 02:51:16,970
Let's get something to eat. Can you
eat late slate? It's pretty late.

2765
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,073

The walls have ears. Big Brown would
lose his job. He tells a story.

2768

We have the best podcast of all time
or, but yeah. Well it would just,

2769

that's the way you go out in a blaze
of glory. Like God damn. Bon Jovi Song

2770
02:51:48,450 --> 02:51:48,770
staying.

2771
02:51:48,770 --> 02:51:53,170
Last question. Bisbing Rockhold no, no.

You gotta. You gotta you know I
trained with bisman. He's a beast man.

in shape all the time. All the time.

2774
02:52:02,430 --> 02:52:06,550

Right. That's what they do. Yeah,

2778
02:52:15,461 --> 02:52:18,040
but Bisping's used to it. Yeah.

2779
02:52:18,070 --> 02:52:19,840

2780
02:52:19,841 --> 02:52:22,540
the guy's giving me a response so I
can get fights. He's a journalist.

2781
02:52:23,680 --> 02:52:26,860
All of us want to fight more. So you
just talk some shit, Joe Civil. He goes,

2782
02:52:26,861 --> 02:52:28,660

that match up. There you go.

2783
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:31,220
When he talking shit to iron sheik,
make that shit happen.

2784
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,100
All these stories and shit.

in hand. It's all better now, right? Oh,

2793

And is that where it goes?

2794
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:16,380
I think that makes some sort of a fist
now as opposed to before poke straight

2795
02:53:16,821 --> 02:53:18,850
out and hit people with it.
