1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,840
There's a movie I saw the other day,

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,261
uh,

4
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,570
about these two prostitutes from
Amsterdam and there the roads,

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,290
they were like the
oldest prostitutes ever.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,303
Oh.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,490
And they said that they saw more
than 355,000 clients to date.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,871
And they're,

9
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:20,190
they're twin sisters.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:20,791
And there's,

11
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,110
uh,

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,480
uh,

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,171
oh my God.

14
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:22,751
Are you kidding me?

15
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:22,821
Yeah,

16
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,240
they just retired the other day,

17
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,001
but there's eight.

18
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:25,860
Just retired.

19
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,190
Yeah,

20
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,670
there's a,

21
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,930
there's a Netflix,

22
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,710
a movie all about them.

23
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:31,831
Uh,

24
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,730
documentary,

25
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,690
uh,

26
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,640
he's a Scooby Doo van
for sale on Craig's list.

27
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,570
Oh,

28
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,100
there's a lot of those because of the law.

29
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,210
When the movies came out,

30
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,081
this could be doing one,

31
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,201
two,

32
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:40,591
and three.

33
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,020
They had a bunch of these
like advertising vans.

34
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,580
So these ladies,

35
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,391
these ladies.

36
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,224
But anyways,

37
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,760
it was a really interesting,

38
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,540
uh,

39
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,900
uh,

40
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,740
documentary.

41
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,630
I can't think of the sea,

42
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,660
see if they say what it is,

43
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,021
but they're,

44
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:56,070
their name is Louise and Martine
focons in their sisters that had been

45
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,980
prostitutes for over 50 years.

46
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,940
And,

47
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,331
uh,

48
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,950
it was the most creepiest documentary
because they talked about how they didn't

49
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:06,240
really want to do it anymore.

50
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:06,741
They were kind of,

51
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:06,930
you know,

52
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,110
like,

53
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,861
I'm an old lady,

54
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,694
I don't want to do this.

55
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,730
But then they had to because they had no
other choice because they had no money.

56
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,740
And uh,

57
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,540
you said I was a little tired.

58
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,683
That's her quote.

59
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,321
I,

60
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,450
those are the [inaudible]
I was a little tired,

61
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,110
tired.

62
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,970
Luis told as it happens,

63
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,720
host Carol off in an interview
that aired March 18th.

64
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,120
The sister said that old age and
arthritis where the main reasons for their

65
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:34,954
retirement,

66
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,680
and I've written about their exploits
in the new book called the ladies of

67
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,514
Amsterdam.

68
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,360
That's how they would
walk down the street.

69
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,580
And the documentary was kind of cute.

70
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,480
Does cause there was
so such an old ladies,

71
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,910
you know?

72
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,760
Oh my God.

73
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,661
But it was awesome.

74
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,890
Really disturbing.

75
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,680
They look like dude's
pretending to be old ladies.

76
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,320
Like one of those theme
movies like Benny Pills.

77
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,531
Yeah,

78
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,730
they'd look Dustin Hoffman.

79
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,420
Yes.

80
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,631
Yeah,

81
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,464
they do.

82
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:57,901
Yeah,

83
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:58,710
they look fake.

84
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:58,891
Yeah.

85
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,020
Look to Benny Hills and dresses.

86
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,430
Their body just becomes like a
battleground and all the Siv,

87
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,330
HIV,

88
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,740
STD,

89
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,640
syphilis,

90
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,271
gonorrhea,

91
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:09,960
aids,

92
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,060
it all just battles it out
together for dominance,

93
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,343
see who wins.

94
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,290
And meanwhile she stays healthy.

95
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,570
She's tastes healthy cause
they didn't attack each other.

96
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,430
They don't even go
after the immune system.

97
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,290
I mean as if though your kids,

98
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,000
that's when it would really gross you out.

99
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,650
Imagine if you had a kid with a chick
and then you weren't really that into it

100
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,340
and you kinda like kept away from her
and laughed and didn't pay child support

101
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,790
and she went into property and then he
found out many years later that your kid

102
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,030
retired as the oldest
prostitute ever in Amsterdam.

103
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,830
You know,

104
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,101
man,

105
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,650
you want to talk about regret
at someone's a little girl.

106
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,601
That's someone's,

107
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:48,961
a little girl.

108
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,900
That was someone's little cute baby that
was so sweet and everything she said

109
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:52,740
was adorable.

110
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,581
Oh my goodness.

111
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,091
Look at her.

112
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,140
She's so precious.

113
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,420
Next thing you know,

114
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,190
it doesn't really end that well.

115
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,503
This story.

116
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,230
Well,

117
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,190
how did it end?

118
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,820
Well,

119
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,020
do you really want to hear the end?

120
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah.

121
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Well they became a prostitute for
50 years and soc 350,000 decks.

122
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,640
It was safe before.

123
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,703
No.

124
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,670
Yeah.

125
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,110
It's interesting when a culture like
drastically changes over a fairly short

126
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:22,770
period of time.

127
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,250
I used to go to Mexico and we
just go to the spring break thing.

128
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,250
MTV in like the late nineties you know,

129
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,560
maybe like to name names late,

130
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,390
maybe even the early two
thousands it was like no big deal.

131
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:33,631
Yeah.

132
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,400
Why was it was it was for fear factor.

133
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,361
The grind.

134
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:36,601
Yeah.

135
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:37,100
Me,

136
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,960
you and Eric were on the ground together.

137
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,500
We used to get our pump on,

138
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,140
taught me how to shave my chest.

139
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,840
I believe all of this totally right.

140
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,621
Yeah.

141
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,454
Were dance partners.

142
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,000
We're,

143
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,420
we're,

144
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,910
we're going to be the first gay
couple on dances with the stars.

145
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:51,744
We're going to come on and go.

146
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,321
He's going to help me.

147
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,160
You guys fuck each other honest with you.

148
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,073
For how long?

149
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,741
For how long?

150
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:58,560
Like an hour or I could watch
that longer than the head cutting.

151
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,271
What'd you get?

152
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:00,961
You Watch two guys?

153
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:01,650
Fuck.

154
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,940
Easier than it had ever seen.

155
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:03,301
Two guys.

156
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:03,880
Fuck you.

157
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,713
Still time.

158
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,990
I find that hard to believe why?

159
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,090
You mean in real life or on the Internet?

160
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,740
I've never even watched
it on the Internet.

161
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:10,961
Well,

162
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,650
pull it up for it,

163
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,270
Brian.

164
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,103
All right.

165
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,393
Yeah.

166
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,481
Okay.

167
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:18,780
Well,

168
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,201
so Brian,

169
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:22,270
the only way this is gonna work
is take the monitor and um,

170
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,910
don't upstream downstream the show and
then on that screen over there you need

171
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:27,591
to show two guys.

172
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:27,791

00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,220

00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,550

well my rap name be,

199
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,100
I always felt like if we're
going to have a nickname,

200
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,810
you can't really nickname
yourself like that.

201
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,480
That's annoying is you can always tell
when someone tried to push their own

202
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,210
nickname.

203
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,960
Do I say introduce you as their nickname?

204
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,690
She was fuck to call me
shrooms and my volleyball team.

205
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,270
It didn't really catch on shrooms.

206
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,780
Shrooms.

207
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,170
I know that you've done,

208
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,100
you've made your own nickname up.

209
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:21,240
It means you have no friends.

210
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,290
That's the only thing it means.

211
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah,

212
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,180
it doesn't make any sense.

213
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,290
Other than that they were crazy person.

214
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,480
Crazy person.

215
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,841
Hey guys,

216
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,110
I'm going to be t rex.

217
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,490
You know,

218
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,900
cause I'm always talking like this.

219
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,253
Yeah,

220
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,790
the fighters,

221
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,541
it's hilarious.

222
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,670
Fighters come up with some
of the silliest nicknames.

223
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,533
Power,

224
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,620
they have to stick with it

225
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,500
and it's there forever.

226
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,161
Well No,

227
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,640
some guys change like a Rory Macdonald.

228
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,350
He used to call himself the waterboy.

229
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,830
Yeah.

230
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,640
And then he changed his to Aries.

231
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,340
Aries God of war,

232
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,060
right?

233
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,181
Yeah.

234
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,580
It's kind of interesting where
you're allowed to change your name,

235
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,603
change

236
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,490
being the waterboy,

237
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,290
but now I feel more like the god of war.

238
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Oh,

239
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,193
okay.

240
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,260
Just do whatever you want.

241
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,920
Ah,

242
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,090
I million people is that people
fucking [inaudible] it's,

243
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,290
you know what?

244
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,560
They fucking right there because he just,

245
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,720

246
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,070

247
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,253

248
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,601
You know what,

249
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,500
I maybe you're right.

250
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,150
Maybe I assumed it was going to be like,

251
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,193
take it away.

252
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,520
Right.

253
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,151
That's not cool.

254
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,620
We're not going to get an honest reaction.

255
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,550
As long as she's seen it.

256
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,890
Now we can say that we were
the first person to show it.

257
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
She goes,

258
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,001
oh,

259
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,170
she's looking right at it right now.

260
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:36,831
You know what?

261
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,551
It doesn't bother me.

262
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,370
She's looking right at it.

263
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,230
You just got it.

264
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

265
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,130
I honestly don't feel bummed out about it.

266
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay.

267
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,830
We're good.

268
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,131
We're good.

269
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,060
We'll get to the sex.

270
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,660
No,

271
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:44,721
no,

272
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,110
no.

273
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,710
That's enough.

274
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,600
It's not bothering me.

275
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
It's honestly not bothered.

276
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,610
[inaudible] they're blowing each other
like two gentlemen who might erode their

277
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:52,851
mouth.

278
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,740

282
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,130
I,

283
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,431
you know what?

284
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,870
I didn't see them penetrating each other.

285
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,010
That might've been a different vibe.

286
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,680
I didn't mind that 69.

287
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,320
Yeah.

288
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,801
We need to get,

289
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,161

295
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:07,680

296
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,110

297
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,944

298
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,260
