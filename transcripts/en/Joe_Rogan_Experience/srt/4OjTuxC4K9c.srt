1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,570
Get ry four,
three,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,763
two.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,590
Who won?

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,270
Ah,
and what lively's gentlemen,

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,380
let's go champ.
Shout out to Shannon,

6
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,920
the Canon Briggs.
Shout out to the flat earth.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,200
Shout out to young Jamie for being a
newfound believer and

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,280
it shut off

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,113
to chill on Dudley.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,970
I'm handing it back,
but my brother,

11
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,710
thanks for coming with me man.
We have fun.

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,830
We just got back from a wild pig hunt,
ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
So if you're a super not into killing
animals is super not into eating animals

14
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,990
or hearing people talk about eating
animals,

15
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,660
now's definitely the time to shut this
one off.

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,970
I get it.
We'll talk about,

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,290
I'm sure we'll talk about fitness or
something good about food for sure.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,870
Our tree life beverages.
Um,

19
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:49,860
yeah,
health.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,730
I ate nothing but garbage over the last
two days.

21
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,440
Just straight.
Great and good food too.

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,250
Like uh,
they,

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,730
they cook good for us there but I corn,
no,

24
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,140
not corn flakes.
Raisin brand.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,100
So sugary was little delicious dude.
You murdered later.

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,320
I thought it was in like,
I dunno,

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,770
I thought I was in a,
in a frat house there.

28
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:18,090
The way you're going through raisin
brand and Fritos and I'm a mess.

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,420
You know I didn't have to feed us,
but I had a lay's potato chips,

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,640
like potato chips.
I did knock down,

31
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,310
I knocked down a pack of m cool ranch
Doritos.

32
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:31,140
They weren't how I remembered him when I
was when I was like 11 and those came

33
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,280
out.
They were the greatest thing of all

34
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:33,300
time.
They were,

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,220
I don't know,
something happened to them.

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,540
You know what I think as you get older,
when you're a young kid and you eat

37
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,630
something terrible for you,
like a Ding Dong or ring ding,

38
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,740
you know those things they see,
they feel so good when you're eating

39
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,120
them.
They feel so good.

40
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:52,320
Like the idea that you could just take
that white plastic wrap or rip it open

41
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,550
and that chocolate delicious hockey puck
with the cream inside of it was there.

42
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,840
Oh,
you didn't give a fuck about your house.

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,080
You're like,
I'm going to eat this thing right now,

44
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,810
and he gets so excited.
But as you get older,

45
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,610
and we talked about that this weekend
used,

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,950
you kind of recognize what's happening
when you do something more like you're

47
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:14,320
more in tune with like what nutrients
you're putting in your body and what,

48
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,350
what their effect has on you.
Oh yeah.

49
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,120
Big Time.
And you start to,

50
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,490
it's funny how your taste buds change.
I recently started liking onions and

51
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,510
didn't and mushrooms and they were the
only two things I did not like it all.

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,730
You remember when you were asking me
about the morels and you couldn't

53
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:31,290
believe that I didn't like Morel
Mushrooms.

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
I actually had some mushrooms in a,
um,

55
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,580
some type of an oriental dish.
And also I'm like,

56
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,330
what the heck it tasted for the first
time when I tasted a mushroom,

57
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:46,710
it didn't just tastes like mush.
It literally had a flavor.

58
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,030
So I've included them on my meals,
like if I'm at a steak restaurant or

59
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:55,530
something and I genuinely are liking the
taste of mushrooms now.

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,390
Weird.
Like your tastebud shifted.

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,890
I think it happens all the time.
Or boy,

62
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,310
Harry,
he just also now know or started really

63
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,050
liking green peppers.
Whoa.

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,440
Yeah,
no where it's a mystery.

65
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,510
It is a mystery.
He said,

66
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:11,110
I,
if I've always wondered like what?

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,290
When people enjoy something that's
really strange,

68
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,610
like in Iceland,
they have this really bizarre pickled

69
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:23,020
shark that is supposed to be atrocious
for everybody,

70
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,510
but people from Iceland it,
well,

71
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,750
it sounds like pickled herring.
Every something way more intense.

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,430
It's supposed to be like really intense
like shark.

73
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,920
It's like a fermented,
see if you could find it,

74
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,170
Jamie.
It's supposed to be levels,

75
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,400
right?
Gusting.

76
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,000
I mean,
what do you think when you hear blood

77
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,730
pudding,
you intro,

78
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm out.
See,

79
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,800
and there's people,
I've got friends in England that love,

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,350
they love blood pudding.
Well,

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,920
they're in the sausages,
you know,

82
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,290
like blood sausages.
I've had that.

83
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,160
They love it though.
We have our own dean on eating Icelandic

84
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,290
delicacy,
fermented shark.

85
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,250
Never forget an Anthony Bourdain had,
if he had to go there to try that.

86
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,080
If he says never again,
never again did.

87
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,190
It's interesting because people have
shifted how they feel about sharks.

88
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,240
Yeah,
I have as well.

89
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
I've had Maaco,
but people have shifted how they feel

90
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,190
about it.
What is this right up there with

91
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,290
airplane food in Nambia and ward hog
rectum according to CPS.

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,640
He's hilarious.
That's so funny man.

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,030
What have weird things.
So they figured out some way to make

94
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,370
shark tastes just disgusting and they
like it.

95
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,760
They really enjoy it and if they want to
claim it will give them that.

96
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,680
I know,
but what the fuck is going on in their

97
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,514
head?
Like did,

98
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,460
I just would,
um,

99
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,630
I would love to see,
look we can assume that you taste things

100
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,150
the same way.
I taste things that can't be the case

101
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,560
cause I like things that people hate.
Like I like certain hot foods that some

102
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,470
people just despise.
Like how the fuck do I know what they're

103
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,210
experiencing?
That's very weird.

104
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,880
One time Sharon and I were out to
Fuddrucker's the hamburger place and her

105
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:07,881
mom was there and uh,
we were doing the machine and Sharon's

106
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:12,420
like she was putting in like the cherry
part of Cherry coke cause you select

107
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,550
your flavor.
So right.

108
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,300
The chair,
she literally made this cherry coke and

109
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,730
her and her mom's like,
what was that?

110
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,050
And she goes,
Cherry coke.

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,180
You never had cherry coach like Oh my
God,

112
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:24,030
that's disgusting.
While she says that she didn't have her

113
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:27,630
glasses on,
she literally pushes cherry coke and it

114
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,240
and she filled her cup with cherry coke.
So Sharon,

115
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,580
I kind of just looked at each other and
did this.

116
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:35,430
We went back and sat down and she was
like,

117
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,740
she went through her coke like that and
so she was just staring.

118
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,650
She didn't know it was cherry coke.
No,

119
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:44,400
when we were doing it she asked because
she saw the red but when she did it,

120
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,300
yeah she didn't have her glasses.
She selected that one.

121
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,690
Anyway.
So yeah about halfway through the meal

122
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:54,120
she's like,
oh isn't that coke just so good here

123
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:59,121
cause she's from England and we said
yeah it was cherry but she was totally

124
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:03,980
stand off because she couldn't mentally
put together cherry and coke cause she

125
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,990
had never tried it.
Maybe that's what it is.

126
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,540
When people say,
oh I hate venison.

127
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,610
Have they ever really had venison or at
least venison worthy eating?

128
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,980
Most people probably haven't.
It's,

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,010
I think it's probably really hard to get
someone to do it.

130
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,840
Right.
It's not commercially available.

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,640
It's probably,
um,

132
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,210
people have done it poorly and then you
get that weird,

133
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,230
I'm like a prejudice that a lot of
people have of it being Gamey,

134
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,580
right.
Quote Unquote Gaming.

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,500
Yup.
So untrue.

136
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,740
We uh,
we have uh,

137
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,110
a big yeti out in the back of the
vehicle loaded with very fresh organic

138
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,670
swine.
Yeah.

139
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,470
Wild pigs.
Pigs are,

140
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,570
it's a,
one of the weird ones that people,

141
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,030
some people are going to get upset if
you have anything,

142
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
but if you want wild pigs.
Why?

143
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,090
Like I have a very good friend who's a,
an agent.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,820
It's a very nice person.
And uh,

145
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,820
we were talking about hunting things.
She goes to do you hunt pigs,

146
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:06,060
you can hunt.
Pigs are ugly and she loves animals.

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,630
She loves them.
But her immediate response was like,

148
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,790
fuck those pigs.
It's weird.

149
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,980
It's weird.
Like that animal gets no,

150
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,620
it's,
it's so invasive that,

151
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,680
and people recognize it for some reason.
Like the way you look at it.

152
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,170
I don't want it to say that I don't have
love for them.

153
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,380
I think it was cool even looking at him
and we saw a lot of cool.

154
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,270
They're brilliant too.
It's fascinating.

155
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,210
I mean I was amazed at how smart they
were.

156
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,850
It's fascinating that,
did you send him that picture?

157
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,610
I put that on instagram.
Oh yeah.

158
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,140
That's awesome.
I didn't even see that.

159
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,180
I didn't have my cell phone didn't work
out there.

160
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
So this uh,

161
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,900
this is actually a female pig that you
and Steve stocked in on.

162
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:50,440
I was filming right where I'm standing
and you guys got so close and you could

163
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,740
hear baby,
you could hear piglets kind of

164
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,110
squeaking.
So you actually didn't you stand up with

165
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,610
your camera and take a picture of the
nest

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,030
and everything?
Yeah I did.

167
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,760
And it stood up like 13 or 14 feet in
front of us.

168
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,290
It was so close.
It was really close.

169
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,300
So it was like,
whoa.

170
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,830
You kept,

171
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,180
you're cool.
Most people would,

172
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,220
would lose it right there.
Cause they,

173
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,830
I mean,
you know the damage for those of you who

174
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,900
don't list or who are listening and
don't know,

175
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,570
uh,
uh,

176
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,450
wild boars,
extremely dangerous if they want to be

177
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,970
their cutters on their bottom teeth
cause they,

178
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,190
they pop their teeth and when they do
it,

179
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,810
they actually file that noise,
is them filing their cutters.

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,960
And have you ever felt the inside of a
big doors cutter?

181
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,690
I mean it's literally like a knife,
you know,

182
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,480
and they,
when they come by,

183
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,630
I mean one little hit on the inside of
your leg and that's fatal potentially.

184
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:46,510
It's

185
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,550
a beast of an animal.
They're enormous.

186
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,000
What's really crazy is that they were
brought here.

187
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,000
A lot of it was by that William Randolph
hearst guy,

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,160
that

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Kooky bastard that was so crazy.
The William Randolph hearst guy who was

190
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,900
the guy that citizen Kane is kind of
based on,

191
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,350
right?
Orson welles masterpiece.

192
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:12,351
Citizen Kane was based on this crazy guy
who also coincidentally a as the guy who

193
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,840
campaigned to make weed illegal.
He was the guy that owned hearst

194
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,150
publications.
And so he,

195
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,550
uh,
he had this idea in his head,

196
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,920
this is the story,
was that hemp,

197
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,870
they're starting to make paper out of
hemp.

198
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,470
And he was threatened and there was like
a popular science magazine and said,

199
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,380
hemp,
the new billion dollar corn crop because

200
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,200
he owned like these fields of hemp,
or excuse me,

201
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,080
these fields of trees they used to make
paper out of,

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,510
he owned paper mills and he own
newspaper.

203
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,680
So apparently his fear was in converting
everything to paper.

204
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:50,810
He would lose millions of dollars on all
his traditional trees that the user

205
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,910
paper.
So he started printing stories about

206
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:58,911
marijuana being this terrible thing and
that Mexicans and black men are raping

207
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,090
white women.
And people went,

208
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,730
what the fuck is this plot?
We've got to stop this right now.

209
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,290
And so they made the prohibition on
marijuana and it happened directly as a

210
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:11,370
result.
That's the conspiracy theory of him

211
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
wanting to stop a competitor in the
paper business.

212
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,720
So it's so hilarious.
This one crazy fuck also brought over

213
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,420
punch a wild boars and just let them run
loose so he could shoot them.

214
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,710
Yeah,
that will now Texas is,

215
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,190
well the most of the south central us is
just overrun with them.

216
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:30,420
People

217
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,750
both don't know.
And it's like a giant rat.

218
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,430
It's like it,
I mean,

219
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,310
I'm not probing,
there's nothing wrong with like,

220
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,200
we have like category categories and
categorizations of animals and like

221
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:47,040
nobody minds if you kill a bug,
but you get to a certain size thing like

222
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,480
people rat traps,
okay,

223
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,970
you gotta do what you gotta do.
You get bigger than a rat.

224
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,601
And people go,
Hey,

225
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,610
what the fuck are you doing?
Right.

226
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,700
And there's something weird.
You,

227
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,470
you get to like pigs and people go,
why are you killing pigs

228
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,350
honey?
What you said about coming into hunting,

229
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,530
what their acceptance level was and it
seems like for sure things that we

230
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:11,961
perceive as like ugly pigs,
like Turkeys look that way.

231
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,171
Um,
you know,

232
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,690
their heads are kind of,
they don't look that cool when you look

233
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,370
at them up close.
They've had good color.

234
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:21,330
But anyway,
it seems like Turkeys and pigs and even

235
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,310
if you,
if you both fish,

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,870
those are like entry level.
I'm shooting something that people,

237
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,340
that's kind of the segue is turkeys or
hogs.

238
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,810
Sharon.
Um,

239
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,910
my wife is from England,
had never hunted.

240
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,520
My boy had never hunted.
Their family,

241
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,220
had never been around hunting.
So when they came here it was a whole

242
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:46,221
new perspective of how many wild animals
are in you.

243
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:50,370
No one in society.
We almost hit several with our car when

244
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,800
we lived in Wisconsin and then they just
started,

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,140
you know,
they would just destroy any hopes of a

246
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,400
garden that we would have.

247
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,560
So Sharon started going out and filming
me on some hunts and one time we were on

248
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,100
a hunt,
Illinois and this dough comes running in

249
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,630
her tongue's hanging out.
Three bucks come behind her and these

250
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,440
books are like,
she's literally trapped between three

251
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,670
bucks and she's,
you know,

252
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:17,980
she's just wanting to get away or
tongues hanging out.

253
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:21,640
She's not ready yet,
but there's three horny bucks there and

254
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,160
she's just sitting there.
It's obvious they had been running most

255
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,950
of the day.
And then two bucks started fighting.

256
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,540
One buck came in,
kind of,

257
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,240
you know,
ended up kind of scooting her with his

258
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,000
horns.
And then they were just running her

259
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,210
Ragen and Sharon's like,
is that what the ruts like?

260
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:37,901
And I go,
yeah,

261
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:42,901
the males literally just run the females
until they're like,

262
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,700
have no choice but I have to breed right
now.

263
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:46,750
And then it happens.

264
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,090
And then they're like onto the next
lady.

265
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,140
So she pleases,
she says when she watched it,

266
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,690
she said,
so she goes,

267
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,140
if I were to get into deer hunting,
cause at that time the only thing she

268
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:02,740
had shot was a Turkey and then she
hunted,

269
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,010
um,
a wild hog and she goes,

270
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,720
so if I go hunting for deer and I
decided to do it,

271
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,190
she goes,
I would only want a buck.

272
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,540
And I said,
all right.

273
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,403
You know,
I was,

274
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,290
I was glad she had an open mind to it.
And she's like,

275
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,690
I feel like I'd be helping helping a
sister out.

276
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,480
She kind of said it a funny way.
She goes,

277
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,420
she goes,
that is like your friend at the bar.

278
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,850
And she went up to get two of you
drinks.

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,130
And now there's three dudes that like,
well I'm not leave you alone and you

280
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,310
like can't get back to your normal life.
And she's like,

281
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,820
I feel like it'd be helping a sister
out.

282
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,950
And I'm like,
Yep,

283
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,940
that's what you'd be doing.

284
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,980
I don't think people who live in cities
have any idea of how many deer there are

285
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,620
now.
If they went through Iowa,

286
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,200
like people went through your,
your area,

287
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,750
they would be like,
what the fuck?

288
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,810
It's like every,
every mile or so.

289
00:13:57,811 --> 00:13:59,580
You're seeing these packs of deer?

290
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,500
Well,
how many just ones did you see on the

291
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:03,090
side of the road that people would
struck?

292
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah,
quite a few.

293
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,700
You know,
and not,

294
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,100
not everyone is,
is uh,

295
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,290
lucky enough to just,
um,

296
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,240
hit a deer and that's it.
And you go to,

297
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,820
you go to the repair shop and they fix
your bumper.

298
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,040
Did I ever tell you about my dad?
No,

299
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,120
I didn't.
My Dad spent many years going through

300
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,530
orthodontics cause he always wanted
perfect teeth,

301
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,340
but he never had like the right type of
what you did tell me this never had the

302
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,830
right type of like insurance.
And stuff to do it.

303
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,730
So finally we get later in life.
He's in his right,

304
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,970
I think he went,
started braces when he was like 35 and

305
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,910
he finished it like 40.
Wore the retainer for two years,

306
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:44,820
like everything.
Next thing you know,

307
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:49,821
he's driving down the road and he had a
Honda civic driving down the road.

308
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,720
A buck runs out in front of the road,
he hits it,

309
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,670
the body of the deer comes through the
windshield into the passenger seat.

310
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,330
The horns came in and hit him right in
the teeth.

311
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,230
So he's got like,
I don't know if it's too,

312
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,050
every now and then he'll snag in front
of me and pull,

313
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,360
pull the ones out.
But yeah,

314
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,680
it was,
it was like,

315
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,820
it was the worst thing because all he
ever wanted was perfect teeth.

316
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,740
And like,
as soon as he had them right there in

317
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:22,160
his hand,
this crazy buck decides to commit

318
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,620
suicide and jumped through the window of
his Honda.

319
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,780
But the reality is that,
I mean,

320
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,740
that's what it's like.
I forget the numbers I was working on,

321
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,110
uh,
a book to try to,

322
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,130
um,
introduce some people in Europe to bow

323
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,360
hunting.
Um,

324
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,120
I wasn't trying to get it necessarily
legalized.

325
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I was just trying to give information on
why hunting in the u s is something that

326
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,640
people at least need to keep an open
mind to and why it's necessary.

327
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,370
And I was trying to write a book and
granted,

328
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,190
um,
for those of you who are listening who

329
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,740
aren't familiar with Joe and I release
our relationship,

330
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,740
um,
I shot competitively for a long time a

331
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:07,250
shot with the u s archery team.
I did a lot,

332
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:12,251
a lot of miles throughout all of Europe.
So a lot of my friends were really

333
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,260
sensitive to the fact that I was also a
hunter.

334
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,090
And then obviously,
um,

335
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,990
I met my wife on a plane to France,
her all of our family,

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,970
there's obviously from Europe.
So this is a subject to where I've tried

337
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,070
to,
you know,

338
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,060
explain it the way that I'm explaining
this now and you know there's,

339
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,480
there's such a difference between areas
that really need that as part of,

340
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,770
I mean it is population control.

341
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,510
Look at how many we were gone.
We were probably hunting what,

342
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:49,511
16 full hours and how many hogs do you
think we saw including the little ones,

343
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:52,250
which will all be breeding within six
months.

344
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,670
Right?
Every baby we saw right now can be

345
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:57,830
breeding in six months.
Is that right?

346
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:58,664
Yeah,
six months.

347
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,830
So I mean you think you'd do it twice a
year,

348
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:03,920
right?
So we saw at least that will,

349
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,740
that we saw that one sow that you
stocked on.

350
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,770
She had maybe eight right little guys.
And then when we went out at dark that

351
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,400
time,
how many ton of,

352
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:18,401
oh my gosh.
Let's just say we saw 30 total at least.

353
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,540
So within 60 days,
any of those six months,

354
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,870
any of those females will be able to
breed and then they're having six to

355
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,490
eight to 10 again,

356
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,990
animal man,
it's a weird animal.

357
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,980
It doesn't seem like it belongs there.
It's really strange like because,

358
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,760
because it's an invasive species,
you see how it's unbalanced.

359
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,690
They just make babies and go and make
babies and go and you've got a Whoa,

360
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,090
they got to like the [inaudible] ranch
keeps a wrap on it.

361
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,440
But some places where they get away from
like a ranch environment,

362
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,530
which is kind of ironic

363
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,160
because like in,
in some places like San Jose,

364
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,980
which have never had a problem with
wildlife at all,

365
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,000
other than the occasional deer,
they're getting wild pigs and once they

366
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:00,751
get in,
man,

367
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,660
whew,
you've got giant fucking

368
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,510
animals.
I mean they're,

369
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:09,720
it's a totally different kind of,
it's not like a squirrel to his big ass

370
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,400
animal.
It's running around eating people's

371
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,211
yards.
Well,

372
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:15,870
when they were brought here,
people had them on their farm to have a

373
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,950
continual replenishment of food.
It's not like they were growing them to

374
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,050
say we want to have this massive pig
farm.

375
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,520
They were growing them is that pigs were
great because you could eat on them

376
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:29,460
continually throughout the,
throughout the whole year.

377
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,200
Right.
And they continually reproduce.

378
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:35,910
But once they go out into the wild and
there isn't a family that's utilizing

379
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,540
that,
you know,

380
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,060
small batch of hogs or chickens or
whatever it is,

381
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,590
then they just go crazy.

382
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,630
Yeah.
Really crazy.

383
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:43,111
I mean,
what a,

384
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:48,111
what a bizarre animal to invade into an
ecosystem pig.

385
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,900
They're just so powerful.
Like we,

386
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:55,410
we look at them in a weird way.
He know they have like that bad

387
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,110
reputation because uh,
you know,

388
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,090
when,
when when someone calls someone a pig,

389
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,610
like if you call person a pig,
it's like one of the worst things you

390
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,850
can say to a person out of it that way.
I mean,

391
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,820
if you call someone a monkey dussel's
Yep.

392
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm the fucking dumb monkey.
That's me.

393
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,570
I'd say that.
You know,

394
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,300
if you called some someone at Gazelle,
they'd be psyched.

395
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,160
Right?
Dude,

396
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,140
you are a gazelle.
They'd be like,

397
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:19,860
yeah.
You think?

398
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,281
Yeah,
yeah,

399
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,500
yeah.
You're an animal that gets jacked by

400
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,120
lions.
Could I be,

401
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,520
what's my animal?
We're going to Avatar.

402
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:29,850
What's my,
you'd probably be some sort of primates

403
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,550
from a large primate,
like maybe an orangutan.

404
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,290
Something along those lines.
Really.

405
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,740
Did you ever see that movie,
which was the stupid movie where I'm

406
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,450
overweight.
They kind of just sit there.

407
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,640
It's one of my favorite kettle bells
that Orangutang.

408
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,810
Yeah,
I love that guy.

409
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,530
He's got to get it really good.
Yeah,

410
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,640
he does.
It seems like it'll all the primates.

411
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,260
That's the one that would fuck with you
the least.

412
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,700
Be like,
what's up dude?

413
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,680
How you doing?
I guess if I was the big guy that was

414
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:56,340
actually just kinda soft.
Which one would freak out the most of

415
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:58,410
primates?
Well,

416
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,650
I was going to give you a silver back,
but now that you say that,

417
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,460
I would say if I had to fear one thing
of the primates,

418
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,890
I don't know.
It could be like a freaking,

419
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,010
if baboons are bigger,
they could be pretty.

420
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:15,510
I mean if a Babin brain and temperament
was in a silver back

421
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,230
would be a monster.
Oh,

422
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:23,400
we had this discussion if like some of
these animals that are just,

423
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,430
this is what's weird.
People think we don't like animals

424
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,500
because we shoot him.
We actually appreciate him more.

425
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,030
Like,
I really think about,

426
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,260
I have so much respect for grizzlies,
you know,

427
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,380
in brown bears and then I see something
like a silver back and the strength of

428
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,030
those things.
And I think if,

429
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,580
if this was a society where everything
like fought for its turf and those two

430
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,990
met,
I mean,

431
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,070
yeah.
So

432
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,260
you think,
well,

433
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,850
what's interesting is I think he's
still,

434
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,470
there used to be bigger and bigger
animals than them.

435
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm talking died off.
Yeah.

436
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:58,060
Well we can relate to you.
The dinosaur thing would've been,

437
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,840
that would've been so cool.
What if you could short face bear?

438
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,150
You ever hear about that thing?
Ah,

439
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,010
I have machine.
That short face bear was enormous.

440
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:08,890
Bear that lived in North America has
apparently was fucking huge.

441
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:11,650
Bigger than a polar bear.
Ferocious Predator,

442
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,250
died out somewhere around,
I think they think 10,000 plus years

443
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,440
ago.
Well it ain't shit.

444
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,131
You know,
that's,

445
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:19,780
that's not that long ago.
Am I right about that?

446
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,240
Or is it a hundred thousand years?
Might be a hundred thousand years.

447
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,270
How big will find out when that thing?
Yeah,

448
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,980
it was enormous.
Enormous bear.

449
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,580
But did they know it was the face?
Yeah.

450
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
No,
it's the bones.

451
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,290
No,
it's the skull.

452
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,820
It had a totally different face.

453
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,300
That's the size of it.
Is that amazing?

454
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,540
So would they not know that was a polar
bear?

455
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,150
Well,
short face bear has a different skull.

456
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,610
That's what it looks like right up
there.

457
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,610
But it was bigger than a polar bear is
like the biggest bear ever by far.

458
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,700
They were fucking huge.
But that's my point.

459
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,860
He's like,
shit can just keep getting bigger and

460
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:54,910
bigger.
It competes.

461
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,400
And then look at people.
People are bigger now than they've ever

462
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,550
been before.
Thriller.

463
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,110
Throw a line main on that sucker.
Do have something that,

464
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,670
look at that.
That looks like the Predator.

465
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,150
Look at the face on that thing.
It's an enormous,

466
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,370
super bare.
That's right out of the Avatar.

467
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,430
Fuck that.
So the idea was it's a bad wolf.

468
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,880
Did they have like a wolf?
We haven't heard of her wolves,

469
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,190
weren't they the biggest,
that thing,

470
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,330
that short face bear.

471
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,480
Um,
there's this guy named Dan Flores and he

472
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:24,920
believes that that short face bear and
the [inaudible],

473
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,960
apparently a bunch of other people that
studied the migration of people into

474
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,270
North America,
they believe that Short,

475
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,750
that short face bear might have been one
of the barriers and it was so ferocious

476
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,790
and so fierce.
Could you love matching?

477
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
If you were a dude and his family and
you're walking from Asia to the United

478
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,160
States and you see one of those mother
fucker of motherfucker bears,

479
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
he'd be like,
what in the fuck am I doing here?

480
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,340
An enormous,
that's what you're saying for the,

481
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,460
for the border,
that's what we need everywhere.

482
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,120
Cages for Kiki kicked ourselves.
Guard.

483
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,850
The board is with giant Wolf dogs.
Oh my gosh.

484
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,460
That thing,
it's so much bigger than a polar boy

485
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,530
vampire or Werewolf.
It's always an underworld was a good

486
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:12,290
call.
Vampires,

487
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,180
vampires,
24,

488
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:16,360
seven c Werewolf's have to become
Werewolf's and then they have to go

489
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,140
back.

490
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,230
Leaves you vulnerable.
So many jacks you when you're not aware

491
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,810
of wolf,
it's like you're a bully for a couple of

492
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,240
nights out of the month and the rest of
the month your pussy.

493
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah.
Right.

494
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean that's really what the Werewolf
is.

495
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,870
There's a lot of people like that
and a werewolf.

496
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,590
It would be a really weird one if it was
real humanity.

497
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:38,500
If we had to like find out who the
Werewolf's swear and you have to make an

498
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,710
ethical choice to kill him when he was a
person or do you uh,

499
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,290
do you lock them up for a couple of days
a year cause it's done.

500
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,800
It's fall.
I Dunno.

501
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,310
A vampire

502
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,550
would be pretty cool.
I guess they say that mathematically

503
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,410
it's not impossible.
It's not possible.

504
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,050
If Vampire's couldn't exist cause
there'd be no people left,

505
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,810
but there's certain amount of time
there'd be no people.

506
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,560
Well that's,
that's a very logical way to put it.

507
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,550
Yeah,
it makes a ton of sense because you

508
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,280
would infect someone,
see you and I would like someone else.

509
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,200
You and I would like it because the
older we get,

510
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:10,340
the more we really realize what makes us
happy and what we like to do.

511
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,630
So imagine if right now you knew,
dude,

512
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm not,
I'm 50 but who cares?

513
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,030
Who Cares?
I know exactly what I want to do.

514
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:25,031
We could all be like a thousand and Jay
are still happening because you're just

515
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,740
endless now.
You know what I mean?

516
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,910
I definitely don't know what you mean.
I lost you somewhere in the middle of

517
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,744
that.

518
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,640
No,
you were just saying mathematically for

519
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,600
years and they live.
I'm just saying if for you and I we

520
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,570
enjoy our life.
For some people that I know that don't

521
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,520
enjoy their life,
that would be a nightmare.

522
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,670
The fact that they had to keep going and
keep going,

523
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,450
that'd be pretty pumped.
I think the thing about vampires,

524
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:53,750
they wouldn't work as mathematically.
If you're a vampire and you by Jamie,

525
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,850
Jamie becomes a van par and he bites
somebody else and you have to buy it

526
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:00,530
like a person a day.
Whereas the Werewolf,

527
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,840
it's only a couple of nights a week
where you're an asshole.

528
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,240
Like if there was like a cage and you're
like,

529
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,860
I feel it coming on.
It's like,

530
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,910
you know,
if a woman was like,

531
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,320
oh my God,
I know my period is coming,

532
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,630
the guy would be like,
we're getting really close to the full

533
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,100
moon.
I'm going to go check myself.

534
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,330
Then he checked yourself in one of those
big ass steel cages and then you turn

535
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:19,910
into a werewolf or a couple of days he
chill out.

536
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,770
You could maybe if you don't like if
you,

537
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,210
you locked up in a cage,
like it was like fasting and then when

538
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:29,240
you're fasting your body sort of starts
burning fat.

539
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,610
You lose your appetite,
you calm everything down.

540
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,280
Maybe that's what it's doing.
I've been doing with werewolves,

541
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,260
I've been doing that.
Not to change subject.

542
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,240
We can,
we can talk wearables more.

543
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,610
Um,
pull up the Irish elk,

544
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,890
Jamie that,
remember when I told you about that

545
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,450
thing?
That thing's cool too.

546
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,560
I wish that was back would.
That's a crazy looking at,

547
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,360
I mean the short face bear fuck that
short fixed.

548
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,760
Yeah,
but things scares the shit out of me

549
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,240
that thinks scares the shit out of me.
I don't think people understand how big

550
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:56,930
it is.

551
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,220
It's so much bigger than a polar bear.
It's essentially a real monster,

552
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,950
a real live monster,
and it was most likely,

553
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:07,830
ferociously carnivorous.
Would you if that is,

554
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,540
if that thing was still alive right now,
now out in random parts of the

555
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,300
wilderness,
would you hunt or the Irish shock if it

556
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,060
was viable population?
Talking about the short face bear.

557
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,550
No,
I wouldn't be in the book.

558
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,460
We've talked about,
fuck you man.

559
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,980
I have a hard enough time with wild
pigs,

560
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:26,000
dude.
I'm freaking out.

561
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,520
What are you doing?
Working out?

562
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,710
No Way.
I'm just thinking if I was,

563
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,990
if I was a kid,
you guys,

564
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,930
you went through the woods.
If I was a kid and I went through the

565
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:39,230
woods with my buddies and we accounted a
short face bear and eight,

566
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,420
one of my friends just right in front of
you,

567
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,740
you'd be like,
that's a monster.

568
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,130
Yeah,

569
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,560
well it would be for sure.
I'm just saying,

570
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,920
I know that when you and I talked about
Hawaii,

571
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,340
I said I would love to learn to surf
from Shane Dorian.

572
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,820
And you say,
I'm not surfing because of the sharks.

573
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,920
So monster soup,
it's the same.

574
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,430
It is the same.
They can go fuck themselves.

575
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,060
So people are crazy.
All you people so you wouldn't hunt if

576
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:10,260
they're short faced bears.
I'm bound freaking out by pigs,

577
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,540
man.
How close we got to those pigs.

578
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,180
Some rogue experience follower that's a
genetic specialist is probably going to

579
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,100
construct one of those suckers just so
you don't hunt anymore.

580
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,200
I don't think it'll work that way if
that's the,

581
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,010
they're really wasting their energy if
they put it towards that.

582
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,130
There's certain animals though that that
have to freak you out.

583
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,200
You have to respect them.
You know,

584
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:34,470
we were talking about all the different
encounters that people have had where

585
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,300
they were bluff charged by grizzlies.

586
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,250
Oh yeah,
we're talking about that this weekend.

587
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,310
Yup.
And Steve Rinella,

588
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,620
my good friend and the host of the
amazing podcast,

589
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,030
meat eater and television show meat
eater was uh,

590
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,970
they were on this hunt and they got
charged by these grizzlies.

591
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,630
It's a mama bear and her cubs and it's a
full on charge and this thing is big.

592
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,360
I mean,
I don't know how big is a 400,

593
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:02,850
500 pounds and they're bigger than that.
How big was shit?

594
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,380
Was it a brown bear or a grizzly?
Grizzly in like math,

595
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,080
Finland?
Yeah.

596
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:12,450
It could have been 600 maybe.
Whatever it was.

597
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,510
It was so big.
It was so big and it was covering ground

598
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,810
so fast.
Yeah.

599
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,380
Like when you see them Brian,
and you realize how big they are and how

600
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,450
fast they move,
you know like you know how fast they are

601
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,590
from like zero to their top speed,
they're are almost equal to a dirt bike.

602
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,690
She,
I think they can run 40.

603
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,750
Oh my God,
they can go like their torque ratio is

604
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,300
very fast.
If they're running,

605
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,630
they're going to catch you.
Oh my God.

606
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,580
I think if one was within 20 yards and
then started like with full intent to

607
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:50,880
come,
I think you would think about turning

608
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,970
and he would get maybe two strides and
that thing that thing's giving you the

609
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,670
Leonardo Dicaprio to the back.
Jesus Christ.

610
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,470
Yeah,
look up that.

611
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,890
What is the speed of those things?
You Know Adam Green tree,

612
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,470
he encountered one when he was in
Montana.

613
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,770
He had shot an elk and he was packing
the elk out by himself.

614
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,690
He was deep in the back country by
himself.

615
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,060
Yeah,
that was,

616
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,090
I think it was 12 plus miles in,
right?

617
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,590
Something like that.
Yeah.

618
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,920
She cuts off Adam.
Adam's an animal and so he goes in

619
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:21,720
there,
he shoots his elk.

620
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,750
That was wrong.
45 Oh,

621
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,100
it's even faster.

622
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,590
What's like speed of the speeding on the
residential street?

623
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,560
Yeah.
You couldn't go through a school zone on

624
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:38,561
the grizzly go zero to 45 times.
So Adam's packing his grizzly,

625
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,250
excuse me,
packing this elk out that he shot by

626
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,380
himself.
I mean,

627
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,810
he went in there with an archery tag,
like it was a,

628
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:50,110
it was an an an over the counter unit.
It goes in like 12,

629
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,570
12 miles into public land.
Amen.

630
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,100
Public hacked it out himself,
which if you know the numbers,

631
00:29:57,101 --> 00:30:00,790
it's gotta be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 500 pounds of meat.

632
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,630
Right.
Well,

633
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,370
depending on the fee or not,
he had that other,

634
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,270
his friend of his at works for a trophy
taker,

635
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,031
right?
Yeah.

636
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,550
Grant Grant.
And he helped him carry it out after a

637
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:17,020
while.
Actually I had just left Montana.

638
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,770
I went to Montana and hunted eastern
Montana for me these,

639
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,820
but for my,
for my elk tag,

640
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,290
it was only in a general unit.

641
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,290
So I had to come back.
I literally left Montana and drove home,

642
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,360
um,
to see Sharon for two days to then drive

643
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,920
back.
And when I was driving home,

644
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:37,150
I was following Adam's instagram story
of impact in that sucker.

645
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,050
I was the,
like if I didn't have a wife at home,

646
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,890
I was this close to just texting him and
saying,

647
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,550
where are you dude?
Cause I was gonna like come help him

648
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:50,590
out.
Well he could definitely get people to

649
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:52,960
do that for him.
That'd be a cool thing too.

650
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,730
People would love to go meet Adam Green
Tree.

651
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,350
Yeah.
Help him pack out.

652
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:00,610
That's the one of the cool things about
hunting is how many like really

653
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,160
considerate,
like really friendly,

654
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,880
helpful people we met on this weekend.
Yeah we did.

655
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,240
We were there and and guide had a
membership out there and had his camper.

656
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,480
They're totally kept to himself and on
his last day when he was coming out,

657
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,430
he saw us and he's like,
Hey dudes,

658
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:19,840
I've been on this really cool big red
boar that I saw and you know,

659
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,470
literally told us like go up here,
turn here,

660
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,220
go here.

661
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,340
I haven't been able to get on him.
I mean the guy was like genuinely

662
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:32,341
helpful to another hunter and you know
that 100% is what we need.

663
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,920
Society really.
We need everyone to just like help one

664
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:38,980
another out when it's possible.
I mean you're going to have pettiness in

665
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:43,030
every single group of humans,
but I think overall the tone that I've

666
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,160
experienced from people that are
involved in hunting,

667
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,590
very helpful,
very respectful,

668
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,160
sounds crazy to those people,
but I think that they have,

669
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,570
by being in nature and experiencing the
life and death moments in nature,

670
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,610
I think what it addresses a certain part
of them in their place,

671
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:05,320
in the food chain that almost like comms
and internal aspect of people that are

672
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,470
involved in it because the,
the real struggle,

673
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,420
the life and death struggle of consuming
meat is undeniable.

674
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,910
Yeah.
In terms of like what it means,

675
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,680
like this is what it means,
the animals to die,

676
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,320
you have to cut it up.

677
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,153
You Cook it,
eat it.

678
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,520
That's the PR.
It's not going to the restaurant and I

679
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:22,930
don't know what happened.
You can't,

680
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:24,880
I can't,
I don't know what happened that I don't

681
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:27,460
know what happened is the problem.
It's not the hunting.

682
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,520
That's the problem.
It's that 95% of the people,

683
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,620
95 that's a big number,
but what percentage of them have ever

684
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,230
even seen it happen?
What percentage of them have done it

685
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:39,330
themselves?
What percent?

686
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,190
I mean,
you don't have to,

687
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,960
you definitely don't have to.
I'm just,

688
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm mean,
we're just talking.

689
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:47,180
I'm not passing any judgment on people
know that I have in the past.

690
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,430
Sure.
Let me ask you this right now.

691
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,680
This is one thing I thought about the
other day.

692
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,270
How many people have gone,
they've ordered something like that and

693
00:32:56,271 --> 00:33:01,130
then they don't eat it all.
So they throw it in the trashcan.

694
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,780
Yeah,
that happened.

695
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,430
But it,
but doing what you are.

696
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,920
I do.
Do you look at that differently?

697
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,580
It's definitely different.
Like if you cooked an elk roast,

698
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,770
which I mean,
that's not even fair that I'm bringing

699
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,470
this up because we,
we did it the first night I came in,

700
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:18,590
but if you cooked an elk gross and you
didn't need it all,

701
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:21,230
would you do?
Would you dump that into the trash?

702
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,220
No,
no,

703
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,323
no.
I eat it.

704
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,290
And what else don't eat?
I feed to my chickens and people go

705
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,000
like,
someone said this to me like,

706
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,500
yeah,
you think that's natural man.

707
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,060
A chicken eating and elk.
I'm like,

708
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,870
I'm telling you,
it's just meet your chicken is a goddamn

709
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,950
murdered motherfucker.
I need to come off it.

710
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,790
Your chicken is more ruthless and more
murderous than any cat you've ever met.

711
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,500
They are God damn dinosaurs.

712
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,210
Well,
didn't they say velociraptors

713
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:50,200
technically a dinosaur chicken,
right?

714
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,110
Some in somehow or another like like uh,
ancient Australia.

715
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:56,810
Pithy kiss is a human of today.
Like that,

716
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,490
that chain of progress.
Yeah.

717
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,430
Somehow or another,
a dinosaur became a chicken.

718
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:06,050
Some kind of little raptor ma.
They are fucking ruthless man.

719
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,010
I've met some people that must have
definitely been t rex got a couple of

720
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:13,430
friends where they're so pumped how much
more they can bench.

721
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,010
But when they're like doing it about
four inches,

722
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,510
I'm like,
what is up dude?

723
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,090
How you x bench?
Yeah.

724
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,040
Yeah.
People love to do more impressive

725
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,650
numbers incorrectly.
Right?

726
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,580
Yeah.
Very true.

727
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,710
That's one of the things that gets
people hurt more than anything.

728
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,350
Lifting weights.
Like one time this guy,

729
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:33,440
he emasculated me in a,
in the gym and Phoenix,

730
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,660
some giant fucking football player.
Dude.

731
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,280
You know,
he'd met me with a dairy man.

732
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,131
Big Fan.
You know,

733
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,440
love you bro.
You still phone?

734
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,540
Do you have sue's really know your shit.
Oh thanks dude.

735
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:44,750
Thanks very much.
And this dude is over there like just

736
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,710
doing stacks,
just stack squats and he's just a

737
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:53,711
fucking Herculean like 300 pound man and
I'm over there doing a kettlebell

738
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,780
workout with 35 pounds like a bitch.
I was doing 35 pound windmills.

739
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,950
I was doing like these slow moving
kettle bell,

740
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:05,300
but I'm like look man,
I know this is not the same thing as

741
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,460
what you're doing but you don't do this
either.

742
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,294
Do you?
Yeah,

743
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,630
like doing like slow stuff live with
lightweights.

744
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,270
Controlled stuff is good for your body
to,

745
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,170
it's like guys get it in their head.
They've got to be floating on bench and

746
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:23,000
nine 50 bro.
When you doing this like you can't move,

747
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:26,000
you got to,
your body's got a move that's all about

748
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,540
free range.
The best thing I did was went down on

749
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:33,710
your recommendation.
I flew down to the onnit academy and met

750
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:37,980
all those guys and spent I think two
days in there and just said I

751
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,980
want to do everything.
Show me the May,

752
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:41,940
show me kettle bells.
You know,

753
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,800
I did some stuff on rings,
um,

754
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,780
did some stuff on Bungee straps and it's
all,

755
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,490
I mean,
and you see people that have conditions,

756
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,790
they've worked out that way and
something real simple.

757
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,890
And then you have someone that's,
you know,

758
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:59,310
I'm six,
five to 30 to 20,

759
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,010
probably two 30 after hunting camp.
Um,

760
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,720
and they're doing these simple movements
to where you just feel like a Wussy.

761
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,840
There's people that are that
structurally and core wise or so sound

762
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,860
and actually movable muscle and usable
muscle.

763
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,160
It's totally different than only only
certain types of weights that most

764
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:26,730
people do.
When I met Frank Zane years ago and I

765
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:31,680
went and trained with him on my weight
training specifically on freeways,

766
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,680
I felt like I had wasted.
I met him when I met,

767
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:39,450
I think I met him maybe in my late
twenties and at that point I'd been

768
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,310
working out maybe 15 years.

769
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,870
And I told him,
I said,

770
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I feel like I've wasted 15 years of like
really trying to improve myself.

771
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,570
But I realize now how inefficient I was.
And then when I've started to learn some

772
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,030
of these movements that are about,
you know,

773
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,950
real body usage strength,
I feel the same way.

774
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:05,790
I'm like I wish when I was in high
school my football coach would have been

775
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,210
having people do windmills because
they're talking about how,

776
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,650
you know,
you go to wrestling practice,

777
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:13,050
everyone's talking about how important
it is to be solid.

778
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,260
But everything was like bench,
squat,

779
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,440
deadlift.
I mean things like what we just talked

780
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:21,450
about with like a windmill.
It's totally different.

781
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,320
I mean

782
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,870
bend,
squat,

783
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,320
squat deadlift is still the kings.
But I just think that people get a

784
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:28,450
little bit kings for total mass,
right?

785
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,330
Just get people,
get a little caught up in the numbers

786
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,900
and to the point where they're willing
to ignore the form.

787
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,640
And I think that's where a lot of people
get hurt.

788
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,490
It's like a real problem with people
being a little bit too macho.

789
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:43,770
And I fucking absolutely have been
guilty of that while I was lifting

790
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:44,740
weight.
Too much weight.

791
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,690
Just like,
cause I can bro,

792
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,650
cause I could do it bro.
I tried to Max out on one 35 months.

793
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,560
One 35 would mean for bench.
Oh,

794
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:56,410
like as many times as you can.
I tried to get it once.

795
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:58,000
I didn't get it.
Oh is that a joke?

796
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,600
I got confused.
Sorry.

797
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,270
I don't joke around with the enough.
You actually took me serious.

798
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,830
I definitely did.
It might be a problem.

799
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,900
No,
I need to screw around with anymore.

800
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,420
I saw brock Lesnar's a,
you ever seen his um,

801
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,681
uh,
his,

802
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:12,320
you know those,
uh,

803
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,980
the times they do when they're trying
out for football?

804
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,600
What's that shit called again?
Combine?

805
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,800
Yes.
The combine scores.

806
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,190
They had brock lesnar versus Shane car
when it was like a big heavyweight fight

807
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:25,230
cause it was too super powerful.
Really dangerous wrestlers in,

808
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,990
when you look at the combine scores,
you realize what a freak brock lesner

809
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:31,030
is.
Well I saw him ringside with you.

810
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,930
Oh,
he's a freak.

811
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,550
He's a freak.
It's just straight viking DNA

812
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,980
from the motherland.

813
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,710
If I was a little guy coming from Asia
with my whole family and I had to walk

814
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,620
up to fat dude,
I would think the same thing as a short

815
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,450
faced bears.
I'd be like,

816
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,760
wait,
I have to go by that.

817
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,760
Then flat,
if that fucking thing,

818
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,130
brick and traps,
I have to go by that.

819
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,700
Screw that.
Let's go back and get some Sushi dudes.

820
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,590
If that thing pulls up in a boat,
you fucked up right you,

821
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,360
you,
you're in the wrong place.

822
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Imagine that being in war in a viking
ship comes up like 300 of those suckers

823
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:12,790
coming off rock lester's,
jump off the boat.

824
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,700
Fuck this life.
It's been real.

825
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,630
That'd be ripping my undies off.
Holding up a white flag real fast.

826
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,160
Kind of what we're talking about though,
when we're talking about the short face

827
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:24,680
bear,
I mean there's like levels of these

828
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,920
animals,
there's levels of all these animals and

829
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:32,921
they reach a state of balance.
And one of the weird things that I

830
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:36,560
experienced this weekend and I've
experienced before while wild pig

831
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:39,620
hunting is,
it's almost like you see something that

832
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:42,840
other people are not seeing.
It's like you,

833
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,630
where you realized you look at it,
you a,

834
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:47,960
hey,
this could be a giant problem.

835
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:53,020
This can be a giant problem.
And it's also like you don't have to go

836
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:55,910
to the grocery store to get pork.
Like in fact,

837
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,560
that's probably not the best way to do
it.

838
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:02,360
What we really should do is stop doing
that and go shoot those legal ones.

839
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,231
You know?
I mean,

840
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:05,180
in California we don't have,
there's no limit.

841
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,850
Great Way to do it.
They don't have a limit in California.

842
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,020
All

843
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,710
the,
all the hog farmers or like,

844
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,350
you know
what?

845
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,281
Yeah,
well,

846
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:14,180
I know,
seriously,

847
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,700
listen,
why don't we do that?

848
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,020
Is there a,
is there a,

849
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,840
I wonder if we have like a food bank or
something to where,

850
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,880
you know,
if we're out for the,

851
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,830
for the places given food to the
homeless,

852
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:27,140
why aren't we out doing some,
uh,

853
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,520
pork lips is,
and bringing in some serious pork chops

854
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:33,920
for people.
Get Chad out there from whiskey bent

855
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,190
barbecue,
get him doing some pulled pork butts,

856
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,260
the homeless shelters.
That'd be ridiculous.

857
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,570
Trager would sponsor go homeless.
Just eat there.

858
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,431
But I would,
yeah,

859
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:47,030
but I don't think you're allowed to use
wild animals.

860
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,990
Oh,
that because,

861
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,460
no,
I think it has to do.

862
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,210
Nope.
No,

863
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,950
you can stop.
[inaudible] Iowa.

864
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,260
We have a really good program called
hush.

865
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:54,531
No,
no,

866
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:55,410
that's not what you mean.
I need,

867
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,340
I don't mean like a donation.
I mean like selling it.

868
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,790
Like if you wanted to like sell it,
like one of the things about wild game,

869
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,460
wild pork,
I think you can,

870
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,620
can,
don't know can commercialize the wires

871
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,470
commercial people now doing.
Um,

872
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,870
cause I know when we were in
Indianapolis,

873
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I cooked,
I cooked elk tacos and the eastern

874
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:21,500
booth,
but we had to actually get a license,

875
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,790
FDA,
elk farmer to provide the meat I

876
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:30,620
couldn't bring.
So that is the disconnect if you raise

877
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,550
it.
But then again,

878
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,100
you're like raising a hog in

879
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,360
a,
it's not the same.

880
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,021
No,
it won't be.

881
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,060
What conditions aren't even near the
same?

882
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,390
Well,
you know the,

883
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,820
you know what the one guy has got it
down as Joel Salitan diverse here,

884
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,550
heard of that guy.
He's got a,

885
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,400
of an organization called polyface farms
and uh,

886
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:51,470
had him on the podcast.
He's fascinating because he's a real old

887
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,540
school farmer,
but really smart.

888
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,410
And what he realized somewhere along the
line is that these animals are only

889
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:01,160
happy when they're living like animals
and you get better product from better

890
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:02,660
food.
It's healthier.

891
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,760
So he takes his pigs and he has his
traveling fence so he puts a fence up

892
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,230
and he makes it like really big and then
they fuck everything up on this one side

893
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,970
of the fence.
Then he moves the fence like having

894
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:17,270
goats or chickens or whatever.
Is it just an enormous sense,

895
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,490
a good fresh ecosystem?

896
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

897
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,680
And it also recycles all the ground the
ground and grow better grass everywhere.

898
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,020
They took a dump,
you know.

899
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,050
So he does that with chickens too.
He has this gigantic mobile chicken unit

900
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:33,410
and he pushed this thing around and he
lets you just chickens out and they all

901
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:35,510
run around.
They do chicken shit and they go back up

902
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,370
into their little houses when it gets
dark out,

903
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,310
they know where their houses.
So he moves them around too.

904
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,680
It's really,
really interesting,

905
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,900
man,
because this kid,

906
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,230
it's less of a disconnect and some
people were uncomfortable with there

907
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,740
being less of a disconnect.
Some people like to just get a chicken

908
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:53,450
sandwich.
I don't know how the fuck you got in

909
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,520
that sandwich with thanks dude.
Here's your five bucks,

910
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,920
got to go.
And then there's other people that go,

911
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:59,210
okay,
what does a chicken,

912
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,340
it gets a little cunty dinosaur thing.

913
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,080
I still run once a eat your kids.
That's what a chicken is like.

914
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:07,970
I have chickens that I love them.
They're sweethearts.

915
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,620
I pick him up and I pet them.
I mean,

916
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,710
they're like pegs.
They make great eggs.

917
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:14,300
Yeah,
but the bottom line is that's a country

918
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,690
little dinosaur and we're lucky.
That thing is smaller than us.

919
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,260
It's bigger than I said.
What?

920
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,190
Fuck us up.
You know?

921
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,410
It's true.
We're so weak as humans when we go out.

922
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,650
I mean,
don't make me bring up the terror bird.

923
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,750
No,
you know about the terror bird?

924
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,550
No,
North American.

925
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:34,580
Tera Byrd.
Is that the one bigger than the Eagle?

926
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,470
It's like nine feet tall,
dude.

927
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,900
Who was a nine foot tall,
gigantic bird that didn't fly and it

928
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:44,050
lived in North America.
So it was an ostrich pull up.

929
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,350
It was an,
it was predatory.

930
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,730
No,
but it was a dinosaur.

931
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,140
Ostrich.
Bigger.

932
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,210
Look how big it was.
That's what it looked like.

933
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,340
It looks like a nutcracker.
There's a scale,

934
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:57,050
whether it show it next to a human look
how fucking big it was.

935
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,110
Are you kidding me?
Why was everything bigger?

936
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,820
Dude?
I don't know.

937
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:05,360
Have you ever seen that movie?
Have you ever seen that movie,

938
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:06,650
honey?
I shrunk the kids.

939
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,860
Did that happen on earth?
Look at that terror,

940
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:11,570
Byrd and the short face bur burp a bear
together.

941
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,220
Look at that right there.
Oh Jeez.

942
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,800
Click on that Jamie.
No,

943
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,850
the next one.
The next one.

944
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:18,440
The one above it.
That's the short face bear,

945
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,870
isn't it?
No,

946
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,040
no.
The the like the drawing.

947
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,390
That one right there that your cursor is
on.

948
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,930
Oh Gosh.
Go Up to the top left.

949
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,880
That's another short facebook saber
tooth cat.

950
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,530
Oh it is.
Are Cool.

951
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,220
Okay.
I love

952
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,370
cats or sort.
I mean cow shit killing me at a certain

953
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:37,620
line.
Cats and bears start looking kind of

954
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,430
similar.
No.

955
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,140
Yeah.
That's kind of bear like a little bit,

956
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:41,340
isn't it?
But faster,

957
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,700
bigger teeth,
faster,

958
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,790
bigger teeth.
Faster with less power.

959
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,880
Look at that bird up there.
What's in its mouth?

960
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,510
Jesus
riding it.

961
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,800
Joy of Google and he's a game.
Actually.

962
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,950
It is.
Oh,

963
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,770
the park.
I would ride that thing.

964
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,210
Listen,
we've got a real problem with these

965
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,060
genetic engineers.
All of these like super geeks out there.

966
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,910
Why don't those are assholes,
decides to recreate one of these things

967
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,560
and keep it around like William Randolph
hearst the year 2017 if that Dick had

968
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,990
just brings,
instead of bringing it around wild hogs,

969
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,560
he brings around terror birds.
Don't worry of domesticated them.

970
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,380
They're all vegetarian now that I seek
in ride him.

971
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:20,520
I thought he was pretty cool.

972
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,990
I don't think you can do it.
I don't.

973
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,520
It says upper class.
If you,

974
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,320
if you pull up to your car spot and it
says like Joe Rogan parking is you ride

975
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,940
up on a t bird.
Yeah.

976
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,830
Thank you.
Would anybody who would take your spot

977
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,120
if they ride up on a bird?
What,

978
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,280
what year did that thing go extinct?
The terror bird.

979
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,520
Yeah,
it's gotta be prehistoric.

980
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,230
We'll definitely create a stork.
Definitely.

981
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:50,790
That's one of the main points of
evidence that I always use when people

982
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,710
talk about big foot.
Like how come you don't,

983
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,630
I know you don't believe big floods that
really anymore.

984
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:56,580
I'm like I don't,
it's not that I don't believe it's real,

985
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,920
but I,
I have a very hard time believing that

986
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:02,220
hunters haven't seen him.
What if I'm the reason all these cool

987
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,590
animals are extinct?
It's cause they walked off the edge of

988
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:05,424
the earth.

989
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,500
That's a good point,
dude.

990
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,720
They,
they passed the ice wall.

991
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,080
There's an ice wall out there.
He can't pass it.

992
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,480
Super important.
Standing inside the ice wall.

993
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:20,530
There are reports from Uruguay of
finding stating to 450,000 and 17,000

994
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:26,030
years ago,
but the claim is debated so immensely.

995
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,620
Wow.
That's as close as we get.

996
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,630
62 to 1.8 million years ago is the
actual normal thought of range even

997
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:37,350
though it doesn't leave it look area.
I tried to keep an open mind about this

998
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:41,310
flat earth thing and I said try to keep
an open mind.

999
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,300
Well,
I just,

1000
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,970
I kind of wanted to hear the other
side's argument just so I can

1001
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,470
understand.
I get what it is,

1002
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,020
man.
I think it's just the lack of

1003
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:52,140
communication.
I think what we need is like,

1004
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,170
and I know Neil degrasse Tyson had this
conversation with Bob,

1005
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:55,720
right?
That's the,

1006
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,680
the rapper's name,
but kind of explained it to him and Bob

1007
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,160
dissed him.
A flat earth support track or some,

1008
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
I don't know.
It's,

1009
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,630
I just think it's just a lack of
communication.

1010
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,670
It's like someone needs to explain to
people in a way that doesn't offend

1011
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:15,960
their preconceived notions because
people get this idea that they have the

1012
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,450
right information about something.
They think that something is wrong and

1013
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,140
they,
they,

1014
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,480
they get married to that idea.
If you go,

1015
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,930
you'll like Shaq who just recently came
out and said he's married to the idea

1016
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,280
that the world is flat.
It's like

1017
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,130
how much research you doing?
Don't

1018
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,581
be,
you know,

1019
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,720
are you not pay me how much,
how much research are the people on the

1020
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,720
space station doing?
Are they all in on a lie?

1021
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,990
They're all in on a lie.
Is that real or did you decide that

1022
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:47,710
that's real and now you're looking only
at things that support that idea in your

1023
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:52,711
head and you're not looking for it
through astrophysicists or astronauts or

1024
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:57,160
people that study it their whole life
who understand it.

1025
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,020
You're not looking at it through those
lenses.

1026
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:03,910
That's why it seems like it makes sense.
It only seems like it makes sense cause

1027
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:06,820
you don't know what makes sense.
How dare you,

1028
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,050
I my Baiting,
I'm not even focusing on the shack.

1029
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,660
Think we all are just,
we're all silly.

1030
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,990
All of us on both sides.
It's not even that.

1031
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:18,910
Just at the people that believe the
earth is flat.

1032
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,360
I've got three full passports with
stamps.

1033
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,570
I think.
I feel for the people that believe it,

1034
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:29,230
cause I think some of them didn't tell
them correctly or something.

1035
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,380
But I've never done an international
flight where I flew for a while and then

1036
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:35,590
the plane banked,
it turned around.

1037
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,480
It doesn't work that way.
It's like a black hole.

1038
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,130
He hit the wall,
the ice wall.

1039
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:42,130
And then you go back in time to the
moment when you're born is the ice with

1040
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:44,500
your life over and over again.
The ice wall real though.

1041
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:47,680
Fuck yes.
No one's been there and take pictures of

1042
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:49,600
it,
but they can't because of the Illuminati

1043
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,720
and plus the Jews know what Pr.
You can't just go to the ice wall,

1044
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,560
dude.
Jamie,

1045
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:58,561
I'm asking you as a third party.
It was a simple question to joe of

1046
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,960
sorry.
So what happens when you get to the

1047
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:02,680
edge?

1048
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,200
I wish I was an expert and he said,
let's just make shit up.

1049
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,830
So,
but is there an ice wall or was that,

1050
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,420
it was cause I actually thought that was
part of the argument.

1051
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:10,991
Yes,
no,

1052
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,350
that is part of the argument.
But the,

1053
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,030
the part of the argument started,
wait a minute,

1054
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,380
are you kidding me?
It sounds like the Truman show or like

1055
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:26,740
hunger games.
I don't fault anybody who believes on

1056
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,900
your end.
I think there's a problem when someone

1057
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:33,280
believes something and then someone else
doesn't believe what they believe.

1058
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,400
And then on both sides there's a is
there's an issue because the side that

1059
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:41,080
believes that they're right,
the side of the astronomers and

1060
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:42,850
astrophysicists,
we get angry,

1061
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,320
get angry at people that believe
something other than what we are pretty

1062
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,900
sure to be true.
So you start making it into personal

1063
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,850
thing and it's stupid,
you know?

1064
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,540
And I think that's part of the problems
that people get invested in their ideas.

1065
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,280
You get invested in the idea of big
foot.

1066
00:49:57,281 --> 00:50:01,870
I was fucking 100% over invested in the
idea of big foot.

1067
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,300
I was super helpful or hopeful.
Rather every time I would see a new

1068
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:08,590
story about big foot,
please let this be the one I was

1069
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:11,680
thinking about it man.
It was like if they really found bigfoot

1070
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,080
I crazy.
Would that be fuck yeah.

1071
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,560
But then it did make sense.
It didn't make sense.

1072
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,660
No.
Sharon actually brought up a very valid

1073
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:21,400
point.
She said if there was a big foot,

1074
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,640
it's like what's his age limit?
Yeah,

1075
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,810
because he's got,
I mean by now,

1076
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:28,250
that sucker based on like how long
monkeys

1077
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,420
and stuff live or a bear or whatever.
He's gone.

1078
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,810
If there was one,
the idea is that there's a population of

1079
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:39,110
them.
I've talked to several experts.

1080
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,920
What's that going to see any updates on
big foot.

1081
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,600
Oh please.
They're excellent.

1082
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,920
Rob Lowe and his sons are going to hunt
big foot for Ada.

1083
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,440
That'll be a fun show.
Rob Lowe's,

1084
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,330
a funny guy.
Hello files.

1085
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,000
I think that'd be interesting,
but is it,

1086
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,000
look,
they're doing it like that.

1087
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,990
He really thinks he's going to find it,
or is he doing it as a way like,

1088
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:05,570
okay boys,
I'm going to prove to you that this is

1089
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:08,930
kind of,
maybe it's not even preconceived or

1090
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:12,440
maybe it's scripted.
The little side streets.

1091
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,730
Well,
you know who absolutely.

1092
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:18,731
100% is balls deep in bigfoot bobcat.
Goldthwait balls and I love that pot.

1093
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,800
I love him.
He's awesome.

1094
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:22,910
He was really cool.

1095
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,150
He actually grew leaves actually
believes at that video.

1096
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,210
You know that Patterson footage with the
things walking across the field.

1097
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:34,211
He thinks of it all the time
that that Bob Patterson guide met you.

1098
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,830
You probably could have taken the place,
the other guy,

1099
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,550
that muscle,
if I had as much hair as you did without

1100
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:41,350
shaving.
Oh,

1101
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,800
they're in like up here.
I think I could look like that sucker.

1102
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,380
Like if he seen me stock in that hog
this morning,

1103
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,130
he'd be like,
there was a fricking big foot doing

1104
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:53,090
yoga.
Well,

1105
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:57,230
there's some dudes that get real hairy
and we've got to assume that the

1106
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,650
Harriers dude that we know today ain't
shit compared to the Harissa student of

1107
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,670
a hundred years ago.
Right.

1108
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,230
If you didn't have clothes,
you know,

1109
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:05,180
you'd be growing some hair.
Yeah,

1110
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,450
for sure.
Seriously.

1111
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,510
Yeah.
If you were cold,

1112
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,250
if you had to live or die,
you would grow hair.

1113
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,340
Why would it be any different than a dog
that sheds when it's hot or grows here

1114
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,170
when it's cold?
Because we're not animals.

1115
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:22,820
John Dudley where people came from.
Monkeys don't tell people that they

1116
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,800
don't want to believe it.
Wow.

1117
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:29,750
Yeah,
super hairy people and if your kind like

1118
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:32,840
big giant freak like dudes like you're
kind of covered with hair.

1119
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,100
We're so opposite.
Actually.

1120
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:35,150
You and I,
I know.

1121
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,780
I'm like sitting there thinking do what
I want to be.

1122
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,580
I feel like a tire.
I feel like he's,

1123
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,810
he's my child.
When we hug,

1124
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,150
I'm his child brother.
I Dunno,

1125
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,180
but I feel like,
remember when you told me that story

1126
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:50,510
about the monkey that you had,
that you had when you were on fear

1127
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:52,770
factor chimp,
Pete my ass.

1128
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,270
When you held that little thing you
thought this thing's made a would that,

1129
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,630
that's what I feel when I get you up on
my shoulder.

1130
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,850
I'm like,
damn,

1131
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:05,660
this thing's made a would
absolutely start.

1132
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,340
I was telling Jamie,
I think I've told you this story.

1133
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:13,520
I've probably told it to everybody.
I've met that I have a little baby chimp

1134
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:16,730
on the set of news radio.
Like way back in the day.

1135
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,350
It was supposed to be in some stuff that
I tell you this,

1136
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,380
I probably said it before.
This little motherfucker was on my back

1137
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:23,540
and he hit me a couple times and I was
stunned.

1138
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,160
I was like,
oh no,

1139
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,070
this is not what I thought.

1140
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,260
It was like.
I thought it was like a little person

1141
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:28,741
like,
oh,

1142
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:30,390
this little person thinks he's a bad
ass.

1143
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,320
Let me just calm him down now.
He got on top of the page,

1144
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,940
just hit me a couple times on the back
and I was like,

1145
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:40,080
what in the fuck?
I just was thinking it immediately.

1146
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:43,570
I started doing the math in my head and
thinking what it would be like to be

1147
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,960
confronted by a full grown chimp.
Okay,

1148
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:48,960
well that's my argument with the silver
back versus grizzly.

1149
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,040
You said Grizzly because grizzlies or
even more and more of the fucking bad

1150
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:55,050
ass than a chimp.
Grizzly.

1151
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,800
Grizzly can't like,
there's no way a chimp can outrun a

1152
00:53:58,801 --> 00:53:59,970
grizzly.
There's no way,

1153
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,370
not a chance in hell.
What's this?

1154
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,680
I don't know if that's true.
What is a silver back?

1155
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:07,350
Full speed.
I seen one of those things.

1156
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,200
No grizzly can outrun a soda.
I know it.

1157
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,960
I'm straight.
I feel confident.

1158
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,370
I think chimps are fast.
The gorillas and I think at Grizzly can

1159
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:20,640
out run a chimp and I think for me,
I think there's no way the guerrillas

1160
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:22,920
getting fucked.
He's getting ds.

1161
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:24,930
Dude.
I'm telling you right now,

1162
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:30,050
big ass and tiering your hands feel like
when they shake mine and so I would be,

1163
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,750
I guess I'm not like a Grizzly,
but you're a giant dude.

1164
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,530
It
would crumple you like empty pop.

1165
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:39,190
It wouldn't even,
it would even be like,

1166
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:41,580
he wouldn't even feel you.
He would go through you like whipped

1167
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,580
cream fee,
25 miles an hour.

1168
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,900
Top speed.
What does it say?

1169
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:50,901
Feels like 25 and 25 similar animals
speeds 34 but it feels like 25 I don't

1170
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:56,430
understand.
What that means is from someone riding

1171
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:58,980
it's back.
Get to a different website.

1172
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,840
Is that really what this is?
Oh my God,

1173
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:05,400
I love the name.
What pd?

1174
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,230
Where'd that come from?
Do you know where that came from?

1175
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:12,020
For elk speed of animals.com
a wall pd?

1176
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:12,751
Yeah.
What does it,

1177
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,670
where does that word come?
That's what an elk is,

1178
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:16,520
dude.
Why the,

1179
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,050
it's actually a whopper who called it
the [inaudible].

1180
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,400
What does that,
where does that name come from?

1181
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,260
I've heard it.
It's a cool name.

1182
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,680
[inaudible] Wednesday is the Hashtag.
Cam uses it a lot.

1183
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,380
Powerful wapatee Wednesday
is a champ.

1184
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:34,550
I said a silver back.
I don't want to know what my gap is.

1185
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:36,840
So do you think a chimp is faster?
Jump off there,

1186
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,700
don't you think in chip is faster than a
gorilla?

1187
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,080
[inaudible] silver back.
Okay.

1188
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,440
Have you seen a silver back come out of
the fricking past

1189
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,930
told you so?
Yes.

1190
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,800
What I'm thinking though,
speaking of restraints,

1191
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,990
it's,
it's just like an archery argument.

1192
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,101
Yeah.
Maybe.

1193
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,740
I think the bear gets a heavier arrow,
slower speed,

1194
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,040
fast Arrow,
but there's not much of a difference in

1195
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:02,490
the speed.
It's real close and a grizzly bear is so

1196
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:05,220
much bigger.
Moving so much more mass around,

1197
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,420
like have a big grizzly is 500 pounds a
silver back.

1198
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,730
I'm pretty sure.
I mean a big grizzly interior,

1199
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,900
grizzly,
what does a big one,

1200
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,570
like 900 is that really not a mountain
grizzly?

1201
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,680
You can look it up.
I would say aggressive ones.

1202
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,320
Just say six or 700 and the really big
ones that the coastal ones,

1203
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,960
right,
which they call brown bears for

1204
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,750
years.
Why do they call them that?

1205
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:28,120
But because it's the same animal,
different specie,

1206
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,950
is it?
Yes.

1207
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,750
Yeah.
They don't interbreed or anything

1208
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,100
bigger.
The break.

1209
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,650
Totally different bear.
Yeah.

1210
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,750
One looks like a Volkswagen with hair
and one looks more like a Ford truck or

1211
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:44,200
one of those other things where the the
one that has the scare,

1212
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:47,530
your name is like not the biggest one,
which is weird.

1213
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:48,940
Like Brown bear sounded like,
oh,

1214
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:52,780
he's so cuddly.
And you see those buses under brainiac

1215
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,300
island.
So coke.

1216
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,870
Yeah,
Klondike bars.

1217
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,160
Well,
that's right.

1218
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,450
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
I fucking poor because your buddy,

1219
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,500
I'm your buddy.
I live in a place where there's no

1220
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,900
vegetables.
It's a conspiracy theory.

1221
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,620
Told her bears brought that up.
They literally made those to make

1222
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:11,800
themselves look cuddly.
So humans would be stupid enough to walk

1223
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:12,634
up to him.

1224
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:16,330
Do you think it's like a nature trick?
Like nature made them cool to look at?

1225
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,760
So we don't mind as much that they're
murderers.

1226
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,180
I would argue Disney fucking Disney,
right?

1227
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:26,980
Like that Bambi movie [inaudible] slower
by 10 miles an hour.

1228
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,430
The,
is there anyone that has the doctor told

1229
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:30,941
you?
No.

1230
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:35,110
But is there any strength of a silver
back versus a grizzly?

1231
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,390
And I say this saying,
I really respect grizzly bears and brown

1232
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:44,440
bears cause you know that,
well I feel that the concerns of a lot

1233
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,440
of grizzly bears and brown bears that
were listening and they were there,

1234
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,600
they're pumped.
I think that um,

1235
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:54,070
they're all dangerous and ferocious and
I'm thinking silver back versus the

1236
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,220
nigger is you think you would win?
Yeah.

1237
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,680
Maybe people who listen to this podcast
and he said put it in the pot and the

1238
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:02,080
pose what we need to know,
what people want to know.

1239
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:07,350
I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat.
I be fucking terrified to fight at 38

1240
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:12,310
pound rat.
So the idea of 38 I just can't put a

1241
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:15,160
number cause that's a fucking giant rat
man.

1242
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,710
Yeah,
but he should have said 30 40.

1243
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,800
I know,
but like [inaudible]

1244
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,740
what's a house cat weigh like 10 pounds.
No Way.

1245
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,530
That's the Garfield waste.
10.

1246
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,520
Okay.
Like seven,

1247
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:28,540
seven pounds.
I'm like that.

1248
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,010
I would think something along those
lines.

1249
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,480
Okay,
now,

1250
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,910
now make it bigger.
Like keep like a what?

1251
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,450
What size is it becomes unmanageable.
First off,

1252
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,350
let's,
if you're not wearing welding gloves at

1253
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:45,351
10 pound in shape house cat,
you're not talking like Garfield,

1254
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:48,090
you're talking like,
I dunno.

1255
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,690
Let's talk about a conor Mcgregor
Garfield at coming in at 10.

1256
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,870
Like a real good tiger cat.
Like one of them,

1257
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,600
you know those,
those ones like real common house cat

1258
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,180
ones that look like a little picture of
this pic.

1259
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,350
If you grabbed a 10 pound mountain line,
do you think you can control that?

1260
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,180
There's no way.
My neighbor,

1261
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,760
my neighbor,
it's 38 pound.

1262
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,960
My neighbors,
good buddy of mine.

1263
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,973
And He,
uh,

1264
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,670
he saw a mountain lion and uh,
he saw a mountain lion when he was

1265
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:20,710
walking his dogs get these little cutie
dogs.

1266
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,300
He's walking this little cutie dogs and
he saw this fucking thing,

1267
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:27,410
so its tail and picked it up,
picked the dogs up and ran back to his

1268
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:32,411
house and then got on a website,
got on a website and found out that,

1269
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:33,830
uh,
that,

1270
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,590
that they attract this animal and that
it a,

1271
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:41,591
it had a collar on it and the tracked it
and it got hit by a car on the five and

1272
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:44,960
he's explaining like how the whole,
the whole thing went down.

1273
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,860
I was like,
Whoa,

1274
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:49,940
like that you were walking your dogs and
this big ass cat,

1275
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:51,800
it's like 120 pound plus cat.

1276
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:55,490
So the actual cat that had a collar,
he knew that's the one he encountered.

1277
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,090
Yeah,
yeah.

1278
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,010
He saw,
he saw the collar and then he went on

1279
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,240
the website and you can track because
he'd,

1280
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,070
he'd found out that this cat had died
and when he found out the cat died,

1281
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,490
he went and uh oh the sound of whiskey.
Are you good?

1282
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,473
Yeah,
I'm good dude.

1283
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,000
Trust me you're yet,
he's talking a lot of stupid shit.

1284
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,250
I even touch that.
I definitely have.

1285
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:15,150
How dare you.
You one of those guys bro.

1286
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,540
You ain't even been drunk cause me bro.
Quit bullying me.

1287
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,700
Sorry.
It's my instinct.

1288
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,320
What we were just,
what,

1289
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,080
what the fuck was I just getting to you?
I had on the rat.

1290
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,820
Oh yeah.
Among other things.

1291
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:29,390
So a silver back is essentially like a
super,

1292
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,270
a super prime it right.
The most super,

1293
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:32,870
super prime.

1294
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:37,870
Yes.
But a bear is one of the most super,

1295
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:43,250
Super Freak Predator animal freak out.
Things like have a bear was little,

1296
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,700
like a nine pound bear.
Like the size of a nine pound rat was

1297
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,310
trying to kill you.
You'd be freaking the fuck out if it was

1298
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:51,800
running annual,
like a little tiny bear.

1299
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:56,390
You'd be fucking terrified.
Now think of a giant one and realize how

1300
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:59,240
pr you,
you are totally defenseless and I don't

1301
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:01,010
think it's going to be that much
difference.

1302
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,880
For average.
Literally think of a silver back gorilla

1303
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,340
with the way they're built and they
swing around.

1304
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:11,570
I think if he stood on the chest of a
grizzly can grab its paws and literally

1305
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:14,780
rip its arms out and beat it with it.
Wow.

1306
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,570
That's King Kong was a good movie.
I agree with you there.

1307
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,040
I enjoyed it as much as the next day,
I think in a Kong,

1308
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,040
but I believe that.

1309
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,760
I don't think that's correct.
I don't think they're that strong.

1310
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,890
The thumb,
the thumb doves does give an advantage

1311
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:28,191
though,
right?

1312
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,610
It could grab,
wait,

1313
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:31,990
it's a little smarter.
Move around a little fast,

1314
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,330
Jamie.
Hmm,

1315
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,900
great.
But he just,

1316
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,010
the bears way stronger.
Way Stronger.

1317
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,690
Way Stronger.
It could smack at once.

1318
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,300
I've seen that.
I've seen a grown mountain grizzly hit a

1319
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:46,760
moose and cannon.
Yeah.

1320
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:48,890
You told me that,
that I've seen you saw it with your own

1321
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:49,724
eyes.
Right.

1322
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:54,470
Is there any solid information of
strength of a silver back for,

1323
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,500
there's not,
there's just a lot of people that have

1324
01:01:56,501 --> 01:01:59,930
argued this on the Internet for the last
five to 10 we get dangerously close to

1325
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:01,280
this argument.
Seriously.

1326
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:05,540
Why don't they put thor's hammer on the
ground have and like put a,

1327
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,770
put a Taco in it or something to where a
grizzly has to try to grab it and pull

1328
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:13,610
it off and have a sensor versus the
silver back down.

1329
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,740
Well,
the grizzly definitely can't grab as

1330
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:17,660
hard because it doesn't have thumbs like
we talked about,

1331
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:18,560
but I think,
yeah,

1332
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:21,990
but that's relative to a beating,
right?

1333
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,520
Who,
how many fighters have a big ass and a

1334
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:31,521
lot of like leg power krakoff versus
someone that's just sheer grill up top.

1335
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,050
I'm,
let's do go there.

1336
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,860
I just wonder how strong a gorilla
really is in comparison to which

1337
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:41,820
essentially like a giant dog.
I just think he's going to get far

1338
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,090
crazy.
You think silver back is equivalent to a

1339
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:47,400
giant dog,
a bearers?

1340
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,840
What I'm saying is a bear.
A bear is like essentially like a giant

1341
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,220
house.
Well,

1342
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,700
why would I call it silver back dog?
I Dunno.

1343
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,060
We've had a couple of adult beverage.
Yeah,

1344
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,100
and we had a fun time this weekend,
man.

1345
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,850
We'd really fun time,
Dude.

1346
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,750
You John Dudley's the greatest archery
coach in the world there.

1347
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,530
I said it,
but even though I only have experience

1348
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:12,930
with John Today,
but I'm telling you,

1349
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,700
he knows his shit to the point where I
can,

1350
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,930
I highly doubt that.
Uh,

1351
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,410
does anybody's more detail oriented than
you?

1352
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,180
He do it.
Sharon told me that.

1353
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,230
She said a lot of times you'll give a
compliment to me,

1354
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,520
but then you'll immediately say
something that contradicts it.

1355
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:31,200
Like I'll say,
say I say,

1356
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,470
I really love those shoes.
Those shoes look really good.

1357
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:36,300
And then I'll,
without knowing it,

1358
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:39,390
say those silver ones that you have or
better or whatever,

1359
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,290
just say it.
You know,

1360
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,660
whatever.
You kind of did that to me.

1361
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:43,290
He said,
I'm a,

1362
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,210
I was a good coach,
but I've only had one.

1363
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,880
I know though.
I know what you're doing though.

1364
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,320
You're so good research though,
Dude.

1365
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:51,300
You just show it.
It's,

1366
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,460
you stopped me.
Archery is fascinating.

1367
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,000
It's such a fascinating thing.
I am definitely a stalker in a Weirdo,

1368
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,690
especially when it comes to archery,
but like learning it and learning from a

1369
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:05,691
guy who's like such a,
the way you break the whole thing down

1370
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,910
is so fascinating because you expose
these little weaknesses.

1371
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,940
I've seen you do it and he did it this
weekend with uh,

1372
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,000
our friend Steve or this week with Steve
Ryan who he hung out with.

1373
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,170
Yeah.
Super Cool Dude.

1374
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,120
Awesome beard.
Really cool guy.

1375
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:23,230
It's definitely work at shaving shortly.
Manly beard or Roche,

1376
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:27,540
mostly manly beer.
But I saw you just tune in his ball.

1377
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,020
You fixed a few things about his stance.
Like you can't help yourself as soon as

1378
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:33,270
you see someone and you were,
you were,

1379
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,940
you're so bored with it at this point.
You started asking me what is he doing

1380
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:38,190
wrong and like what's wrong here?
No,

1381
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:39,120
I did that for a reason.

1382
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,390
That was part of me coaching you this
weekend actually.

1383
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,820
Oh,
well it worked and it was seriously

1384
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:46,620
true.
The video was the best part.

1385
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:49,110
Like showing me a video of the that in
later.

1386
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,180
That was awesome.
Everything was strategic.

1387
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,490
Actually,
I asked you what you thought of him

1388
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:58,491
because a big part of me knowing that
I'm teaching the right way is once my

1389
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:01,920
students are able to identify when I'm
not there.

1390
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:07,070
I think that's a very important thing
that coaches miss is some coaches,

1391
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:12,330
they want the money,
they want the student dependent on you

1392
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:15,330
being there all the time.
They want to go with you to the

1393
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:18,430
tournament.
They want to go with you to the UFC

1394
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,510
fight,
whatever.

1395
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,340
But the reality is like with me
personally,

1396
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,460
thankfully if I agree to work with
someone,

1397
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,790
the reality is I don't get to see you
every week.

1398
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,660
A lot of the people that I work with,
I picked because I really want to,

1399
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,780
I enjoy working with them,
but I want you to be able to help

1400
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,570
yourself when I'm not there.
Cause I mean both of you and I only get

1401
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:45,820
to see each other every three months
maybe.

1402
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:51,070
So if I'm not able to be there seeing
shooting for three months,

1403
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,770
am I a good coach?
Because you're,

1404
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,460
you know,
for whatever 89 days,

1405
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,260
you're wondering if you're doing it
right.

1406
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,690
So when I asked you that it was,
it was for a reason because I thought if

1407
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,870
you ever called me and said,
am I doing something wrong?

1408
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,280
I could be able to say,
well,

1409
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,110
have your ticket,
take a picture and look.

1410
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,980
Because hopefully we've worked on the
same things enough to where you're able

1411
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:17,710
to identify.
I want you to be able to tell me what

1412
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,240
you're doing wrong.
And I think,

1413
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:22,420
I think a good coach does that.
They're secure to do that.

1414
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,140
I don't want to have to,
I don't want my students to be dependent

1415
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:27,550
on me.
I want them to,

1416
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:33,100
I want to push myself because I'm
wondering,

1417
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:37,180
do you know as much as I do right now
and can I take this to another level

1418
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:38,590
where I introduce you to something new?

1419
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,481
Well,
you know,

1420
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:44,481
this is something that I've experienced
in a big way with Jujitsu that the very

1421
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:49,410
best coaches,
not only do they not hold anything back,

1422
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:54,470
but they,
they encourage their students to be as

1423
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:58,620
good as them or better.
Like my friend Eddie Bravo is a perfect

1424
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:03,030
example of that.
He has like this whole team of top

1425
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:04,590
killers,
like he's,

1426
01:07:04,591 --> 01:07:08,730
he's really put together this
fascinating style and now has

1427
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,940
incorporated all these leg locks into
it.

1428
01:07:10,941 --> 01:07:15,941
This fascinating style of Jujitsu and
openly encourages any new moves explores

1429
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:22,560
and gives everyone credit and they all,
they're all battling it out trying to

1430
01:07:22,561 --> 01:07:25,740
come up with the best method for every
single situation.

1431
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,500
And the only way to do that is to
encourage growth,

1432
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:32,220
to not be afraid of competition,
to embrace losing to your students are

1433
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,290
getting tapped by your students.
That's great.

1434
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:38,100
It keeps everyone on their toes and
other martial arts don't do that.

1435
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,930
Oh I shouldn't say they don't do that,
but it's way less common than the Jiu

1436
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:44,970
Jitsu community.
Like John Jacques Machado is a perfect

1437
01:07:44,971 --> 01:07:46,560
example.
Like he's,

1438
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,620
he's the guy who gave Eddie Bravo's
blackbelt and John Jacques Machado was

1439
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:54,030
like completely dedicated to making his
students as good as him or better.

1440
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,130
Like that's,
that's his hundred percent focus.

1441
01:07:56,131 --> 01:07:58,230
And when you do that,
all you're concentrating on is the

1442
01:07:58,231 --> 01:08:01,830
growth and the improvement of the art.
The actual art of Jujitsu.

1443
01:08:01,831 --> 01:08:03,510
And I think the same could be said for
archery.

1444
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,280
Like you're not trying to hold anything
back.

1445
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,830
You're trying to show,
it's,

1446
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:10,980
you're trying to put it into someone's
head so they could do the very best job

1447
01:08:10,981 --> 01:08:14,430
they can at,
at minimizing all the things that can go

1448
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:16,160
wrong,
tune everything right.

1449
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,360
And then you'll know what you're doing.
You'll be able to take steps and it's,

1450
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,830
it's real similar in a lot of ways.
It's real similar.

1451
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,060
Well,
like with Eddy say he knew one move so

1452
01:08:25,061 --> 01:08:26,410
he knew the crane kick,
right?

1453
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,800
That how dare you.
Who doesn't involve pain?

1454
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,300
I just stepped out of your leg is
terrible.

1455
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:32,710
Son of a gun,
sorry.

1456
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,510
Every,
I'm sorry.

1457
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:37,220
Every 10th player,
Jujitsu Guy Ludwig.

1458
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:40,670
Actually use that in a fight.
Dwayne Bang.

1459
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:44,360
Ludwig is such a motherfucker who was
beaten this dude up and in the middle of

1460
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:47,540
beating it was in the king of the cage
in the middle of beating the dude up.

1461
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,690
He goes into the crane kick and this was
when Duane Ludwig,

1462
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,820
he still a motherfucker,
don't get me wrong,

1463
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:56,660
but this was when Duane Ludwig was a
young buck wild motherfucker and he was

1464
01:08:56,661 --> 01:09:00,230
boss Rutan's protege.
So he's fighting this guy in Caney cage

1465
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,970
and his standup is just super advanced
for MMA at this point.

1466
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,700
People just did not know what the fuck
to do with this guy.

1467
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:11,000
He had just wicked stand up and was
very,

1468
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,150
um,
very competent and very successful as a

1469
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,440
professional.
Kickboxer too.

1470
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:20,330
He's just super good striker fought,
you know Ramon dekkers fought like top

1471
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:22,940
level Moy Thai guys.
I mean he was a really,

1472
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:23,810
really impressive guy.

1473
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,400
So when he was in mma,
and this is Kinda,

1474
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,990
he did kind of both of them at the same
time too when he was in mma and when he

1475
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:33,620
did his crane kick on this guide,
MMA was just not level ready for this

1476
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,530
level striking yet.
He's Tj dillashaw star coach,

1477
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,170
you know he is right.
He's beat this dude up.

1478
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:41,080
Look at this.
No.

1479
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,740
Is it wash it for a little bit because
when you watch like how good he was back

1480
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:48,800
then,
you know it's still is not soap fucking

1481
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:51,530
technical like see all these
combinations he threw.

1482
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,750
He was like on another level back then.
But compared to a good percentage of the

1483
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:59,150
people that fought in mma,
like the kitties fighting is wearing

1484
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:00,350
shoes.
Okay.

1485
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,990
Just wondering skate after this.
I mean he's getting lit up now.

1486
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:08,710
This is like Duane Bang,
kick,

1487
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:10,520
jump head kicked him.
I know.

1488
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,380
Ooh,
this dude is getting,

1489
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,000
look at this.
He likes combination.

1490
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,200
No question.
Come on.

1491
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,820
Cowboy combinations right there,
but no question.

1492
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:24,300
I'm feeling like I'm an eighth grade
basketball looking at those shorts.

1493
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,490
Dude,
you're so tall.

1494
01:10:26,491 --> 01:10:29,250
I accidentally touched her feet and
there were all the way the fuck over

1495
01:10:29,251 --> 01:10:30,090
here.
I was trying to,

1496
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:33,180
it's ridiculous.
You can go ahead.

1497
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:34,590
I got real mad.
Don't worry about,

1498
01:10:34,591 --> 01:10:35,700
hey,
she touched my knees.

1499
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:38,340
That's ridiculous cause that your knee.
Yeah man,

1500
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,620
that's my knee.
Be careful you don't have any brb

1501
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,690
we were talking about bouncy road
boners.

1502
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,990
If there is something that happens to a
man when he's in a car that's going down

1503
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:48,910
a bouncy road for too long,
when he was like,

1504
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,860
what is it,
rod in my pants.

1505
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,673
It's weird,
right?

1506
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:55,290
Yeah.
It's like spaceballs that darth helmet.

1507
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,540
I never saw that.
He should.

1508
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,660
I definitely probably should make sure
you're in the mood to see it.

1509
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,370
Really dumb movie.
You know,

1510
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:05,250
sometimes I think when you did the
podcast with Leah,

1511
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:09,150
you said there's some movies that are so
bad that they're actually good.

1512
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,310
Like baseball's is it?
Oh,

1513
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:13,770
is it really supposed to be?
That's John Candy,

1514
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,060
isn't it?
I thought it was supposed to be really

1515
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:17,060
fun.
It is.

1516
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:21,300
So it's just procrastinate as a dog.
I watched part of it.

1517
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:25,720
I think once,
it's one of the like really big flaws in

1518
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:28,530
my catalog,
my catalog of movies I've watched,

1519
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:32,940
I've missed a lot of like really good
movies you have that never saw Bruno the

1520
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:35,040
allergy movie.
I heard it was amazing.

1521
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:40,160
I never,
I saw Bora love dad left dead and I

1522
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,600
should have seen bruce,
but I have never seen Bruno.

1523
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:47,780
I had never seen Barat and we're at
Sharon sister's house and they're like,

1524
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:52,781
what you haven't seen borats is her
sister and Sharon and her sister both

1525
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:55,680
like,
you know they walked pretty straight

1526
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,520
line,
you know that.

1527
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,560
And she said,
oh you cause her sister watched her

1528
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:06,561
sister watches like horror movies and
like scary movies or at movies.

1529
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,780
Sharon and I are more into like,
you know,

1530
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:14,781
we'd like funny movie stepbrothers stuff
like that tell they get nights but she

1531
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:18,750
told her husband to put bore add on and
when he put it on and like,

1532
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:22,900
I don't know if when he put the CD on,
if it likes started up where they

1533
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,850
stopped before,
but it was literally when Barat was like

1534
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:28,360
69 in that fat guy

1535
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,580
in the bed and she's like,
no,

1536
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,590
just wait.
It's really good.

1537
01:12:33,591 --> 01:12:37,280
And we're just sitting there like,
what the hell is this?

1538
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,040
Yeah,
you can't just enter in the middle of

1539
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,980
that movie.
You have to start from the beginning.

1540
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,570
We literally,
I don't know for like timeline,

1541
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:52,571
but it started at fat guy at 69 that's
where it started.

1542
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,380
And we were like,
wait a minute,

1543
01:12:54,381 --> 01:12:56,240
this is good.
Yeah.

1544
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:59,060
Yeah.
That guy is capable of keeping a

1545
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:01,760
straight face and tremendous
circumstances.

1546
01:13:01,761 --> 01:13:06,470
Like I don't know what he has in him,
but he has a fucking constitution of

1547
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:09,140
steel.
The way he doesn't break character while

1548
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:09,920
these people,
like he was my,

1549
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,150
remember when he was carrying his shit,
he shit into a bag and brought it to

1550
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:19,010
this lady that was in Bora.
He Shit in his bag and then handed it to

1551
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:22,940
this lady and this really nice home and
he was pretending that he was this guy

1552
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:24,740
who didn't understand that was his
culture.

1553
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,510
They would shit in a bag and then hand
it to their,

1554
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,060
their uh,
the people ran the house and it was

1555
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:32,690
fucking hilarious.
God,

1556
01:13:32,691 --> 01:13:37,340
I wish there was a Oscar for podcasts.
Look as how we go from being on a series

1557
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:42,540
positive subject to seeing Bora and the
ship positive subject.

1558
01:13:42,621 --> 01:13:47,330
He's the genius that is Bhorat in and
knock on green share outfit.

1559
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:49,350
Amazing.
That is knocking on green.

1560
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,110
It's a little lighter than knock on
green,

1561
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:53,690
but close enough.
I don't want you to think the original

1562
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:56,420
logo had that.
That guy is a character.

1563
01:13:56,421 --> 01:13:59,990
He is.
Did you see when he threw the ashes on a

1564
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,110
Ryan seacrest?
Why?

1565
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,050
Yes,
I did.

1566
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,890
What in the heck?
He was amazing.

1567
01:14:06,891 --> 01:14:09,620
And Talladega nights.
That's where it is amazing.

1568
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,620
Look at them in the middle though.
When he's all,

1569
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:14,320
when he's totally serious.
That's what his wife see.

1570
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,660
She's like,
well it's get creepy here bro.

1571
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:21,690
Well I'm just saying if you see,
I look went from seeing him in a normal

1572
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,270
suit.
I guess it would be a jacket and a nice

1573
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:29,290
white shirt to being in the at like
suspend her outfit.

1574
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,900
I would say that was,
that was normal.

1575
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:34,810
And that was on the extreme side.
Yeah.

1576
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:38,530
Look at him.
See now we're almost at the,

1577
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:40,750
uh,
what was the ice skating movie with Jim

1578
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,700
Farrell and uh,
what was that one?

1579
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,970
Polian dynamite.
That was fun.

1580
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,540
That was a fun movie.
Shareable beat you Vicki Bobi.

1581
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,591
Sharon?
No,

1582
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,590
that was a ricky bobby.
No Talladega nights.

1583
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,490
French character.
Yeah,

1584
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,680
we beat you ricky.
He did have a good,

1585
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,420
he did.
He definitely had to get,

1586
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,000
was it?
Um,

1587
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,380
was it day?
Yeah.

1588
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:05,480
He's his ology character.
He can't really do anymore.

1589
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,500
I think he's doing,
what he's doing is taking cycles and

1590
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:10,810
then these young kids are going to
forget they're gonna forget about

1591
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,470
allergy and then he's going to sneak up
on them again and we're going to know

1592
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:16,870
we're going to be in on it and he's just
going to figure it out.

1593
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,790
How to get like people that just missed
the boat,

1594
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,520
they won't wanna know what's and he'll
be able to bank a bunch of them.

1595
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,110
He,
he can't release them.

1596
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:24,880
Well he have to do is attack a bunch of
them.

1597
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:29,620
Do like a several seasons worth before
he released any of it.

1598
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:32,630
Maybe that's what he's been doing.
Regurge red band.

1599
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:35,220
Think he saw him one night at the comedy
store hanging around.

1600
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,480
He's like,
then it disappeared and he thought he

1601
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:39,940
saw cameras and all that.
But knowing that nothing ever came of

1602
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:40,774
it,
he might have,

1603
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:45,610
but he got sued by a bunch of people.
Like he got sued by those young kids

1604
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:49,390
that he had on like where they were
saying would they say something that was

1605
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,730
racially inappropriate or something
along those lines?

1606
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,560
Yeah.
That lady with the poop sued too,

1607
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:54,580
I think.
Oh good.

1608
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,810
We're there.
The dinner party,

1609
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,410
is that Clean Jamie?
Yeah.

1610
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:01,640
When he's carrying around the Poop,
you can't be doing that.

1611
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,830
Was it someone's 15 yet?
It's super inappropriate because caveman

1612
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,570
with some bugs.
No,

1613
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:08,980
that's not butter.
It's just black.

1614
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:11,050
It's just bar.
We change things around.

1615
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:12,230
You know what happens man?
When I,

1616
01:16:12,231 --> 01:16:14,680
the butter coffee podcast,
I phlegm,

1617
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:17,400
I get coffee flamethrower.
I kept it cleaner.

1618
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,260
It's the worst.
It's super annoying.

1619
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,400
Annoying to me and to anybody.
Yeah,

1620
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:23,110
it is.
Right.

1621
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:27,130
How come we got off the archery subject?
We were finally like definitely on par.

1622
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,350
Uh,
you're a very,

1623
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,340
you're very advanced for an archer.
I don't think that's worth not giving

1624
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:34,660
credit to you for that.
Well,

1625
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:37,030
I'm only advanced cause you dude.
And for cause cameron hands.

1626
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:39,070
Well Cameron Hanes for introducing it to
me.

1627
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,000
You for a tightening everything up and
taking the time to,

1628
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:46,450
I mean even you have a guy who was an
Olympic coach and archery and uh,

1629
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,630
to get someone like you for a Dork like
me who just gets into it,

1630
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,950
you know,
it was really fascinated by it.

1631
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,160
I feel very fortunate to be your friend
because you,

1632
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,240
you've taught me some stuff that's
changed,

1633
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:59,350
like probably taking not just years off
of my progress,

1634
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:04,000
but changed it the right way.
So like it didn't matter like five years

1635
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:06,820
down the road,
I might be better at doing it wrong to

1636
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,920
the point where I kinda have my brain
calculated how to do it.

1637
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:12,680
I practice it enough so I can do it
wrong and still get away with it.

1638
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,980
You had a good detour.
Yeah.

1639
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:20,010
You literally went from a super cool
hardcore bow hunter to like,

1640
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:25,690
how do I become the best at shooting?
And then now you're Joe Rogan,

1641
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:28,660
the hunter.
Well to me it's a,

1642
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,750
it's like,
it's hard to say.

1643
01:17:31,751 --> 01:17:34,000
It's the most honest cause.
It's still,

1644
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:36,210
you're still arrow and an animal,
right?

1645
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,200
You're still using a weapon and you're
still killing it,

1646
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:43,201
but it's many levels of removement from
any other kind of eating meat,

1647
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,500
many levels of removement and this is
where it gets really fucking squirrely

1648
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:52,501
with people.
It's way more respectful of the animal

1649
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:56,470
than eating meat in any other way and
that that's hard for people to wrap

1650
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,840
their heads around.
I totally understand it.

1651
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:02,260
I totally understand that it's hard for
people to wrap their heads around and p

1652
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,210
I totally understand that.
If you're annoyed,

1653
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:06,430
it's me talking about it too much.
How about that?

1654
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:07,820
Wow,
I get it.

1655
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,180
All the hunters definitely appreciate
you standing up for what you're kind of

1656
01:18:13,181 --> 01:18:14,260
seeing the light on,
but

1657
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,570
well,
I would be a huge hypocrite if I didn't

1658
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:21,430
point it out because there's something
going on where people are deciding that

1659
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:25,240
there are certain executioners they're
allowed to kill your meat and then the

1660
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:27,670
rest of us are not allowed to partake.
And if you do,

1661
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,000
then you're some sort of a bad person.
If you let an animal exists in its

1662
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:34,840
natural state until one day with a ton
of practice,

1663
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:36,310
I know how much you practice.
I know.

1664
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,770
How long have you been shooting?
You've been shooting archery for?

1665
01:18:38,771 --> 01:18:39,604
How long now?

1666
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,440
Right?
At 32

1667
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,720
one year.
31 years.

1668
01:18:43,721 --> 01:18:46,420
Many of those years competitively.
And you still practice it every day?

1669
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,290
That's one of the most important things.
Well,

1670
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,460
I've

1671
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,560
competed.
I've competed.

1672
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:51,910
Uh,
let's see.

1673
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:55,870
Competed.
Let's say I've competed 25 years.

1674
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,330
Um,
but the reason,

1675
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,360
the only reason I competed was because I
wanted to make sure that when I was

1676
01:19:03,731 --> 01:19:05,860
hunting,
I was proficient as a hunter.

1677
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,390
That's the only reason I started
competing was I wanted to make sure

1678
01:19:10,391 --> 01:19:11,410
that,
you know,

1679
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:14,890
I remember going out the first time as a
hunter and finally having an opportunity

1680
01:19:14,891 --> 01:19:18,160
and then missing.
And I think I was a lot like you when

1681
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:20,850
you got into it and you realize this is
something I'm really into.

1682
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,270
You're like,
okay,

1683
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:25,150
how do I actually get good at it?
I don't want to go out.

1684
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,040
I don't want to go out and shoot
something.

1685
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:30,190
And you know,
up the butthole or whatever it is,

1686
01:19:30,191 --> 01:19:31,180
right.
You're like,

1687
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,220
I want to go,
I want to make,

1688
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,050
I want to literally make a good shot.

1689
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:40,150
I want this to be something that I'm
cool with and then I want to be able to

1690
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:44,530
enjoy the benefits of it.
So that's why I started competing was

1691
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,290
actually went to my first archery
tournament,

1692
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,180
um,
based on the side,

1693
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,320
a sign on the road.
I was driving down the road and I saw a

1694
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:57,250
sign that said,
and for those of you who are listening,

1695
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,980
um,
there was actually a cool little like

1696
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:04,450
documentary that hoyt did for me called
I am defiant.

1697
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,890
Yeah.
You were part of that whole post.

1698
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,730
Probably the,
if somebody programs.

1699
01:20:07,731 --> 01:20:10,440
Yeah.
If someone's listening and they kind of

1700
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:15,441
want to see my background and know how
kind of Joe and I came together that um,

1701
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,440
the,
I am defiant video from hoyt is really

1702
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:21,000
good.
You can find it on youtube.

1703
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:22,680
But um,
you know,

1704
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:26,940
I was supposed to play college football
and I was a bow hunter,

1705
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:28,680
but I wasn't very good at it.

1706
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,050
I didn't have anyone that really taught
me how to do it.

1707
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:34,440
I was self taught,
my dad introduced me to it and my uncle

1708
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:38,700
mainly.
And then I ended up going to this

1709
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,950
archery tournament based on a sign on
the side of the road,

1710
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:43,830
said archery tournament.
And when I went there,

1711
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I lost all my arrows before I'd finished
because I was so bad at shooting and

1712
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,800
being a,
you know,

1713
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:56,370
a person that was really wanting to play
college football.

1714
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:01,790
That was like the first time I really
felt defeat and just the competitive

1715
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:05,850
drive in me is like,
I have to do this right.

1716
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:10,740
So the people that won that tournament,
all of them had these shirts on that had

1717
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:15,240
the name of the shop.
So the next day I was in that shop and I

1718
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:19,140
was just watching these people shooting
and started asking questions and I

1719
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:24,141
realized that myself taught or family
taught way was just a way to get in.

1720
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,280
But then it just got so much more
diverse and I think that's what

1721
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:30,660
happened,
you know,

1722
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:33,690
for you.
Cam was like your uncle,

1723
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,210
he literally brought,
he brought you into,

1724
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,860
he brought you into archery,
right?

1725
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,000
And then,
um,

1726
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,833
once you're

1727
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:42,630
uncle cam nylon,
that'd be awesome.

1728
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,410
You need,
you need to do a,

1729
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,610
we need to do a,
he's like my crazy uncle that runs ultra

1730
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,444
marathons.

1731
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,180
We need to do a,
um,

1732
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,270
a photoshop thing with Cam and an Uncle
Sam outfit.

1733
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,700
But Uncle Cam,
uh,

1734
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:58,040
he brought you into archery and then
once you were there,

1735
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,420
you realize,
wait a minute,

1736
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:02,570
when I go out,
this is a huge responsibility.

1737
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:07,880
So how do I,
how do I go out and if I'm going to put

1738
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:12,830
this responsibility in my hands,
how do I make sure I'm 100% knowing I'm

1739
01:22:12,831 --> 01:22:13,150
doing it

1740
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,070
the right way?
Let me just point out that this is not

1741
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:16,750
because I didn't have confidence that
Cam,

1742
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:19,930
it's more that I am a junkie for
exploring options.

1743
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,570
And I get,
when I get into something,

1744
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:26,820
I start trying to find all the different
variations.

1745
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,370
I tried to find out who's doing what,
what are the target shooters do and what

1746
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:31,780
did this go like?
This,

1747
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:35,320
it's undeniable that Cameron Hanes,
like one of the greatest bull hunters in

1748
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:36,700
the history of human beings.
Right?

1749
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,260
So just becoming friends with him is
amazing.

1750
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:40,090
And I should probably just follow his
lead.

1751
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,600
Right.
But my thought is I know that that works

1752
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:46,570
and I know that works for him,
but I know that there's certain things

1753
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:48,160
that work for me that don't work for my
friends.

1754
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:50,830
Like I have friends that won't do yoga.
I fucking Love Yoga.

1755
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,080
I have friends,
I have friends who won't float.

1756
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:54,820
I fucking love floating.
I love it.

1757
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,410
You know,
you don't have to the loaded yet

1758
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,420
tonight.
You got to try it.

1759
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,220
Go try it.
Oh look it up.

1760
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,180
Okay.
Yeah.

1761
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,970
It's the greatest thing of all time.
[inaudible] it up next to like a four or

1762
01:23:03,971 --> 01:23:04,960
five things.
Yeah.

1763
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,130
What I'm saying,
I'll look it up

1764
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:10,210
and be knocking on like pull a bunch of
strings to make it happen.

1765
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,360
I'm gonna call a guy door to the
basement when to call a guy.

1766
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:17,260
You can put me in this dark room and
open it up after my plane leaves is one

1767
01:23:17,261 --> 01:23:20,890
of the greatest things of all time.
Once you do it you realize like why am I

1768
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:23,680
not doing this all the time?
It lengthens your body out.

1769
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,650
Everything just sort of relaxes and sort
of um,

1770
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,650
gives,
you know like there's like tight areas

1771
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:32,590
and your back besides like the mental
properties,

1772
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:36,310
the things that you can do mentally that
one of the big things it does is all the

1773
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:41,050
magnesium gets inside your muscles and
it's like a massive epsom salt bath.

1774
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,980
So everything just gets loose and is
certainly a smell in there.

1775
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,060
Yeah.
What salt?

1776
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,620
It's just a salt smell.

1777
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,880
You don't want to do dude,
I,

1778
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:53,970
I hold onto my hips like this when I'm
in it and I can make my back pop like a

1779
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,870
lat spread like I can.
Yeah.

1780
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:59,170
But I'm like pushing down on my hips and
I could feel,

1781
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,470
I could feel my back pop and looking at
the dude.

1782
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,210
It's strong.
V Big Man.

1783
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:07,560
I bet you lift weights.
I bet you do.

1784
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:10,600
I sling some K bs.
You got to get in there man.

1785
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:13,270
And um,
do you do any sort of decompression

1786
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:13,991
stuff?
Do you ever look,

1787
01:24:13,991 --> 01:24:18,820
hang by your ankles or hang like
actually do a lot of hangs.

1788
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,880
Those are great.
Two things or one thing I want to,

1789
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:25,090
I didn't say today,
but when you we were doing,

1790
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,760
I did that stock because you were tagged
out.

1791
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,810
So I did that stock had a really good
stock.

1792
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,810
If it wasn't a sow,
it was game over like that.

1793
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,300
You got within how many feet?

1794
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,830
I Dunno,
it was probably eight yards,

1795
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:44,230
nine yards.
When I stopped and came back and then

1796
01:24:44,231 --> 01:24:46,510
came back in,
the animal stayed in its place.

1797
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:51,310
So you were so quiet at 235 pounds.
You got to crawl through the grass.

1798
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,990
I got video of it.
It's kind of creepy.

1799
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:56,020
He told me I was like a Predator is a
fucking big predator.

1800
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:59,530
It's creepy to watch the holding your
bow and Arrow creeping up on these

1801
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:01,870
animals moving so slow.
But you know what?

1802
01:25:01,871 --> 01:25:05,170
I give credit to that for yoga.
Oh yeah,

1803
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:06,300
that helps.
Did you notice that?

1804
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,350
Did you ever,
did you put that together?

1805
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,200
When I was going,
well I know you've been doing it and I

1806
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:12,700
know you like it,
but I just thought you,

1807
01:25:12,701 --> 01:25:15,280
you're a big athletic guy.
I know you played football and I know

1808
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:17,410
you run a lot.
You mountain bike a lot.

1809
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,420
Yeah,
but that's the difference of your body.

1810
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:23,050
Slow movements is way different than
power.

1811
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:23,920
Yeah,
right.

1812
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:29,160
For sure.
So I think I really credit yoga.

1813
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:32,040
My wife started doing it and she kept
saying like,

1814
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:35,530
you really need to try it.
And then when I heard you talking about

1815
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,800
it,
I tried it and then now I'm to the point

1816
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,940
where I do it and it's,
I mean I wish all guys,

1817
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:46,270
but I think it's if archers could only
do one thing,

1818
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,820
I would say find a really good yoga
place.

1819
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,350
If they could do two things,
I would say yoga and kettle bells and

1820
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:56,110
then if they could do three things,
I would say yoga,

1821
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:58,780
kettlebells and God,
that'd be tough.

1822
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:03,550
I'd say weights,
but then heart rate is relative to take

1823
01:26:03,551 --> 01:26:04,040
cardio

1824
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,570
too.
But I just feel like your ability to

1825
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:13,571
maintain posture is really relative to
yoga.

1826
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,650
So like when I was stocking one thing
that you did that when I was filming and

1827
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:26,330
I stayed back just for sound,
I stayed back and let you do your thing.

1828
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:31,390
I've wished I was the guide at that
point where I could tell you because you

1829
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,680
were behind the guide,
so he didn't really know what you're

1830
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:35,600
doing,
but I was really wishing I could say

1831
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:40,601
like your bow instead of being sideways
where it's easiest to carry,

1832
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,050
it needs to be at the ready and just
when you're,

1833
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:48,500
everything you did need to be,
maybe it's your martial arts background,

1834
01:26:48,501 --> 01:26:50,870
but you were,
you know when we'll get on this subject,

1835
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:55,871
but you were going this way and this way
and this way,

1836
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:01,550
so you're like your angle of attack.
Even though it was in a straight line,

1837
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:06,380
it was still horizontal.
Whereas did you notice my angle attack

1838
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:11,381
was always at a posture to where I could
move 28 inches and I was where I needed

1839
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:14,444
to be draw,

1840
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,130
right?
Yeah.

1841
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,100
I definitely once,
once we talked about that afterwards,

1842
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,300
I got that.
That made sense.

1843
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:23,960
I did feel weird though about holding up
the bowl while this dude is front of me.

1844
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,030
I did feel weird about that.
I was like,

1845
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:28,520
I gotta have this point into the side.
I didn't feel right.

1846
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,500
Even though it takes a whole step to
pull it back and draw,

1847
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:35,600
it just didn't feel right to like have a
bow pointed towards some dude's back.

1848
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:36,800
I know it's stupid.
No,

1849
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:38,240
it's not.
It is sort of,

1850
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,760
but it's not because if someone tripped
or something went wrong,

1851
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,140
but I do think that um,
doing yoga has made my ability to move

1852
01:27:45,141 --> 01:27:46,730
slower,
better as well.

1853
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,220
I think it,
what I was talking about earlier about

1854
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:51,290
lifting weights and stuff,
it's nothing wrong with lifting weights,

1855
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:55,130
but I think there's an overlooked thing
that we were talking about in the car.

1856
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,850
It's being able to control your body and
that's what yoga does almost better than

1857
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:01,610
anything else.
The balance that you get in the,

1858
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,700
the ability to move your body and all
these different ways.

1859
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:08,480
It just doesn't seem as sexy as like
squats or dead lifts.

1860
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:09,314
Fuck,

1861
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,270
we do dead lifts if feels like you're
getting some shit done.

1862
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,800
You know,
I love dead lifts.

1863
01:28:13,801 --> 01:28:15,770
Don't get me wrong.
I feel like I'm getting callous.

1864
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:20,280
Has done like these babies are from
dental bell dead lifts dead well

1865
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,680
kettlebells.
I feel like I get more pressure on my

1866
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:24,840
forearms from channel that a lot of
hanks to right.

1867
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,550
That'll,
that'll definitely give you some houses.

1868
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,190
That's,
I mean for a lot of people,

1869
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:34,140
I think a very neglective movement and I
heard this on your podcast and I called

1870
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:34,831
you and I'm like,
dude,

1871
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:37,170
I do those.
It's just hanging,

1872
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:42,450
literally grabbing a bar and fully
extending yourself to where your bay,

1873
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,190
your body,
a long gates,

1874
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:47,100
your joints.
I think it just brings so much like

1875
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:51,330
lubrication to your joints and the
longer I hang,

1876
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:53,550
do you,
do you hear yourself adjust?

1877
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:57,810
Do you hear like little things?
Click hopping in my lower back too.

1878
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,050
Yeah.
Especially if I can get a place longer.

1879
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,020
We have a hard time getting way you
could feet could

1880
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:02,940
dangle.
See,

1881
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:05,310
that's the thing about being short.
If you get a good one,

1882
01:29:05,311 --> 01:29:07,880
you're freaking dangle.
You can do at the playground.

1883
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:13,110
I have to go to a freaking tough mudder
to get my feet.

1884
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,790
Do you go to a playground?
Some of these playgrounds,

1885
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,400
that goddamn brutal kids keep breaking
their arm and they've got damn monkey

1886
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:18,950
bars.
But yeah man,

1887
01:29:18,951 --> 01:29:20,280
I,
my daughter broke her arm and a monkey

1888
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:21,920
bars.
One of her friends at school broke her

1889
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:24,540
arm and a monkey bars.
I broke my arm on monkey bars.

1890
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:28,200
Monkeys buys or fucking dangerous man.
Well I want these kids bell from metal

1891
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:30,660
bars.
See when you're falling you're only

1892
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:33,480
phone a few inches.
It's different from everybody else.

1893
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:36,090
Maybe that's why I like my size.
If you fall off the monkey bars,

1894
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,640
a fucking long drop.
It's a lot of action.

1895
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,560
But when you can hang from something,
this is all from my friend Steve Maxwell

1896
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:44,460
told me all about this.

1897
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,770
He says,
we get podcasts phenomenal and he's

1898
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:48,270
like,
it allows your,

1899
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:51,570
your arms to like sort of loosen up
those joints.

1900
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:54,690
And give them some mobility and
flexibility and it makes a big

1901
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:55,141
difference.
Man,

1902
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:56,340
I made a huge difference.
Me.

1903
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,810
Soon as I started doing it,
it really changed when my shoulder

1904
01:29:58,811 --> 01:29:59,940
started feeling,
well,

1905
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:02,400
we both have had shoulder problems,
right?

1906
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,170
Yeah.
And just located mine.

1907
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,360
I didn't even know.
I did see I was the same.

1908
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,360
I dislocated in mine and it froze.
And then when I,

1909
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:14,870
when I was like too,
too ignorant to know that it was a

1910
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:19,230
frozen shoulder and I forced myself to
like talk myself into the fact that it

1911
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:24,030
wasn't a rotator,
then it went back in and that noise,

1912
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,260
it's pretty,
I mean,

1913
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:27,180
you know the noise,
the noise,

1914
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:29,070
man,
that was really shocked when I heard

1915
01:30:29,071 --> 01:30:31,170
that ours didn't clunk in.

1916
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,310
I told him,
remember it when I get sad,

1917
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,650
by the way,
the injury,

1918
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:36,600
like the way the inside tissue looked,
he goes,

1919
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,850
it looks like your shoulder was
disconnected just located.

1920
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,530
So I said,
are you sure?

1921
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:40,951
He's like,
yeah,

1922
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:44,490
I'm pretty sure it's like the way you
have these little bits floating around

1923
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:45,360
in there.
He's like,

1924
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:47,550
usually that happens when a shoulder
gets dislocated.

1925
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,700
Oh
Yeah,

1926
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,640
mine wasn't good.
I remember Sharon looking at me and she

1927
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:56,370
goes,
was that a good pop or a bad up?

1928
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:59,670
And I said it was,
it wasn't the good one.

1929
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:03,480
Definitely wasn't seat short faced bears
don't have these kind of weak ass bitch

1930
01:31:03,481 --> 01:31:06,420
body problems.
What those short faced bears,

1931
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,950
they don't have these bitch body
problems.

1932
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:13,800
Problems pull trees out of the roots and
beat people desperately have knee

1933
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:16,020
problems,
lower back problems.

1934
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:18,420
They get talk that would make them so
much creepier.

1935
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:23,940
No uhler fuck you telling me you
wouldn't have a short face bear here if

1936
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:26,970
you knew he wasn't like a mean one.
See you say that.

1937
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,580
But if he's a short face bear,
he's a mean one.

1938
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,710
That's like saying no,
no,

1939
01:31:30,711 --> 01:31:32,010
no.
That's rude.

1940
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,770
You can't just come up with a new way
him.

1941
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,030
He's a friendly shark.
Sharks I've encountered,

1942
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:44,070
I've encountered a lot of bears and
bears have personalities.

1943
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:48,870
I'm sure some bears have very short
tempers and their,

1944
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:54,110
you know,
their total like snap spazzes like Jim

1945
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,220
Miller just instantly snaps on you and
freaks out and then some are really calm

1946
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,060
like polar bear.
Yeah.

1947
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:04,450
Like a polar bear and then game,
they whole new.

1948
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,430
He's your buddy.
They cuddle you.

1949
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,490
They do all that stuff.
No,

1950
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,860
because the only murder the seals when
you're not looking,

1951
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,600
they only want you to watch watch.
I have to defeat they jack the scene

1952
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,860
going bobby,
bobby the polar back,

1953
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:21,950
beat
his murder in some seal choking down and

1954
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,220
getting back to surface and pretending
to be your friend.

1955
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:27,160
Just some P is everyone listening?
Census.

1956
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:29,440
Sarcasm.
Like I don't want to throw a Jim Miller

1957
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:30,730
under the bus.
No,

1958
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:33,640
Jim Miller is awesome.
What do you mean it sarcasm.

1959
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,920
Oh,
like they were just checking.

1960
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,990
Right.
Cause he's,

1961
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,640
it's hard to know.
They don't know your relationship with

1962
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:41,920
Mr. Miller.
He's an awesome dude,

1963
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:44,650
is as awesome as it gets guys.
They're all good.

1964
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,401
Yeah.
And you,

1965
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,080
uh,
you took him on a pig hunt recently?

1966
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:48,850
Yep.
Jim Miller.

1967
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:50,950
Who,
if most people who listen to this

1968
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:55,510
podcast to follow the UFC know Jim,
he's a one of the top 10.

1969
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:57,550
I think he's top 10 lightweight in the
world.

1970
01:32:57,551 --> 01:32:59,260
Just lost a really close fight to
dustin.

1971
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:00,094
Pour.
Yay.

1972
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:00,640
God.
I,

1973
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,920
so that was as close as it gets.
Yeah.

1974
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,490
Awesome.
Awesome fight.

1975
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:06,760
But if he's not taught townies,
certainly top 15 in my eyes,

1976
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:08,710
at least he is.
I'm saying top somebody.

1977
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,040
Well that's hard to argue honestly.
Cause he's,

1978
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:16,000
he's lost to some of the best guys.
And there's still Tony Ferguson.

1979
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:17,320
There's still habib number.
Good madoff.

1980
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,880
They,
those are the top two guys.

1981
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:22,240
They have to fight for the title.
But did he lose with he lost with a

1982
01:33:22,241 --> 01:33:23,580
close fight?
Yeah,

1983
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,310
no,
it's true.

1984
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:25,560
There's no doubt about it.
No,

1985
01:33:25,561 --> 01:33:27,520
he's an awesome fighter.
We talked about that.

1986
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:30,710
That was the first fight that I ever
watched and I,

1987
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:31,441
I'm,
you know,

1988
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:34,270
I remember the first UFC fights,
but that was the first time I ever

1989
01:33:34,271 --> 01:33:39,271
watched one where I felt I had,
I had vestments in someone and you know,

1990
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:46,420
I knew Jim was fighting for,
was that two eight cause I saw him fight

1991
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:48,610
at 200 and he stood on the cage and
then,

1992
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:51,760
cause I was sitting right behind you.
Any like,

1993
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:52,750
you know,
he said let's go.

1994
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,020
Yeah.
So how cool was that?

1995
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:59,380
It was very cool.
Is that you're sitting there and the guy

1996
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:01,480
just wins a fight in.
The first thing he wants to do is go

1997
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:05,380
over and point to say,
200 let's go out and that was so

1998
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:07,960
awesome.
It was so bored when both those guys

1999
01:34:07,961 --> 01:34:08,541
have done that.
I was,

2000
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:09,820
I was so happy.
I was like,

2001
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:14,480
it's so cool and I've got both of them.
Both of them are coming to Iowa in the

2002
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:16,750
fine for the Turkey belt.
One month they're fighting for the

2003
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:20,530
Turkey belt and I'm in there too.
I'm going to bitch slap those suckers.

2004
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,230
Turkey.
The Turkey belt is a thing that John has

2005
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:26,140
every year.
Our bitch knock on loud in UFC.

2006
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,000
I agree.
They should be.

2007
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,220
If I don't see,
they don't know what's coming.

2008
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:32,530
Wait until this bitch supposed to have a
closed hand,

2009
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:34,760
but you can slap some on the side of the
head though.

2010
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:37,210
Dude.
I'm going to put all 15 inches.

2011
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:39,610
This bitch slap right across both of
them.

2012
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,770
I think it's probably better to punch
someone.

2013
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,050
Otherwise people would just be bitch
slap and people.

2014
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:47,200
They used to be an organization called
pancreas and they used to only bitch

2015
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:49,000
slap for real.
Yeah.

2016
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:50,920
Yeah.
Pancreas was not allowed to strike with

2017
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:53,510
a closed fist except to the body.
But uh,

2018
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,390
they could head kick.
It was crazy.

2019
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,910
They fucked up and they made the rules
that perfectly

2020
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,610
fit boss route and style.
Bas rutten,

2021
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:05,030
who was UFC heavyweight champion too,
who beat till she [inaudible] back in

2022
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:07,160
the day,
Bas rutten was a just a murderer.

2023
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,370
His kickboxing was just terrifying to
these guys and he came in out of

2024
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,020
nowhere.
It was knocking dudes out with bitch

2025
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:15,770
slaps you never heard.
A boss is a friend of mine.

2026
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,170
Boss ruin is amazing.
He's amazing.

2027
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:23,350
He was the first like really technical
animal striker to fight in the UFC.

2028
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:27,680
Actually Maury Smith was a really super
solid technical striker.

2029
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:28,960
Good Bitch.
Slap or dude,

2030
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:31,010
look at that bitch.
Look at that mid.

2031
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,150
If it had to be done,
I'm 65 bring your mid up against mine.

2032
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:36,440
Yeah,
they,

2033
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,780
they're the wrongs.
If you got,

2034
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,470
if the camera will.
Seriously,

2035
01:35:39,471 --> 01:35:43,040
they're the same size,
but they're the wrong size for my body.

2036
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:46,400
My mother smoked when I was a child.
I don't know,

2037
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,090
Dude.

2038
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:49,520
I think you had some silver back in your
background.

2039
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:50,870
Well,
if I had a guest,

2040
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,460
someone fucked him monkey when they
shouldn't have,

2041
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,070
you know some of those like,
can I still fuck monkeys?

2042
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,180
No,
you shouldn't.

2043
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,580
You can,
but don't feel like you should know

2044
01:35:58,581 --> 01:35:59,810
better.
Stop fucking monkeys,

2045
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:00,441
bobby.
You're like,

2046
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:05,441
come on one more monkey mind.
So some northeast Jew or a zoo,

2047
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:07,050
sorry,
g

2048
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:12,350
seven Dorothy Zoo.
Someone's going to take that out of

2049
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:13,240
context.
Yeah.

2050
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:14,413
Yeah.
That'll be a,

2051
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,310
that'll be a front page of the news.
I would assume if people came from lower

2052
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:20,180
primates,
right?

2053
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:21,950
If human beings came from lower
primates,

2054
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:23,540
which they think we did,
like,

2055
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:25,490
it couldn't have been a totally even
process.

2056
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,271
You know,
there's,

2057
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:29,660
there's people like I have always
wondered like,

2058
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:33,950
what is,
what is the ultimate form of the human

2059
01:36:33,951 --> 01:36:37,730
being?
If we came from some sort of a hominid,

2060
01:36:37,731 --> 01:36:42,320
some sort of a Australia pick his monkey
thing and became what we are now,

2061
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:43,070
right?

2062
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:45,770
What the hell are we going to be 2
million years from now,

2063
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,150
5 million years from now?
Like what is it?

2064
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,790
Do you think so?
Yeah.

2065
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:51,890
Hell yeah.
Why would it be like that guy?

2066
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,970
That guy's a douche bag to the hines.
He's invisible.

2067
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,190
Exactly what he's cheating.
He's not,

2068
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,460
he can't even sneak around.
Dude.

2069
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,020
He takes this bottom part off and he
doesn't have any genitals.

2070
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,720
That's true.
He gave it to me just for hunting.

2071
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,430
Yup.
And he'll do an alien.

2072
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:10,940
He'll do what's right.
He was doing a shorts and Agar hunting

2073
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:12,840
aliens.
It's not a lot like people hunting

2074
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,120
crocodiles.
Wait,

2075
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,770
see,
isn't it,

2076
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,360
would antis have a problem with Predator
came down when you say antis you mean

2077
01:37:20,361 --> 01:37:22,310
anti hunters?
I speak the language.

2078
01:37:22,311 --> 01:37:23,780
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go champ.

2079
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:26,600
A lot of people don't know.
Yeah.

2080
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,940
Um,
I think they would say open season on

2081
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:29,930
the Predator.
Makes Sense.

2082
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:34,220
So why that's the Salem is fish hogs,
first of all,

2083
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:36,380
because it's not we,
it's not from here.

2084
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,390
It's not from around here.
At a certain point in time,

2085
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:41,810
people get hog is not from America,
not from America,

2086
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:44,090
but at least it's from the planet earth.
Yeah,

2087
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:44,924
we can.
We can.

2088
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:48,350
It's got create shipments.
You're pushing the border while you were

2089
01:37:48,351 --> 01:37:50,180
pushing the border with Noah in the Ark,
right?

2090
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:52,970
Yeah.
There was supposed to die in the flood

2091
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:56,250
and put them all over the world.
Is that ice going further?

2092
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:01,950
Jamie chimes in fine,
but in these in,

2093
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,290
Oh man,
that's hilarious.

2094
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:08,700
Seriously though I d I know you cut
yourself short on archery.

2095
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:11,850
I definitely don't.
I enjoy it.

2096
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,410
Enjoy the process.
It's fun.

2097
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:15,120
But seriously,
joy learning,

2098
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,600
social media people,
they're actually jealous of the fact

2099
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,450
that you got cam to bring you to hunting
for sure.

2100
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:24,650
And then now you're getting like,
well,

2101
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,650
cause I don't really work on people's
bows.

2102
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:32,550
I've worked on friends bows and you get
a lot of bows.

2103
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,140
Yeah.
You said you hooked my bows up,

2104
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:34,980
dude.
I appreciate it.

2105
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,120
It,
you know,

2106
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,420
there's like people who are like most be
nice cam,

2107
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:42,240
take some elk hunting.
John's works on his bows.

2108
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,010
Listen folks,
not fair.

2109
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,440
Life's not fair to let them tell you,
man,

2110
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:47,670
dude,
they're fucking lying.

2111
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,740
Do you give,
say it's Finna get to do Jiu Jitsu with

2112
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:52,020
Bravo.
You get to do so machado stuff.

2113
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,910
What else do you,
who do you learn pool from?

2114
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:55,650
Um,
well I've,

2115
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:57,600
I've had a bunch of friends there were
really good at pool,

2116
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:59,610
but one of the big ones,
my friend Max eberly,

2117
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,640
he thinks the world's flat,
Wonderful Guy.

2118
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:07,320
A Max [inaudible].
He's a fantastic pool player.

2119
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:09,320
That was,
this is going to be at a Max.

2120
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:10,740
I'm like,
there's fundamentals

2121
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:15,610
cool that that mirror,
they don't mirror the consequences or

2122
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:19,840
the actions of archery,
but they mirror the mindset and the

2123
01:39:19,841 --> 01:39:24,841
proper form and the proper,
the proper delivery with the minimal

2124
01:39:24,941 --> 01:39:29,740
amount of like variables,
like muscle movement or torquing of the

2125
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:32,890
hand or all those things that is very
similar in pool.

2126
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,770
Like when you get really good at pool,
and I'm definitely not really good,

2127
01:39:35,771 --> 01:39:39,160
but when you get to a certain level and
people that are really good,

2128
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:40,750
they get this,
well,

2129
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:43,000
it's like I used to play eight to 10
hours a day.

2130
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:45,040
Like all the time.
You're saying you weren't good.

2131
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:48,580
I was never like world class.
I was never like even national class.

2132
01:39:48,581 --> 01:39:51,800
I was like always a b player.
Like at my very best I was a beat.

2133
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:55,070
This is totally being honest.
And then there was a players and there

2134
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:56,170
was pros,
right?

2135
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:58,570
I was never an a player,
but I learned how to get,

2136
01:39:58,571 --> 01:40:01,510
I got better and better.
And if I played for many,

2137
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:03,250
many hours in a row,
I'd start getting loose and I could run

2138
01:40:03,251 --> 01:40:05,350
some racks sometimes,
but it was never a real good player.

2139
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:08,860
But one of the things that I realized is
that when I played my best,

2140
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:11,680
I was barely holding the cue.
It's barely holding it.

2141
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:14,740
It's like I knew that the less control I
had of it,

2142
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:16,270
the more I could let the queue do the
work.

2143
01:40:16,271 --> 01:40:19,570
And I had it tuned into my mind and it
was all about being in the correct

2144
01:40:19,571 --> 01:40:22,150
stance,
making sure that you come through the

2145
01:40:22,151 --> 01:40:24,060
ball perfectly.
Meaning that like the delivery,

2146
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,430
the stroke,
where it's just this natural smooth

2147
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:30,200
motion.
And if you do that you,

2148
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:34,000
you get to this state,
they called dead punch or you get into

2149
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:36,570
dead stroke,
like some guys call it dead punched,

2150
01:40:36,571 --> 01:40:39,640
some guys called dead stroke,
but when you're in dead stroke you can't

2151
01:40:39,641 --> 01:40:40,420
mess.

2152
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:43,990
You see the ball different.
You see angles on the ball.

2153
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:46,510
You see when,
when you know that when you release the

2154
01:40:46,511 --> 01:40:48,310
cue,
when you let that cue go forward,

2155
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:53,170
that tip is going to smoothly striked
the cue ball and it's going to collide

2156
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,530
perfectly with the ball that you are
aiming at is going to go to the center

2157
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:59,440
of the pocket and it's going to roll the
perfect position and you might only be

2158
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:01,120
able to do that like a game or two in a
row.

2159
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:03,850
For me,
I never got into it where it stuck with

2160
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:07,300
me for like hours and hours,
but I had a friend,

2161
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:09,370
my friend Johnny B,
who I grew up with,

2162
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,880
grew up in pool with who was a hustler.
I met him when he was a pool hustler and

2163
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:19,450
he was this really fucking smart dude
who was good at,

2164
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,970
he was just,
he could play chess.

2165
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:26,650
He could do numbers in his head like you
could throw 500 times a thousand minus

2166
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:31,510
six divided by three he'd go forward 65
definitely before 65 but he could do

2167
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:32,920
that like it was,
it was weird.

2168
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:35,650
He had a weird math brain that I don't
understand at all.

2169
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:38,080
And he would get to the asperger's or
no,

2170
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:39,680
it was just a brilliant guy.
Just his just,

2171
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:42,550
his mind was different.
It's just a different mind.

2172
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:47,560
One of the first people I've ever met
who his mind was just so different than

2173
01:41:47,561 --> 01:41:50,050
mine.
Like the way he thought about things and

2174
01:41:50,051 --> 01:41:52,900
the way his brain would,
the RPM considered different?

2175
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,011
No,
no.

2176
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:58,390
He was normal street smart,
very street smart and fun and funny

2177
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:00,310
character,
but it's really a lot of different

2178
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:01,960
traits.
This guy who would get,

2179
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:05,740
he would get loose when we play pool and
for hours he would be in this dead

2180
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:07,120
stroke where it was just insane.

2181
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,960
Like you,
you couldn't,

2182
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:10,450
you people would gather around and watch
him play.

2183
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,150
They would gather around and was like,
you were watching an art form.

2184
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:17,230
Like he had this way of getting out.
He had his way of moving a ball around

2185
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:20,020
the table that was so smooth and
elegant.

2186
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:23,710
If you did it yourself and you realize
how difficult it is to watch,

2187
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:28,950
it's a different perspective.
But pool is is a beautiful art form that

2188
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,290
only the people who know how to do it
can appreciate.

2189
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:36,130
And I think it's the same with archery.
And one of the things about archery is

2190
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:41,230
if you watch a guy like yourself or any
of the top target archers and you see

2191
01:42:41,231 --> 01:42:45,250
those guys on the TV and the Olympics
and their aim at those spots and they

2192
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:48,100
release that Arrow and it goes to the
center at home,

2193
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:49,360
you're watching it going,
Yay,

2194
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:50,420
he got another bulls eye.

2195
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,180
Or again,
I misses and you're like,

2196
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:55,060
what the hell?
You're watching these guys do 10 in a

2197
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:56,020
row,
12 in a row.

2198
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,120
But when you do it,
you realize like,

2199
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,390
oh,
this is a mirror into the mind.

2200
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:06,490
This is one of many disciplines that are
Amir into the mind.

2201
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:09,340
You,
you get to peer into an area of yourself

2202
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:12,580
like internally,
and you get to figure out through these

2203
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:16,010
motions,
like where your mind's at and how to

2204
01:43:16,011 --> 01:43:19,780
discipline this,
this sort of process of learning and

2205
01:43:19,781 --> 01:43:21,670
getting better.
And archery is a weird one,

2206
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:23,590
man.
Where to seems like it should be so

2207
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:25,360
simple.
Like what's so hard?

2208
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,400
You put your arm out,
you aim,

2209
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,110
you let the Arrow go.
That's it,

2210
01:43:29,111 --> 01:43:29,810
right?
Yeah.

2211
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:33,070
No.
That's why this same thing.

2212
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:36,730
They're shooting at the same spot for
the same distance over and over and over

2213
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:39,010
and over again,
and it's insanely difficult and you have

2214
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:41,320
to be a robot.
It's insanely difficult.

2215
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:45,580
You have to re replicate your movements
and smoothness and your breathing is

2216
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:50,050
important and your concentration.
It's a fascinating discipline,

2217
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:51,310
man.
It's fascinating.

2218
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,160
And if I never bow

2219
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:57,160
hunted again for the rest of my life,
I would 100% still practice our tree.

2220
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:01,400
100% it's a form of meditation.
It is.

2221
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,830
It's a spectacular one,
man,

2222
01:44:03,831 --> 01:44:07,100
because it's so rewarding.
Like when were practicing,

2223
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,040
we were at camp practicing out to 90
yards.

2224
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:12,680
That was as much fun as hunting.
Oh yeah,

2225
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,910
I love it.
Yup.

2226
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,450
It's the the most fun way.
Was I in that,

2227
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,450
what was your Pool Guy's name?
Johnny B.

2228
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:21,980
Yeah,
and Johnny B zone.

2229
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:25,070
You're definitely in a Johnny B zone,
but you're always in a johnny b zone

2230
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:26,450
with archery.
It's very annoying.

2231
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:28,800
It's like he just,
we,

2232
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:32,630
we had a pie plate out at 90 yards.
This mother fucker like pop right in the

2233
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:33,560
middle of the pie plate.
I'm like,

2234
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:37,250
how the fuck can even see that far?
I can't even see what that thing is.

2235
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,240
I don't know.
You hit it.

2236
01:44:38,241 --> 01:44:39,560
You're lying.
I hit it a few times,

2237
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,030
but I miss it a bunch of times too.

2238
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:43,130
But,
but my point is that like you're,

2239
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,470
you're the,
because you're so technical,

2240
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,740
you're amazingly consistent.
And there's one I was saying earlier,

2241
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,450
like even though you've been doing this
for so long,

2242
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:53,360
you still practice every day.
That's the crazy part about it.

2243
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:56,720
That it is this discipline.
It's a fascinating discipline,

2244
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,460
you know,
and then start to,

2245
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:02,300
you start to really crave that.
Like you and I were talking with Steve

2246
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:03,830
About.
He kept saying,

2247
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:07,430
I want to get into working out,
but I don't,

2248
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:09,290
you know,
and there's all these buts,

2249
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:13,520
but you and I were saying,
dude,

2250
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:17,540
we're to the point where that is part of
our lifestyle.

2251
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,630
Yeah,
that's part of our daily routine.

2252
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:25,870
If I don't go to the gym,
it's to me if I don't somehow test my

2253
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:29,460
body each day,
whether,

2254
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,580
well one,
it's with archery,

2255
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:35,510
I test my body practicing and then I
also test my body.

2256
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:38,930
Whether I'm doing,
whether I do yoga day or kettle bells or

2257
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:43,160
whether I lift or whether I bike.
Either way it's a task,

2258
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:45,770
but that's,
that's part of my routine.

2259
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:47,420
No different than,
you know,

2260
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:51,950
our series lifting.
I have to brush my teeth every day life.

2261
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:55,250
I always want to see Harry every morning
before he goes to school,

2262
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:57,320
right?
You want to see your wife and you want

2263
01:45:57,321 --> 01:45:59,600
to talk to your wife and you know,
in bed or whatever.

2264
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,970
You always want to have that connection
time for you to sleep.

2265
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:06,800
That's part of a routine.
And once you get into that routine,

2266
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:11,150
your body craves it.
It doesn't want to miss that part.

2267
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,441
Well,
it's also,

2268
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:16,040
you can regulate through those.
And one of the things that I've noticed

2269
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:21,041
is when I've taken days off of a
exercise and I've done it many times and

2270
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:24,950
I did it pretty recently because I was
kind of feeling sick.

2271
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,150
I was like just kind of feeling kind of
crappy and my kids had colds and I was

2272
01:46:29,151 --> 01:46:29,984
like,
man,

2273
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:32,030
I might be coming down with something.
So I said,

2274
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:33,720
I'm just going to just chill out.
I'm going to,

2275
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:35,830
I'm just going to bathroom.
Go ahead by the war.

2276
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,670
I'd never be that guy who don't worry
about it,

2277
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:38,780
man.
We can make it happen.

2278
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:40,040
Bladders.
It's right there.

2279
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:44,480
Go through that door and golden.
Um,

2280
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:49,340
what was I just talking about?
Thank you colds.

2281
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,130
So what I did

2282
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:54,920
was I took like maybe four or five days
off work and at,

2283
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:58,950
which is super unusual for me.
I just said I feel just a little tired

2284
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:01,650
and I know this is going around.
I feel it trying to creep in.

2285
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,780
So I took extra care,
my health,

2286
01:47:03,781 --> 01:47:08,580
I took extra care to drink like a lot of
green juices and eat a lot of probiotics

2287
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:10,620
and I said,
let me just recognize what this thing is

2288
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:13,770
and catch it.
Did some breathing exercises so I never

2289
01:47:13,771 --> 01:47:16,680
got sick.
But what I did do is I took all that

2290
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:20,820
time away from working out and I started
feeling not so happy.

2291
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:24,600
Like I don't want to say I was depressed
because I definitely wasn't,

2292
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:28,260
but I felt a difference between my
happiness level.

2293
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,430
Then what my happiness level is when,
um,

2294
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:36,120
I'm blowing out all the stress when I'm
blowing out all the stress.

2295
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:39,600
Then I look at life as this.
I know it's not going to last forever,

2296
01:47:39,601 --> 01:47:41,910
but it is awesome right now.
Like,

2297
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:45,000
shouldn't I just smile and enjoy this
awesome thing right now?

2298
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:46,110
Yes,
of course I should.

2299
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:50,400
And so I embrace the awesome things
about this awesome life and try to take

2300
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:53,940
them all in as much as I can and just
enjoy the moment.

2301
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:58,080
But when I exercise,
that comes almost natural.

2302
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,600
It just feels like the thing to think of
the thing,

2303
01:48:00,601 --> 01:48:02,370
the way to do,
especially if I exercise hard,

2304
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:06,540
if I can get through a brutal workout,
the sky seems brighter,

2305
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:09,750
the air seems clean,
air people seem happier.

2306
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:14,070
I feel like I can change the way I
interface with the world around me.

2307
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,920
It's,
it's not just as simple as you know,

2308
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:20,070
you work out because it's good for you,
you work out it cause it's,

2309
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,600
it's good for life.

2310
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:26,870
And I just think it's so easy to fall
prey to our natural instincts to want to

2311
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:31,920
be comfortable all the time.
And I think the more you do that,

2312
01:48:31,921 --> 01:48:34,980
the mall more you fall prey to the
natural instinct of wanting to be

2313
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:39,981
comfortable at the time you deny the
observable Yin and Yang to the universe

2314
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:44,400
that the universe requires these moments
of discomfort,

2315
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:47,580
like hard workout sessions and in order
for you to feel good.

2316
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:51,630
And I also think your body has these
natural reward systems that have been

2317
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:56,160
implanted in us through millions and
millions of years of being whatever the

2318
01:48:56,161 --> 01:48:57,960
fuck we were when we were,
you know,

2319
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:01,020
millions of years ago.
I think people have these things

2320
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:05,550
embedded in their head and they,
there's a certain requirement of,

2321
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,740
of panic.
There's a certain requirement of

2322
01:49:07,741 --> 01:49:09,990
exercise,
there's a certain requirement of

2323
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,960
protecting your environment,
surrounding,

2324
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:16,350
recognizing the dangers around you,
like how much of that is left.

2325
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,770
Well if you grow up in the inner city
and it really gang infested crime ridden

2326
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:22,560
neighborhood,
it's way higher ramped up than it is.

2327
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:25,230
If you know you're a kid in beverly
hills and your parents are super rich

2328
01:49:25,231 --> 01:49:28,470
and their parents were super rich and
you don't understand like what it's like

2329
01:49:28,471 --> 01:49:30,200
to be in a dangerous place.
Yeah.

2330
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:32,370
Oh yeah.
I mean people were very strange.

2331
01:49:32,371 --> 01:49:34,770
John Jug,
John Dudley and we're very strange.

2332
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:37,530
Don Judge John,
I'm talking very well,

2333
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:38,990
a buddy of mine,
um,

2334
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,800
dusty filling up in BC one time.
Like what a great name.

2335
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:46,050
Yeah,
dusty Philly in the fillings are

2336
01:49:46,051 --> 01:49:47,320
awesome.
I love those guys.

2337
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:48,040
But it sounds like a

2338
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,250
character on a Stephen King Book.
He's awesome.

2339
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:53,230
Found a spaceship with Jeremy.
I'm gonna give a shout out to both of

2340
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:54,064
them.
Screw it,

2341
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,030
Jeremy.
No,

2342
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:57,580
he was also awesome.
What a great name for a Stephen King.

2343
01:49:57,590 --> 01:50:01,480
Both of them are always my camera people
when I'm up in BC hunting.

2344
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:06,040
And the problem with having a fulltime
camera person,

2345
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:09,280
it would be a lot like you trust in
Jamie with this podcast.

2346
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:14,281
If he was also potentially like a
personality of Jackass.

2347
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,970
Oh Wow.
You would think that

2348
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:21,580
I gave them my

2349
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:26,110
camera and they had it because they
wanted to make sure it was always

2350
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:28,480
charged.
The card was always empty.

2351
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:32,410
So when I get home and I load all my
footage,

2352
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,640
I have this

2353
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:37,910
now,
all these recoveries by my animals or my

2354
01:50:37,911 --> 01:50:42,911
hunts with them posing as don gently.
It's like the guy that you trust.

2355
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,360
Like when we trusted Steve,
we said,

2356
01:50:47,361 --> 01:50:48,830
hey dude,
get a picture of us,

2357
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:52,410
you know,
glass and over here and then all it is

2358
01:50:52,411 --> 01:50:56,000
is this big freaking beard taking
selfies.

2359
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:59,390
He took every reason he was pretending
to take our picture.

2360
01:50:59,391 --> 01:51:01,620
He took selfies and then we got it.
What the fuck man?

2361
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:03,440
He starts laughing and then he took the
pictures.

2362
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,810
He was a funny dude.
A really funny dude.

2363
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,810
He was.
He was real cool and really good at his

2364
01:51:08,811 --> 01:51:11,300
job.
He knew that place like the back of his

2365
01:51:11,301 --> 01:51:12,290
hand gesture,
guys,

2366
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:17,180
pleasure to hang out with.
He was made an awesome [inaudible].

2367
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,220
He did good.
Beautiful as well.

2368
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,210
Beautiful.
But um,

2369
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,180
no,
when I walked in you were talking about

2370
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:26,280
kind of the importance of the Yin and
Yang.

2371
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:30,390
It's a lot like that.
I think with any sport that's an

2372
01:51:30,391 --> 01:51:33,180
individual sport,
especially when it's a finesse sport,

2373
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,990
you have to,
a lot of times you have to lose control

2374
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:42,020
and especially lose the ego in order to
excel in the outcome.

2375
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:50,060
So like a lot of the ways that I coach,
I take away your ability to control and

2376
01:51:50,881 --> 01:51:52,410
then slowly bring it back to you

2377
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,740
and what people don't understand what
you're saying.

2378
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:57,320
Let me just explain to people that have
no idea what archery is.

2379
01:51:57,321 --> 01:52:00,590
If you're still here,
I'm just kidding.

2380
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:03,830
Millions.
But what I'm saying is that when you are

2381
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:06,260
learn our true,
one of the things that happens to some

2382
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:08,300
people,
I should say a lot of people as you get

2383
01:52:08,301 --> 01:52:12,350
something called target panic,
and that means like what you try to do

2384
01:52:12,351 --> 01:52:13,760
is you try to have a hole on it.
Here,

2385
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:16,390
let me explain it to people I think
because they don't know you.

2386
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:17,930
You get scared of it.
No,

2387
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,610
it's scared of the word good.
Okay.

2388
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:21,400
But it's a good subject.
Go ahead.

2389
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,520
Gets mice.
Okay,

2390
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:23,930
I'll be right here.
I'll explain to people.

2391
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:25,340
Then you'd come back and fill in the
blanks.

2392
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:26,990
Um,
it,

2393
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:29,480
people panic the other side.
There you go.

2394
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,710
Um,
they panic and they can't keep the spot

2395
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:35,690
look where they're supposed to aim on
the target.

2396
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:38,810
Like sometimes they're low,
sometimes they're to the left and they

2397
01:52:38,811 --> 01:52:41,840
circle it in there and then pull the
trigger and they freak out.

2398
01:52:41,841 --> 01:52:44,600
And it's weird because it becomes like
the psychological,

2399
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:45,943
um,

2400
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,360
sort of a trap that they fall into.
And it's really common with target

2401
01:52:50,361 --> 01:52:52,520
archers.
And I think something has to do with the

2402
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:56,960
monotony of continuing to stare.
At a spot and sometimes being dead on it

2403
01:52:56,961 --> 01:52:59,570
and sometimes not and eventually it
builds up in your head.

2404
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:02,570
We're trying to figure out how do I time
this thing where I hit that trigger

2405
01:53:02,571 --> 01:53:03,480
perfectly?
Well,

2406
01:53:03,481 --> 01:53:08,481
someone figured out a long time ago that
if you use a release that doesn't let

2407
01:53:09,591 --> 01:53:11,840
you know when the arrows going to go
off,

2408
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:16,400
it's a surprise shot.
Then all those tricks don't get worked

2409
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:18,650
into your system.
All the tricks your brain plays on,

2410
01:53:18,651 --> 01:53:23,651
you don't get worked into the system and
John has an amazing method of what in

2411
01:53:25,371 --> 01:53:27,260
what we're saying,
taking away control.

2412
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:29,380
So that's what it means.
You what you do by taking what you

2413
01:53:29,381 --> 01:53:31,820
controls,
you develop this tension release that

2414
01:53:31,821 --> 01:53:34,640
you're just pulling through the shot so
you can't anticipate when it's go on

2415
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,060
going off because the muscles are not
nearly as sensitive as the ones that are

2416
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,760
on your finger and anything that's used
to manipulating things.

2417
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,633
Yup.
You,

2418
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:46,650
you literally,
you minimize your focus on literally a

2419
01:53:47,971 --> 01:53:50,550
process.
So you occupy your conscious mind.

2420
01:53:50,551 --> 01:53:53,760
This is probably equivalent to most
sports,

2421
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:58,650
but your conscious mind,
if you occupy it with a fight or flight

2422
01:53:58,651 --> 01:54:03,651
syndrome or a fight or flight reaction,
a lot of times when people experience

2423
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:09,420
performance anxiety,
they're triggering,

2424
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,410
triggering a fight or flight experience.
Right?

2425
01:54:13,411 --> 01:54:14,880
So I mean,
even with fighters,

2426
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:18,600
even if they know how to move and they
know how to punch and they have a game

2427
01:54:18,601 --> 01:54:21,310
plan of how they should attacked a
counter.

2428
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:26,330
Mcgregor once say you get fricking
cracked hard with that left hand,

2429
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:28,710
you go,
your,

2430
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:33,840
your conscious mind goes from your
trainer saying slip and moves,

2431
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:34,770
slipping,
move,

2432
01:54:34,771 --> 01:54:37,620
keep moving.
And all of a sudden you get hit with

2433
01:54:37,621 --> 01:54:40,920
this thing that,
that occupies your conscious mind to a

2434
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:45,921
thought of fight or flight.
We'll now it starts thinking about what

2435
01:54:46,201 --> 01:54:48,270
you're doing and then all sudden you go
into attack mode,

2436
01:54:48,271 --> 01:54:48,510
right?

2437
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:52,470
And then your game plans out the window.
So it's the same thing with archery.

2438
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:57,500
You want to,
you want to occupy your conscious mind

2439
01:54:57,540 --> 01:55:01,350
with the process instead of a result.
So,

2440
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,030
you know,
that's a good way of putting it.

2441
01:55:03,031 --> 01:55:04,170
Yeah.
So we're,

2442
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:09,260
we're focusing a hundred percent 100%
and I've worked on you with this,

2443
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:13,890
I've worked on Aubrey with this on a
process and the,

2444
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,450
if you only focus on the process then if
you couldn't,

2445
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:22,260
if that ice shield was out there,
the ice wall and you could never see the

2446
01:55:22,261 --> 01:55:26,670
result,
I would guarantee you that the result in

2447
01:55:26,671 --> 01:55:27,950
the end would be,
you know,

2448
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:32,520
if there was someone on the other side
saying Joe Rogan is an unbelievable

2449
01:55:32,521 --> 01:55:36,270
archer because you never knew the result
you are on this side of the Ice Wall

2450
01:55:36,271 --> 01:55:39,150
saying I'm only caring about the
process.

2451
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:44,310
So I take away all the tools of the
which you've

2452
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:47,850
essentially those tools are what you
came up with on your own when you said,

2453
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:51,600
I want to get into archery and I bring
you into a process.

2454
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:57,050
And then once you understand that
process and I a hundred percent trust

2455
01:55:57,451 --> 01:56:02,451
that you know the process then all
sudden give you a tool to have ultimate

2456
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:08,460
control the result which is like what
you know for a year I worked with you

2457
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:11,370
and then in the end you came back to the
NOC to it,

2458
01:56:11,371 --> 01:56:12,140
right?

2459
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:14,180
Yeah.
That released that you use,

2460
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:19,240
well the just the release method of not
having any control over when it goes off

2461
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:26,060
like that made my archery alone without
the corrections and the form that you

2462
01:56:26,061 --> 01:56:29,030
did for me.
That made my archery alone more

2463
01:56:29,031 --> 01:56:33,120
effective and more satisfying because
like as we talked about like archery's

2464
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:38,121
is strange discipline and when someone
points out the pictures to you it's sort

2465
01:56:38,331 --> 01:56:41,570
of,
it sort of illuminates the process in

2466
01:56:41,571 --> 01:56:43,910
this weird way that makes the process
more exciting.

2467
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:47,000
Like everything you do,
if you enjoy doing something when you

2468
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:48,920
first start doing it,
once you get better at it,

2469
01:56:48,921 --> 01:56:52,670
you're going to enjoy it even more.
That's a big thing with Jujitsu Jitsu

2470
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:52,850
Jitsu.
It's,

2471
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:57,850
it's a huge part of learning and growing
with Jujitsu is trying it out,

2472
01:56:58,551 --> 01:56:59,990
getting good at it,
and then

2473
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:02,740
call up Jeremiah for me while we're
podcast.

2474
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:03,360
We'll do,
we'll,

2475
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,960
we'll set that up afterwards.
The Guy in 10th Planet De Moines 10th

2476
01:57:06,961 --> 01:57:08,130
Planet.
I'm going,

2477
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,480
you should do it.
It'd be fun.

2478
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:10,880
I want to do it.
And you,

2479
01:57:10,881 --> 01:57:12,630
you're going to meet some nice people.
They're not going to hurt you.

2480
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:15,720
I don't want my archery shoulders ripped
out of socket.

2481
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:18,510
If as long as you learn how to tap out,
super important.

2482
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:21,290
I can tell it to learn how to do that
loud to me.

2483
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,940
I do stuff on big,
but I'm willing to submit.

2484
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:25,140
You gotta do it.
Whoa.

2485
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,700
I'll do it.
Sounded super good.

2486
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,620
Ooh,
someone's a bear.

2487
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,110
Not a bear.
It's a bear at the top.

2488
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,650
How's that been?
The like the nomenclature in the gay

2489
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:36,870
community.
The bears a big furry one,

2490
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:39,270
but it doesn't necessarily mean he's
dominant.

2491
01:57:39,271 --> 01:57:40,170
Right?
Where did we go?

2492
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,000
You don't know what bears are?
No,

2493
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,130
he never heard about living in Iowa,
bro.

2494
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,440
Shooting the bows and arrows hide in the
woods.

2495
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:48,380
There's a category of,
uh,

2496
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:51,810
uh,
gay men called bears weight there.

2497
01:57:51,811 --> 01:57:53,700
Uh,
usually like bald,

2498
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,120
very hairy.
Get back to the NOC to your idea.

2499
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,013
I mean,
I'm not,

2500
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:00,480
I'm not saying that there's a problem
with it.

2501
01:58:00,481 --> 01:58:03,360
I'm just saying I'm venturing to the
area.

2502
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:06,600
That's not my expertise.
Well,

2503
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:11,580
the area of my expertise is bears.
That's uh,

2504
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,180
I've been,
uh,

2505
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:13,470
when was it?
What'd you call a bear?

2506
01:58:13,471 --> 01:58:16,830
Ologist
there's a name for him,

2507
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,330
right?
What does the term,

2508
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,100
the term was?
It persists.

2509
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,480
Is that the term for bears?
The,

2510
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:24,030
the technical,
you would know way more than me.

2511
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,950
I think it's,
it's an Ursus.

2512
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:28,800
The most stuff I learned is from my son
right now.

2513
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,220
Oh,
really?

2514
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:32,550
He's 18.
And he comes home with some crazy,

2515
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:35,130
crazy stuff.
He wants to be a veterinarian,

2516
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:35,880
right?
Yes.

2517
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,960
Yeah.
So that's good.

2518
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:38,730
And even study some shit,
dude.

2519
01:58:38,731 --> 01:58:40,500
We're going to,
we're going to Hawaii.

2520
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,670
Do you know about this?
The White Sand

2521
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:44,380
in Hawaii?
You know what it's from?

2522
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:49,770
I would assume it's from seashells to
look up what?

2523
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:53,500
The white sand of Hawaii look up what
it's from.

2524
01:58:53,501 --> 01:58:55,120
This is going to trip you out.
Oh my God.

2525
01:58:55,121 --> 01:58:57,630
I'm tripped out already.
So pumped and it's educating.

2526
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,500
Joe Wrote,
Oh,

2527
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:00,670
it sits bones.
Bones.

2528
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:02,670
What does it is in the salt and sea,
right?

2529
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:04,030
Right.
That's fish bones.

2530
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:06,550
Yeah,
the salt and say what now?

2531
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:09,640
The salt and size,
not really a soon as the primary cause

2532
01:59:09,641 --> 01:59:12,160
of the white sands of Hawaii.
What is it?

2533
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:14,650
Why are we playing games?
It's don't hide.

2534
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,090
It's parrot fish.
Shit.

2535
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,810
Really?
We're literally going to be walking

2536
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:23,020
around on deficoat.
Why white sand beaches are made from

2537
01:59:23,021 --> 01:59:26,530
parrot fish poop.
Oh my God,

2538
01:59:26,770 --> 01:59:31,770
I'm so pumped that I taught Joe Rogan
and some crazy is insane.

2539
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:35,860
That possible.
That's in that.

2540
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,710
Oh my God.
It just shits like crazy.

2541
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:43,150
The thing shit sand.
Oh my God,

2542
01:59:43,151 --> 01:59:47,020
it shit.
Sand does that thing eat like a reef.

2543
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,460
What is it eating?
You know?

2544
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:50,970
It was at a hunting camp.
It what does it eat?

2545
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:56,020
The sponges and oysters also produce
Pacific Ocean stand sand,

2546
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,930
but no animal.
This as proficient as the parent fish

2547
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:02,020
stomachs.
Damn.

2548
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:07,021
Meals past strikes bypass like a gastric
bypass or someone who has lower cost

2549
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:12,610
producing as much as 840 pounds of sand
per year.

2550
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,570
Q.
Imagine if your poor little asshole had

2551
02:00:15,571 --> 02:00:17,710
a process yours.
You're a big giant guy.

2552
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,920
Have your poor little asshole ahead of
over 840 pounds of sand per well.

2553
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,810
Let's break that down.
How many pounds is that a day?

2554
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:29,260
Because 365 days in a year.
And it's what is,

2555
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,340
it's more than double that,
right?

2556
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:36,250
Yeah.
What would a 40 pounds so that is more

2557
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:40,750
than two pounds of sand through your
asshole every day for a year.

2558
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:43,390
That's insanity.
Now that you're a fish.

2559
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,730
So think of that.
It's not even a person.

2560
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:48,460
It's a fish.
A little fish.

2561
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:53,530
It's pumping out more than two pounds of
sand through its tiny little asshole

2562
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,560
every day.
That's insane.

2563
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,090
There's never been a thing like this.

2564
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:00,590
All right,
well

2565
02:01:01,070 --> 02:01:02,320
come on man.
How old are you?

2566
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:03,830
How would the lighting dead?
Coral.

2567
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:07,610
How would that,
how would that translate to a 200 pound

2568
02:01:07,611 --> 02:01:09,650
man?
Can we do the math on that?

2569
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:10,761
Oh,
it'd be insane.

2570
02:01:10,761 --> 02:01:13,280
Run some numbers.
How big or one of these fish?

2571
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:16,970
How big is a parrot fish?
It looks small.

2572
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:18,830
It doesn't look that big.
Look cool though.

2573
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:20,093
His Lips.

2574
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:22,093
Yeah.

2575
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:23,980
No,
that's not Nimo,

2576
02:01:23,981 --> 02:01:26,320
right?
That's a clown.

2577
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:31,190
She had a whole new appreciation.
Mimo.

2578
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:32,183
Oh,
sorry.

2579
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,220
Oh,
gangster.

2580
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:36,460
Yeah.
You most have make it sand with this

2581
02:01:36,461 --> 02:01:40,490
little fairy tale.
A little double stilts skin nemos a boy,

2582
02:01:40,491 --> 02:01:41,960
right?
It sounds like a boy.

2583
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,880
That's kind of weird.
Ambiguous.

2584
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:46,250
It's Pat Chapman.
Then sucker out.

2585
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:52,130
What a trip that is from another planet.
Check out the beak on that sucker.

2586
02:01:52,131 --> 02:01:54,170
It's got a chicken beak,
dude.

2587
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:57,230
If there was a pond on the moon,
the Rhino Horn,

2588
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,250
that would be the number one article in
the history of the world.

2589
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,520
Check if that thing out was in a pond.
Look at the blue.

2590
02:02:04,521 --> 02:02:06,480
What?
The cammo.

2591
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,680
That sucker.
That's a whole new like UAA baron.

2592
02:02:09,681 --> 02:02:11,270
Cammo.
That's insane,

2593
02:02:11,271 --> 02:02:13,160
dude.
All you see is that eyeball floating

2594
02:02:13,161 --> 02:02:14,360
through the water.
You're like,

2595
02:02:14,361 --> 02:02:16,310
is that a set of milk dud?
No,

2596
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:17,690
it's a parrot fit.
Look at that guy.

2597
02:02:17,691 --> 02:02:19,970
He's got a green eye,
he blended and even better.

2598
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:24,650
Doesn't that thing look like something
that belongs in a different era?

2599
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:27,960
Yes.
Everything in the sea.

2600
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:32,930
It's 10 times cooler than on earth.
Do you agree with that?

2601
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:34,060
Ah,
it's hard.

2602
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:36,400
You get cool with an eagles.
What?

2603
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:39,700
You get cooler than an eagle?
Look at that thing and has a rhino bump.

2604
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:44,730
That's the rhino in the zoo that get its
horn cut off with like some cool lips,

2605
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:48,680
but dinky eyeball.
Here's what's cooler,

2606
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:49,300
buddy.
Eagles.

2607
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:51,310
First of all,
Eagles live in my world.

2608
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:54,550
Respect.
I'm all about the people that breed,

2609
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:58,610
that animals that breathe air next,
all those water breathing.

2610
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:00,520
Motherfuckers can kiss my ass.
Okay,

2611
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:03,130
I'm on team air breathers.
Second of all,

2612
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:06,790
what's gangster about the Eagle is the
eagle can manipulate three d space where

2613
02:03:06,791 --> 02:03:11,110
everybody else is trapped on the ground.
The Eagle has got a whole different way

2614
02:03:11,111 --> 02:03:15,100
of operating.
They can fly over and dive bomb on Shit.

2615
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:19,600
They catch fish with their hands.
They just swooped down in the river and

2616
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,820
Jack Fish with their hands and carry
them off.

2617
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:24,820
They're there.
They're existing in our world.

2618
02:03:24,821 --> 02:03:28,960
But not by our rules.
That's why they're the official mascot

2619
02:03:28,961 --> 02:03:30,070
of United States of America.

2620
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,840
Well,
let me,

2621
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:32,220
let me tell you this.
Please do.

2622
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:37,610
So I'm just educating you on what I was
fish pool baffled.

2623
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:39,720
Yup.
So get this.

2624
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:41,700
Don't blow my mind again,
John.

2625
02:03:41,701 --> 02:03:42,620
Dudley.
Dude,

2626
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:46,260
if you live with the 17 year old,
which you will soon enough,

2627
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,530
you're going look at that under water
iguana.

2628
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:53,150
Oh my God.
I was just affects the code.

2629
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:56,290
Those suckers,
they go 50 feet under water.

2630
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,340
You gotta watch the new planet Earth
two.

2631
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:01,290
That's where the first one.
I watched him get that thing.

2632
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:03,840
That is insane looking.
That looks like a monster.

2633
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:06,780
This is literally,
is this Pacific Rim two.

2634
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,880
Do you remember that little baby?
Uh,

2635
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,730
what?
Uh,

2636
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:12,780
the little baby like Guana running and
all the snakes are chasing it.

2637
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,780
That was from planet earth.
That's one of those getting hatched on

2638
02:04:15,781 --> 02:04:18,540
the beach and it's running to the rest
of it.

2639
02:04:18,541 --> 02:04:21,170
Like group real.
It was real clumsy.

2640
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:25,290
Iguana that we're looking at.
It's crazy.

2641
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:28,530
These things look like monsters.
It just small.

2642
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,540
That's why Godzilla was such a dope
movie.

2643
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:32,820
Dude.
You're going to learn so much cool

2644
02:04:32,821 --> 02:04:36,270
stuff.
When your kids are 17 type in this type

2645
02:04:36,271 --> 02:04:39,360
in um,
coral

2646
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:45,480
ejaculations on full moons.
You do you know about this?

2647
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:51,050
Thankfully No.
How dare you wait till you find out what

2648
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:53,760
happens on a full moon in eight o'clock.

2649
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:55,920
I don't want to know.

2650
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:58,970
He probably don't.
I don't want to know.

2651
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:02,870
I'm scared now.
It's like a bad hot tub at the Holiday

2652
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:05,570
Inn Express.
Isn't it funny that people are so silly?

2653
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:08,960
Like we know there's sharks in the water
but surfing is so much fun.

2654
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,820
Would take our chance.
Yeah,

2655
02:05:10,821 --> 02:05:12,920
absolutely.
That's with everything in life.

2656
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:14,720
Dance over the head.
There's risk.

2657
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,540
That's a big one though.
Short little ride.

2658
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,600
Did you find anything?
National Geographic had a special on

2659
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:28,180
corals.
I think it's like eight 8:00 PM on a

2660
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:29,143
full moon.

2661
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:29,730
Yeah.

2662
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:34,730
All I think coral like literally drops
it like it's hot.

2663
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,380
Really?
Yup.

2664
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:39,860
And how does it get the rest of the
coral pregnant?

2665
02:05:39,861 --> 02:05:42,150
Cause corals not like a,
it's not a plant.

2666
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:43,720
No,
I think it's,

2667
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,240
is it an asexual?

2668
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,573
Sure.

2669
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:49,420
I'm seeing this stuff called the corals
spawn.

2670
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:50,680
Yup.
There it is.

2671
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,930
Here's a little,
and after we looked at this,

2672
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:56,440
we've got to check out all the new shit
about the Great Barrier Reef.

2673
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:58,240
Whoa.
That is crazy.

2674
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,720
Look at that creature.
This is coral.

2675
02:06:02,250 --> 02:06:06,580
This coral orgasms.
That's what that is right there.

2676
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:09,670
Pretty low.
They go in those little holes.

2677
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:12,640
It's like that game at the carnival,
right?

2678
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:15,580
Isn't it?
Like the calm comes out in little balls

2679
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:18,250
and it goes in these round holes.
Jamie type in,

2680
02:06:18,251 --> 02:06:22,570
um,
moonlight triggers mass coral romance.

2681
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:26,050
Wow.
Yup.

2682
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:31,600
This is stuff you learn from when you go
to your seven o'clock breakfast with

2683
02:06:31,601 --> 02:06:35,110
your teenager and he's a straight a
student.

2684
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,293
Wow.

2685
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:37,971
And he's like,
Dad,

2686
02:06:37,971 --> 02:06:40,810
did you know?
Yeah.

2687
02:06:40,910 --> 02:06:45,810
The sunlight triggers mass coral.
I look how they put romance in quotes.

2688
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:50,250
It's equally correct till now how the
primitive animals,

2689
02:06:50,251 --> 02:06:53,490
which lack brains or I synchronize.
So their animals.

2690
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:55,230
Whoa.
Wouldn't they be,

2691
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:57,770
would that night be considered a plant?
Okay.

2692
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:01,710
This are people that say plants don't
have feelings.

2693
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,050
I don't know.
I mean seriously,

2694
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:08,360
they're saying it's an animal.
Boom.

2695
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,880
What constitutes that?
I don't understand.

2696
02:07:10,881 --> 02:07:12,650
I don't know.
Let's look that up in a second,

2697
02:07:12,651 --> 02:07:15,290
but synchronize the mass spawning was a
mystery.

2698
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,700
Um,
okay.

2699
02:07:16,701 --> 02:07:20,120
In today's issue of the journal Science,
researchers reveal that they have

2700
02:07:20,150 --> 02:07:25,150
isolated in ancient gene in the corals
DNA that can detect moonlight by

2701
02:07:26,211 --> 02:07:29,540
exposing the corals to different colors
and intensities of light.

2702
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:34,780
The team found the gene known as C R Y
two was most active in Appro,

2703
02:07:36,170 --> 02:07:37,400
uh,
crapo.

2704
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:38,533
Mm.
Uh,

2705
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:40,600
crobe Po Ra,
a cro,

2706
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:44,050
Paul Hra.
That's a corals during a full moon.

2707
02:07:44,470 --> 02:07:45,880
Wow.
Yeah.

2708
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:49,870
It encodes a type of protein known as
crypto chrome,

2709
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:53,170
which appears to trigger the corals
reproductive cycle.

2710
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:57,520
It's a wearable.
It's literally at 8:00 PM on a full

2711
02:07:57,521 --> 02:07:59,500
moon.
Certain coral,

2712
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:01,420
literally it's a werewolf.
We'll do dallas.

2713
02:08:01,421 --> 02:08:02,830
Getting back to what we were talking
about earlier,

2714
02:08:02,831 --> 02:08:05,710
about bucks,
about how strange they are that they

2715
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:08,830
only breed once a year for most of the
year.

2716
02:08:08,831 --> 02:08:12,700
There's no breeding and then something
happens and they all turn into fuck.

2717
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:17,750
Werewolf's crazy.
Now this bouncing a girl was through as

2718
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:21,770
humans.
There'd be a big sign up at 10th Plan

2719
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,750
Jujitsu.
Oh,

2720
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:24,430
it'd be giant.
Cause people would be like,

2721
02:08:24,431 --> 02:08:27,910
wait a minute,
you're telling me once a year I got to

2722
02:08:27,911 --> 02:08:31,690
be gangster and by the way,
everyone would take steroids.

2723
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,000
Okay.
If it was steroids,

2724
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:35,980
grew,
you antlers everyone and antlers,

2725
02:08:35,981 --> 02:08:39,640
how did no one would be,
no one accepts natural antlers.

2726
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:40,540
They would be like,
okay,

2727
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:43,410
all bets are off.
We're stabbing each other with weapons

2728
02:08:43,411 --> 02:08:46,270
to grow out of our heads.
I can't just play by the rules,

2729
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:47,410
you know?
Because when,

2730
02:08:47,411 --> 02:08:51,430
when antlers clash and deer and elk,
they kill each other all the time.

2731
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:53,890
Right.
You stumbled upon heck yeah,

2732
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:54,610
all the time.
Right.

2733
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:57,850
All of the thought of the time.
It's every year program.

2734
02:08:58,090 --> 02:09:00,940
Every year in Iowa on the different
farms that I hunt,

2735
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:06,120
I find either two bucks that are locked
together and dead or a buck that's dead

2736
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:10,370
kind of based on a puncture room.
Right.

2737
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:13,210
They fight.
Remember that we were actually,

2738
02:09:13,211 --> 02:09:15,730
when we were at that to hone,
we talked about some of the elk that

2739
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:20,790
people took last year and the manager
said that one of the bowls they took was

2740
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:26,080
because of the fact he had broke his
horn at one time and he grew that spear

2741
02:09:26,081 --> 02:09:30,910
out of the front and they said he kept
killing other elk because he,

2742
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:35,650
when he would fight,
he literally had this broad sword where

2743
02:09:35,651 --> 02:09:37,960
everything else had this like steel
mace,

2744
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,630
right?
Yeah.

2745
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:41,410
Everything else would,
they would co connect almost like people

2746
02:09:41,411 --> 02:09:45,790
like locking their hands to write and a
game of mercy and one guy had a fricking

2747
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:49,930
wolverines,
like a terminator two Frickin sword on

2748
02:09:49,931 --> 02:09:51,250
his arm.
He had,

2749
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:52,870
it was ridiculous and they're like,
okay,

2750
02:09:52,871 --> 02:09:56,680
we gotta drop t2.
It's just a fascinating thing that these

2751
02:09:56,681 --> 02:10:01,040
animals develop weapons every year and
they collide with each other and smash

2752
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:03,640
each other in the head and then they go
back to normal.

2753
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,110
Like nothing ever happened.

2754
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,700
It's a lot like guys,
we talked about this.

2755
02:10:09,730 --> 02:10:10,563
Yeah,
but it's not,

2756
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:12,910
if we could only do it once a year,
where would you go?

2757
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,740
If the quickening happened once a year
and every once a year everybody started

2758
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:20,650
getting crazy and horny and dude's
running red lights and he's breaking

2759
02:10:20,651 --> 02:10:22,220
into people's houses.
I'd go to,

2760
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:25,780
I'd go to my house and I locked the door
down.

2761
02:10:25,781 --> 02:10:26,760
It's not good enough.
You've gotta be,

2762
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:28,630
you gotta be able to stay awake because
if deere,

2763
02:10:28,631 --> 02:10:30,370
we'll let people,
people know how to open doors.

2764
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:32,410
I have to stay awake,
stay awake,

2765
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:34,070
you gotta I could stay away.

2766
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,860
You got to put like metal all around the
house.

2767
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:39,440
You gotta have all your friends over and
everybody has guns.

2768
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:42,920
You gotta you gotta keep an eye out for
the outside they would call it the

2769
02:10:42,921 --> 02:10:47,921
fucking people just couldn't help like
for for three or four days out of every

2770
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:50,450
year,
everybody just loses their mind

2771
02:10:50,451 --> 02:10:53,030
completely.
That would be the equivalent to what

2772
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:54,950
happens to animals when they were in the
Rut.

2773
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:58,910
Like we'd be talking about finding that
more dough and all those men were just

2774
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:02,030
jumping her.
What's at the purge that you wouldn't be

2775
02:11:02,031 --> 02:11:05,720
similar.
But I mean the quickening is not that.

2776
02:11:05,721 --> 02:11:08,800
It is a quickening just made him not the
quick a's.

2777
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:10,460
A weird one.
That's one of the ones that are,

2778
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:13,190
it's the idea that art bill always
brought up on that show.

2779
02:11:13,191 --> 02:11:14,870
Do you ever listen to the art bell radio
show?

2780
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:19,250
He's the best.
He's the best art bell was like this.

2781
02:11:19,251 --> 02:11:24,251
A late night
radio hosts a legendary late night radio

2782
02:11:24,561 --> 02:11:27,740
hosts that always entertained all these
people.

2783
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:31,520
He had these people on the show that
were psychics or they were big foot

2784
02:11:31,521 --> 02:11:32,331
experts.
Are they,

2785
02:11:32,331 --> 02:11:35,720
were they worked at [inaudible]
experience 2015.

2786
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:37,100
Yeah,
in many ways.

2787
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:40,370
In many ways.
I owe it to art bell and I did his show

2788
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,980
and uh,
when I did his show was a huge honor for

2789
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:43,461
me.
Like,

2790
02:11:43,461 --> 02:11:44,990
and I,
people are mad.

2791
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:46,490
So it was pretty,
they were said that I,

2792
02:11:46,491 --> 02:11:49,280
I,
it was some Ufo researchers got pissed

2793
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:51,900
off at me because I was saying that most
of what you see,

2794
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:54,290
but it's,
I'm still intrigued by the idea of alien

2795
02:11:54,291 --> 02:11:57,520
life,
but I think I'm done with that in that

2796
02:11:57,530 --> 02:12:00,860
what we're dealing with is a lot of
people that are full shit and they're

2797
02:12:00,861 --> 02:12:04,760
making things up and that's what's going
on and there's a lot of like these,

2798
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:07,400
these,
these images that people doctor up.

2799
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:10,660
Then it gets proven their doctor,
but they get into the mindset.

2800
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:14,140
They get into the Zeitgeists of these
people that believe in Ufo isn't,

2801
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:16,190
it becomes something that you wrote and
I was there.

2802
02:12:16,191 --> 02:12:21,191
I used to be 100% in on an area 51 on
Roswell and Roswell.

2803
02:12:21,450 --> 02:12:22,790
Yeah,
totally in.

2804
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,140
Yes.
I thought for sure.

2805
02:12:24,141 --> 02:12:26,000
Rabbit hole.
I thought for sure.

2806
02:12:26,001 --> 02:12:31,001
Hanger 18 in Ohio kept a Ufo that
crashed and Roswell's.

2807
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,190
Yeah,
I was convinced in the Roswell.

2808
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,750
Will you ever convinced to that,
Jamie?

2809
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:37,710
I've heard of things.
Yeah.

2810
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:38,810
Right,
pat?

2811
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:40,430
Yeah,
that's what they say.

2812
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:42,680
Wow.
Yeah.

2813
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:47,600
Hangar 18 was in a movie that has
terrible Ufo movie back in the say about

2814
02:12:47,601 --> 02:12:50,360
aliens,
but the idea was that who was the

2815
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:54,050
president during 1947 was it truman?
I think it was truman.

2816
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:59,500
He flew to New Mexico and then flew back
with the wreckage and they flew it in

2817
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:02,240
two separate planes.

2818
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:04,970
The wreckage of this aircraft history
came from another?

2819
02:13:04,971 --> 02:13:06,920
No,
most likely not,

2820
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,710
but that's probably what a lot of people
thought it was.

2821
02:13:09,711 --> 02:13:13,820
What they think it was most likely
either crashed weather balloon or maybe

2822
02:13:13,821 --> 02:13:17,240
some sort of a Russian Zeppelin spy
something or another.

2823
02:13:17,241 --> 02:13:19,240
They don't know what it was.
Yeah,

2824
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:21,230
well weather balloon,
not as that plan.

2825
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:23,510
Like one of those,
they would use these weather balloons to

2826
02:13:23,511 --> 02:13:25,970
spy on people and there was another
thing they did.

2827
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,580
This was a really fascinating episode of
Radio Lab.

2828
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:32,010
I wish I could remember it,
but they the name of it

2829
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,070
rather,
but they sent bombs in Japan,

2830
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:40,160
sent bombs over to North America flying
the jet stream and balloons and they

2831
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:41,760
land.
It was,

2832
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:46,760
the idea was to send bombs without any
soldiers across the ocean riding the jet

2833
02:13:47,851 --> 02:13:52,290
stream and they would land in America
and fuck people up and some of them

2834
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:56,040
didn't go off and people would find them
like when they would go digging around

2835
02:13:56,041 --> 02:13:57,840
for shit,
maybe some of the metal detector

2836
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:58,890
logical,
right.

2837
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,180
It's happened.
People have died.

2838
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:02,130
They blew up.
If you let a healing,

2839
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:06,840
which I did and like fourth grade I led
a helium balloon up with a letter on it.

2840
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:10,120
Oh Jesus.
And it said like whoever gets is,

2841
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:14,130
I'm from Johnsburg elementary school or
whatever,

2842
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:16,320
you know,
please write me back.

2843
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:18,480
And then people would get these
postcards and said,

2844
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:23,220
all your balloon landed in Ohio or
you're bleeding landon in Michigan.

2845
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:27,000
So it's really not that far off
mathematically.

2846
02:14:27,001 --> 02:14:29,670
Right.
If you knew how long healing would last

2847
02:14:29,671 --> 02:14:32,460
in a balloon versus the current of the
air staying,

2848
02:14:32,461 --> 02:14:34,230
guess it right.
Though they didn't have the proper

2849
02:14:34,231 --> 02:14:37,260
ability to guess it right back then.
But they did get some of them through

2850
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:40,170
and some of them did detonate,
but a bunch of them went missing.

2851
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:42,100
And people did find some of them.
But the,

2852
02:14:42,101 --> 02:14:43,860
the,
the episode is fascinating cause you

2853
02:14:43,861 --> 02:14:47,070
just think of the,
the crazy mindset of people,

2854
02:14:47,071 --> 02:14:49,380
like one of the first things they
figured out when they figured out that

2855
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:52,320
there's wind that travels in a very
predictable current around the world.

2856
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,480
Okay,
how do we fly something up there and

2857
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:57,480
drop it on the bullet?
Is it predictable though?

2858
02:14:57,690 --> 02:15:02,250
It is because it's a competitive
advantage in the game of war.

2859
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:04,980
You know,
and the war in a lot of ways becomes a

2860
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:05,510
game buddy.

2861
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:08,550
Rest of us has got the advantage.
Yeah.

2862
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,490
In that way.
But obviously not,

2863
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:16,520
um,
weapons military was 75% first.

2864
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:18,120
Yeah.
Right.

2865
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:20,380
They could get to us quicker with the
jet stream,

2866
02:15:20,381 --> 02:15:21,780
but nobody's using the jet stream
anymore.

2867
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:23,790
I mean they had a brief window to
kicking on the Internet.

2868
02:15:23,791 --> 02:15:26,040
Now will they use,
if they're going to use missiles,

2869
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:29,190
they're those like that's what scares
me.

2870
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:31,470
Like everybody's worried about Russia.
What about North Korea?

2871
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:34,050
Don't they have missiles now?
Isn't that Kinda Kinda crazy?

2872
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:36,330
Didn't he just killed his half brother
show glee,

2873
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:41,580
intimate one missile?
They were really excited when one got

2874
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:42,900
off the ground.
Dude,

2875
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:45,360
if North Korea was made out of diamonds
that right,

2876
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,820
weren't they really excited when one
went up?

2877
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:53,120
I think they fired one recently and it
went towards Japan and they were really

2878
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:58,730
super pumps.
So it's 2017 and they got one to Japan.

2879
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:02,190
There's just letting bitches know he's,
he's ready.

2880
02:16:02,191 --> 02:16:04,560
He's ready to launch.
But could you imagine if that place has

2881
02:16:04,561 --> 02:16:06,690
made out of diamonds,
how quick would be in there and fucking

2882
02:16:06,691 --> 02:16:08,010
everybody up?
They'd be like,

2883
02:16:08,011 --> 02:16:09,480
yeah man,
we gotta protect the world you don't

2884
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:11,220
need.
And these oil,

2885
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:12,840
yeah,
oil's good,

2886
02:16:12,841 --> 02:16:15,060
but diamonds are better.
If you get a whole country filled with

2887
02:16:15,061 --> 02:16:17,070
diamonds,
you'd have to get those two beers people

2888
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:20,340
on it about broadheads good broadhead.
It's not worth nearly as much as

2889
02:16:20,341 --> 02:16:24,060
diamonds.
North Korea missile explodes within

2890
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:26,520
seconds of launch.
US says that's what they would say.

2891
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:27,990
Yeah.
Say Yeah,

2892
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,640
that bitch just blew up.
Motherfucker.

2893
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:35,790
Probably like everyone at an outdoor
theater watching it and they probably

2894
02:16:35,951 --> 02:16:38,380
are required to watch it.
I wouldn't have imagined that.

2895
02:16:38,381 --> 02:16:40,960
That would be fake.
I bet that's what the one in that

2896
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:43,300
picture was that a Chrysler,
they get what they can get.

2897
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:46,060
It's probably a North Korea creation.
Chrysler Caravan.

2898
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:48,060
Who makes that?
That's probably a North Korea for

2899
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:49,030
action.
Wait,

2900
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:51,750
is that a rabbit or I can't even
recognize it.

2901
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,700
That is to make their own cars,
right?

2902
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:56,860
Wait a minute.
What?

2903
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:00,550
Korean missile launcher,
that's not even legit.

2904
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:02,470
Are you sure?
Yeah.

2905
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:04,420
What website is this?
NPR.

2906
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:06,220
Okay.
I bet you he's right.

2907
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:08,320
That's a Scud.
You think so?

2908
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:10,150
Yeah.
It says people.

2909
02:17:10,151 --> 02:17:12,010
What does it say?
People with news footage of her missile

2910
02:17:12,011 --> 02:17:14,200
launch outside the main railway station
and,

2911
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:16,270
well,
maybe this is just what they're shitty

2912
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:19,030
design looks like.
North Korea missile test failed just

2913
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:21,820
moments after launch Wednesday according
to us and South Korea.

2914
02:17:21,821 --> 02:17:25,810
Maybe they reproduced a Scud md bucking.
That just been an old picture they used

2915
02:17:25,811 --> 02:17:30,430
to use for my wife's bunking.
Why would npr do that?

2916
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:33,520
Cause it just happened today.
They didn't have an updated picture of

2917
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:36,640
Oh,
but don't be faking guys like Don John.

2918
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,760
Dudley will fucking call you out.
John.

2919
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,270
John,
Don Schlein this on my tongue.

2920
02:17:43,271 --> 02:17:46,810
Tongue's not arrived day today.
The Rye brain name,

2921
02:17:47,030 --> 02:17:48,990
you do this.
It's a good combination.

2922
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,830
It's Alfred who didn't watch,
we should keep this up because it's

2923
02:17:53,831 --> 02:17:58,250
almost four o'clock and uh,
we got to get some cooking to do and

2924
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:00,130
before we some not we.
Yeah,

2925
02:18:00,131 --> 02:18:02,860
we got some knock to hog.
The roast up.

2926
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:04,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2927
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,160
This is going to be interesting for
those of you watching who didn't know

2928
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:15,030
Alpha brain from on it,
the peach flavor specifically mixed in

2929
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:20,641
one bottle of water with a Yeti Rambler,
10 ounce.

2930
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:25,720
And today we're on the angel's envy
Angel's envy whiskey.

2931
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:27,670
Who brought this?
It's been here.

2932
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:31,060
It's been here a while,
but this is a very presumptuous name.

2933
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:34,060
Angel's envy.
That's the point of it can fly you.

2934
02:18:34,061 --> 02:18:35,560
Fuck.
They're like eagles,

2935
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:37,330
but they're like super tight with God.

2936
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:39,190
Okay.
They're not envious of your whiskey

2937
02:18:39,191 --> 02:18:41,260
lady.
Better imagine people saying that like

2938
02:18:41,261 --> 02:18:42,100
you're,
you're my whiskey.

2939
02:18:42,101 --> 02:18:43,980
So cool.
People wished they weren't even angels

2940
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:46,960
looking to join my whiskey.
What kind of whiskey and you selling,

2941
02:18:46,961 --> 02:18:47,890
sir?
Yeah,

2942
02:18:47,891 --> 02:18:52,120
we're behind Angel's envy.
For those of you listening,

2943
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:55,000
thank you so much.
But we do have,

2944
02:18:55,390 --> 02:19:00,010
we have the two of us have,
we want to enjoy something together.

2945
02:19:00,011 --> 02:19:05,011
It's called some wild pork roast and
angel's envy.

2946
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:06,880
I want you to know I'm just fucking
around.

2947
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,130
I don't really,
it's just a name.

2948
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:11,320
It's a beautiful name.
It's delicious whiskey.

2949
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:13,060
Are you worried about them being mad at
you?

2950
02:19:13,270 --> 02:19:14,530
I just want to be nice to people,
man.

2951
02:19:14,590 --> 02:19:16,900
So I'm trying to do in this life,
through this life,

2952
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:18,610
be as nice as many people as possible.
Thank you.

2953
02:19:18,611 --> 02:19:23,460
About the looking up the cool stuff.
James and awesome.

2954
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:25,620
Jamie is on top of the needle.
Jamie.

2955
02:19:25,621 --> 02:19:28,130
So bad.
Gosh you don't say

2956
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,690
a Jamie.
There's one jamie,

2957
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:32,840
you will do that.
Someone to perform similar functions.

2958
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:36,030
Yeah,
but Jamie say people say I want a friend

2959
02:19:36,031 --> 02:19:39,190
like a Joe Rogan and I'm like,

2960
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:41,990
he called me out on twitter.

2961
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:45,610
Yeah.
Cause I shoot a bow lane.

2962
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:47,810
It's all right man.
Everybody gets drunk.

2963
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,680
I'm down with,
I'll say

2964
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:51,420
is how

2965
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,980
his,
he got bombed and then called me out on

2966
02:19:53,981 --> 02:19:54,450
twitter.

2967
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:54,901
No,
no,

2968
02:19:54,901 --> 02:19:57,060
no.
It's been very important to me,

2969
02:19:57,061 --> 02:19:58,770
man.
It helped me a lot tremendously.

2970
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:01,350
And I think it's cool that you put all
that stuff online.

2971
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:03,690
So recovery just telling you,
okay,

2972
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,270
podcasting is about conversation,
man.

2973
02:20:06,810 --> 02:20:10,410
It's about just talk and occasionally
you want to figure out who wins a fight.

2974
02:20:10,411 --> 02:20:13,860
Short face bear or one of them bears in
West Hollywood.

2975
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:17,910
I'm thankful you listen to my podcast
for sure do I do and I think,

2976
02:20:17,911 --> 02:20:20,040
um,
like people that are really interested

2977
02:20:20,041 --> 02:20:22,390
in archery,
like there's this rapper going to try it

2978
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,880
levels.
You can get down the rabbit hole,

2979
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:26,910
please try it.
Try to find a good shop near you and

2980
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:29,100
theirs because of John Lott,
other people.

2981
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:33,780
There's just some great resources online
so you can find out a lot about the art

2982
02:20:33,781 --> 02:20:36,510
of archery Zen.
The book of archery is what you

2983
02:20:36,511 --> 02:20:37,420
recommended.
That book to me.

2984
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:39,180
Thought it was really interesting your
take on it too.

2985
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:43,800
Like it seems like a guy who's not
totally there,

2986
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:46,350
but he's talking about it and he's like,
he gets it.

2987
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,840
But you didn't think it was written by
an elite archer.

2988
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:51,400
Nope.
See that so fast.

2989
02:20:51,401 --> 02:20:53,380
And it's funny,
as I read that book,

2990
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:56,320
because I listened to my first gre
Podcast,

2991
02:20:56,410 --> 02:20:58,740
I read that book,
um,

2992
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:03,400
in Mexico,
which actually youth member I laughed

2993
02:21:03,550 --> 02:21:06,340
like the same day you were coming in.
Totally.

2994
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:08,080
It was,
it was crazy.

2995
02:21:08,081 --> 02:21:10,930
And I read that book and then I told you
what my thoughts were on it.

2996
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:15,960
And certain parts of it are really cool
because there's certain parts of it that

2997
02:21:15,971 --> 02:21:20,971
I can relate to for sure,
but it's just like anything with yoga or

2998
02:21:21,641 --> 02:21:23,560
meditation or anything else,
there's,

2999
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:25,320
it's all state of the mind,
right.

3000
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:30,440
So it's also in a language that's
extremely complex and I don't think it's

3001
02:21:31,711 --> 02:21:35,050
the same.
I don't think their interpretations of

3002
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:38,490
what we call things,
I don't think it matches up with the way

3003
02:21:38,491 --> 02:21:41,700
they feel about things.
So when you translate something from

3004
02:21:41,701 --> 02:21:44,550
Japanese,
especially Japanese from I think it was

3005
02:21:44,551 --> 02:21:48,180
the 14 hundreds yep.
When Miyamoto Musashi wrote the Big Book

3006
02:21:48,181 --> 02:21:51,450
of five rings,
you translate from that to today.

3007
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,120
I think you miss,
you're missing a lot.

3008
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:56,820
You're also missing the reality of their
life,

3009
02:21:56,821 --> 02:22:00,630
the feudal life and death.
I could agree with that reality of sword

3010
02:22:00,631 --> 02:22:03,120
fights and that there's an intensity to
their existence.

3011
02:22:03,121 --> 02:22:06,690
That I think is very,
very difficult for us to quantify today

3012
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:10,860
and that book is it's,
you almost have to sit down and think

3013
02:22:10,861 --> 02:22:13,800
for a long time before you open that
book.

3014
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:16,800
You've got to put yourself and don't
just read the words,

3015
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:22,040
read the words and imagine that this is
an interpretation of someone's words in

3016
02:22:22,411 --> 02:22:27,411
Japanese who was maybe the greatest guy
that ever lived at fucking people up

3017
02:22:27,661 --> 02:22:30,990
with swords,
but he was really into calligraphy and

3018
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:35,520
he's really into art and poetry and he
was really into meditation.

3019
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,830
He was a ta and he was really in a mind
games.

3020
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:43,130
He was a totally different kind of a of
of figure because he seemed to me in a

3021
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:48,270
lot like when you're trying to like talk
about mastering archery or trying to

3022
02:22:48,271 --> 02:22:52,980
master Jujitsu,
there's things that are vehicles for you

3023
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:57,660
to try to develop your potential and
some vehicles are more extreme than

3024
02:22:57,661 --> 02:22:59,520
others.
Like our friend Cam Haynes selects to

3025
02:22:59,521 --> 02:23:03,770
run ultra marathons and then he wrote a
run the big foot 205 pound man,

3026
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:06,930
205 a mile marathon,
which is insane.

3027
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:10,680
I mean those people that pick those
paths like that,

3028
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,550
what they're in some sort of strange
way,

3029
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,890
people that pick these like super
extreme pass or kind of redefining what

3030
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:21,960
people are capable of,
you know,

3031
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:27,030
he and engaging with the most extreme
aspects of life there.

3032
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,540
The,
and then they turned life up to 10 and

3033
02:23:30,541 --> 02:23:32,970
then regular life becomes almost an
insufferable,

3034
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,230
it's really fascinating.

3035
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:35,950
Well,
like with me archery,

3036
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:39,560
it'd be 10 which most people can't even
relate to that,

3037
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:40,800
right?

3038
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,720
Yeah.
Most people have a hard time finding

3039
02:23:42,721 --> 02:23:44,520
anything that they really,
really sync up with.

3040
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:47,760
But what I think is that when you see a
guy like,

3041
02:23:48,570 --> 02:23:49,151
you know,
like a,

3042
02:23:49,151 --> 02:23:54,151
a super athlete like mighty mouse,
when you see a fully dedicated super

3043
02:23:54,181 --> 02:23:55,530
athlete,
when you see,

3044
02:23:55,531 --> 02:23:57,120
I mean there's a lot of consequences to
it.

3045
02:23:57,121 --> 02:24:01,680
Mighty mouse does extreme consequences,
but then you go one more level.

3046
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:03,900
And that sword fighting,
I mean these,

3047
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:06,780
these fucking people that live in feudal
Japan,

3048
02:24:06,781 --> 02:24:07,800
the Rowan's,
they would,

3049
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:13,220
he killed 60 something people with
swords and one on one.

3050
02:24:13,351 --> 02:24:15,840
You looking at each other and just
fucking chopping people up.

3051
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:19,070
Yeah.
Like mayweather's is may win a 39 and

3052
02:24:19,071 --> 02:24:24,071
[inaudible] 49 and now 49 and 49 and now
imagine them being that guy.

3053
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:26,330
Yeah.
It's another level,

3054
02:24:26,331 --> 02:24:29,300
right?
49 no in boxing and it's not up to a

3055
02:24:29,301 --> 02:24:31,820
judge that's up to us.
Sword.

3056
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:33,110
Oh yeah,
totally different.

3057
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:34,820
Well,
his style would never work.

3058
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:39,150
So I mean Greg or work a little bit
there because you're so vulnerable.

3059
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:40,850
Cracker or may weather.

3060
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,860
Oh,
we changed subjects.

3061
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:45,370
Um,
mayweather is a way better boxer.

3062
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:47,970
There's just no doubt about it.
He's one of the greatest boxer,

3063
02:24:47,980 --> 02:24:50,290
if not the greatest boxer that's ever
lived.

3064
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:55,000
And even though he's smaller,
you're talking about a completely

3065
02:24:55,001 --> 02:24:59,050
different level of skill,
a completely different level of

3066
02:24:59,051 --> 02:25:02,170
understanding of the subtle nuances of
boxing.

3067
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:06,490
But that said,
conor mcgregor is not incompetent.

3068
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:10,900
He's very dangerous.
Floyd mayweather is a way better boxer,

3069
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:16,380
but conor mcgregor is dangerous as fuck
and he has a really deceptive ability to

3070
02:25:17,561 --> 02:25:22,300
move in and move out.
He can cover distance very quickly and

3071
02:25:22,301 --> 02:25:24,070
he can do so a weird way.
He

3072
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:27,580
can do so in a way or he might stun you.
It might stay on you and you might catch

3073
02:25:27,581 --> 02:25:29,530
you early and he hits really fucking
hard.

3074
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:34,980
But if floyd can figure him out and
start using his jab and using his

3075
02:25:35,471 --> 02:25:36,191
movement.
See,

3076
02:25:36,191 --> 02:25:38,810
floyd has traditionally had problems
with south paws,

3077
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:41,200
but he's never lost one.
He's still,

3078
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:43,030
and he's talking about professional
boxers.

3079
02:25:43,330 --> 02:25:47,110
You also have the bigger glove factor.
Con is going to be wearing bigger gloves

3080
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:50,020
then he's ever fought in the UFC before
the UFC gloves or four ounces.

3081
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:53,830
Most likely if I was floyd,
I would insist on 10 ounce gloves.

3082
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:56,630
I would want this motherfucker to have a
lot of padding on his knuckles.

3083
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:59,050
I don't know.
I don't know if they're going to do

3084
02:25:59,051 --> 02:26:00,140
that.
I think the,

3085
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:02,680
I think everything below one that sucker
out.

3086
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:04,060
Oh,
you're so silly.

3087
02:26:05,190 --> 02:26:08,110
Wait,
what is the weight that they were above

3088
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:13,111
one 60 I think it's 10 ounces above one
60 and eight ounces below.

3089
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:16,390
I've been where you spin to counter
fights with you.

3090
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:20,920
He's incredible and all I can say is
when connor hits a guy,

3091
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:26,670
their face instantly shows the fact that
they don't know that it was really that.

3092
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:30,250
Is that fair to say?
They don't know that it was really that

3093
02:26:30,251 --> 02:26:33,010
meaning that he hit so hard,
like he stunned them.

3094
02:26:33,030 --> 02:26:36,220
I think what he's saying,
I know I'm going to get hit with that

3095
02:26:36,221 --> 02:26:39,010
left,
but when they actually get hit with the

3096
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:44,011
left,
you a person's expression reveals what

3097
02:26:45,161 --> 02:26:49,150
they actually felt and I think people
feel like it's harder than what they did

3098
02:26:49,151 --> 02:26:50,350
in training.
Well,

3099
02:26:50,351 --> 02:26:51,600
you know that people.
True.

3100
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:52,241
Yeah,
for sure.

3101
02:26:52,241 --> 02:26:53,920
Well,
you know that people could run faster

3102
02:26:53,921 --> 02:26:54,641
than people,
right?

3103
02:26:54,641 --> 02:26:56,410
You know there's certain people that
have special gifts,

3104
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:58,900
they have special gifts of athletic
movement,

3105
02:26:59,230 --> 02:27:02,140
and some people have in extraordinary
ways,

3106
02:27:02,141 --> 02:27:03,310
gifts have power.

3107
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:05,770
When it comes to striking and it doesn't
make any sense,

3108
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:09,940
but I've seen it from people where you
see what you think is hard and then you

3109
02:27:09,941 --> 02:27:12,250
see someone else and you'd go,
what in the fuck?

3110
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:14,590
Yeah.
Like there's a video of George Foreman

3111
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,360
hitting the heavy bag.
Right.

3112
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:21,390
And George Foreman was,
I don't know if he had fought Ali yet.

3113
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:27,040
I don't know when this,
I think this was before the Joe Frazier

3114
02:27:27,041 --> 02:27:28,900
fight.
My might be wrong about that,

3115
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:33,820
but pull up George Foreman hitting the
bag cause it's a really recent cliff

3116
02:27:33,821 --> 02:27:36,130
that's been going around.
Some people have sent it to me on

3117
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:40,060
twitter for sure.
Heavy heavy bags.

3118
02:27:40,061 --> 02:27:40,721
It was just,
Oh yeah,

3119
02:27:40,721 --> 02:27:42,070
you could see it.
You see the bag,

3120
02:27:42,071 --> 02:27:43,750
you see him it.
But you got to hear it.

3121
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:47,050
Listen to the sound of this when he's,
and he's winding up,

3122
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:49,540
no doubt about it.
But what he's not trying to work on for

3123
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:50,650
him,
he's just work on power.

3124
02:27:51,170 --> 02:27:53,900
Look at us,
literally been picked up his feet.

3125
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:59,080
You gotta you gotta see when they show
him really digging in c he's like

3126
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:04,660
swinging more prodigious site.
It seems to me that of all the people

3127
02:28:05,091 --> 02:28:07,130
I've seen hitting a heavy bag and
cooling Sonny Liston,

3128
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:12,610
no one ever hit it the way.
And he would just wail these full power

3129
02:28:14,481 --> 02:28:17,000
punches.
And when he would fight people,

3130
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:20,630
like when he fought Joe Frazier,
he hit him with punches that you could

3131
02:28:20,631 --> 02:28:22,130
tell had an endeavor been

3132
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,510
hit like that before.
Right?

3133
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:26,460
Like George Foreman moving his feet.
Look at this.

3134
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:37,950
Those last two are insane.
So his ability to single power punch was

3135
02:28:38,751 --> 02:28:42,290
so extraordinary that almost no one
could stand in front of them.

3136
02:28:42,291 --> 02:28:45,260
And we stay in that sort of a barrage.
That's a freak athlete.

3137
02:28:45,261 --> 02:28:47,540
And those come along and when those come
along,

3138
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,210
if they're smart too,
and then they're,

3139
02:28:50,211 --> 02:28:54,610
they're really good at learning the
sport to a lot of people were trash

3140
02:28:54,611 --> 02:28:56,630
talk.
And that's where conor mcgregor is.

3141
02:28:56,631 --> 02:29:00,170
He's a freak athlete in the sense that
he has this,

3142
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:01,710
there's a guy named for Rasa,
hobby hobbies,

3143
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:04,010
one of the best trainers in mma,
George Saint Pierre,

3144
02:29:04,011 --> 02:29:05,960
his trainer,
he calls it the touch of death.

3145
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:08,120
That's the best way to describe it.
He just,

3146
02:29:08,121 --> 02:29:13,100
he'll best time I saw it.
I saw when he hits people with that

3147
02:29:13,101 --> 02:29:16,370
left,
it doesn't look like you watched Brock

3148
02:29:16,371 --> 02:29:19,850
Lesnar windup and crack someone,
which I saw.

3149
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:24,530
And then you see conor,
which you don't even realize the punch

3150
02:29:24,531 --> 02:29:29,531
came in and then their face is like
swelling up instantly.

3151
02:29:30,051 --> 02:29:31,850
That's like what we just saw with
foreman.

3152
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:33,650
Yeah,
well it's extraordinary for sure.

3153
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:36,840
The difference between that and forming
is obviously foreman has big heavyweight

3154
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:40,910
gloves on and he's punching a bag that a
guy's holding and there's a lot of

3155
02:29:40,911 --> 02:29:43,670
padding between that dude in the back.
It'd be interesting to see someone,

3156
02:29:43,671 --> 02:29:45,660
when you see someone stand in front of
form and informal,

3157
02:29:45,661 --> 02:29:47,060
we hit them.
He was like one of the most

3158
02:29:47,061 --> 02:29:49,160
extraordinary power punchers in history.
They didn't,

3159
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:52,370
it was like,
have you ever been close to an airport

3160
02:29:52,371 --> 02:29:57,080
and you see a big like seven 57 coming
in and you're like,

3161
02:29:57,081 --> 02:30:00,200
is that thing going to fall?
He's too big to be a mom,

3162
02:30:00,201 --> 02:30:01,100
right?
Yeah,

3163
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:04,190
but that's what foremens when he would
swing,

3164
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:05,450
you would think,
okay,

3165
02:30:05,451 --> 02:30:06,380
that's not doing much.

3166
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:08,870
And then you would just see people rankl
yeah,

3167
02:30:09,380 --> 02:30:12,290
well he was at Swedish guy,
but not big by today's standards.

3168
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:15,410
I think foreman was probably only like
two 20 something back in the day.

3169
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:18,650
See if you could pull up George Foreman
versus Joe Frazier.

3170
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:21,650
He got way big as he got older.
When he came back,

3171
02:30:21,651 --> 02:30:24,710
when he was like super heavy,
like he wasn't well over 300 pounds and

3172
02:30:24,711 --> 02:30:27,050
he made his comeback.
I think he was like 36 years old.

3173
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:30,280
Nobody took it seriously.
Then you start blasting people and then

3174
02:30:30,281 --> 02:30:31,490
after a while people were like,
wait,

3175
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:33,610
what?
He just knocked out George Clooney

3176
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:38,450
possible for connor to look at that.
He was to 17 when he fought.

3177
02:30:38,451 --> 02:30:41,450
Joe Frazier was lighter to me,
but look up the video.

3178
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:42,950
It's lighter than me,
right?

3179
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:44,570
Yeah.
That's a UFC light heavyweight before

3180
02:30:44,571 --> 02:30:46,880
they cut weight.
Like John Jones probably weighs more

3181
02:30:46,881 --> 02:30:48,860
than that,
which is kinda crazy.

3182
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:53,410
But watch when he started connecting,
it's a quick fight,

3183
02:30:53,430 --> 02:30:55,070
man.
It's a quick fight.

3184
02:30:55,071 --> 02:30:59,570
George Foreman was fucking terrifying.
Just go like deep into it and you could

3185
02:30:59,571 --> 02:31:03,620
watch the pummeling he gave him on the
ropes is horrendous.

3186
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:04,790
Yeah.
When he hit him,

3187
02:31:04,791 --> 02:31:07,190
he just shook.
I remember this fight and he pushed him

3188
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:08,210
off and boom,
look at,

3189
02:31:08,211 --> 02:31:10,580
look at that.
That's like him hitting the heavy bag.

3190
02:31:10,581 --> 02:31:12,770
And the guy's just like,
what the Hell Dude?

3191
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:15,710
Look how fucking powerful foreman was
back then.

3192
02:31:15,711 --> 02:31:19,830
And look at that like that opera caught
when frazier collapses.

3193
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:20,810
Dude,

3194
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:22,740
play that again.
This is insane.

3195
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:26,400
He was just so murderers.
You saw my God.

3196
02:31:26,410 --> 02:31:29,350
It actually shook then before he got sat
map.

3197
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:32,490
Boom.
But this last uppercut here is dome.

3198
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:33,630
I mean,
come on.

3199
02:31:33,631 --> 02:31:37,740
It's incredible.
Foreman was scary.

3200
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:40,530
His hips.
He's so scary.

3201
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:43,050
Yeah.
Joe Frazier took a horrible shot.

3202
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:45,000
Now today they'd probably stop the
fight,

3203
02:31:45,001 --> 02:31:47,950
I'd imagine.
Cause he looked super wobbling and look

3204
02:31:47,951 --> 02:31:50,060
at that.
You would miss out like right there.

3205
02:31:50,061 --> 02:31:51,530
They stopped the fight.
Not will.

3206
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:54,810
It was a quick knockout man.
That lady got up that look fake.

3207
02:31:54,811 --> 02:31:55,880
Almost.
No,

3208
02:31:55,890 --> 02:31:58,020
it didn't look fake at all.
No Man.

3209
02:31:58,021 --> 02:31:59,160
You don't know what you're talking
about.

3210
02:31:59,250 --> 02:32:03,150
He's wobbly cause he's central nervous
system shutoffs wildly because of what

3211
02:32:03,151 --> 02:32:05,680
he took about 30 seconds ago.
Yeah.

3212
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:08,100
Not because of what he just took right
then.

3213
02:32:08,190 --> 02:32:08,491
Oh,
that,

3214
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:10,040
but that was part of,
that was why I said they would have

3215
02:32:10,041 --> 02:32:11,640
stopped the thing on the top.
Yeah.

3216
02:32:11,641 --> 02:32:13,350
But it didn't look fake.
It didn't look fake.

3217
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:15,540
It was a guy who just,
I don't say it's fake,

3218
02:32:15,541 --> 02:32:20,490
but I'm just saying we kept the,
because they kept the match going.

3219
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:22,690
It didn't take much to finish it.
Right.

3220
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:24,540
Boom.
Dude.

3221
02:32:24,541 --> 02:32:26,700
He was terrified.
He was,

3222
02:32:26,701 --> 02:32:30,840
I don't want it any more of these,
like cinderblocks dropped on my face.

3223
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:32,340
What was incredible?
Is it f you know,

3224
02:32:32,430 --> 02:32:33,360
frazier had gone

3225
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:34,970
15 rounds.
Muhammad Ali.

3226
02:32:35,150 --> 02:32:36,470
Right.
And then you see that and you're like,

3227
02:32:36,471 --> 02:32:38,300
wow,
this is a scariest guy ever.

3228
02:32:38,450 --> 02:32:41,750
And that's why they thought that George
Foreman was going to kill Muhammad Ali.

3229
02:32:41,751 --> 02:32:44,630
It was so depressing to people.
I remember when I was a kid,

3230
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:48,110
my parents loved Muhammad Ali.
It's like one of those things that

3231
02:32:48,111 --> 02:32:50,930
people,
the generation loved him because he

3232
02:32:50,931 --> 02:32:53,260
didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he
did.

3233
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:57,080
He wanted to like protest against these
senseless wars and so they stripped him

3234
02:32:57,081 --> 02:33:00,140
of his title for three years.
Like he was a different guy,

3235
02:33:00,141 --> 02:33:03,470
like he represented so much to people
back then in some,

3236
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:07,070
some sort of a weird way.
So when he fought George Foreman,

3237
02:33:07,071 --> 02:33:10,190
people were so terrified that he was
going to get beat up that hunters

3238
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:13,370
Thompson didn't watch the fight.
He was sent to Africa to watch the

3239
02:33:13,371 --> 02:33:15,740
fight.
He had tickets to be ringside at the

3240
02:33:15,741 --> 02:33:17,780
fucking fight to report for it,
for the rolling stone.

3241
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:20,650
You know what he did?
He just fucked around and and wore a

3242
02:33:20,651 --> 02:33:23,720
Nixon mask and climbing the swimming
pool and hung out all day and drank.

3243
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:25,550
He just did.
He's like,

3244
02:33:25,551 --> 02:33:26,930
fuck this.
I'm not going to go see that.

3245
02:33:27,050 --> 02:33:30,990
He was convinced that Muhammad Ali was
going to get killed and he loved Lamanzi

3246
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:33,620
legend die.
He didn't want to say it and he missed

3247
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:38,300
the greatest come from behind upset
victory.

3248
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:39,740
Right.
Arguably the history,

3249
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:43,100
the heavyweight division even bigger
than when he knocked out Sonny Liston,

3250
02:33:43,101 --> 02:33:43,731
the wind,
the title.

3251
02:33:43,731 --> 02:33:46,520
That was a big upset because everybody
thought that Sonny Liston was just this

3252
02:33:46,521 --> 02:33:49,070
fucking killer and this young kid talked
a lot of shit.

3253
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:51,050
But once sunny got ahold of him,
he'd be fucked.

3254
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:52,130
But nope.
Nope.

3255
02:33:52,131 --> 02:33:55,890
He his face honor.
So you don't know.

3256
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:58,550
You don't know because we'd never seen
conor box.

3257
02:33:58,551 --> 02:34:01,310
What would you say?
Maybe there's a way better boxer,

3258
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:04,340
but the consequences of connor hitting
you should be greater.

3259
02:34:04,341 --> 02:34:06,440
And I say should be because I think
he's,

3260
02:34:06,441 --> 02:34:08,480
uh,
he's certainly a stronger punch or than

3261
02:34:08,481 --> 02:34:09,250
mayweather.
Right,

3262
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:11,600
right.
But I would agree he has boxing gloves

3263
02:34:11,601 --> 02:34:16,550
on and know how much more of,
of an effect is his punch going to have

3264
02:34:16,551 --> 02:34:18,370
when he has a giant padded glove.

3265
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,421
You know,
I would,

3266
02:34:19,421 --> 02:34:24,100
I would assume there's going to be a
diminishing for sure out of the class.

3267
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:25,240
Yes,
for sure it was.

3268
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:28,630
But how much also the ability to block
punches,

3269
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:33,660
it's far easier to block punches when
you have big gloves on because when you

3270
02:34:33,881 --> 02:34:35,680
have big gloves on,
if you watch a guy like floyd,

3271
02:34:35,681 --> 02:34:37,300
he catches his shield.
Yes,

3272
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,870
he catches punches and he's,
or even deflection.

3273
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:43,150
And it's magical.
It moving away with them.

3274
02:34:43,151 --> 02:34:46,000
Like he gets hit,
it gets hit and he's hopping wait on his

3275
02:34:46,001 --> 02:34:48,010
feet.
So you're catching the end of shots.

3276
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:50,620
I don't know conner,
as much as,

3277
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:56,880
I mean I'm not a UFC buff,
but all I can say is I've seen conor

3278
02:34:58,031 --> 02:35:01,840
mcgregor shots go in when I didn't even
know they were going there.

3279
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:03,010
Oh yeah,
for sure.

3280
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:04,900
But again,
a four ounce glove is lighter than an

3281
02:35:04,901 --> 02:35:05,710
eight ounce clubs.

3282
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:07,930
The punches are not going to be as fast.
If it's a 10 ounce glove,

3283
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:11,680
it's definitely slower than it.
That's a good separation of boxing

3284
02:35:11,681 --> 02:35:13,060
versus UFC then?
Well,

3285
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:16,870
there's also a good separation of the
fact that there's many more openings

3286
02:35:16,871 --> 02:35:19,150
when you have smaller gloves.
We have smaller gloves.

3287
02:35:19,151 --> 02:35:20,920
It's much more difficult to cover your
face.

3288
02:35:21,370 --> 02:35:25,600
So connor has extraordinary power.
He's got extraordinary movement and he's

3289
02:35:25,601 --> 02:35:27,220
bigger.
He's a far bigger guy.

3290
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:29,560
I mean,
he's a big frame guy and he's strong.

3291
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:32,020
And Young Floyd Mayweather is 40 years
old.

3292
02:35:32,021 --> 02:35:34,030
He's arguably the greatest boxer of all
time.

3293
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:37,870
I mean,
he's a phenomenal craftsmen.

3294
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:42,900
Like the way he understands the art of
hitting and not being hit is

3295
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:47,870
extraordinary because he's not running
away from guys don't stand rice.

3296
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:49,263
Right?
Yeah.

3297
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:51,160
He'll stand right in front of you and be
untouchable.

3298
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:55,660
He's only been rocked like legitimately
rocked maybe twice or three times and

3299
02:35:55,661 --> 02:35:56,890
his whole career,
he,

3300
02:35:56,891 --> 02:36:00,130
since he's an outstanding,
if you took those away,

3301
02:36:00,930 --> 02:36:02,800
what if you took,
what if you took,

3302
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:07,420
when he got rocked versus when Diaz
choked him out,

3303
02:36:08,530 --> 02:36:09,300
do you think?

3304
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:10,750
What do you do about it?
We're talking about two different

3305
02:36:10,751 --> 02:36:11,800
fighters.
Well,

3306
02:36:11,810 --> 02:36:16,050
what do you think conor mcgregor got
choked out by new ideas or if he takes

3307
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:17,800
away where they got rocked?
No,

3308
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:22,210
I'm talking to when conor got hit pretty
hard when it came back.

3309
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:24,670
Right.
Versus when nate just choked him out.

3310
02:36:24,671 --> 02:36:27,130
If you eliminate nate choking them out.
Right.

3311
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:31,810
Do you think he's got the heart to,
to really stand through a full fight

3312
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:32,501
with mayweather?
Well,

3313
02:36:32,501 --> 02:36:34,630
he certainly does because he went
through a full fight with the,

3314
02:36:34,631 --> 02:36:35,890
um,
with Nate Diaz.

3315
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,260
He won the rematch and a five round war.
Yeah.

3316
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:40,040
Which was good.
It's you.

3317
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:43,990
You can never guess like anybody who
guesses what a guy has like as far as

3318
02:36:43,991 --> 02:36:45,730
heart and determination,
it's foolish.

3319
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,880
He'll show you with his actions where
she'll show you with her actions.

3320
02:36:49,150 --> 02:36:50,890
You can't guess.
So whenever people,

3321
02:36:50,891 --> 02:36:52,140
guests,
they start saying,

3322
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:53,770
oh,
he'll never be able to survive a tough

3323
02:36:53,771 --> 02:36:56,470
fight or he doesn't have the guts.
Then you,

3324
02:36:56,530 --> 02:37:01,060
you mistake like your understanding of
what you see in front of you for what's

3325
02:37:01,061 --> 02:37:02,860
going to happen.
And that's what a lot of people did with

3326
02:37:02,861 --> 02:37:05,590
Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman.
So a lot of people doing a lot of

3327
02:37:05,591 --> 02:37:07,600
fights.
One of the things that makes this fight

3328
02:37:07,601 --> 02:37:11,200
intriguing is we've never seen floyd box
a guy like conor mcgregor and we've

3329
02:37:11,201 --> 02:37:13,150
definitely never seen conor mcgregor
box,

3330
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:15,650
especially at a level that the UFC,
excuse me,

3331
02:37:15,651 --> 02:37:16,130
that floyd

3332
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,830
mayweather is at.
So him coming from being a two division

3333
02:37:18,831 --> 02:37:22,280
UFC champion will help his confidence.
He'll be scary.

3334
02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:25,670
And one of the things that he said that
that's a psychological thing that no one

3335
02:37:25,671 --> 02:37:27,860
could ever say to floyd before.
He said,

3336
02:37:27,861 --> 02:37:29,630
listen,
he goes,

3337
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:32,030
he goes,
the only reason why this thing is fair

3338
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:34,130
is because we're playing by books and
rules.

3339
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:36,590
If it was a fight,
I would fucking kill him.

3340
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:39,920
And the way you said it was like a
hundred percent accurate,

3341
02:37:39,921 --> 02:37:41,120
100% accurate,
and he,

3342
02:37:41,121 --> 02:37:44,360
but he said in saying that something no
one's ever been able to say to floyd,

3343
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:47,240
I will fuck you up.
Like in Floyd's going to know that at

3344
02:37:47,241 --> 02:37:50,120
any moment,
if connor wanted to just slide a little

3345
02:37:50,121 --> 02:37:53,660
bag and start kicking his face or
kicking his legs out from under him,

3346
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:55,370
he wouldn't know what the fuck to do.

3347
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:56,900
Do you think he knows how to block a
wheel kick?

3348
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:59,150
He's going to get kicked in the back of
the fucking head and say,

3349
02:37:59,151 --> 02:38:02,380
connor,
pop the referee and then just we'll get

3350
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:04,370
there.
You'd have to,

3351
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:06,260
you know,
he would have to get close enough to him

3352
02:38:06,261 --> 02:38:08,510
to do that and it wouldn't be as easy as
it seems,

3353
02:38:08,511 --> 02:38:12,050
but the distance between punching and
kicking is pretty substantial.

3354
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:15,170
Right?
Connor closes that distance in a really

3355
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:19,430
fast and really spectacular way.
He comes at you with Shit Front kicks to

3356
02:38:19,431 --> 02:38:22,250
the body and you're trying to figure out
where he's coming and what he's coming

3357
02:38:22,251 --> 02:38:23,630
with.
Very unpredictable.

3358
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:27,650
So I think in a boxing match,
if you have $100 and you have to bet on

3359
02:38:27,651 --> 02:38:30,650
someone,
so the odds are going to most certainly

3360
02:38:30,651 --> 02:38:33,080
favor floyd mayweather because it's a
boxing match.

3361
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:37,070
It was a fight.
It would be 100 million to one that

3362
02:38:37,071 --> 02:38:39,140
conor mcgregor would fuck him up.
I mean,

3363
02:38:39,141 --> 02:38:41,030
I'm not exaggerating it,
putting my course,

3364
02:38:41,031 --> 02:38:43,130
I'm exaggerating.
No one would give you those kind of

3365
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:45,140
odds,
but it would definitely be something

3366
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:47,600
ridiculous if it was a fight.
Don't you think?

3367
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:48,650
Like what would it,
wouldn't it be?

3368
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:52,100
It was a fight an mma how?
Don't know if I had to be 100 million,

3369
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:57,370
if I hadn't of seen conor live,
if I hadn't of seen counter live and how

3370
02:38:58,851 --> 02:39:01,910
people's faces looked when they got
tagged by him the first time.

3371
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:05,440
Right.
I would say I would put money on me.

3372
02:39:05,441 --> 02:39:09,260
Whether based on what you just told
everyone with 10 bucks to do,

3373
02:39:09,470 --> 02:39:14,470
but the fact that I've seen people get
cracked by him and I've seen their face

3374
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:16,820
swell.
Oh yeah.

3375
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,280
By him I,
I don't know.

3376
02:39:19,281 --> 02:39:21,750
I think he's going to freaking rock him.
Okay.

3377
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:23,600
A lot of people in America do,
and that's why we're going to sell it on

3378
02:39:23,601 --> 02:39:27,230
paper view.
John Dudley pay per view coming soon.

3379
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:29,000
Apparently they're trying to do it out
of here.

3380
02:39:29,001 --> 02:39:30,830
We got hog because before I got a
flight,

3381
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:33,410
they're trying to do it in September,
so that's what I heard on the Internet.

3382
02:39:33,440 --> 02:39:36,650
So I know as much as you people know.
I just think if it does happen elk

3383
02:39:36,651 --> 02:39:37,580
season,
yeah,

3384
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:39,800
it'd be a problem problem.
It's better as a problem.

3385
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:40,820
That's problem.
Thanks sir.

3386
02:39:40,850 --> 02:39:42,530
We got to get down here this weekend.
Yeah,

3387
02:39:42,531 --> 02:39:43,590
we got to cook up.
So Jamie,

3388
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:45,270
you're also pig.
Probably James.

3389
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:48,880
Beard and hat.
We'll be back tomorrow.

3390
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:50,330
The robb Wolf.
See you later.

3391
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:01,200
Okay.
