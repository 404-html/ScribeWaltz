1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello Freak bitches
like way over the line.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:04,891
Yeah,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,200
because then you can't do
critical government stuff.

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,790
It's still legal precedent that's set.

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,060
That then makes the craziest
shit possible where it's like,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,331
oh,

7
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,010
this is a words are violence.

8
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:14,910
These words are violence.

9
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,870
I'm raped now.

10
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,070
No one can say like,

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,350
our new president is horrible.

12
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:19,870
You know,

13
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,990
like now you can't even show descent.

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,000
It's all just a way to tighten the screws.

15
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,260
Don't you think that people in the left
or showing dissent more than like a

16
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,400
violent descent towards the president,

17
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,150
like really like,

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,070
angry,

19
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,360
like in a way that I can't
remember anybody doing
towards Obama now to the point

20
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,260
where it freaks me out.

21
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:37,981
Like they're like,

22
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,850
it's weird.

23
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,421
Well,

24
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:39,840
I didn't,

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,050
I wasn't obviously traveling
in the right circles.

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
Look for people that
really angry at Obama,

27
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,580
but even the people that I saw
online that are angry and um,

28
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,700
they were calling them in competent or
fool or spend it all of our money and all

29
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,320
this different accusations,

30
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
but not like what I'm seeing with trump.

31
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,400
Like I'm seeing just like flat out
insults from famous people all the time.

32
00:00:59,490 --> 00:00:59,821
Yeah,

33
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:00,511
and the media,

34
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,130
I don't get white people
totally trust immediate.

35
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,140
It's like you'll see them misrepresent
something in such an egregious way and my

36
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,720
dad is a rhetoric professor so it's
like he teaches a class in propaganda.

37
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,770
This is like my whole childhood
is learned about the shit.

38
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,490
I'm watching CNN.

39
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,891
I'm like,

40
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,724
you motherfuckers,

41
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,370
you know exactly like you
can misrepresent things.

42
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,630
So agregious Lee,

43
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,464
that I'm like,

44
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,380
of course no one's going to
trust you and that's a problem.

45
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:25,591
Right?

46
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,700
And it's not that you.

47
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,250
You don't wish that they were correct,

48
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,030
right?

49
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,890
It's that in them lying.

50
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,250
Even if you're on their side
more than you're on the Fox News,

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
CNN lies even a little.

52
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,250
Then it's fuel for the other side and
it vastly diminishes the impact that you

53
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,200
can have because you're not.

54
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,580
You're not trustworthy anymore.

55
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:51,030
So literally that's all you have in news
now is trustworthiness because everyone

56
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,350
can manipulate and photoshop.

57
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:52,771
Now that,

58
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,400
that,

59
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,720
that Audio Photoshop,

60
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,470
oh my God.

61
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,540
It's like you have to just trust people.

62
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,590
I can't trust anybody though.

63
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:03,570
It's real issue and an issue with an
issue with the left being so hyperbolic.

64
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,100
It's like when trump was first elected,

65
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:05,431
I was like,

66
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:05,611
ah,

67
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,420
sucks,

68
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,253
trump's crazy.

69
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,610
And then I saw their reaction and
almost like triaged it when I was like,

70
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,061
wait a minute,

71
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,751
what's crazier?

72
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,170
The guy that may like
texted dictator is Dick,

73
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,820
or like people like saying that
democracy is bad and I'm like,

74
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,650
this is a weird battle.

75
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,933
So,

76
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,220
but that stayed with me and then when I
started at quest and we were helping all

77
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:32,130
these kids are working with all these
kids and I saw how extraordinary they

78
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:32,340
weren't,

79
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,380
which by the way drug dealers,

80
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,530
some of them are amazing entrepreneurs
and so it became this notion in my.

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,641
It's unreal.

82
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:42,120
Did I'll tell you some stories sometimes.

83
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,660
Sure.

84
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,081
Absolutely.

85
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,914
Fucking crazy.

86
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,611
And I thought,

87
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:45,091
Jesus,

88
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,380
you're a better entrepreneur than I am.

89
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,480
Like they're telling me how they watched
like the cop cars and when they change

90
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:52,680
shifts and how they know that they're
being identified by their cars.

91
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:55,590
And so they changed cars
all the time as crazy.

92
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,460
And so I'm like,

93
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,180
Jesus,

94
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,830
it gave me this concept that
I called mining for astronauts

95
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,870
and I'm like in here,

96
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,291
in here,

97
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:07,291
somewhere in here being the ghetto are
some of the most amazing minds I've ever

98
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,500
come across.

99
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,730
And these guys could be anything.

100
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,660
It can be fucking astronauts,

101
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:10,871
right?

102
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,100
Like whatever they wanted,

103
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,020
but they don't believe they can.

104
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,330
And when I would interview
them it was nuts.

105
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,950
So imagine you're interviewing.

106
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,290
And I came up with just like a fast
weighted where I didn't have to think I

107
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,880
could just ask the same questions and
one of the questions was a magic genie

108
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,760
shows up is going to grant you one wish
and one in which only you can't wish for

109
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,301
more wishes.

110
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:28,991
You can't cure cancer.

111
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,160
Bringing anybody back from the desk.

112
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,360
I'd be something for yourself.

113
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
What do you wish for
universally to a person?

114
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,810
They all said a job.

115
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,171
Okay,

116
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,004
that makes sense.

117
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,690
If you think that's what I want to hear.

118
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,310
So you're trying to get a job so
you can tell me you want a job.

119
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,340
Then when we get past that bullshit,

120
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,890
and I tell you,

121
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,360
obviously that's not true,

122
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,710
like what do you really want?

123
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,000
Like what's the job to get you money?

124
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,570
Okay.

125
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,250
Do you want money or is it something else?

126
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,611
No,

127
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,090
it's money.

128
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,691
Awesome man.

129
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,460
It's a magic genie can
ask for whatever you want.

130
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,260
What do you want?

131
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,990
You know what answer?

132
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,640
Every single one of them gave me.

133
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,470
Well $1,000,000.

134
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,050
You can't buy a fucking
house for a million dollars.

135
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,770
K,

136
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,060
it was so crazy.

137
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,320
It's a magic genie.

138
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:02,710
Joe.

139
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,570
Like you can ask for a trillion dollars,

140
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,480
but their frame of reference was so small.

141
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,171
One guy,

142
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,360
this was like the one exception
said he wanted an airport.

143
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,370
I found that so weird.

144
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,481
So I had to push them.

145
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:13,931
That one I was like,

146
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:14,800
why an airport?

147
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,101
He said,

148
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,830
because business guys come through
the airport and I was like,

149
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,723
okay,

150
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,810
what?

151
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,280
What good does that do you?

152
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:21,581
And he said,

153
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,110
because then they can
teach me about business.

154
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,600
Nothing about that for a second.

155
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,160
How Fun

156
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,530
can many steps removed are you
from what you actually want?

157
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,360
But that's like they don't have you say,

158
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm a systematic thinker,

159
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,000
right.

160
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,610
So I had to learn that
that's not where I started.

161
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,200
So I spent thankfully one of the things
I'm most grateful for in my life.

162
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,520
I have to learn everything the hard way,

163
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,200
but because I learned things the hard way,

164
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,150
then I can show other people what I did,

165
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,270
where I fell down and how hopefully
they can avoid some of the mistakes.

166
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,190
That's what you need is,

167
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,350
is a

168
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,340
bathroom would adore that faces outside.

169
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,830
The worst is when you go over a girl's
house and you go to use her bathroom and

170
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:56,880
you smell matches.

171
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,080
Oh yeah.

172
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,771
Oh No.

173
00:04:58,771 --> 00:04:59,490
She was like,

174
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,690
this motherfucker up

175
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,260
tall.

176
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,910
You're thinking about
burning it off fumes.

177
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,143
Yeah,

178
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,041
just stinky.

179
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,690
But I hate about her.

180
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,990
Matthew ever get to a girl's place and
then you feel the gurgles and you're

181
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,843
like,

182
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,830
I could have had that before.

183
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,880
I was dating a girl once.

184
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,040
She had ferocious diarrhea.

185
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,510
Ferocious.

186
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,210
So she was seeing
regularly or just one time.

187
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,800
And she.

188
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,580
So she went to the bathroom and she just
turned on the shower and she turns on

189
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,020
both things on the sink.

190
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,160
Whoa.

191
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,580
Yeah.

192
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,200
I just tried to drown it out.

193
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,461
I'm like,

194
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,470
what the fuck is going on?

195
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,710
I was very young at the time.

196
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,544
It didn't understand what.

197
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,080
I was super confused.

198
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,610
What the fuck is going on in there?

199
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,683
I had,

200
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,710
I had once in,

201
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,560
in college where I was at this
girl's place and she was just like,

202
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,041
Hey,

203
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:47,760
it's game on,

204
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,593
like go for it.

205
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:48,830
Right?

206
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,450
It's like I have to take and I
could feel that it was a diarrhea,

207
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,550
explosive diarrhea shit.

208
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,210
And I also realized there
was no way to do it that,

209
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,860
that it would just a black toilet
and there's no way I could cover.

210
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,694
So you know what I did?

211
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,230
I went back to my place.

212
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:03,710
I was like,

213
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,410
I'll,

214
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,290
I'll see you some other time or whatever.

215
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,030
And the next day her friends were like,

216
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,960
you're like the fucking.

217
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,460
Like they gave me credit that they,

218
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,190
they thought that I was a good kid.

219
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:13,491
They're like,

220
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,170
you're awesome.

221
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,541
And I was like,

222
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:14,691
no,

223
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:19,010
I had to take my girls do that because
they're not getting fucked and they don't

224
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,000
want their friend to get fucked.

225
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,220
Right.

226
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,830
So they used reverse psychology on you.

227
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,940
You're an amazing guy.

228
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,781
Got An amazing guy.

229
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,220
Credit.

230
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,920
Help you.

231
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,300
Wait forever is so cool that you left.

232
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,400
Even when you get married.

233
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,990
Tell her we'd get married

234
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,600
to have sex after you're married.

235
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,060
It's not about that.

236
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,500
It's about real love.

237
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,060
Twilight love.

238
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,460
If I had had bowels that were intact,

239
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,020
it would have been a
different story that night.

240
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,770
Owls,

241
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,603
bowels,

242
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,430
bowels.

243
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,170
Yeah.

244
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,330
Yeah.

245
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,030
There's a time when you know that it's.

246
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,510
And the sensitivity of
your inner asshole region.

247
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,801
It is.

248
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,490
It knows.

249
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,200
Especially when you go to seep out a Fart,

250
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,771
right?

251
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,790
When you like you like
about to cut a fart.

252
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,730
And then also the alarms start going off.

253
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,620
Oh No.

254
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,170
Oh yeah.

255
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,720
Oh No.

256
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,590
You got to clamp shot.

257
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,180
You're like,

258
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,781
Jesus,

259
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,500
what is this?

260
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,770
We were having this debate yesterday
about why are they sometimes hot,

261
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,330
like why is it hot?

262
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,230
And then why does,

263
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,320
why do you know that hot is going
to smell bad spicy food bro?

264
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:12,771
Is it?

265
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:13,604
But is that what it is?

266
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,450
Solely imagine?

267
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,320
I don't know.

268
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,500
I,

269
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:16,690
I'm,

270
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm,

271
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,130
I was telling you guys at
one time my freshman year,

272
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,650
I didn't take a ship
for a week and a half.

273
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,940
I was addicted this fake,

274
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,040
right?

275
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,873
French fries.

276
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,343
Listen to me.

277
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,390
How long is that?

278
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,140
I was in when I was five.

279
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,680
I played freshman ball and we
were playing paterson eastside.

280
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,460
Wait,

281
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,810
just a jungle over school.

282
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,540
Like you gotta be careful
when you're going there.

283
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,020
And we went there to play
the Christmas tournament.

284
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,930
Well,

285
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,220
what kind of ball are
we talking right now?

286
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,370
Basketball and I hadn't taken a
shift for like 10 days or something.

287
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,091
I took acid.

288
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,340
Something fucked my stomach up.

289
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,400
I didn't tell nobody.

290
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,510
In those days I was really scared of
doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody.

291
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,951
Way Home.

292
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:00,820
We got on the bus

293
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,710
and while we will wait that
my stomach started hurting.

294
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,301
I said,

295
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,170
Jesus Christ,

296
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,680
I don't know if I'm going
to shit myself a fort,

297
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,340
but let me just take a chance.

298
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,270
Good move,

299
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,280
and I blew this fart Joe Rogan.

300
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,260
That was so bad,

301
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,460
right?

302
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,420
We want a bus,

303
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,380
and people started running.

304
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,490
You know the school buses.

305
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,200
People started running to the windows
right to swing down the bus windows,

306
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,280
but he is what you to by the father.

307
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,143
Again,

308
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,850
as the teachers would go,

309
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,511
oh my God,

310
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,540
he's changing flavors.

311
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:32,640
Yeah,

312
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,473
but

313
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,430
what's the worst thing was
the cheerleaders are crying.

314
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,640
That's how bad it was sitting
in front of the bus going,

315
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,260
changing teachers yelled,

316
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,521
oh my God,

317
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,354
he's changing.

318
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,020
That's how bad it was.
