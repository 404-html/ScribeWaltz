00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,610
We've got to be able to think more
nuanced about these things and instead of

3
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:07,090
going,

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,451
well,

5
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:08,680
I don't trust Fox News,

6
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,960
therefore I don't trust any media.

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,080
Therefore I only am
going to go to the site.

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,801
That keeps,

9
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:15,401
as you said,

10
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,290
reinforcing what I already believe.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,610
Omg,

12
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,720
Gmos are horrible.com that's the
only place where I get my news.

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,730
Well now you're in an echo chamber.

14
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,510
Yeah,

15
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,380
that's a huge issue.

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,140
And the other thing that you
brought up there about political,

17
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,340
about financial,

18
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,270
all the different motivations,

19
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,710
all the different things
and the variables,

20
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,030
that's also stuff that you have to try
to pay attention to in squeeze into your

21
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,361
head.

22
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,194
And that's the thing.

23
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,401
It's impossible.

24
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:43,310
We need someone like you
to sort of break it down.

25
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:47,810
Someone who has a background in this
particular area to break it down in a way

26
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,690
that we can understand what we were.

27
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:48,951
Okay,

28
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm comfortable.

29
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,420
The Cara Santa Maria is being honest
with me about this particular aspect of

30
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,960
depression in neurochemistry.

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,440
He,

32
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,731
these are,

33
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,840
this is her experience.

34
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,830
This is also what she knows
about the science behind it.

35
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,050
Right.

36
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,310
I have no motivation otherwise.

37
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,690
Nobody's paying me to say this.

38
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,280
And I think that this is why we,

39
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:03,970
as you know,

40
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,980
the listeners of the Joe Rogan experience,

41
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,080
the listeners of talk nerdy
with Carrie Santa Maria,

42
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,271
the,

43
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:12,880
the people who are really
involved in the next movement of,

44
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,714
um,

45
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,790
alternative and new media.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is our responsibility to continue to
support these kinds of programs and to

47
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:25,300
continue to speak up and
become engaged and involved.

48
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:28,720
Because if we're not happy with the
way that traditional media is handling

49
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,240
things because they're playing to the
ratings and they're playing to the lowest

50
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,290
common denominator,

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,210
we can't be passive about it.

52
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,380
We have to support the news outlets and
the organizations and the podcasts and

53
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,790
the web shows that,

54
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,810
that we support.

55
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,010
We have to do our part to make sure
that those things don't fail because the

56
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:49,070
unfortunate thing is we don't
have the backers that they have.

57
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,670
People look at someone posing
with an African animal,

58
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,043
like a lion.

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,671
They,

60
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,040
they,

61
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,250
I think people look at it and they
feel like they see a dead movie star

62
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,260
because they don't know like all you
know of that animal is sort of wildlife

63
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:11,370
documentaries and then cartoon
versions and the Lion King.

64
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,000
It's like,

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
you feel like you're looking at that.

66
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,470
But in America we drive down the road
and we see just like contorted pulverized

67
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,200
deer carcasses.

68
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,123
Yeah.

69
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,270
You can't escape it.

70
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,230
Yes.

71
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,800
Yeah.

72
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,470
And so I feel like it's never
going to be as offensive.

73
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:28,980
Yeah.

74
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,660
When someone sees a dead deer,

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
it's not as shocking to them is be like,

76
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,410
it's the animal from the movies.

77
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,701
Right.

78
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:34,930
Right.

79
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,763
And then killed it.

80
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,450
You know,

81
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,900
anthropomorphizing of an animal is a
real issue when it comes really feels the

82
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:40,900
people more or less.

83
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,130
I remember a friend of mine who
worked in the environmental movement,

84
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,130
or I shouldn't say that because
she was a conservationist.

85
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,461
Okay.

86
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,730
This has worked in the conservation
movement and she complained about,

87
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,653
um,

88
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,860
half jokingly about charismatic Megafauna,

89
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,520
so that so much mental of Americans
gets tied up in the preservation of

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,770
charismatic megafauna.

91
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
And those things become such
money sinks that we miss

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,270
opportunities to understand like this
vast suite of other creatures out there

93
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,130
that doesn't make it onto calendars.

94
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,940
And she was,

95
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,130
I,

96
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,721
if I remember,

97
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:25,721
I think she was speaking of the amount
of research dollars and dollars and

98
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:30,170
public interests and things that go
into wolves like understanding wolves,

99
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:30,890
you know,

100
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,640
and there's all the other animals that
she calls like non charismatic megaphone.

101
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,710
You just can't get someone

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,770
to like care about them.

103
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah,

104
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,710
yeah.

105
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,450
I'd say it's more chaotic now
than it has been in recent memory.

106
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,671
I don't think,

107
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:45,370
I don't think that's a,

108
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,390
that's not a big statement

109
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,380
is that what happens is they'll just an
ebb and flow when it comes to these sort

110
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,220
of situations.

111
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:51,431
When,

112
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,580
when it comes to like what's
going on in the world,

113
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:58,390
power struggles and the power struggles
that resolved and then new resistance

114
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,120
builds up.

115
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,630
I mean is that in your
experience how things go?

116
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:01,951
Well,

117
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,210
I think it you,

118
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,030
you minimize the chaos
by being consistent.

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,910
And what do I mean by that is,

120
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:09,400
is it,

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,640
you know,

122
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,650
and as foreign policy,

123
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,221
as an example,

124
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:14,310
if you're foreign policy
message is consistent and uh,

125
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,540
and strong and clear and there's no
misunderstanding by either your allies or

126
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,200
the people that,

127
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,620
uh,

128
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,550
that are against us,

129
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,080
uh,

130
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,080
then you can minimize the chaos that
exists if it's not consistent and there's

131
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,760
confusion over where we stand.

132
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,391
And I'm saying we,

133
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,140
because you know,

134
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,441
okay,

135
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:31,681
fine,

136
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,780
we're still at the top of the,

137
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:33,511
of the food heap.

138
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,890
Whether people are
comfortable with that or not,

139
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:35,311
I don't know.

140
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:35,940
But,

141
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,773
um,

142
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,951
so if,

143
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,840
if we're not consistent in that message,

144
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,320
then there's confusion and that's where
you start to get problems cause you

145
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,970
started getting people
probing at the perimeter,

146
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,890
trying to see what exactly is going on,

147
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,940
what they can get away with.

148
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,530
We start getting less leverage.

149
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
I mean,

150
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,491
you know,

151
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,920
we're getting situation in the Middle
East now where countries are acting

152
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:53,754
completely without,

153
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,150
uh,

154
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,983
consulting,

155
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,230
uh,

156
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,540
with the u s you wouldn't
have had that 30 years ago.

157
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,960
You know,

158
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,010
it just wouldn't happen.

159
00:04:59,490 --> 00:04:59,730
What,

160
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,870
it's like Egypt.

161
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,410
Yeah.

162
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,340
Egypt and acting,

163
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,730
uh,

164
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,051
in,

165
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,890
in what they consider to
be their own best interest.

166
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:05,371
The Saudis,

167
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:10,371
the Saudis are enormously pissed off
at us still over of what they view as,

168
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,570
as the current
administration is failure to,

169
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,453
um,

170
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,131
you know,

171
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:18,510
work with them to try to resolve some
issues out in the Middle East and they

172
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:22,190
feel as if we've sort of abdicated
responsibility now whether we have or not,

173
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,370
whether it's the right thing to do or not.

174
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm,

175
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,980
I'm just saying from a policy perspective,

176
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,293
um,

177
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,691
you know,

178
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:31,110
if what we want to do is be isolationists
then be very clear about that.

179
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,760
Say this is all we're going to do.

180
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:33,750
These are our parameters.

181
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,771
That's it.

182
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:36,030
So everybody knows good,

183
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,661
we're all good with it,

184
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:37,140
fine,

185
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,973
get on with it.

186
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,791
But you know,

187
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,170
the mixed messages or the problem,

188
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,280
I was selling masculine
for a little while.

189
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:42,790
This guy,

190
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,810
this Guy Andre,

191
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:48,811
the blackest blacker than your coffee
and tough and he was like in and out of

192
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,410
Juvie homes.

193
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,800
So he got me to sell it to my friends.

194
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,290
So I would have a bad cause like a lot
of my friends were into the grateful dead

195
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,740
and we go to a dead shell and I would
just sell like a hundred hits a masculine

196
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,090
and so uh,

197
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,290
so then one day I guess I
didn't even owe him money.

198
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,030
Like he,

199
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,960
he would give me a bag and then I pay him
after I sold it and time wasn't really

200
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,441
up yet.

201
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:16,280
But I came home one afternoon and I opened
the front door to my house and I walk

202
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:21,230
in and we lived in a pretty nice house
and my mom is sitting with Andre and the

203
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,620
living room having tea
and she never met him.

204
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,221
She just,

205
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,900
he just showed up looking for me.

206
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,500
Oh.

207
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,490
And I was like,

208
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,130
oh what the fuck does
uncomfortable that ended my,

209
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,420
my drug dealing days
ended her right there.

210
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,661
Yeah.

211
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,700
You don't want Andrea
embedded in your life.

212
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,450
Imagine if you can't,

213
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,920
we don't want a hundred
is banging your mom.

214
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,170
Oh cause he would do that.

215
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,030
I know Andre and she's on mask.

216
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,923
I know Andrea.

217
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,783
I was going to do it.

218
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,220
Yeah,

219
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,240
he lit up or drink.

220
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,980
He had tea with her.

221
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Dropped a tab under t right now the
doors are playing riders on the storm and

222
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,240
you open the door and he's just
fucking hammering your arm from behind.

223
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,110
Father.

224
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,890
Yes son.

225
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,540
I want to kill you

226
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,190
and to this house

227
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,993
Tonto.

228
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,163
Oh,

229
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,650
and you're like what?

230
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,370
And I walk in and he turns his head
and sees me and he gives me a look that

231
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,080
makes me have to fucking leave the room.

232
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,350
It mid stroke doesn't
even stop banging my mom.

233
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,400
Wow.

234
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,150
Yeah.

235
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,331
Yeah.

236
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,260
You don't want to see this.

237
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,730
I don't want to see that shit.

238
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,590
And I'm on mask.

239
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,770
Jedi mind trick too.

240
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,570
These are not the droids
you're looking for

241
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,400
Andre.

242
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Work in every angle.

243
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,420
It's someone like that banging your mom.

244
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh that's dark.

245
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,581
Yeah,

246
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,600
that would be brutal.

247
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,350
That's dark.

248
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,340
Seeing his ass.

249
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,470
You know that prison ass.

250
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,850
You don't know what it's been through.

251
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,620
It's probably,

252
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,510
we've got stride and muscle
tissue off out a two.

253
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,380
It looks terrifying.

254
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,950
Right?

255
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,190
Thank you.

256
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,650
Thinking about the amount of force
he could generate without ass.

257
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,730
Oh my God.

258
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,330
Yeah.

259
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,260
Strong thighs.

260
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,880
Cause he's walking around selling drugs.

261
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,750
He's out on the street.

262
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,970
It's that constant motion while cardio,

263
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,240
and now he's got the back of
this size ripping and driving.

264
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:09,580
You know that drive you get from the
inside of your thighs when you're real

265
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,490
fucking oh yeah,

266
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,450
he's doing that to her.

267
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh,

268
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,980
good Lord.

269
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,030
Oh,

270
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,310
is this Eric is actually,

271
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,621
no,

272
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:15,921
no,

273
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,101
no,

274
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,470
no.

275
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,990
We'll throw it.

276
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,823
We'll edit that part out.

277
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,220
Yeah.
