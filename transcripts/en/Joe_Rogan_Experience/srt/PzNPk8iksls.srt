1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,130
And we're live.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,530
So literally this morning
I had this thought,

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:14,910
um,

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,880
I thought about it a bit yesterday and
this morning I thought of it and I was

5
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:18,001
like,

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,840
why don't you just do it?

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,101
I said,

8
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,750
I need to do like some sort of a,

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,010
an MMA recap show cause there's always
so much shit that's happening then I miss

10
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,770
a lot of it.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,090
I don't get a chance
to talk to a lot of it.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,100
I love doing it with Brendan.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,220
He's my favorite because we get so silly
and because he loves MMA as much as I

14
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,110
do know,

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,390
I could talk to him forever about it.

16
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,640
So I'm sure I'll do some of those.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,110
Definitely in the future with him.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,131
Uh,

19
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,960
he's really good at
breaking down fights to men.

20
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,950
He has a,

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,940
he's got a skeptical eye for
things and he has a great,

22
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,520
obviously it was a high level
professional heavyweight fighter,

23
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:58,521
but he also has a real good understanding
of where someone is at various stages

24
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,484
of their career.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,750
I think that's big because fighters have
like these peaks and valleys and you

26
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,070
never know where they're at.

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,851
You know,

28
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,770
like fighting is a hard,

29
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,771
hard business and the idea that you could
stay at like a super high level for a

30
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,310
long period of time,

31
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,800
that just doesn't seem to be the case.

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,890
It seems like everybody's body starts
giving out after a certain period of time,

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,350
after a certain amount of
time cage fighting your body,

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,360
just giving out unless you're a guy
like GSP that takes all this time off,

35
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,980
which I think was brilliant.

36
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,900
Now in retrospect,

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,520
he knew what we all didn't know.

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,220
He really was in fucking amazing shape.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,750
He really was fighting,

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,010
I don't say amazing cardio shape cause
that's one legit criticism that Brendan

41
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,770
had is that he looked like he was getting
tired and it was pretty early in the

42
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,580
fight.

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,870
The guy was off for four years and he's
stepping right in fighting Bisbing who's

44
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,770
the middleweight champion?

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,660
That is not easy.

46
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,531
It's very hard.

47
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,000
Bisbing keeps a fast pace.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
He's got amazing cardio.

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,030
He's tough as shit.

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,840
Like there was a tall order like
to see him come back like that.

51
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,141
But he,

52
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,780
I think he recognized that
grind was too heavy on him,

53
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,830
but he wasn't done yet.

54
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,431
You know,

55
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,060
he was only 32 I think when he retired.

56
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,120
32 is that right?

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,940
Somewhere in that range comes back at 36.

58
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,181
I'm like,

59
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:15,910
wow,

60
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,110
you know,

61
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,591
what are the odds?

62
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,310
He's actually going to be better
than he was before or look good.

63
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,750
He looked fucking amazing.

64
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,101
He looked like a bigger,

65
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,070
better version of the,

66
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,230
the welterweight champion.

67
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,700
George St Pierre was weird.

68
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,110
It was weird to see.

69
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,944
I mean,

70
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,010
I don't want to say that I doubted them
because I did not doubt him because I'm

71
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,440
very open minded and I have
a deep respect for George.

72
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,430
I think he's amazing.

73
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,750
He's just a great person.

74
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,460
A great example of an,

75
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,660
in my opinion like how a
champion should carry himself.

76
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,950
Like George has always been like one
of my favorite examples because you see

77
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,900
them and you liked that
guy is like well spoken,

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,450
he's friendly,

79
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,650
he's genuine.

80
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,730
And he's super open
minded in terms of like,

81
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,310
okay,

82
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,790
uh,

83
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,040
his to listen

84
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
to coaches and formulate a good game
plan and always be trying out new stuff.

85
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,950
Like he spent a lot of time working with
those guys and a Hendo Gracie's that

86
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,030
Donna hurt death squad.

87
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,110
There was a lot of images of them training
together if he's training with like

88
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,400
Gary Tonin and some of
these fucking animals.

89
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,533
I mean,

90
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,840
John Danaher is a wizard and he's,

91
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,900
he's done just this amazing job with Eddie
Cummins and these kids that he has in

92
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:30,880
New York that has these,

93
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,690
these leg lock masters.

94
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,651
I mean,

95
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,760
it says Gordon Ryan,

96
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,820
they're just animals.

97
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,310
He's guys are killing people.

98
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,790
And for George to be in
the mix with those guys,

99
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,991
like he's,

100
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:46,340
he's getting down with some
serious fucking strangle experts.

101
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,870
Okay.

102
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,080
So for just knowing that he's training
with those guys because Eddie Cummins has

103
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,100
been killing tournament's.

104
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:52,401
Gary.

105
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,300
Tony has been killing her.

106
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,134
They've all,

107
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,540
Ryan's been killing tournament's
that all those kids,

108
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,231
Nikki Ryan,

109
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:57,950
his brother too,

110
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,880
they're all animals.

111
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,750
So these got,

112
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,961
like,

113
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:04,961
Donna has this great group of really
savage Jujitsu players and George has

114
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,310
diving into that mix.

115
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,900
Comes to la,

116
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,630
he's doing boxing with Freddie Roach.

117
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,501
You know,

118
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,300
it was one of the best
boxing coaches in the world.

119
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,450
Many packy I was trainer.

120
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:18,380
So he's like getting down with
like real boxing trainers.

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,230
He's getting down with real jujitsu
coaches and he never stopped.

122
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,430
He never stopped,

123
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,020
which is just amazing.

124
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,880
It's amazing that you can
just jump right back in.

125
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,220
Dominick Cruz send me a text
message right after it was over.

126
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:29,461
He said,

127
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,110
I told you ring rust is bullshit.

128
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,270
And unfortunately Dominic
just broke his arm.

129
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,250
I don't know the specifics of it,

130
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:38,650
but that's a,

131
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,660
that's a huge bummer.

132
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,473
He's uh,

133
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,990
he's gotta be chomping at the
bit now to get back in there.

134
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,200
Now that Tj just knocked out Cody
Garbrandt he must be chomping,

135
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,070
chomping at the bit.

136
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,480
Um,

137
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,110
so a few of the fights that went down
really recently this past weekend,

138
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,640
Pedis and pour.

139
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:56,791
Yay.

140
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,630
Holy Shit.

141
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,800
What a good fight that was.

142
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,600
That was crazy.

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,860
That's a crazy fight.

144
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,500
And Dustin poray at a 155 pounds,

145
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,120
it seems like a different person.

146
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,980
He just so much healthier at
one 55 and he looked awesome.

147
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,060
The Joe Duffy fight too.

148
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:12,301
And this,

149
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:13,230
this fight was a big,

150
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,250
big wind farm though.

151
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,840
Former champion in pedes guy who
was a champion of strike force too.

152
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,161
I mean,

153
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:20,994
shit,

154
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,920
that's,

155
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,770
it's a big win.

156
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,580
You know,

157
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,960
Anthony Pettis is a tough loss.

158
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,850
It seemed like he had
broken a rib or something.

159
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,200
Like there was something going on.

160
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,880
Like when he got mounted,

161
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:31,750
he had a tap,

162
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,683
you know,

163
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,410
that's uh,

164
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,580
that's very unfortunate.

165
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,220
But pet is just look really good.

166
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,210
In his last fight,

167
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,320
who did Pettis fight?

168
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,540
He fought and beat in his last fight.

169
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
Did he fight Gilbert Melendez?

170
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,111
Jim Miller.

171
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:49,944
That's right.

172
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,083
That's right.

173
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
Who did Gilbert Melendez.

174
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:54,330
Right.

175
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,090
You know what I just watched the
other day I rewatched Gilbert.

176
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh,

177
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,330
Gilbert fought.

178
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,161
Who has it?

179
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,180
The kicked his legs.

180
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,373
God dammit.

181
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,710
Can't believe I'm forgetting this.

182
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,201
Jeremy Stevens.

183
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:13,621
That's what,

184
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:13,951
sorry,

185
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,340
Jeremy.

186
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,150
Jesus Christ.

187
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,360
There was like one of Jeremy's team is,

188
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,040
is fine,

189
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,090
finest performances.

190
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,550
I forgot who did it does too many fights.

191
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,620
I have to erase my brain data.

192
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:23,454
I got to race him.

193
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,620
Dan Severn footage from the 90s.

194
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,083
I just,

195
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,570
I have to,

196
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,400
I can't though out of respect,

197
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,400
but I have just a too many fights
floating around my fucking head.

198
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,350
That fight was a good fight though,

199
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,920
cause that was the pedes employee.

200
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:39,840
A fight is a fight between two guys
that are like legit top 10 contenders.

201
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,500
Like either one of them with a couple
of good wins could be fighting for the

202
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,590
title and maybe for portrayed that was
enough to get him in there and fight for

203
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:47,424
the title.

204
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,100
But it's like you gotta
just a shark pool there.

205
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,440
Tony Ferguson is the interim champ.

206
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,240
Who knows what the fuck is going to
happen now with Connor because Connor was

207
00:06:57,241 --> 00:07:01,860
involved in some sort of an
altercation with referee Mark Goddard,

208
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,210
where he jumped into the cage while
the fight had not been called yet.

209
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,360
Apparently this is mark
Goddard's interpretation of it.

210
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,300
And I think Connors Connors,

211
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:12,750
uh,

212
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,710
he made an apology and I think what he
was basically saying was that he was

213
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,350
angry that the referee
had not stopped the fight.

214
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:22,590
First he thought the referee had stopped
the fight and then he was angry that he

215
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:27,180
had not because he gets
like really concerned when
someone's taken a beating too

216
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:31,110
much and he felt like this guy really
was out of it and taking a beating.

217
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,940
I think where the confusion was,

218
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,350
and I hope I'm not fucking this up,

219
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,380
we'll check the confusion was I think
that Mark Goddard was saying essentially

220
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:44,250
that he had not known whether
or not the bell had gone off.

221
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:45,660
He knows he knew the bell was close,

222
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,250
but he did not know
whether it had gone off.

223
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,230
It was too loud in there
for him to hear it.

224
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,520
And he was concerned.

225
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,900
I believe that it went off.

226
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,820
And so that's when he stepped in
because he thought the round was over.

227
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,610
He was not necessarily
calling the fight yet.

228
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,130
Then when Conor McGregor jumped in,

229
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,590
since he hadn't already called the fight,

230
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,810
he was in a bad situation cause the fight,

231
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,120
technically speaking was still going on.

232
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,340
I hope I'm not fucking this up.

233
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,253
Did I fuck that up?

234
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,390
He made a statement on Facebook.

235
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,553
Yes.

236
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,431
And by the way,

237
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,730
I felt the way he wrote
this statement was really,

238
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,690
it was,

239
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,270
it was not just like very professional.

240
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,470
It was,

241
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,571
it was very,

242
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm poised.

243
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,340
I was very impressed with it.

244
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,750
I don't want to read the whole thing,

245
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,960
but he essentially says the first round
is progressing and then so when the guy,

246
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,140
when the guy got hurt,

247
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:41,160
he said he connected a Charlie ward
connected with the left hand that slumped

248
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,690
John Redmond to his knees.

249
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,880
And at this exact point I could not,

250
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:49,881
and had not made my determination that
John was either out of the contest or not

251
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:53,040
in the petition position to
intelligently defend himself.

252
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,570
The Punch and the action that followed
resulted in a surge of crowd noise.

253
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,430
One that was so significant.

254
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,680
I had already made my determination that
I could not audibly hear the bell sound

255
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,390
for the end of the round.

256
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,750
I had made my decision to step in with
the belief that the bell had indeed been

257
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:12,714
sounded,

258
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,820
which in actual fact it had not,

259
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,500
this is a critical fact to
the ensuing proceedings.

260
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:23,501
So apparently there was a massive amount
of confusion because of the noise.

261
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,320
And so it looked like it looked like a
very reasonable stop exceeding and find

262
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,240
the video footage to me.

263
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,840
Cause there's a bunch of video of the
brawl itself and all the craziness that

264
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
that happened with it.

265
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,500
But it definitely seemed like if they,

266
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,360
if I remember correctly,

267
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,951
I've seen it,

268
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,161
but I,

269
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,630
last time I saw it was
a couple of days ago,

270
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,230
it looked like a really
reasonable stoppage,

271
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,530
like a smart stoppage,

272
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
I guess see it and you go,

273
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:51,751
yeah,

274
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:52,584
that guy is,

275
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,693
he's getting hurt,

276
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,020
they should stop this.

277
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,950
And then I think Connor just
assumed when he stepped in,

278
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,940
which you would,

279
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,040
especially with staff fucking loud,

280
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,090
you assume there's no bell
and Mark Audit steps in.

281
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,970
See Conard runs in and he
tackles him to the ground.

282
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,081
And then,

283
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,790
but there's already cornermen in there.

284
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,040
And so these guys are hugging and Mark
Goddard is trying to get control of the

285
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,874
octagon.

286
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,280
And so Connor comes at him,

287
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,680
it pushes him and he's yelling at them

288
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:27,990
this,

289
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,060
this is a just a terrible scene.

290
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,170
Terrible scene.

291
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,581
You know,

292
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,480
and I'm sure Connor,

293
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,440
if you could take it back,

294
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,600
we'd take it back because I'm sure he,

295
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,590
you know,

296
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,120
realize that this is a disaster.

297
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,490
And he even apologized.

298
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,351
You know,

299
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:43,980
you can't,

300
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,970
you can't do that.

301
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,740
You can't run in.

302
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,070
You gotta be sure that the
referee stopped the fight.

303
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,401
And you know,

304
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:53,670
I mean,

305
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,260
they have to have control of the octagon,

306
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:56,940
otherwise anything can happen,

307
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:57,210
right?

308
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,620
Anybody can get it in at any time.

309
00:10:58,621 --> 00:10:59,431
Not just a friend,

310
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,450
but somebody wants to hurt you.

311
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,120
So they don't know what I mean.

312
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:07,170
Obviously they knew that Conner was
probably coming in to congratulate his

313
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,004
friend,

314
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,323
but they,

315
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,680
you can't make them give up the rules.

316
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,220
Like the rules are in place for very
good reasons to protect the athletes.

317
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,780
People get super emotional about fights
and there's many times I would believe

318
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,150
that if they weren't like very,

319
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,710
very stringent in how they
allow the athletes to behave,

320
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,390
like have really stringent set of rules.

321
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,890
If they didn't do that,

322
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,770
those guys would fight a lot.

323
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,060
I mean there'll be a lot of chaos.

324
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,820
People would climb into the ring
and beat the shit out of each other.

325
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:43,140
We've obviously had a few incidents
where corners argued with each other,

326
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:44,430
but relatively speaking,

327
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,380
when you think about how
many fights take place,

328
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,630
it's a very small number and it's one
of the reasons why is because we have

329
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,760
pretty clear rules like you have to
listen to the referee at all times.

330
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,940
It's,

331
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,350
it's real simple like this.

332
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,550
There's a time where the cage is shot in
the referees in there and that guy has

333
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,300
control of that until you bring somebody
in and he has to have control over it.

334
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,070
If he calls the fight,

335
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,620
then he does.

336
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,290
He calls time and then he
brings the doctors in or
whatever he wants to do or he

337
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,124
stops the fight.

338
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,090
That is entirely this
guy entirely be his call.

339
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,950
And I see the Connor thought it was
over and it was probably like completely

340
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,530
caught in the moment and he just
fucking happy for his friend.

341
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,230
He dives on his friend there,

342
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,110
they're celebrating,

343
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,110
he's thinking that there's going to be a
bunch of people in there any second now

344
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,820
because the fights over,

345
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,790
he's thinking they're gonna open it up
and Bruce buffer is going to step in.

346
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,980
But no would have been Bruce
buffer is another organization.

347
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,820
But you know what I'm saying,

348
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,080
whoever their of Bruce buffer is.

349
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,320
But then somewhere along the line he
realized the fight hadn't been stopped.

350
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,840
And then I think he got very upset.

351
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,870
He said because he has seen people take
unnecessary punishment and he felt like

352
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,740
that guy was done and he felt like to
not stop the fight right then would be a

353
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,574
terrible thing.

354
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,790
And I totally see his point of view.

355
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,020
That makes sense too.

356
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,090
That makes sense to just,

357
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,013
you can't,

358
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,060
you can't push officials.

359
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,850
You can't jump in when you're
not supposed to be there.

360
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,020
So mistakes were made,

361
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,851
but,

362
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:16,684
um,

363
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,340
I don't know what you do
about something like that.

364
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,203
I Dunno how you,

365
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,720
I dunno,

366
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,480
like fifth standard
punishments for Shit like that.

367
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,760
But it'd be a shame if that instance took,

368
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:28,430
uh,

369
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,790
a Conor fight away from the fans.

370
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,770
I'm not saying he shouldn't be punished.

371
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,090
I would just say if he was punished,

372
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:34,924
it would be a shame.

373
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:36,790
I mean,

374
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,110
I guess you have to set a precedent.

375
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,040
I don't know how that works.

376
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,730
You ever shove an official Jamie?

377
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:43,691
No,

378
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:44,620
I've definitely yelled at him.

379
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:44,980
No,

380
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,580
but I mean,

381
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,413
playing basketball,

382
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,770
right.

383
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,101
Fighters.

384
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:49,060
You can talk to an official,

385
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,360
right?

386
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,811
Yeah,

387
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:50,111
man,

388
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:51,310
they're real strict about that.

389
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,360
Like when people do,

390
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:55,180
they get very upset and you definitely
can't put your hands on them.

391
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:55,631
You know,

392
00:13:55,631 --> 00:14:00,631
Roy Roy Nelson just was pissed off
once it a late stoppage and he,

393
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:01,930
uh,

394
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,720
he kicked a big John McCarthy in the butt,

395
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,240
but it was like the most gentle kick ever.

396
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,021
I mean,

397
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,120
he didn't kick him like
he was trying to hurt him,

398
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:10,811
you know,

399
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:13,030
he like touched his foot on his butt.

400
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,140
I mean it was nothing and big John said
it was nothing but he shouldn't have

401
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:17,974
touched him.

402
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,300
It's all it is.

403
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,250
It's just there's rules and you get crazy.

404
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,080
And it was the same thing.

405
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:27,640
In fact a big Roy was pissed that he um,

406
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,200
he let them take so much punishment.

407
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,140
Something similar happened
this year in the NBA.

408
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,090
The Steph curry is one of the top players.

409
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,960
He's known for throwing his
mouthpiece when he gets pissed.

410
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,470
He always takes his mouthpiece out a
lot when just one play is not an action.

411
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,990
So he does well for whatever reason,

412
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,910
something happened in
the NBA finals last year,

413
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:51,560
he turned around and tried to throw it a
at like the the scores table and it hit

414
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,394
a fan.

415
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,710
That's so nasty.

416
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,050
It's definitely really gross.

417
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:59,150
I mean it's just like a UFC
fighter throwing it into the crowd.

418
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,210
Like some nasty mouthpiece.

419
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,053
I nobody wants that.

420
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,933
Some fighters,

421
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,451
oh no,

422
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:02,621
this is,

423
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,000
some people would dive for
a UFC fighters mouthpiece,

424
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,110
but if he's throwing it at a referee
that's like spitting in his face.

425
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,330
Boy,

426
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,470
he bounced off the ground and hit
him I think is to what happened here.

427
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,760
Oh,

428
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,520
like he didn't,

429
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,230
I don't know if he even
meant to throw it at them,

430
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,980
but either way he shouldn't be thrown
his mouthpiece and he's pissed.

431
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,590
It's sort of like,

432
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,670
but he didn't get suspended,

433
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,070
which a lot of people were
saying like what do you think?

434
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,130
Early in the year you should have at
least got a three or four game suspension,

435
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,140
not just a $50,000 fine,

436
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,200
which is a 10th of what he
makes that day probably.

437
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,880
I don't think anything would happen to
you if you're a fighter and you three

438
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:35,150
your mouthpiece at the
ground in front of a referee.

439
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,370
I think cause the rev,

440
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,710
the UFC is so violent that
that would be taken as like,

441
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,880
oh come on,

442
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,650
throw the mouthpiece on the ground.

443
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,890
But I think in basketball it's
probably a pretty big deal.

444
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:46,710
Right?

445
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,261
Definitely different.

446
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:47,631
I mean you can't,

447
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,320
your spit your gum,

448
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,810
Adam can't spit at people.

449
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,644
Man.

450
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,040
Wow,

451
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,551
that's different.

452
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,080
I mean we are taking
off your head bailing,

453
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,130
you're spinning at people.

454
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,660
You're just throwing it with your hand,

455
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,490
that things all slobbery and shit.

456
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,350
You know what the fuck you doing?

457
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,871
So gross.

458
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:00,270
Anyway,

459
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,360
I all the hands and sweat
and blood and everything.

460
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,410
Just going around the court.

461
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Is it a satisfying know to take out
your mouthpiece filled with spit and hit

462
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,640
someone in the face with it as
it is to spit in their face?

463
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,860
Never done either,

464
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,701
to be honest with you,

465
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:15,440
but I don't know it in the face thing.

466
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,730
It's a dangerous move.

467
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,800
Haka Big Louis.

468
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,340
Yeah cause you gotta be close.

469
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,540
Real close.

470
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,280
It's a bit,

471
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,641
it's like,

472
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,000
uh,

473
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,230
it's like I'm ready for violence move.

474
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,830
You spit in someone's face like Ooh,

475
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,790
that's not just an insult.

476
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,960
It's like the only way to respond to that
insult is like something more intense.

477
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,620
It's like there's always like a moment
when someone spits in someone's face

478
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:36,740
with,

479
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,310
is this like terrifying moment
of anything could happen here?

480
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,061
Like how does this go?

481
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:42,500
Does this swing left the swing?

482
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,220
Right.

483
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,150
How does this go?

484
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,241
But in MMA,

485
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,590
like that happens,

486
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,470
I mean you're,

487
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,980
you're involved in these
violent altercations.

488
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,900
If someone just through their
mouth piece of the ground,

489
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,940
like you barely even notice it,

490
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,320
you know,

491
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,670
you couldn't do it at a referee.

492
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,380
Like obviously it a referee,

493
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,870
they would warn you or
something like that could,

494
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,501
maybe I'm wrong.

495
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,580
Could you throw a shadow
punch or shadow kick and buck.

496
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:06,650
I was never going to hit him.

497
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,640
I wasn't even close,

498
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,474
but like,

499
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,750
no,

500
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:08,990
no,

501
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,171
no.

502
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,010
That's threatening.

503
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,090
That's threatening.

504
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,720
You know,

505
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,111
if you,

506
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,180
if you fee like fake kicked,

507
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:15,980
even if you were five
foot away from someone,

508
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,510
you're kind of threatening.

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,670
You're at the very least,

510
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,680
you're doing something
that's totally unnecessary.

511
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,231
Like why,

512
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,300
why would you do that?

513
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,690
You're doing that to elicit some
sort of response from the referee.

514
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,850
You're trying to get them scared,

515
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,140
trying to get them to realize that
he's in the cage with a trained killer.

516
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,393
You know?

517
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:34,791
I mean,

518
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,600
seriously,

519
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,580
if you're in the cage
and Frances and Ghana,

520
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,910
who's mad at you?

521
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,150
Direct three.

522
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,260
Ah,

523
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,220
what a fucking terrifying
position you'd be that guy.

524
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,270
He's a smasher.

525
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,690
He's just a super athletes at Emory
happened in the history of MMA,

526
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:55,110
like in a big fight in a cage or that
a fighter's gotten pissed and taking us

527
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:55,201
from,

528
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:59,030
I've seen it happen in boxing I think
enough few times just doesn't happen often

529
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,431
obviously.

530
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,160
But I think UFC fighters credit,

531
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,520
I don't think anyone has ever
taken a swing at a referee.

532
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
I don't think that's ever happened.

533
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,953
I don't think so.

534
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,160
Okay,

535
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,880
well that's good.

536
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,570
Yeah.

537
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,860
I think that like

538
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,381
if you,

539
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:21,381
if you stop and think about how many
fights there are and how few even like bad

540
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,520
situations or are in between fighters,

541
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,330
I like to think that even
though it's a super intense

542
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,340
endeavored to do be fist
fighting another person,

543
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,390
male or female,

544
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,240
like for the most part they're like
really friendly people that do it for the

545
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:40,781
most part.

546
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:41,614
They're very,

547
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:42,971
you know,

548
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:43,240
they're,

549
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,990
they're accomplished there and they
don't have any time for bullshit.

550
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,100
But lately there's been this trend and
I think it's because Conor McGregor has

551
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:56,080
been so successful with it of shit
talking to like the nth degree,

552
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,230
like who can be the biggest shit talker?

553
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:00,130
And Colby.

554
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,780
Covington is just going for it,

555
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,614
baby.

556
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,290
He's fucking going for it.

557
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,431
And I got to tell you,

558
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:10,450
I don't know how I feel because part
of me thinks it's entertaining as fuck.

559
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,400
When I read some of the shit that he says
and I see some of the shitty says like

560
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,560
he is just going for it,

561
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,820
but it's working.

562
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,211
See,

563
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:19,751
here's the thing,

564
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,280
and this is one of the
things that he said.

565
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,490
Got To understand like a
lot of this is your true,

566
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:29,710
just trying to get your name out there
and you try to do something that makes a

567
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,370
splash.

568
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,930
Even if it's a band splash,

569
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,020
even it's like pissing off
the entire country of Brazil.

570
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,720
He's making a splash,

571
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,260
you know?

572
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,050
And I could see the point that
like you shouldn't do it that way.

573
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:41,651
I get it.

574
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:42,700
I get people saying that.

575
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,640
What I don't get is people saying
that they're not paying attention.

576
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm paying attention.

577
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,910
I'm not encouraging it.

578
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,700
I'm just being an,

579
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,240
I'm a analyzing it from
an outside perspective.

580
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,040
As a person who's a huge fan of
the way Conor McGregor talks,

581
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:57,760
shit,

582
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,840
I enjoy it.

583
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,440
I fucking enjoy it when Jeremy Stevens
says something to when he goes,

584
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:03,880
who the fuck is that guy?

585
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,020
He's um,

586
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,330
he's a magic man with that shit.

587
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,710
I think he's amazing.

588
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,000
His fucking timing,

589
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,980
the things he says,

590
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,540
he's a character,

591
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,850
he's a fucking character
and he fucks people up.

592
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,080
There's no denying that.

593
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,130
You know,

594
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,210
Conor McGregor is a beast and I
think probably not even in his prime.

595
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:27,871
I mean,

596
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:31,350
I think his athletic prime
might be a couple of years away.

597
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:32,160
I mean he,

598
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,410
who the fuck knows what
that guy can accomplish?

599
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,890
But one thing that's clear is that he's
changed the landscape when it comes to

600
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:40,890
shit talking.

601
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,460
Like now everybody wants
to be a shit talker now.

602
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:45,121
Shit talking.

603
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,920
It's like it's mandatory for the Gig.

604
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:48,641
You know,

605
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,950
shit talking is become
some thing that like,

606
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,710
it's like an art form in and of itself.

607
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,100
[inaudible] some guys
are just going for it.

608
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,390
So Colby apparently got into it with
Fabrizio Verdon because one thing about

609
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:01,931
Brazilians,

610
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,250
if you talk some shit about Brazil,

611
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,630
they will get really mad at you.

612
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,460
They're very proud.

613
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,990
They're very nationalistic.

614
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,070
They'd love Brazil.

615
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,310
And I don't know if that was
what the argument was about,

616
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,300
but for breezy over doom hit Kobi
Covey to with a fucking boomerang.

617
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,153
See,

618
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,270
the problem with that is I don't
think for BC was trying to kill him.

619
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,373
Right.

620
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
But the problem with that is
that's a weapon like that.

621
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,090
It literally is what it is.

622
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,370
Like it seems like it's
goofy because it's,

623
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,204
uh,

624
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,070
something that we have when we're kids,

625
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,461
you know,

626
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,420
it never really works.

627
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,450
I can give you ever got a
boomerang to come back to you.

628
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,141
Like,

629
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:41,711
come on man.

630
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,690
You can't just stay in the same spot
and get that boomerang to come back to.

631
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Is Anybody ever done that?

632
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,340
Can you really do that?

633
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,451
For sure.

634
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,530
I've seen it happen for sure.

635
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,080
You got to do it up in
the air or something,

636
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,293
the way you throw it.

637
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,660
Yeah.

638
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,720
They could just go right back to you.

639
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,490
See if you can find a video of someone
to actually getting a boomerang to go

640
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,980
right back to the same
spot where he stands.

641
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,590
They do that you can
do with the Frisbee to,

642
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,150
I seem like I do it with crazy frisbee.

643
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:05,880
So like they invented it so they
can kill things with it though.

644
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,610
They invented like
throw at birds and shit.

645
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,600
So this is a real weapon.

646
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,630
Like you're literally,

647
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,050
you literally hitting the guy
in the head with a weapon.

648
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,461
I mean,

649
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:19,640
I'm not,

650
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,430
I'm not looking at this guy
that's Australia is fuck,

651
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,990
what's he got to say?

652
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,453
And the boomerang.

653
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,440
We'll come back and then we
just demonstrate for you.

654
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,340
That's,

655
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,173
that goes English.

656
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,170
How you see it.

657
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,381
Boom.

658
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,500
Raise was straight out.

659
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,421
Oh,

660
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:33,254
I fuck dog.

661
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,840
Which is it?

662
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,240
All right.

663
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,073
He got Ya.

664
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,143
He got shot.

665
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,483
He got Ya.

666
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,380
I believe someone probably can,

667
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,071
but the point is,

668
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:41,904
it's a weapon.

669
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,100
So it's like co Colby got hit with a
weapon for dude hit him in the head with a

670
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,350
piece of wood and apparently he
punched him in the phase two.

671
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,480
According to Colby Covington,

672
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,000
this guy looks like he'd be
really good at a boomerang.

673
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,781
Let me see it.

674
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:55,614
Come back.

675
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,513
Oh Shit.

676
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,623
Look at that.

677
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,920
That's fucking crazy.

678
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,010
Oh,

679
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,790
flew away.

680
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,031
All right.

681
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:02,390
Yeah.

682
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,850
I mean,

683
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,830
is this bullshit too?

684
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,680
It comes back to the
vicinity that you're in.

685
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,720
Sorta like a,

686
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,151
I mean,

687
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:08,720
I don't know.

688
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,240
Like even if you send a falcon nine on
and off and come right back to the same

689
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,620
gps spot that you left it,

690
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,671
let it go from,

691
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:14,301
but pretty,

692
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,134
pretty close.

693
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:15,531
Yeah.

694
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:16,364
How does that work?

695
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,170
Falcons who just didn't know what to do.

696
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
I have no idea on that.

697
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,680
So this dude is like a boomerang expert.

698
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,020
Look at them just whipping that boomerang.

699
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,360
How long would you have to practice
to get that good at a boomerang?

700
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
That is what?

701
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:31,760
A weird fucking weapon.

702
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:32,451
And he couldn't catch it.

703
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:33,290
You couldn't catch it.

704
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,210
But what a weird thing.

705
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,380
Yeah.

706
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,400
You know that someone
figured out how to do that.

707
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:38,270
Like how smart were those?

708
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:39,170
God Damn people.

709
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,140
Like how many different
shape today come up with a w.

710
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,491
Okay.

711
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:44,324
If you had to guess,

712
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,580
how long do you think the
boomerangs been around?

713
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,140
Thousands of years.

714
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,420
Abi.

715
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,253
I would say

716
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,480
it's gotta be one of those accidents
someone figured out and was like,

717
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:53,690
Whoa,

718
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,240
look at that and just throw it right.

719
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,210
Hey comes back,

720
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:56,610
look at that.

721
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,260
It comes back.

722
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,093
Yeah.

723
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,430
But do you think that like there's a
conventional academic view of like when it

724
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,541
was invented,

725
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,374
it must be right.

726
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,653
So you could find that.

727
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,620
I just heard that there's this,

728
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:09,951
the one,

729
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,800
one of the most popular VR
games or VR experiences,

730
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,451
I think I it to,

731
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,840
you probably done it called tilt brush,

732
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,970
that virtual painting experience I just
saw yesterday a tweet that said it was

733
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:21,170
started as a,

734
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,560
the guy who made it start out
to make a three d chess game.

735
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,000
But a bug was found that one of the
pieces was dragging a light behind it or

736
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:29,191
whatever.

737
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:29,451
And he's like,

738
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:30,290
oh look at that.

739
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,660
And now he made the most popular VR thing.

740
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:36,710
There was based off of a bug that so
similar to someone could just throw on a

741
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:37,161
stick and be like,

742
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:37,461
hey look.

743
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:37,671
I said,

744
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:37,791
hey,

745
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,750
this is what comes back to you.

746
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:39,620
What could we use this for?

747
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,121
Right.

748
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,940
SORTA like how they invented Viagra
cause we were trying to come up with some

749
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,470
blood pressure medication or some shit.

750
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,611
Yeah,

751
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:44,940
exactly.

752
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,240
Yeah.

753
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,720
Like hey,

754
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:45,971
hey,

755
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:46,660
hey,

756
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,590
I want to knows when no one knows for
sure how the returning boomerang was

757
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,424
invented.

758
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,583
Mm.

759
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,521
Anywhere cold.

760
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:54,550
We got hit in the head with one.

761
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,340
I don't know how that works,

762
00:24:57,341 --> 00:24:57,611
man.

763
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:58,810
That seems like a salt.

764
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,333
I mean that's like,

765
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,290
I know he wasn't trying to kill him.

766
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,550
If you watch the video,

767
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:04,810
let's see if we could watch the video.

768
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:05,701
Boom.

769
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:05,891
Right.

770
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:08,470
25 to 30 to 50,000 years ago.

771
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:08,681
Wow,

772
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,514
that's a big gap.

773
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:09,970
Yeah.

774
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,450
They're like,

775
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,410
um,

776
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,263
I dunno.

777
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,160
Threw a bag of like he just
bought it or something.

778
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,180
I think someone might've,

779
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,631
yeah,

780
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,370
he might have bought or someone
gave it to him or something.

781
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:19,570
They give you boomerangs down there,

782
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:22,090
but he's got it in the bag
and he just fucking whips it.

783
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,570
He hits him in the like side of the head.

784
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,310
He hits him in the shoulder and the head
and Colby still talking shit to him.

785
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,670
Did they give out boomerangs
like blaze and Hawaii?

786
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:34,020
Is that probably show up.

787
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,863
They give you one.

788
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,300
Yeah.

789
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,811
Colby.

790
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:37,920
Like when he hit him with it,

791
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:38,251
he's like,

792
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,180
whoa.

793
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,213
Yeah,

794
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,800
this is crazy.

795
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,631
That just happened today,

796
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:46,350
right?

797
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,183
I think so.

798
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,510
I just found out about it like right
after the last podcast was over

799
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,920
cray and they talking
crazy shit to each other.

800
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,850
We don't have to broadcast,

801
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,050
they shed talking.

802
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,000
I find it rude and vulgar.

803
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,141
It's weird man.

804
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,700
It's like some people like it,

805
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,560
some people like the trash talking,

806
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:07,230
but to these two guys are obviously in
different weight classes so they're never

807
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,064
going to fight.

808
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,310
But some people like this like tough guy
conflict that fighters have with each

809
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,270
other and some people hate it.

810
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,900
There's some people that think that
some people are martial artists,

811
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:19,530
you know,

812
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,010
and they think that this
is all like offensive,

813
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,650
that you should conduct
yourself like a martial artist.

814
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,740
And some people have
said that and you know,

815
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,520
a lot of people like agree with it and
think that this is the better path for

816
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,810
this sport for all of us.

817
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:37,670
But there's no denying the
entertainment value of being a shithead.

818
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,750
It's entertaining.

819
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,153
You know,

820
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,200
I don't want people to fight,

821
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,670
but I am entertained.

822
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:48,570
Often when they do,

823
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,340
I think we'd all be better
off if they didn't fight.

824
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,840
But there's something about like,

825
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,710
John Jones going,

826
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,840
I beat you after I did cocaine.

827
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,630
Like there's something about that that,

828
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,091
yeah,

829
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:58,110
it's not like,

830
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,140
it doesn't feel like the embodiment of
the true spirit of what we would think of

831
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:08,280
as martial arts being a
vehicle for developing your
human potential and the path

832
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:11,190
of the Warrior Samurai and the noble poet.

833
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,670
You know,

834
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,210
we have all these like quiet Chang
Caine views of what martial arts are.

835
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,000
But one thing that martial arts are,

836
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,000
is a psychological warfare as well.

837
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,890
It's undeniable that it has a big
impact and who you're fighting,

838
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:26,970
you can get emotional.

839
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,920
If a guy fucks with your head too much,

840
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,340
you can get to a point where you're
at a character and you take chances.

841
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,480
You shouldn't take your nervous beyond
like your ability to control because

842
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,330
you're so worried about losing it.

843
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:42,090
This person that they have this
big emotional investment with,

844
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,731
that's real.

845
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,080
I mean that's one of the things that me
and molten Musashi used when he was a

846
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,790
sword fighter in,

847
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:51,450
um,

848
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,650
the book of five rings.

849
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,380
He would talk about all the
different games that he would play.

850
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,890
I people have documented it like
when Musashi would have these duels,

851
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:03,891
he would show up like hours late and let
this poor fuck just freak out worrying

852
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:08,400
about a sword fight that he was going
to have the guys sitting there for hours

853
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,401
and hours.

854
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:13,110
Then finally Musashi would show up and
the guy would be like a nervous wreck and

855
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:14,520
he would just fuck them up and kill him.

856
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,893
And he,

857
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,670
he had all these tactics that he
used and that was just one of them.

858
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,230
So psychological warfare is something
that's always been a part of the martial

859
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:25,860
arts,

860
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,860
but some people feel like the most
noble path for both warriors is just be

861
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:35,060
respectful and just have no,

862
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,090
no emotions on the line
with this in terms of like,

863
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,820
uh,

864
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,870
a hate for each other.

865
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,200
Instead just respect each other
like warriors and go after it.

866
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,280
And there's been some amazing fights
or guys took on that mentality.

867
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,660
That's uh,

868
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,493
you know,

869
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,020
that's an,

870
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,170
it's an interesting,

871
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,420
it's an interesting thing,

872
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,960
the way people express themselves when
they're doing what I think is like the

873
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:00,750
most difficult athletic endeavor,

874
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,760
the way people get their
express themselves.

875
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,440
Do you decide,

876
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:08,670
just put on a show or do you
decide to be the stoic warrior,

877
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,540
you know,

878
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,910
who doesn't talk much and
takes care of business?

879
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,721
It's interesting,

880
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:13,554
man.

881
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,260
I go,

882
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,320
we were talking about steep bade.

883
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,451
Me,

884
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:16,920
Oh church before the podcast,

885
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,250
I was going back and
forth and Steve based,

886
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,460
he pays a fireman,

887
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,540
he's the heavyweight champion of
the world and he's also a fireman.

888
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,860
He's the baddest man on the planet.

889
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,630
He's the UFC heavyweight
champion of the world.

890
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:31,080
He's smashing people
and he's also a fireman.

891
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,543
You know,

892
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,400
like that guy doesn't get enough love.

893
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,860
Like that's the,

894
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,940
that's the heavyweight
champion of the world to,

895
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,800
it's what a what a weird
position that guys in,

896
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,630
you know and couldn't be nicer but you
got to think what if he was like a crazy

897
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:53,980
shit talker would have steep Emile chick
was like Colby Covington just talking

898
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,850
mad shit.

899
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,863
You know,

900
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,870
instead Steve Bay shows up to knock people
out and he looks like he's in in line

901
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,810
to like take the bus to get to work.

902
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,410
Like he barely looks
like he's about to fight.

903
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,860
He has like the most stoic relaxed
expression before he fucks people up much

904
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:15,880
like fate or did.

905
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,760
He's got his own sort of version of that.

906
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,770
I goes,

907
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,910
one of the more amazing things about fate
or his career was like he would be in

908
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:26,530
the middle of a firefight,

909
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:31,531
just a full on fire fight and he
never let his expression shift.

910
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,920
You never saw fade are like gritting his
teeth and making a mean face fade or it

911
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:40,510
didn't waste any energy.

912
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,110
Maybe if you made one or two
main faces in his career,

913
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:44,944
I might've missed it,

914
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,500
but most of the time he would be in the
middle of these fucking horrific wars

915
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,150
and pride with like just dead face,

916
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,880
you know?

917
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,860
I mean he in hindsight,

918
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:59,230
especially since Keynes
been injured so many times,

919
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:03,550
he in hindsight I think has
to be recognized right next
to Fabrizio over doom as

920
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,290
the two greatest heavyweights of all time,

921
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,780
which Cain Velasquez is right
in there in that mix too.

922
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,580
And if he wasn't injured so much,

923
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,150
I would think Kane is probably the
most difficult one for all of them.

924
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,570
He just was when he fought for doom,

925
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,980
not making any excuses for him,

926
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:21,970
but I think he really didn't have
enough of an opportunity to adapt to the

927
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,010
Mexico City altitude.

928
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:26,800
It's like extreme altitude and
for Dune did a very wise thing.

929
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,990
He got up there way early and he lived
up there even higher than Mexico City.

930
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:32,540
He lived up,

931
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,440
he set up his training
camp like way in advance,

932
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:36,970
so he totally acclimated.

933
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,040
So for the first time it Keynes career,

934
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,110
somebody had a cardio advantage over him,

935
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:41,944
which was crazy.

936
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,640
And then on top of that for BC over doing,

937
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,480
it was just the nastiest submission
artists in the history of the sport.

938
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,250
He tapped out fade or million enco he
tapped out Minotauro Nogueira any topped

939
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:51,460
out.

940
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,480
Cain Velasquez,

941
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,440
those three guys have to be
considered top three all time.

942
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,360
So top three or five all
time guys made a Taros tap.

943
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,194
Three of them,

944
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,583
excuse me,

945
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,781
for for breezy.

946
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:05,591
Over doing was tap.

947
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,690
Three of them made a Tarald
tapped a bunch of them too.

948
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,860
You know mandatorial when
he tapped Mark Coleman,

949
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,890
that was gigantic for Jujitsu to show
that a guy could tap somebody off of his

950
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:21,931
back that was a UFC heavyweight champion
and still a murderer like mark the

951
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,790
hammer Coleman watch them in a Toro.

952
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,350
Tap Him was giant,

953
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,390
but it just got to think of how good
for doom is for doom tapped minute Toro,

954
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,800
he tapped cane,

955
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,830
any tapped fader or so for Colby to
talk shit to him like cheeses too.

956
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,670
I want to see the rematch
between for doom and Steve Bay.

957
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,780
I hope they can make that.

958
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,490
If for doom wins his fight,

959
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,310
he decided to take this
fight on short notice,

960
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,350
fairly short notice for mark,

961
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,120
Mark Teen Marchine.

962
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,661
How'd he say it?

963
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:58,661
Marching Tibora who's a very promising
young guy and he was supposed to be

964
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:00,711
fighting Mark Hunt,

965
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,890
which is going to be a crazy
strikers match I would imagine.

966
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,500
But I'm Mark Hunt got
pulled from the card.

967
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,010
There's some concern about something
that he said in an interview and he said

968
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,110
that the UFC is uh,

969
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,120
they wanted to remove him because
of his lawsuit in the UFC was like,

970
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:20,390
look,

971
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,870
we,

972
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,870
we've already paid you one point $6
million since the lawsuit was filed.

973
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:26,781
Like you've,

974
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:29,540
you've fought for us and made
a lot of money since then.

975
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,060
Like we're not trying to stop you.

976
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,590
I believe that's what they said.

977
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,743
Pretty sure.

978
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,923
I don't want to,

979
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,490
I don't want to misquote that.

980
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,770
But the point is like,

981
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:39,940
uh,

982
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,940
they decided for whatever the reason was
to remove Mark Hunt from the car and,

983
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:46,790
and Fabrizio moved right into it.

984
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,290
And it was right after he just submitted
Walt Harris so for resale is still in

985
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,480
the mix and like having that quick
win like that over Harris got a nice

986
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,100
submission,

987
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,800
beautiful armbar transition from the back.

988
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:58,880
It was just nasty.

989
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,401
His,

990
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:01,220
his just so high level on the ground.

991
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,620
I don't think people
understand or appreciate it.

992
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,510
He could do that to almost anybody.

993
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,320
That thing is like his level of Jujitsu.

994
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:08,720
He,

995
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,550
he was a legitimate world
champion in Jujitsu.

996
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,680
He won Ahboo Dhabi.

997
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,370
I mean for breezy over doom
is just a straight up killer.

998
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
His Jujitsu is at such a high level still
like most of the heavyweights they get

999
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:29,060
on the ground with him are going to be
in deep fucking water is just the level

1000
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:31,310
of Jujitsu that he has is so high.

1001
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,020
They're like the average MMA practitioner,

1002
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,841
you know the at a,

1003
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,810
at a high level has a really good level
of Jujitsu but Fabricio Verducci is the

1004
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:43,340
guy that taps those guys.

1005
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,110
Like that's how good he is.

1006
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:45,801
He,

1007
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:50,360
if he gets anybody that's anywhere near
his size on the ground that's competing

1008
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:51,350
in the heavyweight division,

1009
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,910
there is a huge likelihood that he
has a massive Jujitsu advantage.

1010
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,780
And until you've rolled with a guy
who has a massive Jujitsu advantage,

1011
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:04,781
you don't realize like how
big the difference between
like him being 5% better

1012
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:05,360
than you.

1013
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,780
Him being 10% better hidden
being 15% for ratios,

1014
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,810
probably 20 to 30% better than anybody
else in the division when it goes to the

1015
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:14,570
ground.

1016
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,690
So it's even if you're good and strong
and you're athletic and you're quick,

1017
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,490
he puts the smush on you,

1018
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,600
you stay smushed,

1019
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,434
man.

1020
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,790
I give the Brandon verify.

1021
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,020
It's a great example of that.

1022
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,780
Brandon Vera was a bad
motherfucker and he's,

1023
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,010
he's good at the ground.

1024
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:28,820
He knows how to fight,

1025
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,660
he knows how to submit.

1026
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,250
He knows how to kickbox.

1027
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,200
He was on fire at the time,

1028
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,840
but Fabricio put the smooshed down on him.

1029
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,020
He got on top of that mount
was just inescapable and
he started smashing him for

1030
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:41,610
Bricio,

1031
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,980
super underrated Jujitsu.

1032
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:47,580
I think even though people know it's his
strong suit and they know how bad ass

1033
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:50,490
he is when you watch like
the shit that he can do,

1034
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,040
there's not a whole lot of guys
that are like that as a heavyweight.

1035
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,370
There's not a whole lot of guys that
have that kind of guard is on a whole lot

1036
00:35:56,371 --> 00:36:00,820
of guys that are just so dangerous from
everywhere and his striking has got

1037
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:01,321
really good too.

1038
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:01,771
You've got to think.

1039
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,930
He knocked out Mark
Hunt with a flying knee,

1040
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,891
you know,

1041
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:06,270
and that's how he won the title.

1042
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,810
He's a beast for received
for doom is a fucking beast.

1043
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,990
He just got super emotional when he
fought Steve Bay in Brazil and just really

1044
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,241
charged at him.

1045
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:20,640
Almost uncharacteristically aggressive
and steep page is set it up and just

1046
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:22,380
dropped a bomb on him and knocked him out.

1047
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,720
But Steve Bay could do
that to any living human,

1048
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,730
any living human that chases steep Emile
chick around like that and Steve Bay

1049
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,700
can just stop and cork went
on you as you're moving in.

1050
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,510
The only one I think you might be able
to take something like that was like a

1051
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:41,511
prime time Mark Hunt like primetime Mark
Hunt had like the greatest job of all

1052
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:42,714
time.

1053
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:43,801
Cro.

1054
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,380
COP head kicked him full on,

1055
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,340
left high kick to the head and Mark
Hunt like barely wobbled a little.

1056
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,930
He was like wobbled a little

1057
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,090
like it might've went down to one knee
for a second and bounced back up like

1058
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,190
that would smash people.

1059
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,140
Most people got hit with that Cro.

1060
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,120
Cop left high kick and it was night night,

1061
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
but there's a video of it.

1062
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,710
I'm pretty sure cro cop was wearing shoes.

1063
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,160
I think he was wearing shoes
when he had kicked him.

1064
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,210
He's wearing shoes.

1065
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:17,883
Yeah,

1066
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,860
that's crazy.

1067
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,330
They let Mirko Cro,

1068
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:25,080
cop Kitkak kickbox which shoes
on pride didn't give a fuck.

1069
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:25,261
Look,

1070
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,480
see that he's throwing kicks with that.

1071
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,320
Boom.

1072
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,040
Hits him in the head.

1073
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,660
Look what happens.

1074
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,493
A little wobble.

1075
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,410
That's it.

1076
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,550
That's insane.

1077
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,770
You have to know how insane that is.

1078
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,450
Folks who don't know.

1079
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,620
I mean,

1080
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,610
that is crazy.

1081
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,631
Mirko Cro.

1082
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,130
Cop puts everybody to sleep.

1083
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,530
He didn't even make Mark Hunt sleepy

1084
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,380
that prime time.

1085
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:48,840
Mark Han had the most
ridiculous job all time,

1086
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,913
the most ridiculous,

1087
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
ridiculous ability to take a shot,

1088
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,351
I should say,

1089
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:52,861
of all time,

1090
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,350
because it wasn't just his jaw anywhere.

1091
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,280
He just could take a shot.

1092
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,900
Just insanely,

1093
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,410
insanely tough for base
over doom owed him.

1094
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,740
So you have to realize you we're talking
about a straight up killer now and he's

1095
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:08,790
40.

1096
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,331
It's interesting.

1097
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:09,691
He says,

1098
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,110
uh,

1099
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,440
he says he feels great
though with guys like that.

1100
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,990
You almost wish they
could get him on some TRT.

1101
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,600
You almost wish it was legal.

1102
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,590
Like the only they could
administer it monitor levels.

1103
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,350
Because if for Breeshia
over doom could do TRT,

1104
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,370
if we get out like TRT
Vitor tight physique

1105
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,040
member that does the,

1106
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,040
those were the glory years of chaos.

1107
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:40,420
The TRT RTV tour years have
you get a TRT ver doom.

1108
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,920
Holy Shit Son.

1109
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,903
I mean,

1110
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,890
God damn,

1111
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,540
that would be insane.

1112
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,821
I wonder.

1113
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:52,654
Uh,

1114
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,321
yeah,

1115
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:57,490
there's tr TV tour and there's regular
retort with the cross on his head.

1116
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,960
And then there's the first v tour,

1117
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,101
which was,

1118
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:00,934
uh,

1119
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,380
probably like some other Shit v tour.

1120
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,620
Yeah.

1121
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,453
Crazy.

1122
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,440
But that his prime man,

1123
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,150
like when he knocked out Luke Rockhold
or when he knocked out Michael Bisbing or

1124
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,350
Dan Henderson in one round,

1125
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,340
he was just terrifying.

1126
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,990
He was just something different.

1127
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,650
Just smashing people in a way that like,

1128
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,970
was kind of stunning.

1129
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,961
Like wow,

1130
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,910
if he tourists never been better,

1131
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,510
he just understood more because
he was older and experienced.

1132
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,500
And then when they let them take tests,

1133
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,910
his body was performing.

1134
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:34,091
Look,

1135
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,170
a young guy's body.

1136
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,420
So he has this young guy's body,

1137
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:42,421
but this old guy's brain and he just has
incredible confidence from all his wars

1138
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,750
and he's been in there with so many
just assassins and survived and lost and

1139
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:49,864
won.

1140
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,450
You know what I mean?

1141
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,900
Vittores it's been around forever.

1142
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,190
So to see him on the TRT makes you go,

1143
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:58,290
God Damn Monster,

1144
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,590
I'm doing cheer team,

1145
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,424
man.

1146
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,740
You're not supposed to say that.

1147
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,971
You're not supposed to say that.

1148
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:08,470
But here's one way that a company
like Bella tour or one of these other

1149
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:13,471
organizations could get ahead
is if they allowed that.

1150
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,970
I don't know how they do that.

1151
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,220
I don't know if that has to be a
state athletic commission thing,

1152
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,440
but if there was a way
where Bella tour decided,

1153
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,274
listen,

1154
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,480
let's be honest here,

1155
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,850
fighters would be much healthier.

1156
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,950
Be able to get through
their training camp better,

1157
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,260
feel more physically strong

1158
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,190
if we just allow them to do
just a little bit of TRT.

1159
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:36,431
Well the,

1160
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,240
we'll monitor it.

1161
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,290
We'll make sure everybody's okay.

1162
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,110
Extend the career of a
lot of the older guys.

1163
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,513
What's up with that?

1164
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,410
A heavyweight Grand Prix.

1165
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,390
They just announced a big tournament.

1166
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:46,901
Yeah,

1167
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,400
they're doing some big crazy tournament.

1168
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,290
Ryan Bader is going to
fight as a heavyweight.

1169
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,950
Came Mo's going to fight as a
heavyweight big countries in it.

1170
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,580
Mitre own fade or rampage.

1171
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,080
Chael Sonnen's in it.

1172
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,730
Yeah.

1173
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,940
It's going to go like for a year
or that they really don't know.

1174
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,350
I don't know what the schedule is.

1175
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,740
Um,

1176
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,560
I just saw the announcement for it the
other day and I saw some pictures and I

1177
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:08,890
was like,

1178
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,390
Oh shit.

1179
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,783
Yeah.

1180
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:13,781
Interesting.

1181
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,614
Huh?

1182
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,140
It Trios.

1183
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,171
I like,

1184
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:17,620
um,

1185
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,030
Ryan Bader as a heavyweight.

1186
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:19,990
That could be interesting.

1187
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,610
Ryan Bader,

1188
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,230
we're not having to cut any weight.

1189
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,320
Maybe even putting a little
weight on fast as fuck man.

1190
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,090
That might be his weight class.

1191
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,613
Who knows?

1192
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:29,921
You know,

1193
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,300
and Ryan Bader is the,

1194
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:35,670
he's the bell tore champ now some
I get cut off in the back there.

1195
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,960
Who was that?

1196
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,793
What happened?

1197
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,270
The picture cut someone off.

1198
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,710
Isn't that Frank Mir?

1199
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,150
I think that the pictures,

1200
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,631
Frank Mir,

1201
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,690
how dare they cut Frank Mir
off you sons of bitches.

1202
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,860
You sons of bitches have some respects
that frankly on the left have some

1203
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,180
fucking respect.

1204
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,470
Whoever edited that Shit's
going to ask if you,

1205
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,210
have you heard any,

1206
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,760
I haven't heard his name come up
yet to know that it's Kyle Snyder.

1207
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,950
He's a wrestler from Ohio state.

1208
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,800
He won the gold medal and the Rio
Olympics and he's really young.

1209
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:05,450
He's only 20 when he wanted and he just
won the 2017 Gold Bento for heavyweight.

1210
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,021
Uh,

1211
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,030
it could be to Russian and I guess he's,

1212
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,010
I've seen his name pop up a little bit,

1213
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,030
but I haven't heard any of them thing
about him training with a particular team.

1214
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,590
I think he's done at Ohio state now.

1215
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,990
He went back to back like
doesn't want to fight MMA.

1216
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,000
So I was just googling it.

1217
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,260
That's why I was asking
if you heard anything.

1218
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:24,590
It said that he wants to fight in
the UFC and do the 2020 Olympics.

1219
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,363
Whew.

1220
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,330
You'd have to be matched up carefully.

1221
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,880
You know the thing
about the 2020 Olympics,

1222
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:32,061
like,

1223
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:32,301
man,

1224
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,190
I got to think that would
take up all your time.

1225
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,910
How would you have time to like
kickbox and learn submissions?

1226
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,441
I don't know.

1227
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:40,040
I mean he's a bad ass wrestler obviously.

1228
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:40,110
It's,

1229
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,850
I don't know.

1230
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,040
I don't know what he doesn't
know or what he needed needs to.

1231
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,181
Well,

1232
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,500
I think everything escalates,

1233
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:45,830
right?

1234
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,940
Everybody gets better.

1235
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,590
I mean there's,

1236
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:52,370
there's outliers in every generation
like Michael Jordan type characters.

1237
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,860
But I think in every
sport people get better.

1238
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:56,450
And it must be the case in wrestling too,

1239
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:56,840
right?

1240
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,620
It's gotta be,

1241
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,453
I would imagine,

1242
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,380
I don't know enough.

1243
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,610
I only wrestled for one year in high
school and I quite honestly don't know

1244
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:06,090
enough about modern.

1245
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:06,220
Right.

1246
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,881
But I could always call,

1247
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:09,110
call me up and he would school me on it.

1248
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,090
But I think like if you look at the level,

1249
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:12,680
like he's a great example.

1250
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,550
Look at the level of technical wrestling
knowledge that [inaudible] has in

1251
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:20,000
relationship to maybe some of the earlier
days wrestlers you're talking about a

1252
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,200
completely different level.

1253
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,860
Like one of the reasons why core has
been so successful is how technical he is

1254
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:25,371
as a wrestler.

1255
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:26,204
How good he is.

1256
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,380
I cause his wrestling's [inaudible] like
him Yoel Romero is probably number one

1257
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,420
like Yoel Romero meddled in pretty much
every international match that he was

1258
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:38,774
ever in.

1259
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,890
Every international major
tournament that he was ever.

1260
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:47,180
And he medalled the Romero was like
one of the scariest wrestlers it's ever

1261
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:47,361
done.

1262
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,740
MMA for sure.

1263
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,660
There's no doubt about it.

1264
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:50,901
I mean,

1265
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,700
he was the freak of freaks.

1266
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,070
He beat Cael Sanderson twice.

1267
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,630
And who's one of the
greatest wrestlers ever?

1268
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,070
I mean,

1269
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,020
you all were marrow,

1270
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:04,970
so fuck Rick.

1271
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:05,930
Did he,

1272
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,150
did he ever fight in UFC or anything?

1273
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,650
I remember hearing him
when I was growing up.

1274
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:10,371
Cael Sanderson.

1275
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:10,610
Yeah.

1276
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,080
I don't believe you ever fought MMA.

1277
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:12,950
Could pull,

1278
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,491
pull that up.

1279
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:14,390
Find out if that's true.

1280
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,850
There was a fake MMA fight.

1281
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:18,230
I found out that,

1282
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,093
um,

1283
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,930
uh,

1284
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,460
the Russian experiment did God damn it.

1285
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,470
Why can't I remember his name?

1286
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,051
I don't see anything.

1287
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:29,720
It just says he's a
coaching after he wrestled.

1288
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,360
Yeah,

1289
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,193
it probably did.

1290
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,250
Probably decided not to.

1291
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,510
What the fuck's that dude's name?

1292
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:34,344
The giant guy.

1293
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,363
The experiment.

1294
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,130
I can't believe his name is slipping my,

1295
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,800
the giant Russian dude.

1296
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,911
I believe.

1297
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:47,570
I can't remember I said Carrie Berona.

1298
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,843
No,

1299
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,701
the one.

1300
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:51,840
I'm always talking about.

1301
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:52,111
What,

1302
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:52,670
how,

1303
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,020
what,

1304
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,940
how does that happen?

1305
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,520
Where does an idea go

1306
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,280
and just vanish?

1307
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,110
Why is it saying sleep experiment?

1308
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,130
No,

1309
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,420
the Russian experiment.

1310
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:04,710
Uh,

1311
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,230
he's the guy who lost a
rule on Gardner Gardner.

1312
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,330
Jesus Christ.

1313
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:09,781
I can't believe.

1314
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,620
I can't remember his name.

1315
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
This is so embarrassing.

1316
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,860
I got God that was pull up.

1317
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:16,694
Look him up.

1318
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:19,871
No,

1319
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:20,281
those guys.

1320
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:20,460
Huh?

1321
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:20,770
No,

1322
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,910
the guy right about what?

1323
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:22,170
The group,

1324
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,380
the red singlet.

1325
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,333
Keep going.

1326
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,061
Keep it right.

1327
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:25,241
Right,

1328
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:26,074
right.

1329
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,753
Yeah.

1330
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,003
That's him.

1331
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,930
Go to the webpage.

1332
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,380
Alexander Karelin.

1333
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,060
Thank you Jesus Christ.

1334
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,060
How can I not,

1335
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,760
I was coming up with some
weird fake Russian names.

1336
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,770
We smoked pot before we did this.

1337
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,263
I'm sorry.

1338
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,040
Sometimes is not good for your memory.

1339
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,680
There's a perfect example
because Carolyn is a guy.

1340
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,220
I've been a fan of his forever.

1341
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,610
He's just one of the scariest
human beings that's ever lived.

1342
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:58,290
Uh,

1343
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,650
I don't even know what my point was.

1344
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,960
What was my point about Carolyn?

1345
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,410
Why would we be bringing him up?

1346
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:03,581
Oh,

1347
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:04,414
we had a fake fight.

1348
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,800
He had an MMA fight.

1349
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:06,581
Everybody was always like,

1350
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:07,150
wow,

1351
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,950
if that guy only fought MMA,

1352
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,300
it would be fucking amazing.

1353
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,370
And then he had like
a pro wrestling match.

1354
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,220
I don't believe I W W it's not my,

1355
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:16,330
I'd seen it was like a fixed fight.

1356
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,820
I'm thinking it was like a
pro wrestling type situation.

1357
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,531
And,

1358
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:20,830
uh,

1359
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,780
it just look weird to watch.

1360
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,830
But at the time,

1361
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,590
I think before Rulon
Gardner had beaten him.

1362
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,610
He had one like,

1363
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:31,740
who knows how many
fucking matches in a row.

1364
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,660
If you such a terrifying person,

1365
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,290
he would scoop guys up by their waist and
they would try to flatten out on their

1366
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:42,950
stomach to try to avoid being
thrown the received video.

1367
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,251
Whoa.

1368
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:45,650
Did we blow out what happened?

1369
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:46,760
There we go.

1370
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,180
Yeah.

1371
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:47,870
All right.

1372
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:48,703
We're back.

1373
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,603
We had some issue,

1374
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,540
I don't know what the fuck happened,

1375
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,040
but we were talking about,

1376
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,320
uh,

1377
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,640
Josie Aldo versus Max Holloway to dose,

1378
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,700
which is only happening because
Frankie Edgar apparently got injured.

1379
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,200
I do not know what the injury was.

1380
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,280
Do you know what the injury was?

1381
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,983
And James,

1382
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:03,963
did you disclose it?

1383
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:06,531
Stepping up?

1384
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:09,050
I thought it was a bunch of people
that we're talking shit online.

1385
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:09,891
I was watching,

1386
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:10,700
uh,

1387
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,211
one of his,

1388
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:11,720
uh,

1389
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,200
Instagram pictures or the video that
he made a bunch of people calling him a

1390
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,150
bitch for pulling out of the fight.

1391
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,210
Like these fucking kids like it
of all the people to call a bitch.

1392
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,150
Frankie Edgar is one of the biggest
studs it's ever fought in MMA.

1393
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,350
That guy's an animal.

1394
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,813
He's,

1395
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,420
I mean he's like one of the most durable,

1396
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,370
tough and like mentally
strong guys in the sport.

1397
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,800
So when someone calls him a bitch,

1398
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,000
it's,

1399
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,640
it's,

1400
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,140
it's actually hilarious.

1401
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,840
It's like you read that,

1402
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:47,051
you're like,

1403
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,870
that is one of the craziest fucking
things anybody could ever say.

1404
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:53,750
You called Frankie Edgar a bitch
like that doesn't even make it.

1405
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,880
That's preposterous.

1406
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,540
That's like saying Joey Diaz
is a hot chick or something.

1407
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,070
Just what he's saying,

1408
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,420
it doesn't even make any sense.

1409
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,110
Like if Frankie Edgar is a pitch,

1410
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:08,170
do you know what kind of
benchmark you ha you have set?

1411
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,130
Like you have to be more of a man
than Frankie Edgar or you're a bitch.

1412
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:13,300
That is crazy.

1413
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,770
We're all going to be bitches.

1414
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,390
We will all fail.

1415
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,600
You're going to look at a nation of
bitches if that's what you're setting your

1416
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:20,560
bitch benchmark,

1417
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,150
you're calling yourself a bitch.

1418
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,170
For sure.

1419
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,700
For sure.

1420
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,390
Because I guarantee you if Frankie Edgar's
pulling out of a fight for an injury,

1421
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,500
you would have pulled out quicker.

1422
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,740
So you're more of a bitch than him.

1423
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:33,670
You'd have to be.

1424
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,890
There's no way you're less
of a bitch or anything.

1425
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,490
Anything remotely close to him.

1426
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:47,920
When you're talking about a guy who's
a former UFC lightweight champion in a

1427
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:50,650
weight class that he barely
even cut any weight for,

1428
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,520
that was,

1429
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,070
he would walk around at one
55 and he won the title.

1430
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,490
He beat Bj Penn like
get the fuck outta here.

1431
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,750
More than once.

1432
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,910
Big Cubs wants to me.

1433
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,040
Frankie Edgar is a fucking monster.

1434
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,150
He's an animal.

1435
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,550
He's the wrong guy to be calling a bitch.

1436
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,713
She can't.

1437
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,090
It just,

1438
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,060
it just shows you how
ridiculous people are online.

1439
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,170
WHO's Joe Nobel?

1440
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,891
You'll get it,

1441
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,370
bro.

1442
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,600
He's a bitch for pulling out.

1443
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,150
I guarantee you that's not true.

1444
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,900
I guarantee you if he
pulled out of that fight,

1445
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:28,060
it's because he's fucking injured.

1446
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,020
Period.

1447
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,580
End of discussion.

1448
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,410
He's not a bitch.

1449
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,810
He's not afraid of anybody.

1450
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,500
And that's not taking anything away
from Max Holloway Cause who's fucking

1451
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:38,861
awesome?

1452
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:40,510
Max Holloway's a savage.

1453
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,243
He's a killer.

1454
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,340
Straight up killer and not
even close to his prime.

1455
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,890
Max Holloway is a long
way away from his prime.

1456
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:50,380
He's way better now than he was
when he first got into the UFC.

1457
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,390
He's continued to get
better with every fight.

1458
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,760
Now he's the champion and
he just stopped all though.

1459
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,990
And then when they offered him the
rematch because Frankie Edgar got injured,

1460
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:00,340
they offered all do the rematch.

1461
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,790
So although took it now it's going to
be Max Holloway versus all though too,

1462
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,470
which is still a huge
fucking fight and all those,

1463
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,720
when he although got accepted,

1464
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,650
Max Holloway wrote on his Instagram,

1465
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,470
it is what it is like no big deal.

1466
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,580
Well what are we going to do?

1467
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,670
Like what you're about to fight the
greatest featherweight of all time for the

1468
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:27,160
second time.

1469
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,311
And he's like,

1470
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,001
it is what it is.

1471
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,680
Like that's how bad ass he is.

1472
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,820
He just figured if I fucked you up once,

1473
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:36,410
I'm gonna fuck you up again.

1474
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,300
Like in his mind,

1475
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,460
this is not a good fight.

1476
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,750
Which is hilarious.

1477
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,410
That's,

1478
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,400
that's what a beast Max
Holloway is that he's facing.

1479
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,960
Joe's a Aldo and he's like,

1480
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:48,770
it is what it is.

1481
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,850
It's not what I was looking for.

1482
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,873
Yeah,

1483
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,170
it is what it is.

1484
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:55,303
What a beast.

1485
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,010
Max Holloway is a killer.

1486
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,440
He's a fucking killer.

1487
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,274
That kid,

1488
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,091
he's a killer.

1489
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:02,781
It is what it is.

1490
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:04,070
You're fighting Josie,

1491
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:09,100
although he's coming to get you because
you knocked him out to win the belt.

1492
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,290
He has a chance at revenge and he's like,

1493
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,573
it is what it is.

1494
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,840
He's an animal man.

1495
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,580
A fucking kid is the real deal.

1496
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,170
What's so exciting to him about him
and said he's not even close to done.

1497
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:24,981
You know,

1498
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:29,330
he has massive potential and he could
easily move up to one 55 if he wanted to.

1499
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,553
Like if they could,

1500
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,780
if if say

1501
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,760
Max Holloway wins this fight spectacularly
and then starts talking about your

1502
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,960
shit about Conor McGregor

1503
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,070
and then moves up to one 55 I think Max
Holloway can easily compete at one 55 if

1504
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,210
you wanted to do some
sort of unification bout.

1505
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:48,830
I think that,

1506
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,900
I'm not a unification bow,

1507
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,100
but you know a champion
versus champion bout.

1508
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,240
I think for sure Max Holloway could,

1509
00:51:55,241 --> 00:52:00,241
could be competitive at one 55 and Max
Holloway's only lost in his career and

1510
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:03,470
was to Connor as the only
loss he has on his record.

1511
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,480
That's what a Badass he is.

1512
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,450
And he was the only guy
that went to decision.

1513
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:13,250
Frankie Edgar release a statement
after UFC two 18 withdrawal Max.

1514
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,330
I'll see you down the road.

1515
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:14,830
Well,

1516
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,430
what's the statement?

1517
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,460
It's got a facial surgery
to repair a facial injury.

1518
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,020
It says it's a minor setback.

1519
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,431
Oh,

1520
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,720
start trading in about six weeks.

1521
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,650
I wonder what it is.

1522
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:26,871
Oh,

1523
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,220
maybe it's a phase problem,

1524
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:29,030
bro.

1525
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,863
It might be.

1526
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,093
I'm just saying

1527
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,220
facial surgery can meet a lot of things.

1528
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:35,900
You know,

1529
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,651
it can mean a,

1530
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:37,940
you got something wrong with your jaw,

1531
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,410
a which is not good.

1532
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,990
You could mean you got something
wrong or your cheek bone,

1533
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,130
which is not good.

1534
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,040
It could mean you got something
wrong with your orbital,

1535
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,270
which is not good or it
can mean something to that.

1536
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:49,104
I don't understand.

1537
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,680
So if he's not concerned about it,

1538
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,120
maybe it's something I don't understand.

1539
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,060
Maybe it's not a broken something.

1540
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,690
Maybe like something was like detached
or something need to be stitched back on.

1541
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,613
Yikes.

1542
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,770
I think about all the elbows,

1543
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:07,010
people who've taken all the shit that
gets displaced all over your face.

1544
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,990
Like John Wayne par.

1545
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,990
I sort of documented all the
stitches that he's ever taken.

1546
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,780
Multiple time world Moitai champion.

1547
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:18,980
Just a fucking straight up savage from
Australia and John Wayne par was still

1548
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:19,520
fighting.

1549
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,720
It's fighting for Bell Tor now.

1550
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,720
It's one of the bell torque on
the Beltour kickboxing roster,

1551
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,883
but he's had,

1552
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,773
oh God,

1553
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,560
he's going to be pissed
at me for not remembering,

1554
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,770
but I think he's had more
than 300 stitches in his face.

1555
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,920
He's such an animal.

1556
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,920
He's like documented them too.

1557
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:41,640
I think they did some thing where chose
John Wayne par and it shows all the

1558
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:46,590
places and they put stitches on all the
places where he's had actual stitches.

1559
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,731
They like,

1560
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:48,564
you know,

1561
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,920
doctor demand.

1562
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,390
Yeah,

1563
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,610
and the pictures just straight crazy.

1564
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,361
You're like,

1565
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,970
you are in a business
that's shreds your face.

1566
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,211
Yeah,

1567
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,080
that's it right there.

1568
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,580
That's all the different places in
his body where he's been stitched up,

1569
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,460
which is just incredible.

1570
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:06,701
I mean,

1571
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,810
you look at his face,

1572
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,750
it's like a mask of stitches,

1573
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,281
but he looks normal.

1574
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:12,880
When you meet him,

1575
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,440
they did a great job stitching them up.

1576
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:14,681
I mean,

1577
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:16,450
it definitely looks like a
guy you wouldn't fuck with,

1578
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:17,231
you know,

1579
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:19,750
and you want to fuck with a dude
who a scars all over his face.

1580
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:21,430
Probably not a good move,

1581
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,120
but couldn't be a nicer guy.

1582
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,260
That was a fight that he had,

1583
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:29,680
whereas cornermen took that big cut on
the side of his head and started making

1584
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:32,170
mouth many things with it and talking,

1585
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,921
Hey Martin,

1586
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:33,790
dear ms Mr. Caught,

1587
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,580
that's how morose these guys get.

1588
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,703
But um,

1589
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:39,860
you know,

1590
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,540
he's,

1591
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,640
he's still after it and that guys,

1592
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,133
you know,

1593
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,280
I mean it comes to like the amount
of facial damage that he's received

1594
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:50,840
and delivered,

1595
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,370
delivered a lot of it too.

1596
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,690
Shitload of it.

1597
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,380
Yeah.

1598
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,490
Oh No.

1599
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,001
Who's that?

1600
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,050
Ron Stallings for?

1601
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,980
Suffers nasty cut eyebrows hanging off.

1602
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,180
That's the choir boy.

1603
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,690
He's a very good fighter.

1604
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,303
That sucks.

1605
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:07,611
Yeah,

1606
00:55:07,611 --> 00:55:10,040
there was a real bad
one with Marvin Eastman.

1607
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,100
Vito Belfort hit Marvin
Eastman with a flying knee,

1608
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,061
not a flying knee,

1609
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:19,061
but like jumped into it jump knee and
just smashed him in the forehead and cut

1610
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,770
his eyebrow open terribly.

1611
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:23,510
It was like this really long cut.

1612
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:23,870
I was like,

1613
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,040
oh my God.

1614
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:26,863
Yeah.

1615
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,461
Yeah.

1616
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:29,294
That one.

1617
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,200
Pull that up.

1618
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,471
Yeah.

1619
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:32,390
That is a enormous cut.

1620
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,430
I mean literally,

1621
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,830
I mean four inches long,

1622
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:38,360
maybe third eyebrow.

1623
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,230
Yeah,

1624
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,531
like a,

1625
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:44,450
a huge third eyebrow going off his eyebrow
and you see all the meat in there and

1626
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:47,330
everything and they have to
stitch all that together.

1627
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:47,690
I mean,

1628
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,760
I don't know what happens with
the muscles underneath it.

1629
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,050
Shit.

1630
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,880
That one was bad.

1631
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:53,660
What was that one?

1632
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,493
Is that it?

1633
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,370
Marvin Eastman.

1634
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,203
Oh my God.

1635
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,961
That's the other,

1636
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:58,580
the last tangle was even worse.

1637
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,770
Go to that one right next to that one.

1638
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,220
Yeah.

1639
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,120
Look at that.

1640
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,410
When you see it from that angle.

1641
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,760
Ooh.

1642
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,970
It literally looks like he
got attacked by a machete.

1643
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,160
Like someone stuck a machete in his head.

1644
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,080
Yeah,

1645
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:12,913
those are nasty.

1646
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,040
I don't know how we got to that
and then how we got on that.

1647
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,510
We're talking about damage,

1648
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,493
you know,

1649
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,300
I dunno if we said enough about the,

1650
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,740
the Goddard Mcgregor thing,

1651
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,331
but it's,

1652
00:56:24,331 --> 00:56:24,851
it's always,

1653
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:26,170
this is very disappointing.

1654
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,300
I wish he hadn't had done it,

1655
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,170
but I get,

1656
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,220
I get where he,

1657
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,230
I get how he thought the fight was over.

1658
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,140
I get why when he thought
the fight wasn't over,

1659
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,100
he was furious.

1660
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,934
I get all of it.

1661
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,760
It's just very uncomfortable.

1662
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,661
Uh,

1663
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:43,480
and I think Goddard could not
have handled himself better.

1664
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:44,920
That guy is a fucking man.

1665
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,570
I love the way you handle it.

1666
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,280
I wrote love the way he wrote about it,

1667
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:53,310
the way he wrote about was like
so clear and so concise and uh,

1668
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,830
it's the way he wrote
about how taking control,

1669
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,330
like his job inside the cage
when he was trying to do,

1670
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,570
makes you realize what a
great referee he really is.

1671
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:08,920
Like how he's taking everything into
consideration and following the rules even

1672
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,000
in the middle of chaos.

1673
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,553
But you gotta do,

1674
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:12,670
you gotta do,

1675
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,990
it's fucking tough job.

1676
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:18,991
That is one of the toughest jobs in sports
to be a referee in a professional MMA

1677
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:20,560
fight.

1678
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,390
It's one of the toughest jobs in sports.

1679
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,560
There's so much craziness going on and
it's so dangerous if someone loses the

1680
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:31,561
moment between someone getting hit and k
out and being okay that to taking five,

1681
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:34,961
six,

1682
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:35,794
seven,

1683
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,800
eight unanswered blows and not being
okay that there is a difference.

1684
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,440
There's a big difference
in a great referee is very,

1685
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,080
very important and it's so subjective.

1686
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,230
It's so hard to decide when a guy's done.

1687
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:53,980
And how do you know and do you take
into consideration how tough the guy is.

1688
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:58,981
Cause like Frankie Edgar can survive
past the lands of doom where most people

1689
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,150
drown in their own fear.

1690
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,420
He survives past that and
comes back and can win.

1691
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,770
There's guys like him and then there's
some guys at once they get hit and once

1692
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:09,550
they get hurt,

1693
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,240
they're just,

1694
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,540
they,

1695
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,820
their ability to recover is not the same.

1696
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,920
And I don't know what it is.

1697
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,080
I don't know if it's just
the person who recovered,

1698
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,610
didn't fight someone who hits hard enough
or in the correct places to do enough

1699
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:24,730
damage where they couldn't return
or if they're so damn tough,

1700
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:27,040
it doesn't matter who hits
them or where they hit him,

1701
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,870
they figured out a way to make it back.

1702
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,220
It's who knows?

1703
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,040
There's a lot of arguments on both sides,

1704
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,870
but man,

1705
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,990
you got to take into
consideration like if,

1706
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,130
if you're watching,

1707
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:41,800
say a Frankie Edgar Gray
Maynard fight and you go,

1708
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,221
oh my God,

1709
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:43,540
this could be stopped at any moment.

1710
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:44,374
It can be stopped,

1711
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,850
but it wasn't stopped and Frankie came
back to when he had a draw in one fight,

1712
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,180
one in the second fight and the
second fight where he won by knockout.

1713
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:57,570
It was arguably even crazier because
gray Maynard was fucking him up in the

1714
00:58:57,761 --> 00:58:58,481
first round.

1715
00:58:58,481 --> 00:58:59,314
Again,

1716
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,320
like gray Maynard was a beast and he was
huge for one 55 but Frankie Edgar got

1717
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:05,554
through that storm.

1718
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,210
Some guys wouldn't have in some referees
would have stopped that fight and I

1719
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,170
don't know who's right.

1720
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,310
That's,

1721
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,870
I want to be really honest about this.

1722
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:15,040
I have no idea who's right.

1723
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,810
I don't know what the right move is.

1724
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:21,520
I don't know if the right move is to let
a guy fight and let them recover and,

1725
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,220
and,

1726
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,070
and give him every chance
he can to win that fight.

1727
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,520
Even if it makes him
take unnecessary damage.

1728
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:34,270
Give him the benefit of the doubt or err
on the side of caution and safety and

1729
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,260
different fighters would
have a different opinion.

1730
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,370
Um,

1731
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:37,700
you know,

1732
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:37,971
there's,

1733
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:38,330
there's,

1734
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:42,050
there was this archaic idea for a long
time that is pretty much since been

1735
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:42,884
abandoned,

1736
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,290
but the idea was that
if you tap from strikes,

1737
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,124
you're a bitch.

1738
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,230
It was a real thing.

1739
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,400
You know,

1740
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,660
that people would stick.

1741
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:54,320
And George Saint Pierre his face because
he tapped with strikes to Matt Serra.

1742
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:57,250
Matt Serra was just blasted him
and he was on top blaspheming.

1743
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,640
Him and George knew he was going out.

1744
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,481
So he just,

1745
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:00,314
he had a tap.

1746
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,240
Matt Serra was a Kol artists too.

1747
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,740
He could hit fucking hard.

1748
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,343
Um,

1749
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:10,310
but when you tap to strikes,

1750
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,080
if you,

1751
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,913
you know,

1752
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,360
if you know that you're
not going to recover,

1753
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,130
I think it's a smart move.

1754
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,640
I think we have the wrong
way of looking at it.

1755
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:22,820
If we denigrate P I know,

1756
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,290
I know they do it just to talk shit.

1757
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,124
I know it's a,

1758
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:25,700
I don't,

1759
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,090
you know,

1760
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,290
you're testing someone's courage but I
think between fighters there should be a

1761
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:34,190
difference between the shit talking that
fighter's engage in and then the way

1762
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:37,460
that other people analyze
the actual sport itself.

1763
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,590
Because I think if you analyze
the actual sport itself,

1764
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:40,970
you can't see anything wrong with tapping.

1765
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,470
It strikes if you're a,

1766
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,670
you're a pundit,

1767
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,310
you're a sideline or you're an MMA fan,

1768
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,271
your eye,

1769
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:48,470
in my opinion,

1770
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,190
if you really trust you guys' judgment
as a champion and as a high level fighter

1771
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:54,981
like George Saint Pierre,

1772
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,470
as you can't be upset if the taps,

1773
01:00:56,471 --> 01:00:57,200
the strikes,

1774
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,780
it's cause he's getting fucked up and
he knows it like the you want to you and

1775
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:01,221
Jay check,

1776
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,900
she said she didn't tap the strikes.

1777
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,510
She said she was moving her hand around.

1778
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,220
It looked like a tab to me.

1779
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,660
She was getting smashed,

1780
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,700
though she might not have
even known she was tapping.

1781
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,940
She might've been in a a memory short
out circuit or she's getting blasted,

1782
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,550
blasted,

1783
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,780
blasted.

1784
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,360
So if she even remembers tapping,

1785
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:24,194
who knows?

1786
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,940
She's getting cracked,

1787
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:26,570
man.

1788
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,820
I mean she got clipped with that left hand

1789
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:35,360
and then rose gets on top of her and
starts dropping haymakers on her,

1790
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,410
which was boom,

1791
01:01:36,411 --> 01:01:36,891
boom,

1792
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:37,371
boom,

1793
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:38,180
boom.

1794
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,110
And you see her reach over and tap right
as a referee gets in and rescues her.

1795
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,260
And she might not have meant it.

1796
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,161
She might've been just,

1797
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,530
you got to realize when you're
getting smashed in the face like that,

1798
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:49,880
everything is chaos.

1799
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:51,890
It's fireworks and sparks.

1800
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,650
And every situation is different.

1801
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,240
In one situation,

1802
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,900
you might have a guy who was fully aware
of what's happening and knows exactly

1803
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:00,260
what he's doing.

1804
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,580
He's getting bombed on,

1805
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,990
but he can get through it.

1806
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,890
Versus a person who gets hit
and from the very first shot,

1807
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,690
they don't know what
the fuck is happening.

1808
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,580
They're just on Queer Street.

1809
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:11,800
They're gonna fail.

1810
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:12,830
They don't know where they are.

1811
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:13,161
They're like,

1812
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,180
whoa.

1813
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,520
And you can't see it from the outside.

1814
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:21,521
The only person who knows is the person
that's getting and you only person who

1815
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:24,360
knows their ability to recover.

1816
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:26,310
Now how much is that his psychological,

1817
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,290
how much that is their fighting spirit,

1818
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,470
how much of it is physiological guesswork?

1819
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,520
No one knows.

1820
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,070
It's a combination of all
those things for sure.

1821
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:39,390
100% cause you can't just
have the physical and you
can't just have the mental.

1822
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,240
If you have the mental and someone
has the physical way better than you,

1823
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,350
you have to have all of it.

1824
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,213
It's a big,

1825
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:44,930
there's a,

1826
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,160
the,

1827
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,120
the idea that any person
could be an MMA champ,

1828
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:48,871
it's like Ooh,

1829
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:53,871
I don't know cause everyone that's a
champ is fucking super ups exceptional.

1830
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:56,850
If it's not just physically,

1831
01:02:56,851 --> 01:03:00,330
it's physically and mentally
like it's not an easy game.

1832
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,850
It's a crazy fucking sport.

1833
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,960
And who knows if you want a chapped,

1834
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,730
it looked like she tapped.

1835
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,470
Who knows if she realized
what was going on,

1836
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:11,971
you know?

1837
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:16,320
Did you see that thing about that football
player that was diagnosed with CTE

1838
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,180
for the first time while he was alive?

1839
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,380
We sort of glossed over it.

1840
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:20,760
When we were talking to Dan Carlin,

1841
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:25,470
this is the first time a living football
player has been diagnosed with CTE

1842
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:28,531
and ask what it was,

1843
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:29,690
but it says there unnamed.

1844
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,250
Mm.

1845
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:31,440
Yeah.

1846
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,340
I wouldn't want people to know,

1847
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,190
I guess man,

1848
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,620
they're saying that even
high school kids have it,

1849
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,070
but high school kids who
play a lot bang heads a lot.

1850
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,290
You're going to get it like that is,

1851
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,190
that is so hard to deal with.

1852
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,050
You think about how many
people play football,

1853
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:50,070
how many people box,

1854
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,060
how many people fight,

1855
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,540
how many people are going
to walk out of that thing?

1856
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,520
Does God's Ville

1857
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:02,660
and how many people are going to be
really clever like mighty mouse and avoid

1858
01:04:02,661 --> 01:04:07,661
the damage and just have a
technical understanding of
like where to be and we're

1859
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,890
not to be what's coming next,

1860
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,150
how to,

1861
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,320
how to keep somebody's thinking,

1862
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,220
how to overload their,

1863
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,701
their,

1864
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:15,290
their mind with possibilities.

1865
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,121
You know,

1866
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,100
it's like you've got two different styles.

1867
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:20,060
You've got that style.

1868
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:25,860
I think these super technical upper
echelon of MMA where he's like get super

1869
01:04:26,901 --> 01:04:29,310
aggressive and picks up his pace towards
the end of the fights and wind up

1870
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:34,311
finishing guys just had a just
excellence like that crazy um,

1871
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,560
suplex to arm bar thing that he did

1872
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,960
on um,

1873
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,480
ray a goddamn it.

1874
01:04:43,481 --> 01:04:44,314
What's his name?

1875
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,333
Ray Borg.

1876
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:46,810
The taz Mexican devil.

1877
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,980
I fucked that up all the time.

1878
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,650
And when I do the Wayans I
call him the Tasmanian Devil.

1879
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,530
It just comes into my mouth like an idiot.

1880
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:59,200
But Ray Borg who's a very good fighter
and very tough and fast man when mighty

1881
01:04:59,201 --> 01:05:00,460
mouse just put it on him,

1882
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,380
it was like you're watching an artist,

1883
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:07,180
you're watching someone who's just clearly
head and shoulders technically above

1884
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:08,380
anyone in this division.

1885
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:12,280
That's why this fight
that Tj is asking for,

1886
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:13,630
it gets really interesting.

1887
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:19,590
Tj Dillashaw versus mouse is going to be
one of the greatest fights of all time.

1888
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:21,280
If they could pull it off,

1889
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,310
they actually wind up making that fight.

1890
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,150
Holy Shit.

1891
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:26,020
Will I be excited?

1892
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:27,670
I'll be so excited.

1893
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:32,671
Cause I think this would be the first
time in a long time where mighty mouse has

1894
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:33,880
been challenged.

1895
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,490
I mean you've got challenged by Ian.

1896
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,250
Ian Mccall had him in a really bad spot.

1897
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:40,750
Um,

1898
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,890
he certainly been challenged
by other fighters.

1899
01:05:44,891 --> 01:05:45,131
You know,

1900
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:50,080
he certainly like fought fighters early
in his career where he had like really

1901
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:50,801
good fights with them.

1902
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:54,910
Joseph Benevidez but at
the stage that he's at now,

1903
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,890
he's like,

1904
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,330
he's so fucking,

1905
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:03,810
he sell advanced that I think it takes
someone like a Tj Dillashaw like a real

1906
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:10,981
super confident world champion killer to
give him the fight that we need to see.

1907
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,040
Cause if Tj really can make one 25 and
he says he really can make one 25 then

1908
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:18,670
holy shit.

1909
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:19,840
What a fight that is.

1910
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:20,800
Ooh,

1911
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,730
that's a good fight because TJ
will have a giant power advantage.

1912
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,540
Right?

1913
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:29,020
I mean Tj is knocked out
Hanan Barao Tj is knocked out.

1914
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,150
Cody Garbrandt in his last fight,

1915
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,430
TJ avoided all,

1916
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,520
all the chaos that John
Linacre brings into the cage.

1917
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,630
Tj avoided all that.

1918
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,464
He shut him down.

1919
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,660
Like TJ right now is operating at a
real high world championship level.

1920
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,250
And the only fight that he lost,

1921
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,390
he lost to Dominick Cruz by
the narrowest of margins.

1922
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,580
Some people don't even feel
like you lost that fight.

1923
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,250
The,

1924
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,350
there was an argument that if you look
at the damaging blows that he landed more

1925
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,880
damaging blows to Dominic picture it.

1926
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,390
Particularly if you
factor in the leg kicks.

1927
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,891
So it's a,

1928
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:05,680
it's arguable that that
was it at the very worst,

1929
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:08,500
a draw that was a such
a close fight to call.

1930
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:09,460
That's arguable.

1931
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,020
Or you could argue the Dominic one too.

1932
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:16,380
But the point is he's a lid git
world championship caliber fighter.

1933
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,090
Like TJ is a fucking killer.

1934
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,410
He's a killer.

1935
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,540
What he did to Hennen borrows insane.

1936
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,490
And then what he just did to Cody
coming off the deck and Kale and Cody

1937
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:27,910
Garbrandt like that.

1938
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,200
That's fucking insane too.

1939
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,670
He's in rare form.

1940
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,720
So him versus mighty mouse is the fight.

1941
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,860
That's the fight where you go,

1942
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:37,090
Holy Shit.

1943
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,510
Which one of these guys is arguably
the best fighter in the world?

1944
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,680
Cause right now we
think it's mighty mouse.

1945
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:47,140
But that's that thing
always moves up and down.

1946
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,100
Like who's the best fighter in who?

1947
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,530
You know that it always moves around.

1948
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:53,140
Like when Jon Jones wins and
knocks out Daniel Cormier,

1949
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:53,974
you go,

1950
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:54,970
damn,

1951
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,170
you almost want to give it to John.

1952
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,140
Like he's easy in a deeper shark pond.

1953
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,850
You know there's more killers.

1954
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:05,851
He's fighting Cormier who's just as good
as they get after beating rumble after

1955
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,730
holding the title and John Kay,

1956
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:07,991
awesome.

1957
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:08,950
You got cop hand.

1958
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,330
You almost have to give it the John.

1959
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,890
But then John test positive.

1960
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:13,570
So you're like what the fuck man.

1961
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,100
So here's the heat.

1962
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,030
It's John

1963
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:19,820
and DJ,

1964
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,211
right?

1965
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:21,820
Demetrius is probably my ideas.

1966
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Number one cause and John is in the
situation where he's probably going to get

1967
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:28,340
suspended or something.

1968
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,250
But then you got probably Tj,

1969
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,070
if not George Saint Pierre GSP

1970
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,420
moved up on the official list.

1971
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,320
Did you go to number one?

1972
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,120
Number two

1973
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:37,953
Oh of course.

1974
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,210
That's interesting that you give them
that with one fight against Michael Best

1975
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:42,044
Bang.

1976
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,890
That just shows you how bad ass you
have to be to step in and fight Michael

1977
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,300
Bisping after Michael Bisbing
knocks out Luke Rockhold,

1978
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:58,540
after he had beaten Anderson Silva defends
his title against Dan Henderson and

1979
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:03,680
he just jumped in there and beat him and
then jumped to number two and the pound

1980
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,460
for pound rankings.

1981
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,293
Like,

1982
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,121
welcome back,

1983
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:08,954
man.

1984
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,973
It's crazy.

1985
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,410
So what do you think about all that stuff?

1986
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,491
They're having all this,

1987
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:13,641
uh,

1988
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:18,641
these conversations about who's ranking
the fighters and that the organization

1989
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:20,420
shouldn't be able to rank the fighters.

1990
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,371
Like do it,

1991
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:23,840
shouldn't be able to make the matches.

1992
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:27,080
It's done technically right
now through a writer's right,

1993
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,550
but mostly writers is it,

1994
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,511
I think are,

1995
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,710
you can see who the writers are,

1996
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:31,544
right?

1997
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,800
Who writers are voting panelists.

1998
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:34,610
I'm sorry,

1999
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,230
but they're all people from,

2000
01:09:36,231 --> 01:09:37,010
let's see.

2001
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:37,281
Yeah.

2002
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:38,150
But at the end of the day,

2003
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:38,984
logs and whatnot,

2004
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,310
do you have see decides what
they're going to do right now?

2005
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:41,991
At the end of the day,

2006
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:42,310
they go,

2007
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:42,560
yeah,

2008
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,490
you guys are cute.

2009
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,031
Listen,

2010
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:45,170
George Saint Pierre is going to fight.

2011
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:47,260
Michael Bisping shut the fuck up.

2012
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,650
It's going to compare it to a,

2013
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,090
just something that came out this week,

2014
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,540
the way the college football at friends,

2015
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:56,541
they're big playoff as they have a
panel that takes into account all of the

2016
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,150
official rankings that are done,

2017
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,500
a couple of computer rankings.

2018
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:01,430
But then at the end of the thing,

2019
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:06,431
it's still the seven or eight people
are going to decide that this team is

2020
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:09,440
ranked over this team and it
really comes down to money.

2021
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,020
Dick matchups they want to see
and what they can sell in ads,

2022
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,580
but they don't officially say that.

2023
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,340
It just creates more posts
that like why did they do this?

2024
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,180
We don't understand it.

2025
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:18,450
And they won't say it was that Kinda,

2026
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,383
yeah,

2027
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,820
well it's the UFC has the ability to
do whatever it wants and they're in a

2028
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:26,050
situation and this,

2029
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,140
here's the argument for it.

2030
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:31,010
During the situation where they just
bought this organization for $4 billion

2031
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,061
that need to make money,

2032
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:32,894
motherfucker.

2033
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,540
So think going to have Tyron
Woodley fight Nate Diaz.

2034
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:35,751
Like,

2035
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:36,040
Hey,

2036
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,420
I was going to do some paper
review numbers and it will,

2037
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:39,680
that's an interesting fight.

2038
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,543
I like to see it.

2039
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,661
I'd like to see,

2040
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:42,380
uh,

2041
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,680
I'd like to see how Nate
deals with the biggest,

2042
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,230
fastest welterweight in the division,

2043
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,050
the biggest knockout artists
welterweight in the division.

2044
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,150
I mean there's no doubt about it.

2045
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:55,130
Tyron Woodley is a tank.

2046
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,420
He's a tank who throws missiles your way.

2047
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:00,720
Boom,

2048
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,553
boom.

2049
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,650
And he's gotten very tactical.

2050
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,350
People got mad at him for
those two Wonderboy fights.

2051
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,633
But I,

2052
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:13,030
I suggest that they don't truly
appreciate what those fights represented.

2053
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,860
They represented extreme
consequences for any mistake.

2054
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,630
You're fighting a guy who's like one of
the best counter strikers on the planet

2055
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,340
earth in Wonderboy.

2056
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,460
He's one of the sneakiest slippery
just strikers in the sport.

2057
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:35,090
He moves like a world champion karate guy
who also has takedown defense and he's

2058
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:39,720
got a ton of experience in MMA
now and he just fights weird.

2059
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,090
He throws front leg
roundhouse kicks to your face,

2060
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,750
he jumps in and hits you with shots you
don't see common cause he like has that

2061
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,800
blitz karate style that he employs
sometimes very difficult to hit.

2062
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:54,540
His hands are always down low and Tyron
managed to not just beat him and they

2063
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,590
were boring fights.

2064
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,640
I'm not going to lie to you.

2065
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,870
They were boring fights,

2066
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,000
but they weren't boring to
me while they were happening.

2067
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,990
It was boring in terms of the overall
result because it was a five round

2068
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:04,351
decision.

2069
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,910
We're not a lot of exchanges took place,

2070
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,400
but it wasn't boring
when I was watching it.

2071
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,550
And this is why it's because
now that you know that what,

2072
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:12,300
how it ended,

2073
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,650
you'll just sit through the fight and go,

2074
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,071
oh my God,

2075
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:14,880
this is boring.

2076
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,670
But when you don't know
what is going to happen,

2077
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,690
they don't know either.

2078
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,410
And they're making these decisions and
they're so evenly matched that they're

2079
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:23,520
canceling each other out.

2080
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,140
And Tyron is doing a very smart thing
by not engaging and he's not doing too

2081
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:32,610
much because if he does too much at leaves
these openings and he doesn't want to

2082
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,980
even remotely risk that,

2083
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:38,540
he's going to put himself in a position
where he gets open and wonderboard

2084
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,180
catches him.

2085
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,670
So he makes Wonderboy do all the leading.

2086
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:45,270
And then when the bombs get
dropped on both occasions,

2087
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,340
Tyron Woodley was the
one that hurt Wonderboy,

2088
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:51,480
which is crazy when you
think that Wonderboy is one
of the best kick boxers it's

2089
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,440
ever fought in MMA.

2090
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,080
He had some insane kickboxing record.

2091
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,850
I want to quote it out
of the top of my head.

2092
01:12:56,851 --> 01:13:01,350
I think it was 57 and [inaudible]
57 [inaudible] as a kickboxer.

2093
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,100
He's,

2094
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,370
this is a guy that George Saint Pierre
said was the best striker that he's ever

2095
01:13:05,371 --> 01:13:06,204
sparred with.

2096
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,460
That's how God damned good Wonderboy is.

2097
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:08,730
He's,

2098
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,563
he's,

2099
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:14,660
he's another level striker and those
two fights between Tyron Woodley and

2100
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:16,194
Wonderboy,

2101
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,500
essentially we're striking
exchanges for the most part,

2102
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,150
except for the first fight,

2103
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,721
the first fight.

2104
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:25,590
Tyron did get him in a gay teen for awhile
and it looked like he was burning his

2105
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:26,424
arms out.

2106
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,370
Like you couldn't believe that
wonder boy you got out of it.

2107
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,790
But the point is that in the points,

2108
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,530
in the moments of the fight,

2109
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,540
we're one fighter was in trouble.

2110
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:41,870
It was always wonderful and that's
enough in my eyes to give tiring the

2111
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:43,620
decisions for sure.

2112
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,530
Just the just that if we want
to look at what is a fight,

2113
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:48,750
I think the current
system of like 10 points,

2114
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:49,584
nine points,

2115
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,110
it's too flawed.

2116
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,100
It's a,

2117
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,670
we adopted this from boxing we that we
should have a way more comprehensive

2118
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:00,300
system and I think it should be a system
that's probably over a hundred points

2119
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,360
or up to a hundred points rather that you
have points for significant moments in

2120
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:06,241
the fight.

2121
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,170
Like maybe significant moments when
someone gets dipped that accounts for a

2122
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:11,160
certain amount of points,

2123
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,220
significant moments where a person almost
get submitted and figures out how to

2124
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:17,590
power out that accounts for
a certain amount of points.

2125
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:20,740
Do they power out and wind up reversing
the position cause that should be worth

2126
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:21,574
a certain amount of points.

2127
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,220
You know there should be
an accumulative effect.

2128
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,230
It shouldn't be just
like you want or you won.

2129
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:26,771
She'd be like,

2130
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:27,850
how do you know who won?

2131
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,560
Like can we look at the stats?

2132
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,680
Can we look at the numbers and then can
we look at it from an expert point of

2133
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:33,100
view?

2134
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,860
Cause every punch does not have the
same impact at other punches do.

2135
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,640
Every kick does not have the
same impact that of the kicks do.

2136
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,860
And every submission doesn't have
the same probability of succeeding.

2137
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,350
So if you're watching
all these things happen,

2138
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:49,770
you need real world class
experts to assess what's
happening at any stage of the

2139
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:51,461
fight.

2140
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:52,090
Like you should.

2141
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,800
The only people should ever judge a fight.

2142
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:56,680
Our guys like bat Hume who
used to judge for pride,

2143
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,040
guys like Duke Roufus like
worldclass guys for Rasa Hobby.

2144
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:02,860
We could,

2145
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:07,640
you could get that level of martial
artists to judge fights and I think you'd

2146
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:11,900
have the opportunity to create a totally
new system that's not boxing base.

2147
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:14,230
Cause the 10 point must
system is just so flawed.

2148
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:20,190
Have a new system and just only have
high level worldclass martial artists and

2149
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:27,380
nothing less do all the judging cause
they don't understand what the differences

2150
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,540
between someone just taking somebody
down and someone taking someone down and

2151
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:31,450
threatening them.

2152
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,200
Someone who's on the bottom was winning
with elbows or was threatening with

2153
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:35,771
submissions.

2154
01:15:35,771 --> 01:15:37,930
Maybe they don't understand how
close these submissions are.

2155
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:42,190
Some people don't know what a triangle
is locked up until it's a fucking tap.

2156
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:42,570
You know,

2157
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,030
there's,

2158
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:46,900
if you've never sparked a day in your
life and you watch someone who's tapping

2159
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:47,890
someone with a wrist lock,

2160
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,480
you're not going to know
what the fuck is happening.

2161
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,440
You're just not most likely unless
you're a real efficient auto that's just

2162
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:54,640
never physically practiced it.

2163
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,580
Most of the people that are referees,

2164
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,331
unfortunately,

2165
01:15:58,331 --> 01:15:59,770
or I should say judges,

2166
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,820
there's a lot of them,

2167
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,810
I don't want to say most of them.

2168
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,550
A lot of them are real martial artists,

2169
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,560
100% but there's quite a few that were
sort of grandfathered in from boxing and

2170
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:13,000
they don't necessarily
know a whole lot about MMA.

2171
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:13,301
Now,

2172
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:16,030
this is not representative
of the vast majority,

2173
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,570
but I see them every now and then and
some of them were very nice people and I

2174
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:19,781
say,

2175
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:20,710
Hi Mike,

2176
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:21,544
how you doing?

2177
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:22,470
I mean,

2178
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:25,780
we're just talking disagreements on
things and maybe different levels of

2179
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,220
appreciation for what's happening,

2180
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,180
but some we get every now and then you
get a decision where everybody looks at.

2181
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:31,661
Everybody was,

2182
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:34,930
what in the fuck does that
just say like everybody,

2183
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,321
you,

2184
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:35,801
me,

2185
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:37,870
everybody look over at Tony.

2186
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,460
I look over at Jon Anik,

2187
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,361
he'll look over at me.

2188
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:41,620
I look over at Daniel Columbia.

2189
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,670
He'll look over at me and were like,

2190
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:43,780
what the fuck?

2191
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,370
That shouldn't happen.

2192
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,880
That shouldn't happen when all the experts
are in agreement that this is a bad

2193
01:16:51,131 --> 01:16:51,800
decision.

2194
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,770
Now we're not talking about
like debatable moments.

2195
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:56,470
Like there's fights where
you look at it and go,

2196
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:56,921
man,

2197
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:58,510
I could see the argument
for this guy winning.

2198
01:16:58,511 --> 01:16:59,350
And then the other guy could say,

2199
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:01,300
well I see the argument for that
guy winning and I'll be like,

2200
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:01,541
damn,

2201
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,260
you got a point.

2202
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,150
You know like Brendan and I
will do that all the time.

2203
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:04,620
He'll,

2204
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,530
he'll make an argument for why he thinks
that Conor won the second fight easy.

2205
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,080
And I'll make an argument and like,

2206
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,050
I don't know man.

2207
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,160
I don't know about all that.

2208
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:17,450
I mean we're not using the same system
back then when someone got dropped,

2209
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:19,700
it's not an eight a ten eight thing.

2210
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:20,480
Right.

2211
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,570
It's not like they don't give away
ten eight rounds as quickly back then.

2212
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:27,470
I'm pretty sure that was the old
rules wasn't not God damn it.

2213
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:28,304
I should know that.

2214
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,810
Anyway,

2215
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:30,643
point being,

2216
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:31,190
um,

2217
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:35,600
some people think Nate could have got
to draw on that fight and I'm like,

2218
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,463
maybe,

2219
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,810
maybe it wasn't far enough away.

2220
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,910
We couldn't see that it was
one of those where like Bob,

2221
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:45,170
maybe this has been a bunch of fights
like that and I could see the argument for

2222
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:46,520
Conor winning 100%.

2223
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,870
He hit him quicker,

2224
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:48,291
faster,

2225
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:49,910
harder one the first rounds bigger,

2226
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:50,900
you know.

2227
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,381
But man,

2228
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,214
I don't know.

2229
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,560
We're adding points if you just doing
this ten nine thing that occasionally 10,

2230
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:57,801
eight,

2231
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:02,801
but now most of the states are adopting
the full new MMA regulations and as they

2232
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,600
do that we're going to get a much better,

2233
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,880
we're going to have a much better uh,

2234
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,500
range of rounds.

2235
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:12,230
Like what would around scores
as which is a good step.

2236
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:13,640
It's a good step in the right direction.

2237
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:19,300
I just think it is an incredibly critical
part of the sport is who judges the

2238
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:20,864
decisions.

2239
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:24,350
And that again is not to disparage
anybody who's currently doing it,

2240
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,740
but I think it is a position that should
be held in the highest of esteem right

2241
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:31,010
up there with referee.

2242
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,470
I think this position is,

2243
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:33,831
is,

2244
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:34,220
uh,

2245
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,530
it's crucial for the
future of the fighters.

2246
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,860
It's crucial for the legitimacy of the
sport itself because when bad decisions

2247
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:42,800
happen,

2248
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,520
people get angry and they question
whether or not the sport is legitimate.

2249
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,550
And that's dangerous to the
respect that the athletes face.

2250
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:50,061
Like,

2251
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:51,260
here's a perfect example.

2252
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:55,470
Canelo Alvarez versus Gennady
Golovkin everybody was a boxing fan,

2253
01:18:55,471 --> 01:18:59,670
knows Gennady Golovkin won that fight
and last year a huge Canelo fan and you

2254
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:00,170
just,

2255
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,790
you're just absorbed in Canelo.

2256
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,653
You love him.

2257
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,100
If you watch that fight,

2258
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:09,140
Golovkin seem to control way more
of the fight that Canelo did.

2259
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:12,650
It didn't mean a Canela didn't win rounds
didn't mean Canelo didn't land good

2260
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:13,484
shots,

2261
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:16,040
but he lost he,

2262
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,730
it seemed to me that he lost
and they didn't give it to him.

2263
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,460
Golovkin didn't get the decision.

2264
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:25,580
It was a draw and people
were watching it going,

2265
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:26,510
what the fuck?

2266
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:29,390
And that's what Brendon called in advance.

2267
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,790
Brenden's shop called it in advance.

2268
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:32,101
He's like,

2269
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,720
and let's go Lufkin wins by knockout.

2270
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,030
He's never women in decision.

2271
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:35,690
And I go,

2272
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:36,411
you really think so?

2273
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:36,711
He's like,

2274
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:37,544
fuck yeah,

2275
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:40,100
he nailed it.

2276
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,510
He totally nailed it.

2277
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,010
When,

2278
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,250
when they read the draw,

2279
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:46,340
I put my hands on my face like
Macaulay Culkin home alone.

2280
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,900
I Wa oh,

2281
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:48,890
you fucked him.

2282
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,020
Who fucking not Eagle Love Kid.

2283
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,370
Oh,

2284
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,270
you got 'em.

2285
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:55,693
What do you think of the,

2286
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,100
when they did the instant replay at,

2287
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,980
I think it was the first
time at the UFC in New York.

2288
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,620
I didn't know Walt Harris fight.

2289
01:20:02,621 --> 01:20:03,050
Yeah,

2290
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,190
it's a good move ma'am.

2291
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,010
They keep doing that or is that
only a one time kind of thing?

2292
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:08,951
I don't know.

2293
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:09,661
They should keep doing it.

2294
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:09,841
No,

2295
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:10,621
it wasn't Walt Harris,

2296
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:10,761
right.

2297
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:10,980
Wolf.

2298
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:11,870
Which fight was it?

2299
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,770
They said they did it
because of the massage.

2300
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:14,910
Aussie Weidman fight.

2301
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:15,450
Right.

2302
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:16,380
And then they used it.

2303
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:18,330
I guess it got used though
during those two fights,

2304
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:18,700
right?

2305
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,290
Yeah.

2306
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,060
It was Juan Harris fighting
and it was the other fight.

2307
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,073
Um,

2308
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:22,360
uh,

2309
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,193
it was Demir.

2310
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:23,930
Yeah,

2311
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:24,720
yeah,

2312
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,500
yeah.

2313
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,630
So I came into play and was used properly,

2314
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:27,991
probably,

2315
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,141
right?

2316
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:28,321
Yes.

2317
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:28,681
It was.

2318
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:28,801
Well,

2319
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:29,680
the wall Harris things.

2320
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,600
Very unfortunate.

2321
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:31,830
And he had kicked that dude.

2322
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:32,670
Um,

2323
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,790
but the other one a owes
Demir got knocked out by,

2324
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:36,870
who was the gentleman?

2325
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:37,131
Austin.

2326
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:37,964
Tamir was fighting.

2327
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,623
Uh,

2328
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,313
don't try to remember.

2329
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,213
Look it up.

2330
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,751
I was like,

2331
01:20:44,751 --> 01:20:45,171
I was there.

2332
01:20:45,171 --> 01:20:46,060
I can kind of remember.

2333
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,450
I remember him like being pissed
that he thought he'd knocked a loss.

2334
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,560
Then you came in and told him
that he didn't actually lose.

2335
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,360
Is that the duty?

2336
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:54,290
Fobts a beast.

2337
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,520
Um,

2338
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,460
this is a weird time.

2339
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:59,810
We're at time for the sport man.

2340
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,910
Like a,

2341
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:03,590
this is like a transitionary period,

2342
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:04,424
I feel like.

2343
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:05,690
And uh,

2344
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:10,520
Connor is such a gigantic star that
he's almost eclipsed the sport.

2345
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,433
Who Was it?

2346
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,353
It wasn't,

2347
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,140
it wasn't.

2348
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:15,973
No.

2349
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:16,521
Oh.

2350
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:18,530
Volkov owes Demir is the
guy who's going to fight.

2351
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:18,721
Yeah,

2352
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:19,540
he's going to fight.

2353
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,373
I'm

2354
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,143
like,

2355
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,210
that's hilarious.

2356
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,550
Just pull up the last card.

2357
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:31,783
Yeah.

2358
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:33,103
17.

2359
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,010
It's not Alexi Oli nick.

2360
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:39,110
Actually that sounds right.

2361
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:44,750
Is it Curtis blades defeated
Lexi Olin name Curtis blades.

2362
01:21:44,751 --> 01:21:45,590
Beat the shit out of him.

2363
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:46,340
Yeah.

2364
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:46,431
Oh,

2365
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:47,000
that's right.

2366
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,310
Curtis blades is a really
interesting prospect,

2367
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,090
is a big,

2368
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:50,930
big kid,

2369
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:52,220
is super athletic,

2370
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:53,780
and he threw a,

2371
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:54,710
an illegal kick,

2372
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,620
but it literally just touched the ear.

2373
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:59,060
That was the god Beer Walt here.

2374
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:01,790
That was the illegal kick and that
that was God be Your Walt Harris.

2375
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:01,960
Yeah.

2376
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,470
The other one was a doctor stoppage.

2377
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:04,670
Right.

2378
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,310
But wasn't there something
that happened in that fight?

2379
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,890
There was also a controversial,

2380
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:13,520
I think he was beating him
up and then there was a,

2381
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:15,780
I can't remember how it stuck.

2382
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:17,300
I think it was who did God be a fight?

2383
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:18,140
He fought Walt Harris.

2384
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:19,070
He got head kicked.

2385
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:19,421
Correct.

2386
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:19,670
Right.

2387
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:20,900
And God beer got the win on this.

2388
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:24,590
But then when Curtis blades,

2389
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:28,490
he accidentally kicked him in the
ear or you just touched his ear.

2390
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:32,420
Referee stopped the fight after blades
delivered in an illegal kick to down the

2391
01:22:32,421 --> 01:22:32,900
opponent.

2392
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,320
Yeah.

2393
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:38,270
Doctor called in to check to see that
that kick barely touched his ear like he

2394
01:22:38,271 --> 01:22:38,980
was already done.

2395
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,570
Yay.

2396
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:39,740
Right?

2397
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,250
Yeah,

2398
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,720
he was hurting really bad.

2399
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,740
Curtis was putting a beating on him and
when he went down Curtis through this

2400
01:22:45,741 --> 01:22:48,650
wild kick and just touched,

2401
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,150
I mean literally touched his ear,

2402
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,013
it did not hit him,

2403
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:55,550
but the referee saw the contact and then
went to the instant replay to make sure

2404
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:56,041
that it was okay.

2405
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,970
But as soon as the referee
saw the instant replays,

2406
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,101
like,

2407
01:22:58,101 --> 01:22:58,341
okay,

2408
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,174
clearly he's okay.

2409
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:01,790
But the doctors looked at
him and they asked him like,

2410
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:01,941
dude,

2411
01:23:01,941 --> 01:23:03,240
this guy's fucked up like this.

2412
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:04,160
This fights over.

2413
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,100
And I think he said that it was over.

2414
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,420
He said he couldn't continue.

2415
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,730
I was bringing that up to begin with.

2416
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:10,620
Could do you know how the
instant replay worked?

2417
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,573
It was like,

2418
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,830
did they all just get into a huddle and
watch the video or is there someone,

2419
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,320
I can imagine the referee probably right.

2420
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,130
Watches it and they probably
watch it with like Mark Ratner,

2421
01:23:20,131 --> 01:23:21,180
one of the officials,

2422
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,841
you know,

2423
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:22,071
and they,

2424
01:23:22,071 --> 01:23:24,030
they look at it and make a,

2425
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,920
an informed decision,

2426
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:26,671
you know,

2427
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,260
and I don't know what the
parameters are that are,

2428
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:28,410
no,

2429
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,610
don't who gets the call.

2430
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:31,320
But I would imagine it's a group.

2431
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,650
I would imagine there's very
little disagreement when
someone's looking at film

2432
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:35,850
like that cause they're not biased.

2433
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:36,121
They don't,

2434
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:36,954
I mean these guys,

2435
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,240
if you have John McCarthy and herb dean,

2436
01:23:39,241 --> 01:23:40,021
they're looking at film,

2437
01:23:40,021 --> 01:23:44,670
I guarantee you they're going to
agree and what it is and it's uh,

2438
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,730
there's a lot of dispute
dispute about that kind of shit.

2439
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:48,510
You know,

2440
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:48,741
it's,

2441
01:23:48,741 --> 01:23:51,900
it's really important to have those guys
that are like completely on top of the

2442
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:52,231
rules.

2443
01:23:52,231 --> 01:23:54,240
Like there was one fight where,

2444
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,103
uh,

2445
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,950
Tim means fought cowboy Olivera
and he hit him while he was down.

2446
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,790
Do you remember that?

2447
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:05,790
And we were trying to figure out whether
or not it was legal and I believe it

2448
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,330
was Dan Merkley,

2449
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:11,164
Yada.

2450
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:15,500
And we even got mark Ratner on the air
and Mark Ratner thought it was illegal

2451
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:20,550
knee cause he was down on one
knee with one foot and no hands.

2452
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:24,730
He's like under the new rules
that would be legal and big.

2453
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:25,600
John McCarthy says,

2454
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:25,811
no,

2455
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:26,644
it's not.

2456
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:30,760
If anything from your feet other than
the soles of your feet are down on the

2457
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:31,061
ground,

2458
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,380
you're still a down to Poland.

2459
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,250
And I was like,

2460
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,061
oh.

2461
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:37,120
So he had explained it to me after the
fight because everybody was called it

2462
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:38,230
three points of contact,

2463
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:41,860
but Olivera literally did not
have a foot on the ground.

2464
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,120
He just had his knee,

2465
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,570
his foot was up in the air and his
other foot was touching the ground.

2466
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,380
And he got kneed in the face
and we got kneed in the face.

2467
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,760
They said it was an illegal nay.

2468
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:52,361
And we were like,

2469
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:53,710
how is that the case?

2470
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,603
Cause there's,

2471
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,770
there's only two points of contact.

2472
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,360
There's the knee and the foot.

2473
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,860
Like you're not talking about Nia foot.

2474
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,170
And the hand is just
two points of contact.

2475
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,860
But apparently it can't be
anything other than the ball.

2476
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:06,460
Your feets.

2477
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,440
But it could be is you have the both
balls of your feet down on the ground,

2478
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:14,740
but you have one hand down
that's three points of contact.

2479
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:19,600
And under the new rules that would
be legal under the old rules.

2480
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:21,070
If you touch the ground at all,

2481
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,030
it's illegal.

2482
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,540
Super confusing.

2483
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,380
Right.

2484
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,520
So in that one,

2485
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,130
it was really important to have a,

2486
01:25:29,131 --> 01:25:31,430
a referee like big John Waite.

2487
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:32,403
And right there.

2488
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:33,761
Yeah.

2489
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:37,030
See he smashes him like see how he's got,

2490
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:38,651
yeah.

2491
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:39,790
The need means more than one.

2492
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:40,060
Right.

2493
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,110
That's what they're going with.

2494
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:46,240
Well I think when it landed that right
foot was elevated and was off the ground,

2495
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,240
then something similar happened.

2496
01:25:50,241 --> 01:25:53,780
Where did the guy delivering that needs
like lifted him up off the ground.

2497
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:54,560
Yeah.

2498
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,630
Get them off the ground yet.

2499
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,583
Yes.

2500
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,670
Yeah guys have done that to lift him
up off the ground and slammed ease into

2501
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,920
their body because they were
touching with their hands.

2502
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,823
You can do that.

2503
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:04,723
That's legal.

2504
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,400
It is a weird a rule.

2505
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,860
It's a rule that we're
going to have to figure out

2506
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:15,620
what makes sense because the knees
to the head to a down deponent.

2507
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:21,490
I feel like that almost makes sense
because that is a real legitimate move.

2508
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,040
And if someone can do that to you,

2509
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,690
why is that different?

2510
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,070
Is it too easy?

2511
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:31,460
Like why is that different than being
able to elbow someone in the face when

2512
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:32,294
they're on the ground?

2513
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,570
Cause it hits harder?

2514
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,500
Is that what it is?

2515
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:35,861
Okay,

2516
01:26:35,861 --> 01:26:36,694
so it's better.

2517
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,350
So I can't use it because it's better.

2518
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,440
So you can just elbow me
all day long in the face,

2519
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:43,870
but you can't name me in the head
and put me out on my miseries.

2520
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,300
I don't know who's right or who's wrong,

2521
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:49,960
but it's an effective
martial arts technique and
they've eliminated supposedly

2522
01:26:49,961 --> 01:26:51,190
for the safety of the fighters.

2523
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,330
But you got to figure out like
what's legal and what's not legal.

2524
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,470
Like here's another thing,

2525
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:01,330
and this is a fascinating fight that
just took place between Matt Brown and

2526
01:27:01,331 --> 01:27:02,410
Diego Sanchez.

2527
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,390
Crazy wild fight.

2528
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:05,410
As long as it lasted.

2529
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:10,770
Matt Brown lands this fucking beautiful
Elbulli palms him away and just boom,

2530
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:13,870
drops this beautiful elbow on him.

2531
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:18,310
I mean it was just picture
perfect and Diego goes limp,

2532
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:19,240
like a sniper.

2533
01:27:19,241 --> 01:27:21,370
Just shot him from the
sixth floor depository.

2534
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,160
I mean it was perfect.

2535
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,630
It's like the perfect Kao.

2536
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,830
But Diego was complaining that
it was the back of the head.

2537
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,943
But here's the thing,

2538
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:34,470
nobody gives a shit if it's the back
of the head of your standing up.

2539
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:34,951
Watch this,

2540
01:27:34,951 --> 01:27:36,120
boom.

2541
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:36,781
Look how it goes.

2542
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:37,440
Limp.

2543
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,730
I mean that is Diego Sanchez is a fucking
warrior dude for him to go limp like

2544
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:42,360
that.

2545
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,070
Look at this.

2546
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,010
Boom.

2547
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,630
Totally on the back of the head,

2548
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,540
but that's okay.

2549
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:49,374
When you're standing up,

2550
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:49,681
that's,

2551
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,480
it's weird if you punch something
in the back of the head,

2552
01:27:51,481 --> 01:27:54,150
like when Matt Serra Fought George,

2553
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:56,580
I'm pretty sure some of those
shots he blasted him with,

2554
01:27:56,581 --> 01:27:57,630
he hit him in the back of the head.

2555
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,340
It might've even been the first one
because if you're swinging sometimes and

2556
01:28:02,341 --> 01:28:05,700
your hand goes around like your hand
hits the back of the head all the time.

2557
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:06,990
Head kicks,

2558
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:10,560
head kicks hit the back
of the head all the time.

2559
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,240
I give you neck kicked.

2560
01:28:12,241 --> 01:28:13,074
Somebody.

2561
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:14,520
Like if you go over,

2562
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:16,620
like say if someone's standing
with her left shoulder to you,

2563
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,780
have you go over that left shoulder
and dropped down with that kick,

2564
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:26,070
that neck kick shit that a lot of
time it goes in the back of the head.

2565
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,870
That's a lot of times where it's landing.

2566
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,860
It's coming around.

2567
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,030
You're coming over the short.

2568
01:28:30,031 --> 01:28:35,031
You're literally slamming your he foot
the instep right into the back of that

2569
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:40,191
dude's head and that's a hard fucking
impact from a leg happens all the time.

2570
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:41,994
It's totally illegal.

2571
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,280
It's weird because if
you get on the ground,

2572
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:45,330
they'll go watch the back of the head,

2573
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:47,970
watch the back of the head
like even from the mountain.

2574
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,560
I mean even for the guard,

2575
01:28:49,561 --> 01:28:49,831
rather.

2576
01:28:49,831 --> 01:28:50,870
If you're in someone's garden,

2577
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:51,451
you're punched him.

2578
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,350
Watch the back of the head.

2579
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,660
Everybody's watching the back of the head.

2580
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,760
How about protect the back of your head?

2581
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:57,781
No one says,

2582
01:28:57,781 --> 01:28:58,680
watch your eyes.

2583
01:28:58,681 --> 01:28:58,941
What?

2584
01:28:58,941 --> 01:28:59,940
Don't hit the eyes.

2585
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:01,420
You don't say it on hit eyes.

2586
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:03,210
Be The back of the heads off limits.

2587
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,160
It seems like a good spot to hit.

2588
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,250
Like what do we do it and I mean,

2589
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:09,390
well it's so dangerous.

2590
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,800
It's everything is dangerous.

2591
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:11,910
This is fighting.

2592
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,620
This is MMA.

2593
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:14,830
Look,

2594
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,050
it's we shouldn't,

2595
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:18,990
you know what works the best if you can
elbow someone in the back of the head

2596
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:19,830
sometimes.

2597
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,690
How can we can't do it all the time.

2598
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,450
I'm not saying that anybody
should change that result.

2599
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:25,350
The result was perfect.

2600
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,550
Matt Brown by Kale.

2601
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,631
I'm not saying that.

2602
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:29,790
What I'm saying is open it up.

2603
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:32,960
Let guys do whatever they want to do

2604
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,333
and no gloves.

2605
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:36,570
I'm tired of saying this.

2606
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,770
Take the gloves away.

2607
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:40,200
No raps,

2608
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,250
no hand wraps.

2609
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,500
That would save a lot.

2610
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:46,100
You would not be able to get
away with nearly as much.

2611
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,570
Everybody would look like
John Wayne par though.

2612
01:29:47,571 --> 01:29:48,404
You'd be all cut up.

2613
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:52,130
But I just think it's more realistic.

2614
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:53,510
It's just so weird to me.

2615
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,430
He put pads on your knuckles,

2616
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,890
but you're allowed to elbow
someone in the eyeball.

2617
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:01,401
Oh,

2618
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:02,900
you're protecting your hands.

2619
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:03,051
Oh,

2620
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:04,220
that seems like cheating.

2621
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,601
You should be like,

2622
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:07,970
if you only hit someone
with your hands so hard,

2623
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,740
that should be how hard you can hit them.

2624
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:12,380
Shouldn't be able to
fucking put them in a cast.

2625
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:13,830
I mean that's what you're doing.

2626
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:17,240
You put them in like a
soft leather covered cast.

2627
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,330
That's what that Margarita fight was.

2628
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,920
You know when Margarita got busted with
Shane Mosley when they found a cement

2629
01:30:23,921 --> 01:30:24,754
and his gloves,

2630
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,510
I took it too far.

2631
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,610
But that's what it is.

2632
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:28,990
You're,

2633
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:29,823
you're,

2634
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,270
you making it so you
can hit someone harder.

2635
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:35,210
It hurts almost as much.

2636
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:39,560
It doesn't have the sharpness to it that
someone has when they hit you with bare

2637
01:30:39,561 --> 01:30:40,340
knuckle.

2638
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,170
Bare knuckle has like a sharpness,

2639
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:49,180
but the amount of power that someone
can generate just w with no regards to

2640
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,710
their own safety is more,

2641
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,260
they can swing drop bombs on you.

2642
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:54,660
That

2643
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,920
copy cause of that picture.

2644
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,250
They saw it and I do not know.

2645
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,330
Did they see it there?

2646
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,230
You could see it there.

2647
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,610
I mean it's hard to tell what
that is and that's what that,

2648
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,150
that's what that other picture
was sort of alluding to.

2649
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,080
Can you make that bigger?

2650
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,220
That's far as it'll zoom.

2651
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:09,660
I think it's hard to tell what that is.

2652
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,820
That could just be the
gauze that's all wet.

2653
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:14,790
I mean it's after the fight
it looks like a crack.

2654
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,270
I guess that's what they're
trying to say is like low.

2655
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,060
Really.

2656
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:18,301
I mean,

2657
01:31:18,301 --> 01:31:20,040
I don't know that Gosh
shouldn't crack like that.

2658
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:20,320
Right.

2659
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:20,980
I should rip

2660
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,730
Yo.

2661
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:22,900
Imagine if that's the case.

2662
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:25,330
What if it really did
turn into like hard shit?

2663
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,920
Like real plaster.

2664
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,100
Whoa.

2665
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,090
I don't know how they found it.

2666
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,610
Yeah.

2667
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:32,590
I mean how did he get caught?

2668
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,910
I don't know either.

2669
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:34,750
I think they uh,

2670
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,220
someone from,

2671
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,540
cause that's how you catch sugar.

2672
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:40,090
Shane Mosley's team watched him,

2673
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:41,920
watched him wrap his hands.

2674
01:31:41,921 --> 01:31:43,060
I think you're allowed to rap,

2675
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,020
watch your opponent,

2676
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:44,681
wrap their hands.

2677
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:47,530
And he noticed something in the
wraps and had it pulled out.

2678
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:50,800
So then everybody decided that that's
what he had been doing his whole career,

2679
01:31:50,801 --> 01:31:54,580
which is why he had been smashing people
cause he had been smashing a lot of

2680
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:55,414
people.

2681
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:57,490
He just had more power.

2682
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,610
More pop is loaded.

2683
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,444
Gloves.

2684
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:03,160
Prior to the 2009 sugar,

2685
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:03,821
Shane Mosley,

2686
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:08,821
Antonio Margarita fight Mosley's trainer
Nasim Richardson was in the Margarito

2687
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:13,420
dressing room so he could
observe Margarito his hands
getting wrapped prior to

2688
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:15,400
putting on boxing gloves.

2689
01:32:15,401 --> 01:32:16,570
As Margarita is trainers,

2690
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:18,550
we're wrapping their fighter's hands.

2691
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:23,551
Richardson noticed what appeared to be
a plaster of Paris powder on the wraps.

2692
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,430
Don Tom.

2693
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:26,263
Ah,

2694
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:31,770
the plaster of Paris hardens when it
comes into contact with moisture and any

2695
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:35,110
fighter will sweat during
the course of a fight.

2696
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:35,980
Oh Shit.

2697
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,990
As soon as Richardson saw the substance,

2698
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:40,750
he accused Margarito of
fighting with loaded gloves.

2699
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:46,110
Margarito his hands or rewrapped and
Mosley hammered Margarito he did too.

2700
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:47,590
He beat the shit out of him that day.

2701
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,390
I bet that dude felt guilty.

2702
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,450
No one that you were going to try to
fight a world champion like sugar Shane,

2703
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:57,470
but you try to change up.

2704
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:00,911
Yeah,

2705
01:33:00,911 --> 01:33:01,570
that's not good.

2706
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,880
But I think that bare
knuckle would be different.

2707
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,420
I think it would be better
for submissions for sure.

2708
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,430
Way Easier to secure.

2709
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:14,431
Chokes your hand slip behind things way
easier when there's no gloves and it'd

2710
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:16,240
be way harder to hit somebody.

2711
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:16,600
You,

2712
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,560
you would have a really hard time if
someone duct and you hit the top of their

2713
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:21,041
forehead,

2714
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,420
you can easily break your hand.

2715
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,610
Like people break their hands
all the time and that way.

2716
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,040
Um,

2717
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,480
what else did I want to talk about?

2718
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,250
I think that might be it,

2719
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,084
dude.

2720
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,060
We covered it all.

2721
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:36,280
Although Max Holloway,

2722
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:37,690
we covered that a little bit.

2723
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,010
I want to see if,

2724
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:44,550
although still can compete at a world
class level and improve because you know

2725
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:48,610
that he can compete at
a world class level.

2726
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:50,290
You've seen the last few
fights that he's had.

2727
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,143
He's still,

2728
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:57,010
I mean other than the fight that he had
with Connor were Connor starched him.

2729
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:01,660
Did he fight Frankie Edgar
right after he fought Conor?

2730
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,590
I believe he did.

2731
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,290
I believe that's who
we won the title from.

2732
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,403
Is that who it was?

2733
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:10,870
Yeah.

2734
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:11,591
And he uh,

2735
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:12,430
outboxed him,

2736
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,553
you know,

2737
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:19,180
he fought a guy in Max Holloway
that's at the top of his game,

2738
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,330
top of his game for now and
with more height to come.

2739
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:24,791
But I mean,

2740
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:25,810
he's just peaking.

2741
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:27,730
He's ramping it up right now.

2742
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:29,800
Max is a fucking beast.

2743
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:33,490
So it's interesting to see whether or
not all though can recover and he doesn't

2744
01:34:33,491 --> 01:34:34,960
have a full camp for this fight either.

2745
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:35,651
You know,

2746
01:34:35,651 --> 01:34:37,060
he had to take this fight on,

2747
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:37,894
um,

2748
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,940
I want to say four weeks notice.

2749
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,193
See if that's true.

2750
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,013
I don't want to lie,

2751
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:45,143
but

2752
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,450
I think Max Holloway is one of the
best up and coming fighters for sure.

2753
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:50,971
In the world,

2754
01:34:50,971 --> 01:34:51,900
a world champion.

2755
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,250
When I say up and coming,

2756
01:34:53,251 --> 01:34:55,920
I mean up becoming in like the
pound for pound sort of a way.

2757
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:59,360
I mean he's just greatness
written all over him.

2758
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:02,240
If he just keeps up at this
pace and he's got the attitude,

2759
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,710
he's got the skills,

2760
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,300
he's a straight killer.

2761
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,710
But you can't look past
and old warrior like Aldo.

2762
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,740
Not saying that he is,

2763
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:10,993
I bet he's not.

2764
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,220
But um,

2765
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,840
everybody else can't look past it either.

2766
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,420
Although still fucking super dangerous.

2767
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,690
He's going to be real motivated in a wind
by all though would be to [inaudible]

2768
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,620
John,

2769
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:25,190
I can't tick at this stage of the game.

2770
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:29,330
If although could bounce back the way
he bounced back from the Mcgregor fight,

2771
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,220
an outbox Frankie,

2772
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,710
if he could bounce back in some way,

2773
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:38,060
figuring out what he did wrong in
that first fight and solve the puzzle.

2774
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:39,920
Whoa,

2775
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,193
that's big.

2776
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,183
That's a big fight.

2777
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,750
And the other fight we talked about,

2778
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:45,140
um,

2779
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,580
Tyron Woodley and Nate Diaz

2780
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,303
does the other one.

2781
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,480
That's crazy.

2782
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,020
Five days ago I found that it says he
was supposed to fight Ricardo Lamas,

2783
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,130
uh,

2784
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,293
two weeks later.

2785
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:58,190
And now he's been bumped up to this.

2786
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:00,470
So it was only five days
ago they made that fight.

2787
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:01,933
Whoa.

2788
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,100
And so he only has two weeks then.

2789
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:04,561
Yeah.

2790
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:05,450
So yeah,

2791
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:09,320
November 11th she's confirmed
auto replace Frankie Edgar.

2792
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,730
So I guess that was
when they announced it.

2793
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,660
Jesus Christ.

2794
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,513
That's crazy.

2795
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,650
Well,

2796
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,060
I hope he's training a lot.

2797
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:18,920
I hope he's in great shape.

2798
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:21,470
I hope to weight cut isn't too
much either because he's a big guy.

2799
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:22,723
At least he was for awhile.

2800
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,850
He leaned out quite a bit because I
think he was having a really hard time

2801
01:36:25,851 --> 01:36:30,650
making that cut from like well into
like he looks like he's about one 70

2802
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:35,150
something and they would cut down
to one 45 and real hard for him.

2803
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:36,770
He would suffer in the last round,

2804
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:38,440
the fights like uh,

2805
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,250
if he didn't smoke guys early on,

2806
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:43,550
sometimes he faded towards the end
like he did with Ricardo Lamas.

2807
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:44,660
Like the end of the fight,

2808
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,800
moss was on top of him.

2809
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,600
Like he had done enough to win for sure.

2810
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,580
But at the end he was fading.

2811
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:50,630
He's getting tired.

2812
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:55,100
And I think a big part of that was
probably just getting the water sock data.

2813
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:56,900
You know those guys,

2814
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:57,920
they tortured themselves,

2815
01:36:57,921 --> 01:36:58,310
man.

2816
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:59,450
The card for this weekend,

2817
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:00,121
Dun,

2818
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:00,451
Dun,

2819
01:37:00,451 --> 01:37:01,284
Dun Dun Duh

2820
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,520
for doom and to bore is interesting.

2821
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,280
I like that Tim Means and below Mohamad.

2822
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:08,240
That's a serious fight.

2823
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,330
Some good fights on that card.

2824
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:12,531
All right,

2825
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:13,730
and that is when Saturday,

2826
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:14,450
yeah,

2827
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:15,170
Saturday night.

2828
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,580
Saturday night in Australia.

2829
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,420
Oh Shit.

2830
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,260
Oh Australia.

2831
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:19,543
I'll be in,

2832
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,010
I'm going to be in Phoenix.

2833
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,721
I'm going to be in Phoenix,

2834
01:37:23,721 --> 01:37:24,554
Arizona.

2835
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:26,600
I'm going to get to see a Mike Goldberg.

2836
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,400
I haven't seen Mike and Forever.

2837
01:37:28,401 --> 01:37:29,990
He's killing it in Beltour man.

2838
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:32,570
I like the fact that Bella tour exists.

2839
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,350
You know,

2840
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,610
I love the UFC.

2841
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,900
The UFC is my home.

2842
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,810
I'm not doing commentary for anybody ever.

2843
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,700
The UFC is like family to me,

2844
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,880
but I think competition is important.

2845
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,830
I think it's important for everything.

2846
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:49,250
I think the systems competing
with each other make some greater.

2847
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:54,670
I think the more opportunities that
young fighters have to perform and fight,

2848
01:37:55,770 --> 01:38:00,060
the more you're going to see higher and
higher level of ability and performance

2849
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,590
level fighting knowledge.

2850
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:02,401
You just,

2851
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:03,031
there's more,

2852
01:38:03,031 --> 01:38:05,460
competition is a higher level for the UFC.

2853
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:07,070
It's higher level for Bella tour,

2854
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,700
everybody is going to accelerate.

2855
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:14,150
This is a growing thing right now and as
long as you're not competing with each

2856
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:16,100
other on the same night long,

2857
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,930
they don't do anything dumb and
that fights in the same night.

2858
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:20,460
I think they compliment each other.

2859
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:21,563
I really do.

2860
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,660
I think there's some fighters
that will do better in Beltour.

2861
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,820
I think there's some fighters
that prefer to be in the UFC.

2862
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:27,840
It's all good man.

2863
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,233
It's all good.

2864
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:34,370
You know the UFC has way
more worldclass fighters,

2865
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,320
but bell tours got some
tough motherfucker,

2866
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:40,920
some real legit worldclass
fighters to now and their,

2867
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:44,520
their rosters growing like Rory
Macdonald's is one of the best fucking

2868
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:47,130
welterweights on the planet
and he's over there now.

2869
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,570
I hope we get him back.

2870
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:49,171
I really do.

2871
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:50,490
I love commentating his fights.

2872
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:51,810
Lorens Larkin's over there now.

2873
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,370
A llamas.

2874
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,750
Like there's a,

2875
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,190
there's a bunch of guys,

2876
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,361
Diego,

2877
01:38:57,361 --> 01:38:58,194
Lima,

2878
01:38:58,350 --> 01:38:59,183
um,

2879
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,391
I think,

2880
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:01,224
uh,

2881
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,730
Lima is,

2882
01:39:02,731 --> 01:39:06,180
or Douglas Lema is one of the best
fucking Walton weights on the planet for

2883
01:39:06,181 --> 01:39:06,840
sure.

2884
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,561
His brother Diego,

2885
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:09,840
I think it's still fighting for the UFC,

2886
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,050
but there's a bunch of
town over there now.

2887
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:14,490
Like real legit talent.

2888
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,590
It's good.

2889
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,423
It's good for everybody.

2890
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:18,383
It's good for the sport,

2891
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,880
gives people opportunities,

2892
01:39:20,881 --> 01:39:24,420
makes people raise their
games up for the athletes.

2893
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:26,790
The more Michael Chandler's are out there,

2894
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:28,260
the boogie man in the woods,

2895
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:31,500
Michael Chandler is a boogie
man and 155 pound division.

2896
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:32,880
He's terrifying for everybody.

2897
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:35,390
It doesn't matter what organization
you fight for that guys,

2898
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:36,810
straight up killer.

2899
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,123
So this like,

2900
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:42,930
there's enough really dangerous worldclass
fighters over there in Beltour for it

2901
01:39:42,931 --> 01:39:44,880
to be excitingly
competitive for everybody.

2902
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,103
I think it's good.

2903
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:47,571
And I liked the gold.

2904
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:48,930
He's got a Gig because I love him.

2905
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:49,801
Uh,

2906
01:39:49,801 --> 01:39:51,420
so I think that's it.

2907
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:52,530
I think we did more than an hour.

2908
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:53,490
We're going to call it the hour,

2909
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:58,890
but I'm blabber mouth motherfucker
and I can't stop talking.

2910
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,323
Um,

2911
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:02,670
I don't feel the need to
apologize for anything I said.

2912
01:40:02,671 --> 01:40:04,740
I don't think I fucked
up and offending anybody.

2913
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:06,331
If I did,

2914
01:40:06,331 --> 01:40:07,500
I'm going to blame it on the weed.

2915
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:09,090
Anything to add young Jamie?

2916
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:10,110
Nope.

2917
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:12,990
I think that was a good first episode one.

2918
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:14,940
I think we'll do this more often.

2919
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:15,893
Okay.

2920
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:16,350
I'm not,

2921
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,420
I'm not guaranteeing every week,

2922
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:19,830
but we'll keep it close.

2923
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:20,700
All right.

2924
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:20,821
Bye.

2925
01:40:20,821 --> 01:40:21,120
Bye.
