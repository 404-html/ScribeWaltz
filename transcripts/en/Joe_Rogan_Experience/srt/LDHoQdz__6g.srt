1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,140
We don't want you outrageous.

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,220
Like I want a viper.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,270
You can't try that hyper.

5
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,104
Not Hyper.

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,970
What's an American car?

7
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,410
Can you ever have a vapor can imagine
drove a viper and a Ford 158 corvette

8
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,864
convertible.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,570
Fucking big Elvis sunglasses.

10
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,404
Yeah,

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,581
I'm free.

12
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,414
You fucks.

13
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,250
If it was me and I finished up,

14
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,890
I would drive away from the White
House in my last day in an El Camino.

15
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,710
It's just,

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,860
this is the fact that
drives my wife crazy.

17
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,620
I,

18
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,210
I've always,

19
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,680
always wanted an El Camino.

20
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,980
I've always kept my alf or,

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,013
you know what,

22
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,690
you give me an El Camino come every year.

23
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,140
Uh,

24
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,000
it was manufactured and I would be a
happy boy because I don't know why.

25
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,520
And it's,

26
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,770
it's,

27
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,031
it's,

28
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,070
it's irrational.

29
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,590
And my wife hates it
because she thinks it's a,

30
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,760
it's a horrible looking car.

31
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:48,450
Do you have one?

32
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,051
I don't.

33
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,370
I've got my latest one.

34
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,600
My latest by was a,

35
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,434
as a,

36
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,273
a wagon here.

37
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,150
Remember the old jeep wagon?

38
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,300
He with a wood panel on the side I bought,

39
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,220
I bought one of those and it's uh,

40
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,801
it's uh,

41
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,200
actually being redone at,

42
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,740
at bucks four by four and
in Idaho for all your,

43
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,480
all your automotive needs.

44
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:10,110
So you bought it and you're refurbishing
it or is it the last year they

45
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,800
manufactured it?

46
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,540
91 91.

47
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,510
And it's got an original Shag
carpeting in there and it's uh,

48
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,020
it's just uh,

49
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,140
it's a brilliant vehicle.

50
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,090
Got The big bench seat.

51
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,290
Remember the bench seat
you'd have and CDC,

52
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,970
those are good when you went
around corners just slid
all over them depending on

53
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,320
if you had to girl by your side,

54
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,154
then you know,

55
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,690
you take the hard left turn.

56
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,051
Oh,

57
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,890
what do you mean over here?

58
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,860
That was big seats.

59
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,173
Yeah.

60
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,390
Almost like that.

61
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,224
Huh?

62
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,880
I ain't even one car.

63
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,540
That's a piece of shit
that is not to say that.

64
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,590
Look at that son of a bitch.

65
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,140
That's a fucking ugly
cat is a car right there.

66
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,440
And you know what that thing
weighs about 400,000 tons.

67
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,180
This solid steel.

68
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,200
I tap.

69
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,190
What the fuck that I know of.

70
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,430
That one is a tap that's been,

71
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,020
yeah,

72
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,853
that's

73
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,480
weird.

74
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah.

75
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,593
That shouldn't happen.

76
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,550
You want it classic.

77
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,500
You want a classic test,

78
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:00,690
right?

79
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,110
You keep it classic and
like the wood panel.

80
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,331
Oh,

81
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,901
are you kidding me?

82
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,734
Of course.

83
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,340
How could you see that's validated?

84
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,250
All the common sense that
you've laid out on this podcast.

85
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,160
There's a lot of people out there that
would look at the Woodside wagon here and

86
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:17,341
say,

87
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:17,641
yeah,

88
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,091
I get it.

89
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,930
That's a great vehicle.

90
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,741
There's a Camino.

91
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,574
To be fair.

92
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,950
A lot more throwing up in their mouth.

93
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,953
Yeah.

94
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,253
Well,

95
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,161
you know,

96
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,140
thank you for that fucking keyboards.

97
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,370
This is essentially,

98
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,620
so it's sort of a preview of the,

99
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,030
this weekend's fights are really just a
chance to get together and fuck around.

100
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,350
I was told it was a breakdown,

101
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,533
but he couldn't be.

102
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,900
I was told to break down hair.

103
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,190
I've studied all night for a break.

104
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,891
I have my notes.

105
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,850
I was told this is a breakdown.

106
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,771
What are your thoughts,

107
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,280
sir?

108
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,113
I'm glad you asked.

109
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm going to go with a asked me,

110
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,810
asked me.

111
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,051
Well,

112
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,250
I'm going to go with Nate Diaz now.

113
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:53,750
Ask me why.

114
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,583
Wow.

115
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,890
Well,

116
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,611
the way I look at it,

117
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,660
and correct me if I'm wrong,

118
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,760
Connors boxed the daylights at everybody.

119
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:05,410
Who for the most part either has his
reach or smallest way does he hangs on the

120
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,244
edge of the pocket.

121
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,610
He hangs on the edge of the pocket and
he's a counterpuncher waits to you commit

122
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,050
slips and hits.

123
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,150
He's dealing with something
very different with Nate,

124
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,520
which is that Nate is
longer and taller and neat,

125
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,510
doesn't have to do that.

126
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,230
And I wonder what he's going to have to
do is either one of two things is going

127
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:24,660
to have to weave and get inside or
because nightstands so you know,

128
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,743
flat,

129
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,000
I mean it's sort of squares up with you.

130
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,390
I guess he could back kick
in front kick is his body,

131
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,830
but kind doesn't kick.

132
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,240
Like it's not what you think.

133
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:34,451
Whoa.

134
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,290
Watch out for Connor.

135
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
Connor's a hard kicks.

136
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,474
You know what I mean?

137
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,220
So he actually keeps pretty good.

138
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,820
Yeah,

139
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,391
he does.

140
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,140
Very good kid.

141
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,710
He doesn't,

142
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,510
I haven't seen much of
him cause he's smoking.

143
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,100
Everyone is murky.

144
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,770
But Nate's a very durable guy too.

145
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,310
He spends a lot of time in those gyms
with a lot of those Mexican boxers that

146
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,660
stand in the hole and just bang,

147
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,530
which is in Connor.

148
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,491
It's not,

149
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:54,850
but I,

150
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,171
but I,

151
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:58,060
I wonder how common is going to actually
have to change a little bit of his

152
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,280
boxing and I'm curious
to see how he does it.

153
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,114
He's only um,

154
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,620
what about this idea?

155
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,340
What if,

156
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,340
what if Meisha Tate crawled
on about a three point stance.

157
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,210
Literally crawled toward Holly home
cause she couldn't get kicked Sean Jones

158
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,600
style.

159
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:13,960
Right.

160
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,430
And just grabbed her ankle.

161
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,760
Picked single does.

162
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,070
She won't be going to punch her.

163
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,170
She's in a punch in the face.

164
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,100
I kicked her arms but oh my God,

165
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,950
that's not a viable,

166
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
let's see.

167
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,700
Get them kicks show.

168
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,240
She can kick the shit out of those arms.

169
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,700
Let me tell you something to
do to have you on all forms,

170
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,070
on all fours and someone kicks your arms.

171
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,320
Horrific.

172
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,170
Break your arm and your dumb ass as they
get up and fight with one [inaudible]

173
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,620
guys.

174
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,911
Sorry.

175
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:38,320
It was my,

176
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,160
my status.

177
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,540
She's probably listening me.

178
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:43,720
Shit.

179
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,201
Don't do that.

180
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:44,490
It's bad.

181
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,490
I should a climbed on top of the Octagon
and leaped to the center of the Misha

182
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,051
has a knife.

183
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:50,261
Guys.

184
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,360
You ever thought about that do well,

185
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,030
you can't do that if
Nisha knows named Jitsu,

186
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,550
right?

187
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,450
What does she a golf,

188
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
sleeping dust.

189
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,930
I need to stand hopes calling.

190
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,130
Put Him on speaker.

191
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,421
Stan,

192
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:04,950
hope you're on Rogan's podcast.

193
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,843
You're on speaker

194
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,713
delay.

195
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,273
He

196
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,530
notices his fucking phone
vibrating in his pocket.

197
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:18,970
No,

198
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,020
it doesn't delay Killam volume.

199
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,770
We'll pause it.

200
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,603
You pause it.

201
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,470
Can we pause the show?

202
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,570
No,

203
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:24,681
no,

204
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:24,930
no,

205
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,131
no.

206
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,520
He's talking to just stand still.

207
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:26,920
Stand.

208
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,753
Still.

209
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,283
Pause.

210
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,000
I texted Rogan a picture
of you in the fun house.

211
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,680
Yeah.

212
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,513
Yeah.

213
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,543
I just got it.

214
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,743
Here it is.

215
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,690
Is this me hammer?

216
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,523
Yeah.

217
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,920
I just texted a picture of us.

218
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,550
Oh Shit.

219
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,900
You in the fun house.

220
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,520
What's going on?

221
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:47,641
Yeah,

222
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:47,790
we,

223
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:47,981
we,

224
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,230
we,

225
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,720
we,

226
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
we came in late.

227
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:53,070
Chad shank said he's been
watching it since the beginning.

228
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:53,371
He goes,

229
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,540
they mentioned my name.

230
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,160
He can't hear us.

231
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,430
Yeah.

232
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,850
Well you can tell it's beer,

233
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,890
but here.

234
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,090
Yeah,

235
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,450
go ahead.

236
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,081
Do you hear us,

237
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,880
Doug?

238
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,500
It's on speakerphone and he should be
able to hear us using speaker phone.

239
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:06,650
Yeah.

240
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:06,741
Oh,

241
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,190
he's watching.

242
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,550
Oh yeah.

243
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,300
Hang on.

244
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,700
Shit.

245
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,130
No wait,

246
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,710
we pause.

247
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,543
Do you

248
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,170
see or talk to Joe?

249
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,004
Did you just do it?

250
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,511
Well,

251
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm just saying you're the
only one who could talk to him.

252
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:18,934
Douglas.

253
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,850
Yeah,

254
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,440
sure.

255
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,100
We have a,

256
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,840
we have a shitty way
of communicating here.

257
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,170
We've got to figure out a better way to
do this because you could only hear us

258
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,910
when we're like really
close to this phone.

259
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:29,380
You're not wired into anything,

260
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,720
so we have to pass the phone
around for you to hear us.

261
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,290
Unless you like this speaker
phone works pretty well.

262
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,160
I was just trying to fuck with Chrysler.

263
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,070
I think you need colleagues for good
to turn his phone off for the plug.

264
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,251
Dawn.

265
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:41,730
Doug.

266
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,001
No,

267
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,050
nobody ever turns it off.

268
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:43,884
They turn it over.

269
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,870
We're too addicted to turn it off.

270
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,680
Nobody.

271
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,850
Nobody turned shit off.

272
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,713
It's too,

273
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,680
you never know.

274
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,180
Someone might get in contact with you.

275
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,980
What the fuck's going
on in the desert sun?

276
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,500
Ah,

277
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,910
that we,

278
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,140
uh,

279
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,360
we,

280
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,101
we did date.

281
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,770
You have bingos disappearance.

282
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,180
I Dunno.

283
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,770
Burk talked about that in early.

284
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,171
Yeah,

285
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,004
he did.

286
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,760
Yeah.

287
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,070
Yeah.

288
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,751
The gate two,

289
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,584
at the end of it,

290
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,320
she calls and uh,

291
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,070
reveals her location.

292
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,910
Whoa.

293
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,220
So got it.

294
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,830
Ain't over there.

295
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Still has to be the,

296
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,470

297
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,303
uh,

298
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,920
what's it gonna be?

299
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,260
Is it going to be him
or is it going to be me?

300
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,170
Whoa.

301
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,010
No gunfight.

302
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,233
Don't do that.

303
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,531
No,

304
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:21,771

305
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:22,040

306
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,860

307
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,693
You're cool.

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,803
So you and the guy.

312
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,360
so you're hopeful that
it's all gonna work out.

313
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,670
It'll work out one way or the other.

314
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,650
I just hope it works out in my favor.

315
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,920
