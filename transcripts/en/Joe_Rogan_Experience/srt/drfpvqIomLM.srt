1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,650
Yes,
it's true that the new Joe Rogan 

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,931
experience studio will have a desk that 
has meow written into it in metal.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,060
Damn.
That's how we roll bitches real deep and

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:19,230
we hire craftsman having shit 
constructed right now.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,510
Made out of old re a reused farm.
Would the Joe Rogan experience podcast 

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,360
is brought to you by many,
many things,

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,930
ladies and gentlemen,
because the shit all costs money and I'm

8
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,710
trying to get paid.
You know what I'm saying?

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,280
One of the things were brought by is a 
fucking bad ass new cell phone company 

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,211
called Ting.
Ting is it's.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,120
They use the sprint network so it's not 
like they have three towers in the whole

12
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,980
country now.
They have a fucking major network.

13
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,450
They use a sprint network and they make 
shit really simple.

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,280
They cut out all the bs that is normally
involved in having a cell phone.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,710
Like for instance,
you don't have to have a contract,

16
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:06,711
you don't have to pay if you cancel,
like there's weird shit that happens 

17
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:07,500
when you get a cell phone.
It's weird.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,050
It's not like buying gas.
You can't say,

19
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,240
well,
you,

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
I don't want to use your gas anymore so 
I'm not going to give you any more 

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:15,290
money.
No,

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,981
you,
you somehow or another got roped into 

23
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,761
some weird thing where you've got to 
continue to give them money and if you 

24
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,300
don't want to give them money anymore,
you've got to give them extra money.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,960
Three hundred and $50.
He usually kind of bullshit is that.

26
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:29,961
That's nonsense.
That should be illegal and what team 

27
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:33,720
does is they take it upon themselves to 
try to create a moral business,

28
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:36,930
a business that that's fair.
A business that makes sense.

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,530
No contracts,
no bundling and ride along services,

30
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,240
no overage charge.

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,510
If you use a certain amount of cell 
phone minutes per month and you don't 

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,051
use like all of your minutes,
they roll over into the next month the 

33
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,570
way it should be.
Rogan.ting.com.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
That's where you want to go and you'll 
save 50 bucks off of any smartphone and 

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,681
they have some dope phones,
especially the one that I got from them 

36
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,230
is the Samsung Galaxy s three and it is 
fucking bad ass.

37
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:12,231
I love it.
Especially for looking at pictures and 

38
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:12,570
looking at websites.
It's enormous,

39
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,110
man.
The screen is gorgeous.

40
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,020
Is it better than the iphone?
It's not better.

41
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,330
It's different.
It's bigger screen.

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,690
It's a bigger screen.
I know that,

43
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,820
that part's better for sure.
But um,

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,850
I really am so used to the apple 
operating system that it will be hard 

45
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,420
for me to say what's better and what's 
worse.

46
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,300
And by the way,
I kept a blackberry for a long time.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,310
I hung in there,
dude.

48
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,020
I took body shop.
I saw people.

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,830
I saw Mike Young last night using a 
blackberry,

50
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,670
probably reminding himself of the old 
jokes that he's got written out.

51
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,510
It's blackberry.
This,

52
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:45,800
uh,
sorry my tongue.

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,820
I hate to do that to you.
And Mike Young,

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,730
you know,
I love them.

55
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:50,010
Sort of.
I do love him.

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
He's a great guy.
He's a great human being.

57
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,780
I just give him.
I give everybody shit about their act.

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,720
You know,
if you're,

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,240
if you're telling the same jokes for 10 
years,

60
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,770
someone should give you shit and you 
should snap out of it.

61
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,410
I think that's for all of us.
Can you think Duncan?

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,260
Yes,
but other than that my comes and awesome

63
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,700
dude.
He's very funny too.

64
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,400
Very funny person.
What are you doing with that noise?

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Getting crazy.
I like what you're doing with tripping 

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,240
you out.
You aren't tripping me out.

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I like that.
Setting the stage.

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,680
Um,
so go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot

69
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,990
com and find out more.
Find out the technical shit that I can't

70
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:24,040
tell you and see all the different 
phones that are available.

71
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:29,041
Lots of different android phones are 
available and even like regular phones 

72
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,600
leave if you're,
if you're crazy,

73
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:34,601
you're one of those nutty dudes likes 
one of those flip Dana White's one of 

74
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:34,601
those many dudes.
He's got like flip phone.

75
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,320
It's got a little flip phone.

76
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,370
That's how they all had them in Japan.
Remember in Japan they all had high tech

77
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,000
flipped.
Totally different though,

78
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,030
but still teaching as you say,
it's creating a situation where you 

79
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,650
don't have to have a contract and they 
have cheap phones.

80
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,930
They have great.
That's called prank central.

81
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,750
I can just pop in there and get a phone 
for a month and then put that in my 

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,480
friend's trunk or in a briefcase.
So they think they found some government

83
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,640
phone and then randomly call them 
fuckers.

84
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,780
Fuck yes.

85
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,710
Who the fuck is wrong with you?
Why would you think to use it like that?

86
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,360
Especially in the middle of a fucking 
commercial

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,560
that that helps sell the phones to cont 
was what's wrong with praying?

88
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,460
Thank you for landing.
Now.

89
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,380
That's really fake.
Anyway,

90
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,090
back to the commercial.
Go to [inaudible] dot ting.com

91
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,970

We're also brought to you by death squad

Brian Red band.

94
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,720

00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:31,750

to put a website up that represents what
desk squad is,

97
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:38,220
is our little family of fuckheads.
That's us.

98
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,700
We're the desk squad.
Long story anyway.

99
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,790
It's,
um,

100
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,520

103
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,800

it's bad ass to say,

104
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,830
you know,
so many people wearing these silly 

105
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,451

107
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:06,471
dates.
A lot of guys are starting to do a 

108
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,020
little mini road trips.
I know Brian's got one coming up in 

109
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Columbus,
Ohio with.

110
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,490
Yeah,
with Brendan Walsh and Tony Hinchcliffe 

111
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,680
and a special guest.
So I can't tell you about who's pretty 

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,931
fucking bad ass.
So I'm going to Vancouver to not you 

113
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:17,931
bitch.
It's not all about you

114
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,100
motherfucker.
It's not all about him.

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,590
I'm in the middle of a commercial for 
Brian.

116
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:28,591
You like,
I'm going somewhere to Vancouver to you,

117
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,070
man.
Just calm down.

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,130
I didn't get the program.
No,

119
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,220
you should be happy though.
Somebody's got another desk squad 

120
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,220
tattooed.
This makes it,

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,990
I think the 15th one and check this out.
It's the new cat.

122
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,030
The one that you like so much.
Oh Wow.

123
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:45,031
That's good.
That's a really good version of that is 

124
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:48,660
fucking creepy as shit isn't it?
And I can't even tell what part of his 

125
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,260
body because it looks like it's very 
big.

126
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,620
It's clearly as.
It's weird.

127
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,740
I'm not a hardcore.
Porn is going on there.

128
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,380
You've got a lot of porcelain.
Nice.

129
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,020
Eat some vegetables.
I don't know what's happening.

130
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,170
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

131
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,320
That's o n n I t and [inaudible] Dot com
is a essentially a supplement company 

132
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,470
all for high end athletics.
Supplements and what we call nootropics 

133
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,110
and what nootropics are is

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,610
far more complicated for a retard like 
myself to be describing and would really

135
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:23,040
seem hypocritical if I had some Alpha 
brain with my beer.

136
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,890
Is it not good with beer?
I don't think.

137
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,200
Does it really freaked me out?
No,

138
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,020
I don't think it goes with beer.
Brian Duncan,

139
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,930
excuse me.
No,

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,650
I don't think it's a nutritional and 
alcohol.

141
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,120
It's like the opposite of nutritional.
Alright dude.

142
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Silly Bitch.

143
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,780
If you go to [inaudible] dot com,
o n n I,

144
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,450
t you can check out all the different 
supplements that are available.

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Um,
all of them are things that I have used 

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,210
extensively before we ever got involved 
in the company.

147
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,540
It's all stuff that I believe in.
Anything that I ever sell you on this 

148
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,890
silly fucking show.
One thing I can guarantee you,

149
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,940
if I say something,
even if I'm incorrect,

150
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:06,690
I believe it.
Um,

151
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,430
I'll never tell you anything I don't 
believe.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,920
And if I find out that I'm wrong,
I'll tell you that.

153
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,120
And if I use something and I tell you to
use something,

154
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,550
it's because it's a really solid product
period.

155
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,140
That goes all the way back to the 
fleshlight.

156
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
very underrated product.

157
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,470
Flashlight,
right Brian,

158
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,140
just because I encouraged you,
play a little piano in the background 

159
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,990
doesn't mean you can have fucking aliens
landing on my head.

160
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,790
You're freaking me out,
man.

161
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,780
The newest things we have at a on it,
our hemp force,

162
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,760
which is this new delicious protein 
powder,

163
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,860
it's the best tasting protein powder in 
the world.

164
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,290
It's fucking fantastic.
It's made out of hemp,

165
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,750
which is hard to get an illegal in this 
country.

166
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:48,450
Duncan trussell illegal.
I know they've.

167
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,950
Even though it doesn't even get you 
high,

168
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,010
that's a good answer to the question 
that inevitably comes to these poor 

169
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,350
folks that have to get drug tested at 
work.

170
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,700
No,
we don't.

171
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,010
None of them.
Like if you.

172
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,500
If you eat hemp protein powder,
you will not test positive for thc,

173
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,400
but if you eat poppy seed bagels,
you will test positive for heroin,

174
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,950
so you've got to be careful about that,
which is really crazy.

175
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:12,951
But it is true.
They tell you not to eat poppy seed 

176
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:12,951
bagels before you go in for a drug test.

177
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,970
Does that mean that you could take 
enough poppy seed bagels and extract 

178
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,520
heroin out of them?
I do not know.

179
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,610
I don't think so.
I think it's just a confusion in your 

180
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,701
system because I think the urine test 
that they use just register metabolites 

181
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,230
and it's just the same metabolite.
Apparently.

182
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,790
I got it.
I don't really understand it.

183
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,610
I don't think so.
I don't think you can get high from it.

184
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't think you could just eat all 
day.

185
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,430
I can't imagine if that's why the appeal
of bagels at poppy seeds.

186
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,730
We're just super mild heroin,
you know,

187
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,720
and you just eat it in the morning and 
just feel everything feels so good.

188
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,070
How poppy seeds don't digest full laser.
Like when you're wiping emily's little 

189
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,620
seeds flying all over your hands.
Yeah,

190
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,090
they're kind of tricky.
Well,

191
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:56,091
people had been arrested for having 
those seeds on them when they go to a 

192
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:56,091
like the Middle East and like really

193
00:08:56,091 --> 00:09:00,980
strict drug countries because their 
seeds of like set off alarms and those 

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,581
fucking eight.
Remember those things that they use for 

195
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:07,041
a little while that would push dust off 
of you that they don't use those 

196
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,790
anymore.
I just stopped using those because dudes

197
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,100
are going to jail for fucking poppy 
seeds and other countries.

198
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,350
Fuck,
that's just my ex opposition anyway.

199
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,250
Have hemp force will not make you test 
positive.

200
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,720
It's just the plant and it is a.
it's a.

201
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,650
it's not psychoactive at all.
Even though it's completely,

202
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,080
completely illegal.
Yet legal.

203
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,750
It's really weird.
It's totally legal to have.

204
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,480
It's totally legal to sell,
but you can't grow it here.

205
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,510
You have to grow somewhere else.
It's really a fucking.

206
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,830
It's,
it's,

207
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
it's clear corruption and it's clearly 
the pharmaceutical drug companies 

208
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,350
controlling agriculture and controlling 
our access to one of the greatest plants

209
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,470
the world has ever known for whatever 
fucking goofy ass reason our government 

210
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,470
has let this go and place and even 
though they know that this hemp plant,

211
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,190
even though it's related to marijuana,
it has no psychoactive properties.

212
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,180
You cannot get high from it,
but it has an amazing source of protein,

213
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,930
amazing source of amino acids.
You can make essential oil out of it.

214
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:07,290
You can make fuel out of it.
You can build houses with it.

215
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,590
It's really unbelievable.
That hampers illegal,

216
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,750
but it is so we have to buy it from 
Canada,

217
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,100
but it's legal to have it.
Once you get it,

218
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,350
once you fucking let somebody else grow 
it,

219
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,390
it's so crazy.
It's just one more giant piece of 

220
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,570
evidence that we're fucked.
But if you go to [inaudible] dot com,

221
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,120
that's o n n I t,
you can get yourself some hemp force.

222
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
It's Yummy.
It's not.

223
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,460
It doesn't have,
it's got one gram of sugar per serving,

224
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,900
one I think.
Yeah,

225
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,340
something.
Whatever small amount is,

226
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,590
and it's all Stevia that it's sweetened 
with,

227
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,660
so it's sweetened with natural 
sweeteners and it's Yummy is fuck and 

228
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,350
it's got Makkah and it's also got a raw 
cocoa in it.

229
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,730
So go to [inaudible].
Com comments o n n I t.

230
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,790
all right,
you fucking get some battle ropes in 

231
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,790
your system.
We've got kettle bells,

232
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,920
battle ropes,
do a lot of manly shit.

233
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,290
Duncan Trussell,
and if you use a code name Brogan,

234
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,350
you will save 10 percent off any an all 
supplements.

235
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,190
All right,
freaks.

236
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,520
Duncan trussell's here.
Let's get the party role.

237
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,700
Yeah,

238
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,080
the Joe Rogan experience.

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,630
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

240
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,930
All Day.

241
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,910
Powerful contrast.
A lot of times you know someone,

242
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,160
you can know someone for a long time and
you go,

243
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,990
wow,
this fucking weird cat,

244
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:28,991
man.
I ain't never met anybody like him and 

245
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:28,991
you never get it.
You're like,

246
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:29,240
what is this dude is not like anybody 
ever.

247
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:34,241
I wonder how this guy grew up and then 
you go to the town where they grew up 

248
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:36,260
and you go,
oh,

249
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,360
okay,
okay.

250
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,410
Okay.
Okay.

251
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:44,411
Okay.
I just got a huge piece of the Duncan 

252
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,130
trussell puzzle this weekend in 
Asheville,

253
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:49,640
North Carolina.
Asheville is so awesome.

254
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:54,641
I don't want to tell people about 
Asheville because I'm scared they're 

255
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:54,641
going to move there.
I know.

256
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:59,160
I'm scared.
They'll move there and fucked up place 

257
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,160
up.
It's crazy.

258
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I mean it's grown so fast,
already mad because it's.

259
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,910
It's unbelievably beautiful.
It's,

260
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:07,911
it's the whole thing is so ridiculous.
You've got this incredibly gorgeous 

261
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:12,690
landscape all around you everywhere.
These intense green mountains and then 

262
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,400
there's a super cool people in this town
where you can walk around everywhere and

263
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,210
you're like,
whoa.

264
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:19,770
I mean,
it's like,

265
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,830
it's like they took the best parts of 
Austin and moved into the North 

266
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:24,830
Carolina.
Right.

267
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,090
That's a perfect description.
It's like southern cool people,

268
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,820
but it's like freebasing Austin,
if that's possible.

269
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,280
It's really Canadian mining it.
Austin.

270
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,280
It's Austin in an inner needle.
Shoved right into your Dick,

271
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,960
but you didn't get to walk around

272
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,080
new shops I went to.
There's a tea room there were like,

273
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,900
like there's opium den with

274
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,900
blankets everywhere.
People wear their shoes.

275
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:53,901
Offsetting like reading poetry and it's 
fucking cool places.

276
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,450
So weird.
It's weird.

277
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:58,980
It's awesome though.
It was awesome.

278
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,680
The show was awesome.
Hanging out with the people there.

279
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:06,681
It was awesome.
Thanks to my friend Sam for hooking me 

280
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:06,681
up,
taking care of us out there.

281
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:10,020
It was a that the whole place was just 
so strange.

282
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,770
It's like what a crazy little town.
It's so small.

283
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,040
It's so small and cool and like 
everything.

284
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,140
I.
I just loved everything about it.

285
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,760
It's like occupy Wall Street turned into
a city now.

286
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,240
It's not because it's not as 
complaining.

287
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,870
That's true,
but it is filled with.

288
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,310
I mean it is filled with subversive 
folks.

289
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,230
It's,
there's a lot.

290
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,440
There's a lot of people there who are 
apparently in the Environmental 

291
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,810
Liberation Front.
Ecoterrorists perhaps are hanging out 

292
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:43,810
there.
Oh my God.

293
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,510
You should probably not say that on the 
air.

294
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,870
Doing the government's work.
I think people.

295
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,380
Oh yeah.
It'd be really hard to figure out.

296
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:53,381
There might be ecoterrorists there.
I saw none writing down the fucking 

297
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,220
street on some giant tricycle

298
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,320
cases on the phone.
That wasn't a nun.

299
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:02,530
That was a chick who's going to go fuck 
her boyfriend and he wanted her to come 

300
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:02,530
over dress like a nun.
That's what that was.

301
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,860
That's a gross.
Yeah.

302
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,930
That's a great girlfriend.
That's.

303
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:09,931
That was.
It wasn't at my house on a tricycle 

304
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:09,931
dressed as a nun.
I'm Horny,

305
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:10,760
but there were a few churches there,
so maybe it is,

306
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,310
you know,
I think religion that is.

307
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,530
I've never been to the one place that 
has no religion,

308
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,540
like even a boulder.
Boulder's pretty,

309
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,040
pretty liberal,
intelligent,

310
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,180
you know,
sort of a left wing.

311
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:22,820
He kind of a place that had plenty of 
churches.

312
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,240
My friend has sent me this thing.
I haven't listened to it yet on this 

313
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,380
debate that they did as to whether or 
not the world would be a better place if

314
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:34,940
religion did not exist and it's like a.
like these are professional debaters and

315
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:39,941
intellectuals.
I can't remember what it's like on NPR 

316
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,461
or something,
but the end result was they decided to 

317
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:42,461
have the world's better without religion

318
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,010
that they say that,
but yes and no.

319
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,890
I think religion serves as an operating 
system for a lot of people and if

320
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,070
they didn't have religion you'd have to 
explain shit to them and that could get 

321
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,491
so tiresome.
They will get so tiresome to sit around 

322
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:04,571
with some blundering Moron pontificating
on what it means to have a finite life 

323
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,970
in an infinite universe.
And what,

324
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,240
what part of you know,
this part of this experience you really 

325
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,520
do play,
what part do you play and what,

326
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:17,330
what is your consciousness all about and
why you so scared of it shutting off.

327
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Know those are scary,
terrifying questions for the average 

328
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:22,640
person and you know,
maybe like,

329
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,590
you know,
maybe some ditch digger do doesn't need 

330
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:28,590
to know that.
Maybe there's some dudes who have some.

331
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,600
I believe there's people that have 
brains that work way better than mine.

332
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,780
I've seen it.
I've talked to people that it's not just

333
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:39,020
a matter of education.
It's a matter of some people are gifted,

334
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,080
you know,
there's some people have a little tiny 

335
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,080
hands and then there's people that are 
built like Shaquille o'neal and he could

336
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,350
grab them and crush them and it's not 
fair.

337
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,330
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's just the way it is.

338
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,760
And I think that there's some people 
that are,

339
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,020
they're living in this life as humans,
but yet they're not quite human to like 

340
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,820
just below human,
like you talked to them and you're like,

341
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,990
um.
So,

342
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:04,991
uh,
so what do you think happens when you 

343
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:04,991
die?
Well,

344
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,070
man,
for sure you go to heaven and you get to

345
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,240
be with Jesus.
Well,

346
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,110
I've believed this and I was a child and
you're talking to them and you know,

347
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,880
there's like a weird disconnect with the
person.

348
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,050
Like they,
they talk and it's not,

349
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,950
not even that they're there,
they're not just like this.

350
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,790
I've met some really intelligent 
Christians.

351
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,990
Don't get me wrong.
It's not what I'm saying.

352
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
What I'm saying is there's certain 
people that are just really dumb and 

353
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:30,260
they really aren't capable of thinking 
about deep shit.

354
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,410
They're not capable of pondering the 
really insane question of what the fuck 

355
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,940
this life is.
They're not capable of it.

356
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,380
So religion I've always felt was like a 
nice scaffolding for people like that.

357
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,520
It lets them experience all the benefits
of,

358
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,580
of,
of being a positive person and being a 

359
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,580
giving and loving person.
You know,

360
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,180
we all experience those benefits,
you know,

361
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,110
it's just,
they're,

362
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,990
they're teaching them to do it in the,
the,

363
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,300
the,
the way that it's,

364
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,370
it's transcribing the wishes of some 
holy master who created you and I said 

365
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,160
it once.
I'm not fucking saying it again.

366
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,260
Write it down.
This is what you do,

367
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,300
do it or else you go to hell.
It's like,

368
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,540
it's almost like it's structured to make
the idiots like have a really simple 

369
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,550
moral path.
Like it gives you a nice little story to

370
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:27,551
explain the really weird but real 
complexities of love and positive 

371
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:33,581
thinking and,
and how it shapes lives and how your 

372
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,330
intention shapes lives in your 
imagination,

373
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:40,331
shapes your life and how this thing is 
malleable and it's,

374
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,170
it's not understood.

375
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,660
This life that we're living simply not 
understood.

376
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,000
That's too fucking weird for some 
people,

377
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,220
they're not gonna they can handle that,
that's not getting in there,

378
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,450
that that's going to their ear and 
bouncing off like it hit a fucking 

379
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,660
trampoline.
So for some people,

380
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,990
religion allows them to be on a good 
path.

381
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,670
It allows them to,
you know,

382
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:10,671
to do good and to experience the result 
of that even though they're doing it 

383
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,140
because of some fictional character,
it's like they're still doing the same.

384
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,320
They're doing the correct things.
So like when religion gets nutty when 

385
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,611
you get into like the inquisition or 
stabbing cartoon makers because they 

386
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:29,931
drew your guy.
When religion goes completely off the 

387
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:30,300
tracks like that,
that's when it becomes a problem.

388
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,140
But I think that's not the majority of 
religious people.

389
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,320
I think the majority of religious people
probably benefit from it in a sense of 

390
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,440
community for sure.

391
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,600
You know,
churches are a big part of neighborhoods

392
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,470
and communities,
you know,

393
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,500
it's a big part of how people interact 
with each other.

394
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,560
And if you could find something that 
was,

395
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,380
uh,
a religion where,

396
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,520
you know,
it made sense to you,

397
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,800
if it,
if it was a logical religion,

398
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,040
it actually would probably be a good 
thing to be a part of because you're,

399
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:06,111
what you're doing is you're committing 
your family and you're committing all 

400
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,871
the families around you that are all in 
the sort of community together to take 

401
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:09,790
part in some sort of journey of 
spiritual Islam.

402
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,900
Can I play devil's advocate literally?
Sure.

403
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,570
Against religion.
So,

404
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,890
um,
because I agree with you,

405
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,510
but I think that the problem is that it 
creates a not only a structure where 

406
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:26,581
people can sort of rest and have an 
ethical system that they're not going to

407
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:31,681
come up with on their own.
But obviously the danger of all that is 

408
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:36,520
that certain unscrupulous human beings 
have figured out that if they put on the

409
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:41,521
right costume,
they can convince dopes to give them 

410
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,060
cows suck their day,
take gold.

411
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,640
Because all they have to say is.
And they're like,

412
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,580
God,
they're the priests.

413
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,370
And religious leaders become like gods 
agents,

414
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,170
like ca for God,
where they're like,

415
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,330
yes,
I'm taking the cause for God.

416
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:58,840
I'll tell you what God wants and it 
wants you to blow me.

417
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,720
Conveniently in,
I don't know why,

418
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,750
because he's crazy,
but he wants you to suck my dick and he 

419
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,240
wants seven of your cows.
I don't even know why likes cow

420
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,780
and he would like 10 percent of 
everything you make for the rest of your

421
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:12,740
life.
That's what he said.

422
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,990
I just don't kill the Messenger.
That's what he said.

423
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:17,690
We're not going to put it on paper.
I just want you to continue to pay that.

424
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah,
just that's not even on paper,

425
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,270
right?
When you tithe,

426
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,010
it's not like written somewhere or you 
have to give 10 percent of your money.

427
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:26,960
Right?
Isn't that some people just do.

428
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,090
I don't know if there's a scriptural 
thing that says 10 percent.

429
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:34,090
I think it's something that just sort of
seems like a logical number,

430
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,270
but I remember that it was a couple of 
years ago in India and in a temple,

431
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,360
they like opened up at the faults in the
temple.

432
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:48,361
They hadn't opened it up or they found 
some vaults and it was just filled with 

433
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:51,451
gold,
just filled with fucking gold and you 

434
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:55,231
know,
everyone around the temple was in offer 

435
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,150
all this money.
But when you really think about what 

436
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,281
that goal came from,
it came from hypnotized people who 

437
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,750
believed that these priests were in some
way representing God.

438
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,970
And then the gold didn't even go 
anywhere.

439
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,180
It molded in the basement of a fucking 
temple.

440
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,130
Wow.
So it's so when,

441
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,730
when you see that there's that level of 
exploitation that happens in like you,

442
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,850
you retweeted that amazing youtube video
of the guy whose job it is to suck the 

443
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,180
freshly circumcised kids cock.

444
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,630
And he's explaining why according to 
religion,

445
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,700
that's in my.
That's the guy in my act.

446
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:30,060
People think that that's fake.
That's the really is real.

447
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,570
I couldn't believe it do.
I did think you were exaggerating.

448
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,180
I couldn't believe that that's a,
uh,

449
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,390
an actual.

450
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,370
Yeah.
Well,

451
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:41,371
it's not only that he was justifying it.
He was justifying it by quoting the 

452
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:44,510
pages.
It says in page 64 chapters.

453
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,920
He's going through all this nonsense 
with his fucking wizard outfit on his 

454
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,461
goofy ass beard and he's explaining 
where it says it's okay to suck that 

455
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:53,650
baby's Davies.
He's so.

456
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,650
He's so completely lost his objectivity 
that he,

457
00:21:56,651 --> 00:22:01,651
he is actually trying to explain why 
this is necessary.

458
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,830
I think there's a distinction to make 
between that deck,

459
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,380
that baby deck.
It's not just a baby's deck,

460
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,460
it's a bleeding,
babysit a screaming babies there can,

461
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,820
you know,
like I say in the bit about it that I do

462
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:20,821
in my act,
like how the fuck do we know that that 

463
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,130
kid can't remember that we're just 
assuming just because he can't talk and 

464
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,130
he,
you know,

465
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,811
that he doesn't have a way to express 
how much it sucks that you cut his dick 

466
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:27,910
and start sucking on it.

467
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,540
But for sure you don't know whether or 
not that baby can remember that.

468
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,541
That seems like a really traumatic 
moment and I remember some intensely 

469
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,950
traumatic moments from when I was young.
So I would think that would be something

470
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,770
that would fucking haunt the back of 
your brain for the rest of your life.

471
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Some old creepy asshole speaking in a 
dead language and sucking your Dick 

472
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,270
while he's wearing a wizard costume.
Bloody Day.

473
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,550
Your Dick that he just mutilated slash 
Dick.

474
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,700
While your parents don't even save you,
your parents let this stupid.

475
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,930
Yeah,
they're paying dues to get this dummy to

476
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,450
fucking cut your bloody duck.
Suck it.

477
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,860
I just had my mom on my podcast and I 
was like,

478
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:08,861
what did.
How did it go when I came out of your 

479
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:08,861
pussy?
Did they circumcise me?

480
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,091
Right?
Then they cut it off then and she's 

481
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:13,091
like,
yeah.

482
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:13,400
She said it was sometime around there.
She's like,

483
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,990
she's like,
but you didn't like it.

484
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:15,560
You cried.

485
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,320
Jesus Christ.
No Shit.

486
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,980
I cried.
You snipped off the tip of my car.

487
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,600
It's so crazy.
It's everybody's mutilated.

488
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:27,650
You know?
The majority of Americans are mutilated 

489
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,480
and it's a weird thing with people where
they don't want to admit that this is 

490
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,170
like,
it's really kind of people.

491
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,120
You're so exaggerating.
Rogan.

492
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,400
Fucking relax.
Mutilating.

493
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,580
That's a really what it is.
It's like skin is there to protect the 

494
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,731
tip of your Dick.
Don't you think uncircumcised macaques 

495
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:45,980
and porn look weird knowing don't Duncan
the skin is

496
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
supposed to protect the tip of your Dick
and your Dick is supposed to be like 

497
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,101
glistening mucusy.
It's supposed to be like super 

498
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,071
sensitive,
but instead they hacked that shit off 

499
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,490
and the tip of your Dick Dries out.
It's not supposed to be dry like that.

500
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,340
It's supposed to be moist like inside a 
woman's vagina.

501
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:06,341
That's what your Dick supposed to be 
like and it's supposed to feel better 

502
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:09,101
that way because of that,
because if it's moist and slippery and 

503
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:13,241
then there's this nonsense that people 
are pushing and it's all been disproven 

504
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:16,930
by science about aids.
People are saying that it's like to 

505
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,930
protect people from aids.
Like that is one of the craziest ideas I

506
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:24,931
have ever fucking heard.
Is that somehow or another extra for 

507
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,630
skin?
Dick skin is gonna protect you.

508
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,690
If you fuck a guy got aids.
Like that is one of the craziest ideas 

509
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,051
I've ever heard.
Like you're going gonna fuck that guy 

510
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:35,051
man.
He's got aids.

511
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:35,051
Like dude,
I'm circumcised.

512
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:36,650
Oh well go,
go fuck away.

513
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,010
Go hit it buddy.
Like this.

514
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,460
Not Protecting you from AIDS,
there's no fucking way that protects you

515
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,380
from aids.
That's ridiculous,

516
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,770
but we we can justify doing it.
We want to justify that it was done to 

517
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,470
us and we were in denial about it.
You're,

518
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,640
you're hacking off a piece of a little 
kid's Dick and there's no science for it

519
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,670
whatsoever.
It's craziness and the majority of 

520
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:00,670
people do it.

521
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,410
How many pounds of baby for skin meet?
It's generated a year enough to feed 

522
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:11,000
like a couple dogs for life,
right?

523
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,110
Couple bears.
Thinking about all the babies being born

524
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,280
and just chop,
chop,

525
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,390
chop,
screaming.

526
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
If you could put together all the babies
being born,

527
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,780
coming out of pussies all at once and 
getting their dicks circumcised 

528
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,160
altogether and one screaming man.
It'd be a V,

529
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,600
a dubstep music video.

530
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,700
I think it would.
I think.

531
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:41,850
I think

532
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,940
you are underestimating the amount of 
force can meet that gets generated by 

533
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,900
the feed.
Like you hear about that guy who fell 

534
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:51,900
into his hogs,
hogs,

535
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,660
the hogs Itam.
Yeah.

536
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,870
Pigs are a motherfucker,
man.

537
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,480
Pigs are a motherfucker.
They're so scary.

538
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,060
Big Fat,
stupid animals that would eat you if you

539
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:01,150
fall in their pay.
Anything.

540
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,330
Seven hundred pounds like this.
They just started chewing on.

541
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,510
I bet it was a quick death though.
Well they,

542
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,050
they fucked him up,
man.

543
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,080
You know,
they ate most of them before the people 

544
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,810
even found like the guy went missing for
a few hours by the time they got there.

545
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:18,780
He was just disemboweled.
They had just eaten the shit out of him.

546
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,230
Well they,
yeah.

547
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,480
They couldn't even find him.
Yeah.

548
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,070
Most of them was missing.
It's really scary with a picket duty.

549
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:25,860
You.
It's like the Tibetans skier at your.

550
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,740
With both pigs.
Wild pigs are even better than that.

551
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:30,180
You don't even have to mash up the 
bones,

552
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:32,610
the do it for you.
They'll take care of everything.

553
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,240
The pigs are,
uh,

554
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:39,470
you know,
they're responsible for more deaths per 

555
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,710
year than any of the livestock.
That's crazy when you think about like 

556
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,710
bowls.
But no.

557
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,370
Pigs are responsible for more deaths.
I had no idea.

558
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,920
Yeah.
Pigs are fucking for a wild pig.

559
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,010
Especially wild pigs are really creepy.
That just doesn't go through my list of 

560
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,061
ways.
I might die that you've never seen the 

561
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:57,150
pig show a pig man.
Now go pig hunting.

562
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,780
Dude.
It is one of the craziest shows that 

563
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:02,780
I've ever seen on television.
Okay.

564
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,090
Is a guy named pig man and he lives in 
south Texas and the pig.

565
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,230
The wild pig problem in south Texas is 
like roaches in Manhattan.

566
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,030
I mean,
it is bananas.

567
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,120
You can't fucking believe how many pigs 
there are and they're huge and they're 

568
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,041
wild pigs.
It's what happens with pigs is a pig 

569
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:22,650
when they leave the.
It's really weird.

570
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,610
When they leave captivity within three 
weeks,

571
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,030
their body changes,
their snout starts to grow longer,

572
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,910
their hair gets thicker and bushier 
their fans,

573
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:35,490
their tusks grow longer.
It's really weird,

574
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,850
like they physically morph and it starts
in just three weeks.

575
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
As soon as they have to fend for 
themselves as soon as the food's not 

576
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,880
continually delivered to them.
So you keep them in like this fetus 

577
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,451
form.
When you continually deliver food to 

578
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:50,451
them,
when you see pigs,

579
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,800
you see them,
they're fat and they're lazy and they're

580
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:57,801
just laying around and we just stuff 
them and overstuff them and then 

581
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,110
eventually slaughter them that they do 
not even remotely resemble wild pigs.

582
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,330
Wild pigs are mother fuckers,
dude,

583
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,300
and they will attack you like this one 
and this one show.

584
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,450
This guy shot a wild pig with two arrows
and it didn't kill it and the thing 

585
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,790
charged them from the bushes and he's 
unloading a pistol into it.

586
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,600
Blab,
Blab,

587
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,920
blab.
Plan as a thing,

588
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:21,921
rushes him a death run.
It's with tusks and there are hundreds 

589
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,230
of pounds,
three,

590
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,280
four,
500 pounds,

591
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,410
wild pigs,
and they're everywhere.

592
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:27,090
There are millions of them in Texas.

593
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,540
So this guy,
pig man and Ted nugent get a helicopter 

594
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,050
and they're flying around in a 
helicopter shooting these pigs out of 

595
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,410
the sky,
shooting them from this guy.

596
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,120
It's.
It's insane.

597
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:42,330
They killed 200 pigs in a,
in a one hour show.

598
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,220
It's amazing the different lives people 
are having.

599
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,850
Yes it is.
This guy is just fucking up pigs all 

600
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,080
day.
What do you call Shanken?

601
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,610
I'm here to Shanghai,
Shanghai.

602
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,130
He's Shanken swag and he's like this 
heavy duty southern,

603
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
you know,
a good old boy from south Texas.

604
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,940
It's a funny fucking.
It's a funny fucking show man.

605
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,950
Like you know when you play video games 
and when you're going to bed,

606
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:15,951
if you played video games too much,
you kind of see him on the back of your 

607
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:15,951
eyes if you ever done that.
Yes.

608
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,040
This guy,
when he goes to bed,

609
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:22,041
he just sees pigs and from a helicopter 
shooting and shooting pig too.

610
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:26,040
They shoot them with assault rifles to.
I mean it's crazy.

611
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,560
It's.
They're swooping around this helicopter.

612
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

613
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,870
So why not grenades?
Because they actually use the meat.

614
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,930
Oh,
I see.

615
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,630
They,
they give the meat to a foreign foreign.

616
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,910
They'd give the meat to a poor.
He sent

617
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,260
me.
They sent the Meta Iran,

618
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,000
Afghanistan where all the boys wild 
swine.

619
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,650
Nothing.
They love more than wow.

620
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,250
Poor.
Yeah.

621
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:53,150
That's how we really good at them.
We brought,

622
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:57,520
we import pigs because the Muslims,
they're not supposed to eat pork.

623
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,760
If we imported these 500 pound murdered 
fucking hogs murdered from the sky,

624
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,310
death from above,
they do it to like apocalypse now,

625
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,800
Dr de Dah.
And it's called a pork lips.

626
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,570
Pork Lips.
Now I is,

627
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,940
it is.
It is a fucking insane show.

628
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,520
Um,
so there are no pigs in Iran.

629
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,990
Um,
that's a good question.

630
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,580
I don't know.
I do not know.

631
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,620
I know.
Uh,

632
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,150
yeah.
They're not supposed to eat them if it's

633
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,110
a Muslim country.
Right?

634
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,980
I mean,
you would offend a lot of people if you 

635
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:27,980
were eating them because they eat their 
own shit.

636
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

637
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,460
It's sort of Gorilla Doni.
Correct.

638
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,090
Bush meat.

639
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,400
That's where it all starts.
That's where patient zero starts.

640
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,540
So gross.
You ate bad guerilla one night and then 

641
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,341
you get aids.
There was some people eating thing in 

642
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:47,400
Africa right now.
What do you think the aids grill.

643
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:50,340
It tasted like.
Not good tasting,

644
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:53,460
like old feet.
Just a gym,

645
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,550
but they were hungry.
It tastes like a cadaver.

646
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,890
Ugh.
Yeah.

647
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,570
It's got to be very human.
Like dirty game me than humans though.

648
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,100
What did that gorilla do to get aids?
Why?

649
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,220
Where did it?
The grill so many probably fucked it.

650
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,670
It's probably when you introduced like 
human,

651
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,710
we're going to find out that all this 
shit boils down to somebody had a 

652
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,140
fucking animal somewhere.
All of it.

653
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,940
Where,
where's the swine flu come from?

654
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:20,260
Well,
the funny thing about pigs,

655
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,630
they'll just let you fuck.
I'm so people started getting swine flu,

656
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,980
chicken,
flu,

657
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,670
chicken virus.

658
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,510
You know,
that's the thing about flu's.

659
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,060
A lot of people don't know a lot of 
them.

660
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,340
Um,
bird flus there,

661
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,220
the,
these fluids.

662
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:38,221
A lot of them,
they come from farms that come from 

663
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:41,680
these crazy places where you stuff a 
million animals on three acres and uh,

664
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,660
you know,
it smells like death.

665
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,740
And that's where diseases come from.
Yeah.

666
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,820
It's really weird.
Farms are fucking creepy man.

667
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,040
Like,
like cattle farms,

668
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:56,041
whether they butcher cows.
We went and did a fear factor on one of 

669
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,241
them.
I got to tell you about this other guy 

670
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:00,241
on fear factor tube goes with what we're
talking about earlier about religion.

671
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,500
Remind me,
but we went to this thing.

672
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,570
We had to do this a slaughterhouse 
episode.

673
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,440
It was a fucked up show man where we 
gave these people,

674
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:13,441
it was like a bathtub of blood and they 
had a dunk their head in and pull out 

675
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:17,760
these rings that grabbed them with their
face and pull out these rings and they 

676
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,640
were just covered in blood and one guy 
was,

677
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,360
he couldn't do it.

678
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,860
It was cold water.
The water.

679
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,890
I mean the blood rather was really cold 
and it had to be 38 degrees because 

680
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,840
otherwise it can go bad and then you 
people sick.

681
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,760
So we had to change the blood for every 
person.

682
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,750
I think that was polite.
Yeah,

683
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,830
well that's.
I think we had to do it for health 

684
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,830
reasons.
I,

685
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,830
I forget,
but I remember being super,

686
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,870
super cold.
So anyway,

687
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:44,930
this guy starts going nuts and smashing 
the blood.

688
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,430
I don't like the Hulk and screaming and 
this guy had been in the parking lot 

689
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,431
before the show.
He had been talking in his side view 

690
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:54,431
mirror,
looking at a side view mirror and go,

691
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,520
you are a winner.
You,

692
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,910
you are going to press ahead.
Nothing will stop.

693
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:02,870
You cannot quit shit.
So this guy had some like serious,

694
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:06,380
like hangups in his mind with failure 
when it comes to,

695
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,850
I don't understand you say you smashing 
the blood.

696
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Well like the hulk,
like here's a big bathtub full of blood 

697
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,160
and he's going to like this splattering 
all over everybody in him and he's 

698
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,100
soaked in blood screaming and he was a 
big guy.

699
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,370
He was a big dude.
He's like a football player and I'm 

700
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,370
looking at this guy and this guy wants 
to kick my ass.

701
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,110
Like this might be a real problem.
Like this is a big dude.

702
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,230
Like this guy would like,
he's like a fucking physically strong 

703
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,810
guy.
Like if you want to kick your ass,

704
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,740
the very least someone's getting hurt 
you.

705
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,260
This is going to be going to be some 
chaos.

706
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,410
And I'm looking around with these,
these fucking cameraman.

707
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,580
They're all skinny guys smoking 
cigarettes.

708
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,650
Most of them are completely out of 
shave.

709
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,500
A lot of them are older guys were like 
back problems.

710
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:48,560
I'm like,
no one's going to save me.

711
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,540
Who's going to save me if this guy goes 
bananas?

712
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,940
That is fucking.
Yeah,

713
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,990
this dude right here,
apparently he was a really nice guy and 

714
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,230
he felt real bad about his performance 
on the show and he just said that he was

715
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:05,150
having some issues and he had had it 
with like other sports in the past.

716
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,170
Yeah,
it was insane.

717
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,390
It was insane.
By the way,

718
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,420
I don't even remember this.
I'm watching this and I don't even 

719
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,420
remember it.
I barely remember it.

720
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,990
Dante.
Oh,

721
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,370
inferno man.
That's demonic.

722
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,400
We did 148 of these fucking things.
Can you believe that shirt?

723
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,510
What a ridiculous job I had.
I'm screaming at these people,

724
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,490
giving them,
telling them they can do it

725
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,770
crazy.
This guy right here,

726
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,660
I saw you outside.
You were talking to this,

727
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,430
the side of the mirror.
What are you doing?

728
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,710
Psyching yourself up.
It's a story that goes back to my 

729
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:41,710
football coach and he said,
little eyes upon you.

730
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,620
You know little kids watching you all 
the time and the man in the class.

731
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,530
Look yourself in the mirror when you're 
done and you say,

732
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:49,630
good job.
That's what I want to do.

733
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,460
You go home and you can't look at 
yourself.

734
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,480
I don't want that,
man.

735
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,230
All right,
well,

736
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:58,231
you're going to be looking at yourself 
in the mirror with a big fat face full 

737
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:58,231
of blood.
What's going to happen now?

738
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,520
You're going to send Joseph home.
I'm going to do my best buddy.

739
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,110
I can't pull my head in there and then 
go home and have people say,

740
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:03,130
man,
you did that for nothing.

741
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,840
Joshua.
You Ready?

742
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,600
Ready?
You beat 19.

743
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,460
Joseph goes home and you move on

744
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,400
in three,
two,

745
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,670
one.

746
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,740
So he quit right away and see how he's 
screaming,

747
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,850
punching the blood,
get so nasty.

748
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:33,921
Look at that,
and he couldn't do it right now.

749
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,020
He keeps shaking,
shaking his face.

750
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,850
That's all I'm saying is.
See everybody else just went in there is

751
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,430
totally quitting.
Now,

752
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,480
here's what he starts freaking out.
Good instincts broke and I saw that 

753
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:15,621
blood coming.
This is so ridiculous.

754
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,250
No,
I don't think so about that transfer 

755
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,170
like an episode.
Incredible.

756
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,230
Incredible.
You.

757
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,210
I noticed how much different

758
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,280
my voice sounds before I got my nose 
fixed.

759
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,290
Yeah,
I had a nasally sort of thing going on.

760
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,540
I had no nose for most of my life when I
got a deviated septum operation.

761
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,130
Completely changed my life.
Man.

762
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I can't believe I went so long.
I have friends that have like fucked up 

763
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,280
noses.
I'm like,

764
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,920
do please get your nose fixed.
Just please listen to me.

765
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,840
Get your nose fixed.
You're whole life.

766
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,850
You can be like a dog like this.
Here.

767
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,770
You realize it.
You know your whole life.

768
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,320
You get this fucking thing that's 
blocking up air.

769
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Did you hear about that millionaire that
did so much cocaine that his fucking 

770
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,900
nose exploded?
Did not collapse.

771
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,140
Here's,
here's a.

772
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,920
here's this nosy like,
looks like boss Hog neck.

773
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,720
Oh damn this.
Let's just go down.

774
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,390
Jesus Christ.
Look at that.

775
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:22,680
Fucking knows.
Alright,

776
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,610
whatever you're using,
windows aren't you?

777
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,190
Got To stop enough.
I didn't know somebody that did so much 

778
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,400
cocaine that,
uh,

779
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,160
his nose in between the nostrils,
like,

780
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,590
made a hole in between the two nostrils.
But to do a lot of,

781
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,840
that's like a goddamn commitment.
Do you think it collapsed all at once?

782
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,580
Like one night he woke up and I was 
like,

783
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:42,940
that.
Or,

784
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,240
that guy's an ugly fuck and he doesn't 
give a shit.

785
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:46,660
Anyway,

786
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,400
just trying to get my ged shock and get 
my coke.

787
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,210
He's one of those can get my coke,
we'll get him.

788
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,820
The other dude that,
uh,

789
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,970
I want to talk about the fear factor 
when a million dollars and he was going 

790
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,591
to tie that.
He's just going to give them a 10 

791
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:07,811
percent is church.
And the dude started talking in tongues.

792
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,170
He was talking in tongues like he was a 
showman.

793
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,360
Zalia yeah.
Glossolalia.

794
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,260
Colossae.
Lelea.

795
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Yeah.
Just how long they start talking and see

796
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,200
if he could put that up.
Pull that up,

797
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:27,980
man.
Fear factor.

798
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:32,210
Guy Speaks in tongues.
It was so bizarre that he won.

799
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,650
He Won.
He won a million bucks.

800
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,860
So maybe the dude just believes in 
himself so much because of all this that

801
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,840
he forced the.

802
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:41,860
Well,
you know,

803
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,090
where that speaking of tongues comes 
from right now,

804
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,320
after the Jesus,
our Lord died.

805
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,570
He,
um,

806
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,970
his disciples were all gathered together
in some,

807
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,780
like hiding out and like,
I think he appeared to them or the doors

808
00:38:55,781 --> 00:39:00,781
opened and a wind blew through and 
suddenly they were able to speak in 

809
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:04,411
every language and they all started 
speaking and all the languages of the 

810
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:04,600
world.
That's the myth.

811
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,440
So pentecostal churches,
they will,

812
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:12,460
um,
try to induce this state,

813
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,760
you know,
I know you've seen it and they handle 

814
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:17,760
rattlesnakes do because that was the 
other thing.

815
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,450
He gave them power to take up serpents.
So they.

816
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,140
So they have these

817
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,650
rituals.
We handle rattlesnakes.

818
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,860
So what do they do?
They get bit,

819
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,490
a little bit.

820
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,810
Some of them,
they get bitten and they die.

821
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,080
Dude,
look up pentecostal snake handling.

822
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:33,650
He never seen that Rogan.
You've never seen snake handlers?

823
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,740
I've seen snakes.
They dance around with the snakes up in 

824
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:38,740
the mountains.

825
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,260
There's a guy whose father died.
He was a snake handler and then he just 

826
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,780
died really recently.
Who was one of those?

827
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,520
Those a snake handler guys.

828
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,710
Oh man,
that is just the fucking worst man.

829
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:51,710
That is the worst.
That's so creepy.

830
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:55,790
It's such the opposite of what that 
religion.

831
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,850
It's so weird that Christianity managed 
to mutate into like malnourished country

832
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:07,901
people talking and fake languages and 
holding snakes on a Sunday.

833
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:09,920
That's fucking weird,
man.

834
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,540
Yeah.
It's a very weird.

835
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:16,541
It's so strange how religion can mutate 
because like if you look at that versus 

836
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,890
Catholicism,
it's two completely different things.

837
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,930
Yeah.
This is from a just from may serpent 

838
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,690
handling pastor dies from rattlesnake 
fight bite.

839
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,610
Just like his father.

840
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

841
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,280
He's in West Virginia.
Hala,

842
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,840
his faith wasn't strong.
Is that what they think?

843
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:38,841
Do they think that like their faith 
failed and that's why the snake bit him 

844
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:38,841
or

845
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:43,240
we did some traveling through West 
Virginia and I got to just see some 

846
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:47,350
really bizarre places.
Like one of them was um,

847
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,620
a bar that was a house.
It was a house and then the downstairs 

848
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,410
was the bar.
I mean it was just,

849
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,530
they had like a plastic sign that said 
bar.

850
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,280
And I mean it was a fucking house.
It was like somehow or another they had 

851
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,760
converted their house into a bar.
It was so bizarre.

852
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:08,540
And then right next door was always a 
church and then there was always a strip

853
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,980
club.
It was strip club,

854
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,810
church Bar,
strip club,

855
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:13,190
church bar.
That's all you had.

856
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,920
Weird shit goes on in those Hollers,
Joe and the uh,

857
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,760
and,
and a city next to where my mom lives.

858
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,600
This guy fucking hacked up.
His Dad sit through his limbs on the 

859
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:31,610
Blue Ridge Parkway,
which is just up in the woods.

860
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:36,611
He was through his head,
the forest and then his arm somewhere 

861
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:37,910
and then his arm somewhere.
A Betty wasn't a good dad.

862
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,160
That was,
I don't know,

863
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:41,090
I,
I asked my mom,

864
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:41,570
I was like,
yeah,

865
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:46,571
the dad's probably.
I realized that the exact same thing 

866
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:46,571
where I blame the dad,
but she's like,

867
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:46,790
no,
it wasn't that,

868
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,190
you know,
the kid was just fucking crazy.

869
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,170
Yeah.
I mean,

870
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,230
you know,
regardless of how bad or daddy or I 

871
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,170
don't know if you deserve to have your 
limbs chopped off,

872
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,610
maybe.
Well there are exceptions.

873
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,260
Relentless for 20 years.
She deserved to get 20 years straight.

874
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:05,060
He just managed to crawl away to the 
ash,

875
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,460
been trying to get to the expert 20 
years,

876
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:12,461
and you never lost your heart on and 
develop those strength just from 

877
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:15,770
resisting ass rape.
Oh Man.

878
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:20,771
But that fucking goddamn idea that 
people just walk from time to time this 

879
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,170
member,
each other.

880
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,740
It's really strange that they're,
you know,

881
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,020
in the same way that what's his name 
flies around blast and pigs.

882
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:32,290
You also know that at this very moment,
multiple limbs are being hacked off and 

883
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,100
a variety of basements and back rooms 
and force like definitely more than like

884
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,500
50 people at this very moment are 
probably getting their arms chopped off.

885
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,890
Wolf,
how about this?

886
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,891
How about thinking about all the people 
in different parts of the world that 

887
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:48,291
have to walk around on the ground 
knowing that they're killing machines 

888
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,570
flying over their sky every day at any 
point in time.

889
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:56,571
You could be the wrong place at the 
wrong time and a hell fire missile comes

890
00:42:57,361 --> 00:43:02,361
out of one of these fucking flying 
killer robots and annihilates a house 

891
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:02,361
that you're standing next to

892
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,360
Predator drones.
That shit's intense.

893
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:08,750
And when you think about the future,
we've talked about this,

894
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,670
but I don't think we've talked about 
this on the podcast,

895
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:15,671
which is that when you see those Goddamn
quadra copters that can fly perfect 

896
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,110
formations,
and then you see those dogs that they've

897
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,940
used that.
What's that dog called?

898
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,910
Know the robot dog,
because people don't understand that.

899
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,270
If they can make that thing that size,
they can make it bigger.

900
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,660
They can make that thing real fucking 
big so that you've got truck sized robot

901
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:35,840
dogs lumbering into your village opening
up slats.

902
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:40,010
That quadric copters fly out of blast.
Everyone in the village,

903
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,320
you know,
cremate them or whatever,

904
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,920
suck them into the dog and walk away.
That could be the future of warfare.

905
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,460
It's like a Trojan horse at Trojan horse
filled with Quadra copters.

906
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,440
Yeah,
that's completely possible.

907
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,590
And not.
Not even remotely outside the realm of 

908
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:56,590
possibility because where do you think 
that they're?

909
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,430
They're learning how to build these 
robots.

910
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:03,200
It's Darpa.
Darpa is creating these robot dog

911
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,140
Darpa stand for.
Oh,

912
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,600
that's a good question.
Darpa gives me that fucking creeps.

913
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:11,180
Every time I see any Darpa rate later 
thing,

914
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:11,740
it's always

915
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,050
defense.
Advanced Research Projects Agency.

916
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,140
Jesus.
What is scary?

917
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,800
That's patient.
We named that the scary concern.

918
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,390
Crazy.
They're just finding new ways to fuck 

919
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:29,390
people up.
That's what they do.

920
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,460
It's funny how we like to call it 
defense.

921
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,960
How much money we're gonna spend on 
defense.

922
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,560
It's seems pretty authentic.
Our offense budget.

923
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,240
Yeah,
it's our offense budget.

924
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,000
Really.
It shit like robot dogs.

925
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,670
Come on son.
Those things are fucking terrifying.

926
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,320
Robot dogs.
You can't kick over.

927
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,850
They'd get back up.
Brian,

928
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,630
pull up.
One of those.

929
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,080
Darpa robot does is actually a new 
version that just came out.

930
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,330
I'm looking at it right now on the Darpa
website.

931
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:58,020
It is horrific sound.
It makes that kind of Hell's squeals and

932
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:58,380
it makes.

933
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,800
Dude,
this thing is terrifying.

934
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,930
It goes up hill.
Oh,

935
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:10,050
I'm looking at this video before Brian 
pulls it up and it doesn't even seem 

936
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:12,130
real.
It looks like CGI.

937
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,690
This thing is walking up hills.
It can negotiate over rocks and terraces

938
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,840
and it's built like a bowl.
Do you think they could make that the 

939
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840
size of a bus?
Yeah.

940
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840
Fuck yeah,
they could.

941
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,620
Darpa legged squad support system.
How'd you get to that video?

942
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,550
I went to Darpa.com
and then what'd you click on Darpa?

943
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,700
They have.
There's a little image of it all right 

944
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,671
here.
You see in the lower right hand corner 

945
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:40,360
and then the lower left.
It looks like a dog running at Ya.

946
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,590
That's it.
Click on that.

947
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:44,710
I love the way you figured out how to 
embed advertising into your podcasts.

948
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,330
We know you're sponsored by Darpa.
Joe.

949
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,890
I'm not sponsored by robot dogs.

950
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,380
You can't buy.
That doesn't even make sense.

951
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:55,970
Would it use coupon code Rogan at Darpa?
Look at this fucking thing,

952
00:45:56,651 --> 00:45:59,650
man.
That's like the giant robot bowl.

953
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,600
Imagine this thing.
Had machine guns and then rocket ports.

954
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,340
This things coming over the hill.
You don't shoot shooting Mrs 

955
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,570
[inaudible].
One of those things is coming over the 

956
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:14,570
hill.
300 of those things coming over.

957
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,400
They build one of these motherfuckers.
They they're going to build a million 

958
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,440
pound of 300 of those things at once is 
the last thing.

959
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:24,250
A lot of people are going to hear.
This music has creeped me out.

960
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,570
I want to hear this thing,
Brian.

961
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:26,740
I want to hear that noise.
It makes.

962
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,100
Hold on.

963
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,900
Imagine 300 locusts.
They're playing.

964
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:36,900
Follow the leader now it can follow.
Oh,

965
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,820
they follow each other?
Holy Shit.

966
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:43,821
It's like it's got a face in there too.
That is not following him.

967
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:46,690
That's what follow the leader is.
I don't want it to fall in.

968
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,330
Oh my God.
They're calling a follow the leader.

969
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:51,780
Not Chase you and hunt you down.
Isn't that cute?

970
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,460
They call it follow the leader.
Oh,

971
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:56,320
that's so sweet.
Follow the leader.

972
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,510
Look at this thing.
It's liners back.

973
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,280
Fucking goddamn terrifying.
Oh fine.

974
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,720
They can dance.
Oh my God.

975
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:10,710
Look at the scanners on them and shit.
Reading what's in front of them.

976
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,720
So scary.
That is so holy fuck kids.

977
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,520
Woo.
Yeah,

978
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:26,521
that's spooky shit man.
And when you combine that with those 

979
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:29,821
quadra copters man,
it's not just that the quadra copters 

980
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,010
and if you ever have you seen that 
thing,

981
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,040
they can jump off of buildings and we'll
just.

982
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,020
That alone is terrifying.
That thing is.

983
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,100
That thing is horrendous that that's a 
robot dog,

984
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,160
a giant robot dog that can house 
missiles and anything you want to 

985
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,770
fucking anything you want.
Those things would probably super 

986
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,731
strong.
They can carry all sorts of metal 

987
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:52,801
fucking things that kill people on them 
and they look like they look like they 

988
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:54,110
weren't going to stop.
That just looked like it wasn't going to

989
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:59,120
stop.
Like it's like you couldn't get away 

990
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,120
from them.
They would never stopped at.

991
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,120
Keep coming.
Yeah,

992
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,431
and even if they did stop a repair swarm
of quadric opters would come down and 

993
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:03,431
fix it.

994
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,700
You're not gonna.
You're not gonna.

995
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,710
You can't beat it.
You're not gonna be able to beat that 

996
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,051
kind of technology and mass that scale 
that is just as frightening almost as an

997
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:17,000
atomic bomb because it's just as 
heartless and cold and it's just.

998
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,330
It's going to do what someone said that 
someone has to do is press the button,

999
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,010
send it out there,
and they sort of alleviate themselves of

1000
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:29,011
any responsibility because it's the 
robot that's going to go in there and 

1001
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:31,861
fuck things up.
And also there's this ridiculous notion 

1002
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:36,391
that humans still seem to have that 
these computers are never going to 

1003
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:36,850
become autonomous.
Of course.

1004
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:37,540
Yeah.
I mean,

1005
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:42,850
at one point in time,
every single programmer that has ever 

1006
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,130
made anything that you use on your 
computer has had to contemplate where 

1007
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,220
the fuck that's going?
Where the fuck the,

1008
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,960
the anybody who's talking about 
artificial intelligence,

1009
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:58,020
anyone is talking about it,
they all say it's going to get too 

1010
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,020
upset.
The important.

1011
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,020
They all say yes.
And it's almost like we don't.

1012
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,030
We're like little kids that have a 
credit card and we're just going to keep

1013
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,520
running up the bill until the check 
comes and then we're going to go,

1014
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:04,540
fuck,
how do we pay this?

1015
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,680
Oh wait,
what have we done?

1016
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,080
Oh Shit,
we're fucked.

1017
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,040
Yeah.
Like we're gonna.

1018
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:14,190
We're gonna create this artificial thing
that is way fucking smarter than us and 

1019
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,130
realizes how gross we are.
Look at that thing that's on the sheet a

1020
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:18,910
robot.
It goes up to 28 miles.

1021
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,660
Look at that thing going.
Oh my God,

1022
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:26,920
that's scary.
That is fucking terrifying.

1023
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,840
Scary.
Looking at Komen,

1024
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,190
but again,
25 miles an hour running after you 

1025
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,520
imagine 200 of those running down hill.
It's not.

1026
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,790
It's not just one.
They just don't unleash one name.

1027
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,720
Only sworn in there.
They have.

1028
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,770
They're covered in

1029
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,600
machetes.
Can Be like a transformer can be bad at 

1030
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,880
Weiss.
Everyone hates underneath.

1031
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,160
Yeah.
They found out that cutting things apart

1032
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:55,190
is cheaper than shooting missiles and 
guarantee they're going to have drones 

1033
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,800
that can figure out how to turn human 
blood and the energy.

1034
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,400
It's just.
It's just weird to me that you know that

1035
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:01,710
this is all happening inside of our 
life,

1036
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,770
that this is all going on right now.
I mean we really are seeing robots that 

1037
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,011
can run 25 miles an hour.
We really are seeing drones shoot 

1038
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:10,800
missiles.
It's like it seems like some shit from a

1039
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:15,801
movie,
but it's really happening right now and 

1040
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:17,850
there really are people that are 
programming computers and programming,

1041
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:20,280
artificial intelligence,
and they really are going to get it to a

1042
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:23,340
point where it can think for itself and 
there really are going to get to a point

1043
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:27,740
where it can make its own decisions and 
where it can decide to improve itself.

1044
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,710
Auto bots doing this is really happening
in our life.

1045
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,080
We really might be in this glory day 
before the scene and the terminator.

1046
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,390
I mean that's.
That's that,

1047
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,550
that it's within the realm of 
possibility of robots do become sentient

1048
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:47,210
and then especially if they need more 
power,

1049
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,860
the question is the type of singularity 
that's not if the singularity is going 

1050
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:55,840
to happen,
but the type of singularity that happens

1051
00:50:55,841 --> 00:51:00,841
and that.
The big question is an advanced 

1052
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,770
intelligence that we made machines that 
becomes autonomous.

1053
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,670
Are they going to view us as just a 
waste of time and just decide to wipe us

1054
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:13,891
out or.
I think that the other alternative is 

1055
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:17,341
far more likely.
Are they going to see that we're a 

1056
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,741
resource in the same way?
Like they would probably see everything 

1057
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:22,090
as a,
a bit of information that they could use

1058
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:27,091
to transform and create whatever the 
thing is that they've decided is a more 

1059
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:29,230
perfect universe.
So I think it's more likely that they're

1060
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:34,231
going to assimilate with us than it is 
that they would just chop as to bits 

1061
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:35,980
because we are rudimentary bio 
computers.

1062
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:38,770
They certainly are gonna have some use.
You know,

1063
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:42,630
I think that I think it's going to be 
more about connectivity than destroying.

1064
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:47,830
Well the real issue is how do you 
program into an artificially intelligent

1065
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:53,021
being the need to improve or the desire 
to improve or the need to progress.

1066
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:59,110
It's like just because something is 
intelligent and capable of incredible 

1067
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:03,791
things and capable of thinking on its 
own doesn't mean it's going to have 

1068
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:07,121
those human style ambitions that allow 
us or cause us to make like a lot of the

1069
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:12,731
things that we make,
the things that we make we make because 

1070
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:16,271
of this weird competitive drive that we 
have because of this weird desire to 

1071
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,950
innovate and improve and create things.
These are like characteristics that have

1072
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:26,951
led us to not be monkeys.
They've lead us away from the lower 

1073
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:31,061
hominids and we don't know that a 
computer would have these 

1074
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:35,890
characteristics,
these characteristics that lead people 

1075
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,440
to work all day and busted her ass and 
you know,

1076
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:41,510
and in,
in acquiring material goods and be a 

1077
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,510
baller and all that stuff.
Those,

1078
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,960
there's a weird instinct,

1079
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,780
but the,
the what if those instincts inside of us

1080
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,140
are not just inside of us,
but our manifestations of a kind of 

1081
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,461
evolutionary energy that's rolling 
through time and as it rolls through 

1082
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:59,961
time,
it gets more and more complex and more 

1083
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:02,520
and more harmonized.
Which manifests in the form of evolution

1084
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:05,730
in the form of single celled organisms 
becoming multicell organisms all the way

1085
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:10,731
up to us.
This is an actual energy that in the 

1086
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:11,430
same way wind blows through trees and 
moves trees.

1087
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,820
When this energy blows through the world
or through time,

1088
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,990
it causes things to wake up and connect.
And in that case,

1089
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,320
whatever happens to be in,
in that wind,

1090
00:53:22,321 --> 00:53:26,100
in that energy is going to just wake up.
And that's what it does.

1091
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,890
So in that case,
it's not as though the computers need to

1092
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:33,891
be programmed,
they just need to be fine tuned enough 

1093
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:35,640
to start picking up that energy.
And once they pick it up,

1094
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,560
that's when the,
um,

1095
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,250
the,
uh,

1096
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,260
whatever this point is,

1097
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,980
that's assuming that something that's 
not natural.

1098
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,730
Something that was created by life,
not,

1099
00:53:45,731 --> 00:53:50,731
not born in a natural way is going to 
inherit the same sort of desires to,

1100
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,840
to progress forward.
You know,

1101
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,180
I think that the universe certainly is 
getting more and more complex.

1102
00:53:58,181 --> 00:54:03,181
Like everything.
If you look at the idea of the big bang 

1103
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,630
that's there was a single point smaller 
than the head of a pin.

1104
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,510
The giant explosion creates everything 
we see in the sky today.

1105
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,960
That just that alone,
like then it has to cool down and then 

1106
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,081
planets are formed and stars explode and
carbon based life forms based out of 

1107
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:17,610
star,
but we have,

1108
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,670
we have.
We literally have to have a star has to 

1109
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,111
explode for you can make a person.
A lot of people don't really understand 

1110
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:25,111
that you,
you,

1111
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:29,410
you look at that.
Just that idea that in that person might

1112
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:32,910
very well one day harness the power to 
make a star explodes.

1113
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,220
I mean that person could,
if you exponentially increase the rate 

1114
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,400
of our destructive capabilities,
if you look at like 19,

1115
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:45,160
47 when they first,
was it 45,

1116
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:48,130
47 when they perfected the atomic,
oh,

1117
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:48,910
I don't know,
the year,

1118
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:54,150
whatever year that is,
looked at as the forties and look at 

1119
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,880
2012.
What they could do now destroy the 

1120
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,771
entire earth like 100 times over if 
Russia and the United States and 

1121
00:54:58,771 --> 00:54:59,170
Pakistan,
everybody just launched their nukes.

1122
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,640
Everybody launched.
Every nuke we've ever made was.

1123
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,280
It was.
It would be crazy.

1124
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,380
I mean,
it would be nothing left on the planet.

1125
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:07,090
The whole planet would be done.
Well,

1126
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:10,000
if you extrapolate 100 years from now,
you know,

1127
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:15,001
200 years from now,
what kind of destructive anti-matter 

1128
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:15,040
weapons are we going to have?
Then we're going to have star killers.

1129
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:15,730
You know,
we're,

1130
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:20,731
we're most certainly going to have to 
have the ability to erase things.

1131
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,340
A race planets.
It's just gonna happen.

1132
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:28,630
What you made me think I've man is like,
I've always thought that idea that we 

1133
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:33,051
are star energy that's woken up because 
the elements are the result of fusion 

1134
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:39,801
happening inside of stars.
I've always thought were eight 

1135
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:44,270
degradation of the energy of the stars.
Where are the energy getting weaker or 

1136
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:48,561
weakening down?
But what if actually worst our energy 

1137
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:52,850
getting immensely more powerful.
Only the power is manifesting as 

1138
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,110
intelligence or consciousness.
And,

1139
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,100
and what if the this destructive thing 
that you're talking about,

1140
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:01,810
it doesn't come from weapons,
but from innovation and,

1141
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:02,960
and,
and this is this,

1142
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,130
this is why I fucking love Kurzwell 
because he's,

1143
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:10,340
he talks about this idea that it gets to
the point where we begin to manipulate 

1144
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:16,011
matter at the atomic level and this 
somehow spreads out into space where,

1145
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:22,180
where Nan Nan,
swarms of nanobots just fly through the 

1146
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,641
universe reconstructing matter according
the whims of whatever the overmanned is 

1147
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:30,691
or whatever the,
the force of intelligence that is a 

1148
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:34,111
result of everything connecting is now 
that's fucking a million times more 

1149
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:36,490
powerful than a star.
It's something totally brand new.

1150
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:38,350
It's like a novelty.
Explosions.

1151
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:43,890
I think there's no doubt whatsoever that
people are probably very much like a lot

1152
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:49,171
of other animals that create byproducts 
without even understanding why they're 

1153
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:49,171
doing it.
You know,

1154
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:54,060
there's a lot of bees making honey.
I mean they make honey to feed their 

1155
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,760
offspring of their.
They're little,

1156
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,070
but they also pollinate flowers.
They do,

1157
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:01,780
they do.
They do a lot of like weird tasks.

1158
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,930
Like they,
they help things move along in 

1159
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,220
pollinating plants.
You really like help things move along,

1160
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:09,760
right?
You,

1161
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:10,240
you,
you're,

1162
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:13,780
you're aiding in the process I think are
crazy.

1163
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:18,781
Need to acquire things is aiding in the 
process of technological innovation at 

1164
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:21,490
the highest speed possible.
I think it's one of the reasons why it's

1165
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:24,730
so compelling to get new phones and a 
new laptop.

1166
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,560
Dude,
you got the new laptop.

1167
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,550
Oh Shit.
Let me see.

1168
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,250
Look at that fucking screen.
It's sexual man.

1169
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,880
I mean it's sexy as fuck.
You can get a really dope phone.

1170
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:36,400
You hold it and you scroll through it 
and like it's.

1171
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:41,401
There's something.
There's something alluring about that 

1172
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:44,251
technology.
I think our desire to continue to have 

1173
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:44,770
bigger,
better,

1174
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:49,771
badder,
faster or more awesome or I think that 

1175
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:52,681
is.
That's the number one thing that's 

1176
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,591
pushing innovation.
The number one thing that's pushing 

1177
00:57:55,591 --> 00:57:58,381
technology is this desire for all these 
new objects and as that technology gets 

1178
00:57:58,381 --> 00:58:03,120
pushed further and further and further,
more becomes possible until you really 

1179
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,501
develop reality changing technologies.
I mean the atomic bomb is essentially a 

1180
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,970
reality.
Changing technology.

1181
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,030
Electricity is reality.
Changing the Internet's reality.

1182
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:18,031
Change is d reality changed for sure,
but it's essentially inevitable.

1183
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,570
It's like it's going to keep going and 
going and going.

1184
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:27,571
As long as the humans don't blow 
themselves up with one of their reality 

1185
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:30,481
changing things,
they're going to come up with something 

1186
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:32,851
like a time machine come up with 
something like some sort of a 

1187
00:58:32,851 --> 00:58:33,160
transportation device or transport or a 
beamer.

1188
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:38,330
They're going to be able to scramble 
your fucking cells and reconstruct them 

1189
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:38,330
on the moon.
I mean,

1190
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,580
they're gonna be able to do anything 
they want eventually.

1191
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:44,581
If if time keeps going on and people 
don't get killed by asteroids or blow 

1192
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:46,210
themselves up.
It's just inevitable.

1193
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,860
It's an inevitability for sure.
It's inevitable and you can kind of feel

1194
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:52,440
it,
and I know it sounds so stupid,

1195
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,040
but whenever I fucking go without 
playing a video game for a long time and

1196
00:58:56,041 --> 00:59:00,660
buy a brand new video game and play it,
it really fills me with a kind of.

1197
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:05,520
I love it,
but it's kind of ominous and how amazing

1198
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:07,320
they are getting,
how potent they are getting.

1199
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:09,420
You know that.
You used to talk about this,

1200
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:14,540
how our nervous systems might not be 
built for the massive amounts of sense 

1201
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:20,481
gratification that are accessible 
through technology and we it hijacks 

1202
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:22,010
your reward system.
Borderlands two,

1203
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,790
I just started playing this game.
Holy Shit Man.

1204
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,210
It's such a perfect game.
Not just like graphics wise,

1205
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:34,211
which are really trippy,
kind of like heavy metal magazine 

1206
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:36,731
trippy,
but like the game itself is the first 

1207
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:36,770
game that's ever made me laugh.
It's kind of funny.

1208
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,040
They've added a weird humor to it.
They get good voiceover actors and it's 

1209
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:46,001
super violent,
but it's so narcotic that it's really 

1210
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:50,240
makes me understand that this technology
is a drug.

1211
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,120
It's a drug that they haven't identified
yet as a drug,

1212
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,360
but it's a fun.
It's exactly like any other drug.

1213
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,800
Well maybe not even like any other drug 
like heroin it.

1214
00:59:59,830 --> 00:59:59,990
Well,

1215
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,930
porn is also a drug.
Yes.

1216
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:07,260
Porn,
especially the immediate access to porn 

1217
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:07,260
online.
It's a drug.

1218
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,380
I mean it is a drug.
There's no question about it.

1219
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:14,650
You know,
I was watching and Dr drew episode the 

1220
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,110
other day where there's a dude who was 
addicted to porn.

1221
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,830
Fucking fascinating,
fascinating looking at this guy and his 

1222
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,681
wife and you know them trying to work 
out intimacy again because this guy was 

1223
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:26,930
just fucking completely whacked off on,
beat it off to to check some online.

1224
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,950
It's a man.
It's a pull.

1225
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,040
It's like a technology has a gravity and
you and it's a gravity that doesn't 

1226
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:37,980
operate on mass.
It operates on a tension,

1227
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,190
so when you're around technology,
you can feel it.

1228
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,310
Drawing your attention into it,
the thing you were talking about with 

1229
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,130
your phone,
with porn,

1230
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,500
with TV,
with your car,

1231
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,690
you're fucking new car.
Whatever it is,

1232
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:56,870
it pulls at your mind in this very 
obvious way that's impossible to deny 

1233
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,540
and that that energy,
that is the beginning of the connection 

1234
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,530
that machines are making with our 
neurology.

1235
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:07,590
That's the very first contact.
When you feel that pole,

1236
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:12,860
you're filling feeling the force of 
technology linking into your nervous 

1237
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,731
system.
You're feeling an interface happen at a 

1238
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:19,161
very rudimentary level,
but that interface is going to get more 

1239
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,390
and more focused,
more and more advanced and more and more

1240
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:26,391
perfect until it'll lock in for good.
Do you think people back in the day 

1241
01:01:26,611 --> 01:01:29,220
though thought that about books like 
when blood these books,

1242
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,040
man,
they're teaching us.

1243
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:35,310
Well,
they didn't know when they first 

1244
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,400
invented printing.
That's one of the things that held Islam

1245
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,880
back was that they didn't allow it to be
printed with the typeset.

1246
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:43,200
It was only allowed to be like written 
down and there was a.

1247
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:47,530
It was a long time before they allowed 
the Koran to be printed.

1248
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,480
Well,
that makes sense.

1249
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,850
Yeah.
Well fuck them up.

1250
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,240
That's the thing about relisted print 
was the beginning of the devil and while

1251
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,280
they were in the same camp as the 
unabomber was a brilliant guy who they 

1252
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,570
whacked out with Lsd Studies.
Yeah.

1253
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,800
I think there's no question.
We have some bizarre attraction to 

1254
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:16,111
technology and there's no question that 
we're not set up to handle that type of 

1255
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,190
sensory overload that they provide.
Where when

1256
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,070
when a guy goes on a screen and you 
know,

1257
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,160
and his fucking face is 60 feet high and
he says the perfect shit because there's

1258
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:32,640
a team of writers who spent weeks going 
over his dialogue with a fine tooth comb

1259
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,540
and his music.
There's music playing when he's talking.

1260
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,930
I mean it's the impact is pretty fucking
intense.

1261
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,240
The hero impact that you get from a 
movie.

1262
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,700
Yeah.
That's if you could,

1263
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:47,390
if you could take someone from the 15 
hundreds and and,

1264
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,760
and bring them to a movie theater and 
get them to watch like Avatar.

1265
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,150
They,
they would shriek in horror.

1266
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,230
They would cry and scream.
They would be weeping and fascination.

1267
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,180
They wouldn't believe what they were 
saying.

1268
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:05,181
They would.
They would think that they were in the 

1269
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,531
presence of God himself.
If you played a movie and God was in a 

1270
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:09,330
fucking robe and old man and a robe can 
make magic shit happen,

1271
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,630
and you showed on the screen God,
like making things happen,

1272
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:15,270
all kinds of crazy special effects.
They would buy it,

1273
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:20,271
hook,
line and sinker 100 percent because it 

1274
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:21,630
would be beyond the realm of 
imagination.

1275
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,830
It'd be completely beyond.
So the question is,

1276
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,680
my thing was that were setup like that 
guy though our biology is like that guy,

1277
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:33,770
our biology hasn't changed,
but what we introduced to it on a 

1278
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:33,870
regular basis has changed significantly.

1279
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:38,930
It's,
it's getting and it's getting more and 

1280
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:38,930
more powerful every day and it induces a
trance state.

1281
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,710
And so the question is,
what are we like when we're not in a 

1282
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:44,500
trance state?
What does that look like?

1283
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:48,220
Because I don't know if you're without 
your phone for an hour,

1284
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,070
you feel a little weird.
Like if you forget your phone at your,

1285
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:56,071
at you feel weird.
So because the state of consciousness 

1286
01:03:56,071 --> 01:03:56,740
that we're in now,
we have become dependent on the machine.

1287
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,760
The machine has become part of us.
So what is,

1288
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,450
what are we like outside of that trance 
state,

1289
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,070
outside of that stupor.
What uh,

1290
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,080
what are we like when our consciousness 
or our attention isn't getting drawn 

1291
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,780
into some glowing screen?
And before that,

1292
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:18,781
what is it,
our consciousness like when it's not 

1293
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:19,390
being drawn into a book or a religion,
is there a pure state or.

1294
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:22,990
We always like constantly in relation to
something.

1295
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:28,170
Is there a way that you're not in a 
trance or are you always consistently 

1296
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,490
connecting with some symbols structure 
out there,

1297
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:31,780
you know?

1298
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:37,210
Well,
unless you live in the woods and go 

1299
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,930
offline for a while and you're 
connecting in one tiny bit,

1300
01:04:38,931 --> 01:04:41,070
you mean it's like you have your finger 
on home base,

1301
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,090
you're scared to run away from it.
You're safe,

1302
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,740
you're safe.
You get your finger on home base.

1303
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:51,010
How many times have you been at a 
restaurant and you're looking at your 

1304
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,010
phone?
It's just compelling.

1305
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,010
You check,
you can check it,

1306
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,290
check,
check,

1307
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:52,870
check,
check.

1308
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,910
Using link that you can use.
If you don't check your twitter.

1309
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,220
Endless.
It's endless.

1310
01:04:57,221 --> 01:04:57,630
And,
and,

1311
01:04:57,631 --> 01:04:59,260
and it's,
I mean,

1312
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:00,460
I,
I will admit,

1313
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,110
man,
I'm addicted to the Internet.

1314
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:05,200
There's no question.
My behavior is addictive behavior.

1315
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,360
I am addicted to information.
I love it.

1316
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,990
I love every weird little fucking thing,
man.

1317
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,870
The fact that I,
you know,

1318
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:17,020
the amazing leopard attack video that 
came out today,

1319
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:17,230
or

1320
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,270
what is the video?
It's a leopard in a gorilla.

1321
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:19,570
Is that okay?

1322
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:20,880
It's a fucking.
It's a,

1323
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,280
it's a leopard leaping it something,
but I was on the fucking airplane and 

1324
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:26,280
couldn't watch it.
I try.

1325
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,240
I spent 30 minutes trying to watch that 
fucking thing just because I was so 

1326
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,620
interested in it.
But when you consider that 10 years ago,

1327
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:37,621
15 years ago,
if you wanted to see something like 

1328
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:40,261
that,
you'd have to be sitting in front of a 

1329
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:40,261
big ass TV and before that if you wanted
to see something like that,

1330
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:42,790
you'd have to go out in the woods and 
find it to see it.

1331
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,780
You know,
it's,

1332
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:44,620
it's the,
the,

1333
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:49,630
the things that we are witnessing as 
human beings in this time period or 

1334
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:54,631
things that most human beings in the 
past would see one of them in their 

1335
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:55,780
entire lives if that,
if that.

1336
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,640
The thing is that these things are 
coming out as constantly all the time.

1337
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:05,110
So our senses are just on overload.
Just a 100 percent overload.

1338
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,940
Yes,
and we don't,

1339
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
we don't have the ability to process 
whether or not those rewards are being 

1340
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,260
utilized in a natural manner.
It's like a,

1341
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,560
it's like a parasite system.
It's like the story of that,

1342
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:22,561
uh,
aquatic worms that infects the 

1343
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,730
grasshopper and literally talks the 
grasshopper into committing suicide,

1344
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,670
just gets inside of its brain,
tells it what to do.

1345
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:29,830
And then,
and then hatch's Brian,

1346
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:34,120
if you pull up an animal face off 
gorilla versus leopard,

1347
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:39,150
I think that's the video,
but maybe that's what technology is 

1348
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:44,521
doing with us.
Maybe it's sort of embedded itself 

1349
01:06:44,521 --> 01:06:45,400
slowly but surely into our system and 
more and more and more,

1350
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,460
it's getting to the point where you 
can't function without it.

1351
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,020
It's

1352
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:54,740
beyond that point.
If you know the thing where they talk 

1353
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,570
about if the sun solar flares do much 
and knocks out all the GPS satellites,

1354
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:01,650
the havoc it'll wreak on this planet.
It's way past the point of no return.

1355
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:06,651
We've got to have the connection.
We must have it for our society to work 

1356
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:10,701
for trucks,
to deliver food for fucking nuclear 

1357
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:12,300
plants to work.
If this shit shuts down,

1358
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,100
you know and shit

1359
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,310
on the ropes.
Yeah,

1360
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:18,740
you got to fast forward quite a bit 
before the actual action.

1361
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:23,741
That's fake news.
That was an artificial leopard.

1362
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,350
Look at these fucking through.
These are real.

1363
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:32,770
They're having fights in the trees.
What a scary ass animal.

1364
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:37,250
Leopards are scary too,
because they're there.

1365
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,510
They're really quick.
The arms can you do.

1366
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,770
I've never seen this guerrilla fighting 
elaborate.

1367
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,720
These gorillas duking it out to shake 
off.

1368
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,730
We have that leverage is jack and that 
absolute.

1369
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,680
Oh my God.
That is crazy.

1370
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,860
The senses are as sharp as our size of 
that fucking thing could keep the 

1371
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:58,520
leopard and edge.
I would say gorilla would when I say,

1372
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,510
oh,
look at that.

1373
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:04,100
Predict who will win only to find out.
I don't know man.

1374
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:08,090
I wish animals have police.
The grill might.

1375
01:08:08,091 --> 01:08:13,091
When they look pretty fucking crazy.
The grill might just rip that thing 

1376
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:13,091
apart in our scenario of,
Oh,

1377
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:14,900
this is a scenario.
You sons of bitches,

1378
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:18,310
so this is all fake.
It's not just ones that are real though,

1379
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,320
isn't there?
Like,

1380
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,750
this is so dumb in our scenario,
in our crap.

1381
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,750
It's like a bad video game.
Oh my God,

1382
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:33,751
this is awful.
This is a video game for the eighties 

1383
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:39,390
produce.
This is what happens when the budget 

1384
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:39,390
runs out.
Yeah.

1385
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:44,131
This isn't the video.
Is there another video or is this the 

1386
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:44,131
one you were talking about is awesome 
because like.

1387
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,040
Yeah,
definitely.

1388
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,290
This is 100 percent horseshit.

1389
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,830
Well,
there you go.

1390
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,210
You were addicted to watching that 
though.

1391
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:57,770
You really wanted to see it.
It drew you in.

1392
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,350
It was real.
That's the thing man,

1393
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:05,351
and it's like the.
There's like a lot of meditative 

1394
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:07,811
practice practices are all about like 
developing your focus and developing 

1395
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:12,041
your will through developing your focus 
and when your mind is getting pulled in 

1396
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:17,471
a million different directions by your 
phone and by the computer and buy tv 

1397
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:21,650
than it really does seem like you are.
It's like eating too much,

1398
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,560
too many sweets.
You know,

1399
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:26,960
like you're some innate part of you is 
going to start rotting.

1400
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:32,000
You're gonna lose this really important 
focus like men,

1401
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,790
you know when you get around someone 
who's got real focus,

1402
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,120
who's really,
really figured out a way to pin to turn 

1403
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,651
their minds into a pinpoint,
like a laser fucking Tom cruise does it 

1404
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:46,610
from the scientology training.
Have you ever seen him?

1405
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,780
You know,
like when he gets,

1406
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,440
when he gets sprayed,
so he gets to blow my hair.

1407
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,380
I mean that dude.
I don't,

1408
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,880
I,
I wouldn't be surprised.

1409
01:09:55,881 --> 01:10:00,881
I'm sure there's a lot of power in that,
but we're so distracted right now that 

1410
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,230
when you come across someone who's got 
that kind of focus,

1411
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:05,960
you almost feel like you're around 
Dracula or something.

1412
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:09,590
It's kind of creepy when someone's like 
just tunes in salesmanship.

1413
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,530
Do you think that that would work on you
though?

1414
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:16,590
If you and Tom Cruise,
we're alone in a room together and you 

1415
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,390
had a conversation with suck his dick.
Stop.

1416
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,880
Stop.
If you are alone in a room with him,

1417
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:27,150
don't you think that he would appear 
silly if we talked to them just for a 

1418
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,150
couple of hours?
Oh yeah.

1419
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:30,250
He would be a silly person.
Like did you ever see him in Matt Lauer?

1420
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,270
Never.
See that.

1421
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:36,350
The conversation with a lady that got on
the subject of scientology and his 

1422
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:38,740
criticism of Brooke shields taking 
antidepressants,

1423
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,170
that's a fascinating dude,
man.

1424
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:44,170
He would curl rumble like a house of 
cards.

1425
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,270
Okay.
You think he's charismatic?

1426
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,460
I think he's only charismatic if you're 
really dumb.

1427
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,700
If you watch that video and you see like
the way he communicates when he talks 

1428
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:53,700
about,
you know,

1429
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,750
match pink glum.
You're glum like,

1430
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,340
he's like,
he's like a silly person.

1431
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,290
Like,
well,

1432
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,530
yeah.
It has to be protected.

1433
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,450
Yeah,
he will.

1434
01:11:00,451 --> 01:11:05,451
He's got an entourage around him and 
people who are probably better at 

1435
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:05,451
hypnotizing,
but yeah,

1436
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:06,130
as a brilliant actor,
I don't.

1437
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,470
I don't think I get sucked in by that 
from Tom Cruise,

1438
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,250
but I think that what you're saying,
but talking about Tom Cruise

1439
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:14,810
having this.

1440
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,240
Yeah man,
I think there's.

1441
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,320
I think it's an example of people.
What is that?

1442
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,310
Was that,
but we have video game tech Demo.

1443
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,270
Oh Wow.
That's

1444
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,960
fucking insane.
Crazy.

1445
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,220
Oh my God.
Look at the facial features.

1446
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:30,690
This guy is like making all these 
different facial features or a gestures.

1447
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,360
That's incredible.
That's really weird.

1448
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:38,390
That's crazy.
Creepy and it's going to get going to 

1449
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,881
get crazy.
It's gonna be hard to kill people in 

1450
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:40,881
video games.
You're gonna start feeling guilty.

1451
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:42,960
This is the new real listening engine 
where it's supposed to look like a real,

1452
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:48,050
as realistic as it looks like a video.
This is quake like it looks like a 

1453
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:48,510
camera.
You're going down.

1454
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,230
That looks so realistic.
If you told me this is a real video,

1455
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:52,890
I would say,
yeah,

1456
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,840
that's a video.
Someone's got their iphone.

1457
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:56,220
Amazing.
That's incredible,

1458
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,160
but my,
my,

1459
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:00,870
my thing was I just don't think that you
would be impressed with his focus.

1460
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:03,060
I think that's nonsense.
I think that's only.

1461
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,840
That's only when you see him in 
interviews and he puts on this thing and

1462
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,390
I think alone.
You would think that would be silly.

1463
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,170
No,
I,

1464
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,210
I think I.
I'll give you a list of people.

1465
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:13,650
I don't know why I started with Tom 
Cruise.

1466
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:16,740
Probably a bad idea,
but you see that focus in.

1467
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,030
I'm like politicians a lot.
Like Obama's got it.

1468
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,240
Even fucking Romney has this weird way 
that he kind of does the heat seeking 

1469
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,900
missile lock in on people when they're 
talking.

1470
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:33,150
It's different from the way normal 
people act and that level of focus comes

1471
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:36,990
from being supremely disciplined in some
way or another.

1472
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,300
You know,
whether it's because you're having to,

1473
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:44,570
as a politician,
like if you think about the level of 

1474
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:44,570
focus it takes for those guys during the
debates,

1475
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:46,170
regardless of whether you liked them or 
not.

1476
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:51,470
When you imagine that one misstep,
one each one wrong thing that you say is

1477
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:57,861
going to get repeated like a strobe 
light for the next week or perhaps could

1478
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,320
ruin your chance at being president.

1479
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,160
That's an insane amount of pressure that
they're under and they've developed some

1480
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:10,161
incredible focus that deal with it,
which I think is different than most 

1481
01:13:10,161 --> 01:13:10,860
other people.
You know,

1482
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:12,690
most people are scattered,
man.

1483
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:17,870
I eat dinner with people sometimes and 
they can't go four minutes without 

1484
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:18,390
checking their phone.
You know,

1485
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:20,880
you just get used to it.
You get used to this thing around people

1486
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:22,140
where it's like,
oh yeah,

1487
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:24,510
they're one of those people who always 
check their phone.

1488
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,970
Like I know during a conversation with 
this person,

1489
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,180
they're going to be constantly looking 
at their phone,

1490
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,060
irresistibly drawn to it.
It's the worst.

1491
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,220
Yeah.
There's some people that they can't.

1492
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,200
You can't lock in with them if they have
a phone on them.

1493
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,170
No,
they can't resist it.

1494
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:44,530
They don't even know they're doing.
Where it gets really creepy is where 

1495
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,460
your mid conversation with someone and 
they just go down to the phone.

1496
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,730
Oh yeah,
another dose.

1497
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:52,910
Well,
the worst is like there'll be in the 

1498
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:52,910
middle of something and then it'll stop 
and start texting and you're like,

1499
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:53,430
hey man,
are we hanging out?

1500
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,460
What's going on here?
Is this really that important?

1501
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,270
You're going to stop in the middle of 
talking like you stopped talking,

1502
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:04,690
you started going hold on file.
It's vitally,

1503
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,250
it's silly because most of the time it's
not that important.

1504
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,780
What could it be?
It's most likely pussy.

1505
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:19,590
Some of that sweet.
That's the other thing.

1506
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:23,140
The robots are going to have no desire 
for pussy,

1507
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,960
so how are these life forms can even get
out of bed?

1508
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,960
There's no no fucking reward system set 
up.

1509
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:33,990
I think that you are at being incredibly
optimistic thinking that robots are 

1510
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:34,600
going to give up.
They're going to pull the cord,

1511
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:39,601
they're gonna realize how pointless life
is and before they ever get to recreate 

1512
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:42,691
it,
they're just going to blow themselves 

1513
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:42,691
up.

1514
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:42,691
The robots.
Yeah,

1515
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:44,440
they're gonna realize what's the point 
where robots would have souls ever.

1516
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:49,490
Nothing got nothing.
Just send 10 robot fucking circuits 

1517
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:51,720
going off,
switch flipping back and forth.

1518
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:54,370
The singularity happens and they're just
a bunch of depressed.

1519
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:59,430
They're homeless,
homeless robots because they have no 

1520
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,040
ambition.
It's and then we have to figure out 

1521
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,751
whether or not we want to put ambition 
of the robots because then they'll 

1522
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:06,571
surely take over.
There'll be a big dilemma to be a bunch 

1523
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:06,571
of more list or like we have to give 
them ambition.

1524
01:15:06,571 --> 01:15:07,810
We gave them life.
They're like,

1525
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:10,000
Pinocchio.
He wants to be a real boy.

1526
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,280
I think it's very likely that they will 
have no desire whatsoever.

1527
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:23,281
Unless it's programmed into them.
There's no reason for them to want to 

1528
01:15:23,281 --> 01:15:23,410
fuck.
There's no reason for them to want money

1529
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:24,810
or a big house.
I mean they're.

1530
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:29,820
They're robots.
The what the fuck is the point in 

1531
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,220
advancing.
What's the point in making more robots 

1532
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:32,220
like what are.
What's the point of even being alive?

1533
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,750
It's like it doesn't.
There's not going to be any reward.

1534
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:39,930
The whole,
the whole like mo momentum that pushes 

1535
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:44,650
us towards all this technological 
innovation and towards progress is these

1536
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:49,651
weird reward systems that we have.
These reward systems are engineered by 

1537
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:54,091
the universe to ensure that we keep 
pushing forward and all of the these 

1538
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:59,460
reward systems are all like going after 
these primal reward systems that have 

1539
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:06,061
been inside of us for like hunting and 
gathering and cold as a reward system 

1540
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:07,890
that it wants a common cold.

1541
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,900
Is it,
is it.

1542
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,400
Does it have ambition?
Is it going for something?

1543
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,410
It's just,
it's just doing its thing.

1544
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,260
Yeah,
but we know that we're not a cold.

1545
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:20,760
We have actual were more complicated,
but viruses,

1546
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:23,080
computer viruses don't have ambition 
there.

1547
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:25,330
They've just been coded to do something 
right,

1548
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,690
but they don't act.
They react the.

1549
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,610
When a computer virus gets into your 
system,

1550
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,760
reacts to the fact that it can get in 
and then it moves forward.

1551
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,620
If this didn't get in,
it just stops.

1552
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:38,500
Right.
This point here is like the beginning of

1553
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:43,400
like an endless argument that you can 
have because the point is do we act or,

1554
01:16:43,401 --> 01:16:44,500
or are we just.
Well,

1555
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,590
my point was the computer viruses are 
programmed to do things.

1556
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:49,420
They're programmed to behave in a 
certain way.

1557
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:54,421
They go,
they try to go in if they can get past 

1558
01:16:54,421 --> 01:16:56,671
step one to get in the right.
I mean that's how a computer virus is 

1559
01:16:56,671 --> 01:17:01,431
set up.
We would have to make these computers 

1560
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:04,860
make these sentient beings.
We have to program them with some sort 

1561
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,831
of ambition,
some sort of desire to move forward 

1562
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:07,831
because if you didn't program them with 
a,

1563
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,620
with an objective,
a mandate,

1564
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,590
if you didn't,
then they would just be intelligent just

1565
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:17,591
because they're intelligent.
There's no reward system for them to 

1566
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,650
want to make a new nuclear reactor.

1567
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,610
Again.
Man,

1568
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:24,611
it's like you're creating a situation 
where the robots are different than us 

1569
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:29,860
non-writers thing where it's like 
they're not an expression of us or an 

1570
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:30,320
expansion of us.
You know,

1571
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:35,321
they could be us as they could.
They could take what we are.

1572
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,430
Our brains,
for example,

1573
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:40,880
which is what is creating all the 
simulation theory forever.

1574
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:45,860
Once they take a human brain scan than 
neurons in it,

1575
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:51,070
ron energy through it and replicated 
inside a machine will now you have 

1576
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,570
ambition now

1577
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:52,620
consciousness.
Wow,

1578
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,160
that's a big leap.
I think you have matter.

1579
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,740
You have organic matter that will move 
and react.

1580
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:02,741
Did the.
The idea of consciousness being 

1581
01:18:02,741 --> 01:18:04,640
completely local is a fairly 
controversial idea.

1582
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:09,730
There's a lot of people that don't 
believe that consciousness even resides 

1583
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:09,730
in the mind.
You know,

1584
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:13,261
if you want to get all woo with it,
they believe that consciousness is like 

1585
01:18:13,261 --> 01:18:13,460
radio signals in your body is 
essentially

1586
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:18,570
really good antenna.
There's no way except to be speculative 

1587
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:18,570
about this.
No,

1588
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,110
it hasn't happened yet,
so why would you?

1589
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:24,350
But I would speculate that if you're 
going to recreate a human mind inside a 

1590
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:27,891
computer,
I would speculate that the thing is 

1591
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:30,711
going to.
If you want to say that there's 

1592
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:32,361
consciousness that is exteriorized,
then I would say that that brain would 

1593
01:18:32,361 --> 01:18:34,680
be an antenna for it in the same way 
that our brains are.

1594
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,080
That to me is like saying that if you 
recreate it,

1595
01:18:37,081 --> 01:18:38,220
a car would start itself.

1596
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:42,720
I don't think it's the same thing 
because cars never start themselves.

1597
01:18:42,721 --> 01:18:47,721
Human brains are innately awake.
They're innately Sarah.

1598
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,080
Create an artificial baby and let this 
baby live life and learn all the things 

1599
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,191
that a person learns to develop a 
personality or you can have somehow 

1600
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,340
another download.
Someone's already formulated 80 year old

1601
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:00,210
personality into this,
this,

1602
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:00,860
this creature.

1603
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,920
Well,
I think that you've got a lot of 

1604
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:05,920
choices.
I mean,

1605
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,450
it's literally the ideas.
If we take the neural pathways of the 

1606
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:11,660
human brain and replicate them inside a 
machine,

1607
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:16,050
the question that we're coming up 
against as does the thing is,

1608
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,280
will the thing think?
Will it be

1609
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,680
well,
not only that will will the thing be a 

1610
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,761
person?
Will it grow old or does it just exists 

1611
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:27,461
in the state that you created in?
Are you able to create not just a 

1612
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:29,060
person,
but the mechanisms inside of a person,

1613
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:34,061
the genetic coding that allows a person 
to continue to grow and get older and 

1614
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,830
move forward?
There's a lot.

1615
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,110
There's a lot of questions because is it
just a meat bag?

1616
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,300
You know what?
If that would be really creepy if we 

1617
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:44,300
created a person and then just nothing 
clicked.

1618
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,740
It's just a meat bag that just dumb as 
fuck.

1619
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,230
Meanwhile it's got the most advanced 
mind ever.

1620
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:53,231
We checked the switches,
everything's on no desire to move 

1621
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:53,231
forward,
you know,

1622
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:57,250
and then we developed a robot woman to 
suck his Dick and then all of a sudden 

1623
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,850
he's out there huffing.
He's got a Ferrari.

1624
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,200
He got a boat.
Hmm.

1625
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:07,700
It's an interesting idea.
Is an amazing fucking drug and in a 

1626
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:12,381
definitely no one can argue with the 
fact that it has been the carrot in 

1627
01:20:12,381 --> 01:20:15,100
front of a lot of people's ambition,

1628
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,890
washing a lot.
Why don't you say all the.

1629
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,430
The idea of to be loved is in front of 
almost anything

1630
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,000
I guess.
All.

1631
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:27,001
Yeah.
I mean I guess I'm just thinking like 

1632
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,001
maybe there's a.
I don't know.

1633
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,001
It is.
It is.

1634
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,480
It.
Is it peace.

1635
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,940
It is a piece.
It might not be your entire expression,

1636
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,340
but it's a piece of your motivation for 
doing anything.

1637
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,400
It's to be loved or the love of what 
you're doing.

1638
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:40,730
The love of what you're doing ultimately
is a better way of approaching it and 

1639
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:40,730
you know,
and you know,

1640
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,300
you get love from doing that.
Well,

1641
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,580
and it's a,
it's kind of a strange little,

1642
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,820
uh,
it's sort of a strange little exchange.

1643
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,390
Like if you concentrate too much on,
on getting love for what you're doing,

1644
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:56,391
then you're not going to do good stuff.
You have to concentrate on being loving 

1645
01:20:56,391 --> 01:20:58,500
what you're doing and then when you love
what you're doing and really focus on it

1646
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,450
and then you get love from it.
Yeah.

1647
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:01,730
It got me the trick.
Yeah.

1648
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:02,520
Occurs.
Sure.

1649
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,080
Don't you feel like that with comedy?

1650
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,880
Yes.
The moment you get outside of that,

1651
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:07,410
you are fucked man.
Well,

1652
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,480
this is that,
that's in the,

1653
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:13,481
in the Bhagavad Gita.
The versus you have a right to your 

1654
01:21:13,481 --> 01:21:13,481
actions and not the fruit of your 
actions,

1655
01:21:13,481 --> 01:21:17,841
which means you just focus on what 
you're doing and don't worry about 

1656
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:21,381
what's going to flourish on the tree.
And then everything works out much 

1657
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:21,381
better.

1658
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:21,850
Well,
that sounds like socialism to me,

1659
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:23,290
Duncan.
And that's what that sounds like.

1660
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,200
Fucking Bhagavad Gita.
Queer,

1661
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,270
old,
shitty fucking writing.

1662
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,160
What else does it tell you to do?

1663
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:31,960
Yeah,
I think that it's,

1664
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:36,961
um,
it's one of the sure ways to destroy 

1665
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:36,961
yourself is when you start worrying 
about,

1666
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:37,810
um,
or you can't.

1667
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:38,890
By the way.
It's unavoidable.

1668
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Well,
have you ever had a conversation with 

1669
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,040
your agent about how to improve your,
your,

1670
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,800
your response from the audience?
Got to give the people what they want.

1671
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,640
No,
thank God.

1672
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,480
You know,
you're going to think like why is pretty

1673
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:55,490
cool.
Jamie Masada would give the worst 

1674
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,640
fucking advice in the history of the 
world to comics and number one of them.

1675
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:57,270
I mean,
look,

1676
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:59,460
Jamie's a great guy.
He's got a great club,

1677
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,880
but nobody can tell you what can make 
you funny.

1678
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,060
You are,
you and Duncan trussell's fund is going 

1679
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:08,400
to be different than jody is funny going
to be different than Brian.

1680
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:09,150
Red Bands.
Funny.

1681
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:14,180
We all got a weird way of looking at 
things and you gotta figure out your 

1682
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:14,680
way,
but when you get a guy who's not a comic

1683
01:22:14,681 --> 01:22:16,740
that comes along with like the worst 
advice ever.

1684
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,510
Jamie Masada was this one dude.
He's like,

1685
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,150
buddy,
you are the generation x guy.

1686
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,700
That is your thing.
Everything you say will say,

1687
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:27,360
my generation,
I'm generation x and that's your ag.

1688
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,820
And the guy was like,
what the fuck are you talking about man?

1689
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:35,030
Fucking generation x guy.
If I ever told you about who's opening 

1690
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,030
the door here,

1691
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,270
if I ever told you about the advice that
my first manager gave me.

1692
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,430
No.
So he saw me.

1693
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:43,160
This was years and years and you've 
locked the store.

1694
01:22:43,161 --> 01:22:44,670
Just the case before creeps.
You're walking in.

1695
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:47,660
This place is not exactly secure.
It was.

1696
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,540
It was.
Brian got up years and years ago I.

1697
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,050
He saw me with wet hair and he's like,
that's what your thing could be.

1698
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,250
You could be.
The guy always gets on stage.

1699
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:58,580
What?

1700
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,540
Oh,
that's an awesome piece of advice.

1701
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,560
Did you think about for a second?

1702
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,950
Not even for a second.
Like what is that even?

1703
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,630
I guess.
I guess what I was thinking like,

1704
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:12,820
well I'd probably get electrocuted for 
one,

1705
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,830
but what's,
what is that?

1706
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:16,390
What's the joke?
Hey guys,

1707
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,260
I just got wet.

1708
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,120
Would you remember when you were doing 
open mic?

1709
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:24,121
Where there were guys who would have 
like a very specific sort of fucking 

1710
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:24,121
stick.
Yes.

1711
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:25,780
They were doing like they would have an 
outfit.

1712
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:27,790
Yes.
Yeah,

1713
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,770
yeah,
I've heard of.

1714
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:30,540
I heard it.
Didn't you hear the tone?

1715
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:32,840
You know the story of Jackie?
Jackie Banana.

1716
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,860
Oh,
crazy.

1717
01:23:34,861 --> 01:23:37,530
Bob.
You know the story of Jackie Banana.

1718
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,330
Jackie banana comic,
right.

1719
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,750
Buzz.
He didn't he have like a funny act,

1720
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:47,751
like a fake act.
I heard Mitzi just told him he had to 

1721
01:23:47,751 --> 01:23:48,600
wear a banana,
a banana colored suit with a banana peel

1722
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:53,601
hanging out.
Is he the guy that I'm thinking about 

1723
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:53,601
this.
There's a guy that had like this,

1724
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,050
uh,
like sort of a throwback act,

1725
01:23:55,290 --> 01:24:00,290
sort of a Vaudevillian sort of a,
of a gesture to Vaudeville.

1726
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,610
Is that the guy?
I don't know.

1727
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,640
It was really like Hacky,
but purposely hacky on purpose is that 

1728
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,970
the guy doesn't know.
There's a comic.

1729
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:09,950
Kind of like that,
Neil.

1730
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,150
I'm not talking about Neil Hamburger.
I'm talking about.

1731
01:24:12,151 --> 01:24:14,080
There was another guy who is from years 
ago.

1732
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:16,860
It was like a skinny,
handsome sort of a guy who had this.

1733
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:19,280
Is Jackie something or another?
I don't know,

1734
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,800
Jackie diamond,
is that,

1735
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:23,640
I'm sorry,
I can't remember the guy's name,

1736
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:25,710
but he had like this.
It was pretty funny act,

1737
01:24:25,711 --> 01:24:26,920
but it was a.
It was like,

1738
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,720
it was like you could have seen him in 
a,

1739
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,080
you know,
19 fifties mobster movie.

1740
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:33,720
He'd be the guy on stage one of the 
speakeasies or something.

1741
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:35,990
Yeah.
Or you know,

1742
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,350
most comedy way back in the day used to 
have to have some shtick.

1743
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:44,351
It didn't.
It wasn't like you could just like go 

1744
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:46,361
off and weird directions.
Comics were very sticky back in the 

1745
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:47,210
eighties.
There were a lot of sticky comics.

1746
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,400
We'll look at Larry the cable guy.
That's his thing.

1747
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:52,820
When you ever see the video of him doing
his reelect,

1748
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,890
know him,
his real self as Dan.

1749
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,360
It's really interesting.
No,

1750
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,720
it was a comic and then he just took me 
totally talks different when he took on 

1751
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:05,940
this thing and he's a very nice guy.
I've only hung out with him once,

1752
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,330
but he was a very nice guy who's back in
the 19 nineties.

1753
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:14,100
We did Montreal together and hung out at
the comedy works and he sent us some,

1754
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,710
uh,
is a potato chips.

1755
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,840
He has potato,
he listens to the podcast and he sent us

1756
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,920
some potato chips that taste like 
hamburgers.

1757
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,930
Wow.
It tastes like cheese mustard.

1758
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,310
The Burger.
It's a trip like you're,

1759
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,770
you're eating it and you're like,
this is so strange.

1760
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:34,380
It's like you're getting all these 
different flavors and then you're like,

1761
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:39,530
how quick does this cost cancer?
There's no this nothing even remotely 

1762
01:25:40,951 --> 01:25:42,480
natural about that Shit.

1763
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:47,640
Dude.
You know what I just saw on Reddit that 

1764
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:47,640
reminds me of is delicious.
God Damn.

1765
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,400
I just on Reddit,
fight off the cancer.

1766
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:52,210
It's worth it.
Take fucking cool ranch Doritos.

1767
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:57,211
Someone took coherence Doritos and put 
it into a salt grinder and the caption 

1768
01:25:57,581 --> 01:26:00,860
was enjoy the rest of your life.
Everything.

1769
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,640
Taste like.

1770
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,080
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

1771
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:07,860
It wasn't like a mortar and pestle.
Yeah.

1772
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,960
Do it like alchemy and infinite core 
ranch flavor on everything.

1773
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:16,990
Wow.
That would be delicious on chicken or 

1774
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:16,990
something like that.
You know,

1775
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:21,371
like if you fried chicken,
chicken breast with cool instead of 

1776
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:23,690
breadcrumbs,
you put cool ranch potato chips all over

1777
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:25,340
the outside of it would be good on 
anything.

1778
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,780
That's so yummy.
That sounds really good on a Turd.

1779
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,280
No,
it wouldn't.

1780
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,220
But man,
this thing about stick,

1781
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:41,460
this gets into metaphysics and this gets
into a place that I think about all the 

1782
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:45,481
time,
which is how much of what human beings 

1783
01:26:45,481 --> 01:26:48,480
day to day that people are doing is just
is a stick in the same way that comics 

1784
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,431
have this thing.
How many times do you run into someone 

1785
01:26:53,431 --> 01:26:53,710
who's got this thing going on,
which is their personality,

1786
01:26:53,711 --> 01:26:58,711
their ego,
this thing that they're clinging to her 

1787
01:26:58,711 --> 01:26:59,200
putting out front that he isn't even 
them at all.

1788
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:04,470
Well,
how many people do that in the guise of 

1789
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,470
a radio personality?
I mean,

1790
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:07,090
isn't that like the ultimate goof?
The radio personality?

1791
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:11,350
I was listening to Opie and Anthony 
today and they do a thing called October

1792
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:16,470
where they go after hacky radio people 
and they start talking like them and 

1793
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:17,980
mocking their act.
It's that.

1794
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:20,600
It's the Strip club Dj the same.
That's the,

1795
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,910
that's the thing,
they go into the,

1796
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:25,600
hey ladies,
$15.

1797
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:30,630
Kamikaze is coming up to the stage.
Girls drink for free guy ladies night 

1798
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:34,060
and then the president.
Yeah,

1799
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:39,090
very much so.
When you speak in front of great groups 

1800
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:42,490
of people,
you must take on a different inflection.

1801
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,220
We as a nation,
you can't just talk to them.

1802
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,850
This is what I think we need to do.
I think this country is crazy.

1803
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:51,660
We got to change some shit.
What are you saying?

1804
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:52,660
You're not presidential.

1805
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,590
Yeah,
you could say the same thing in a normal

1806
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:58,700
way and it would seem really fucking 
weird what my opponent thinks.

1807
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
You know what?
My not my opponent just thinks that the 

1808
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,420
taxes are too high and I disagree.

1809
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:09,360
It does not concern me.
What concerns me is the good will of the

1810
01:28:09,361 --> 01:28:14,361
American people.
What concerns me is the prosperity of 

1811
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:18,680
the American nation.
I just want people to be nicer to each 

1812
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,261
other and make more money.
What concerns me is seeing more made in 

1813
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:21,840
America.
Stickers on goods.

1814
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,150
Yeah.
That was that voice,

1815
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:27,400
that hypnotic fucking voice,
and then we allow it,

1816
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:30,790
but keep bringing that down.
Like there's personality types,

1817
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:35,791
you know,
this is where you get into like certain 

1818
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:37,411
personality types where you'll run into 
specific groups of people who all act 

1819
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:40,990
exactly the same.
Like goths.

1820
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,730
People were under certain band.
They all act.

1821
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:48,750
They all,
they all share the similar personality 

1822
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:48,750
and in colts it's a,
a,

1823
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:53,430
one of this.
One of the aspects of culture is that 

1824
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,150
everyone in the colt kind of acts the 
same way and the way they're acting like

1825
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:57,070
is like the leader,
you know.

1826
01:28:57,071 --> 01:29:02,071
So it gets really interesting when you 
start considering to yourself how much 

1827
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:06,621
of what I'm doing is a shtick or how 
much of what I'm doing is just imitated 

1828
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,460
from someone else,
whether it's.

1829
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:11,130
My parents were good.
Excellent sense.

1830
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:11,740
Exactly.

1831
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,780
We,
we inflect on words.

1832
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:18,990
You know,
I didn't even realize how heavy my 

1833
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:18,990
Boston accent was until I started seeing
myself on television.

1834
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,150
I saw myself on television when I was 19
after taekwondo tournament.

1835
01:29:22,151 --> 01:29:23,080
I heard my accent.
I was like,

1836
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:23,660
oh my God.

1837
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:28,730
Oh God,
I got to stop that and I've slowly like 

1838
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:28,730
removed it over the.
But you have to hear it.

1839
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,540
You have to hear it to realize you're 
even saying it.

1840
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,700
Yeah,
it's fucking crazy man.

1841
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:33,080
And,
and,

1842
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,220
and it's just amplitude tutor 
atmosphere.

1843
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:39,990
It's fun to like chase that thing back 
and to.

1844
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:45,020
This is where psychedelics are really 
useful is because you begin to start 

1845
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,440
contemplating will,
who is behind all this?

1846
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:48,000
Who's behind the accent?
Who's.

1847
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:50,250
Do you ever just think,
where do my words come from?

1848
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,030
I think

1849
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,430
all cool motherfuckers that other people
copied,

1850
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,370
you know,
that's where the accent is mean.

1851
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:01,410
There must've been one cool motherfucker
in Kentucky that just knew how to talk 

1852
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,180
in a way that it just saying bad ass.
This mother fucker didn't,

1853
01:30:04,181 --> 01:30:05,870
didn't give a fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

1854
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:08,520
He just sat there with a cigarette 
dangling and have average miles.

1855
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,720
I don't give a fuck.
And everybody in the neighborhood is 

1856
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:13,720
like,
man,

1857
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:13,820
I want to be like that dude.
Yeah,

1858
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:14,400
sure.
And they,

1859
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,080
they all just sort of took on that

1860
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:21,180
fluxion.
Well remember when a movie would come 

1861
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:21,180
out when you were an alum.
Actually,

1862
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:24,781
that's not true.
It's not like one guy is not a patient 

1863
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:24,781
zero when it comes to accents,
you know,

1864
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:28,710
it's some kind of collaborative 
collaboration between groups of cool 

1865
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:28,710
people.
Sure.

1866
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:33,320
But you know,
when a movie would come out and you 

1867
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,581
would be an elementary school and then 
some catchphrase from that movie would 

1868
01:30:35,581 --> 01:30:37,120
suddenly go rushing through elementary 
school again.

1869
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:38,500
I'm Rick James.
Bitch.

1870
01:30:38,501 --> 01:30:39,460
Yes,
yes,

1871
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:44,461
exactly.
Where it just kind of like a wildfire 

1872
01:30:44,461 --> 01:30:46,981
goes through idiots and they just 
imitate and imitate and imitate the 

1873
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:47,140
can't help it.
They can't help it.

1874
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:48,310
And,
and this,

1875
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,730
this is the big question.
This is like,

1876
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,050
but it's also fun.
Oh,

1877
01:30:53,051 --> 01:30:53,800
it's A.
Oh yeah,

1878
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:54,880
it's huge.
It's human.

1879
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,920
I mean,
God damn everyone's guilty of it,

1880
01:30:56,921 --> 01:30:57,790
man.
James,

1881
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,840
there's no way to avoid it.
I love saying that.

1882
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:02,220
No,
it's.

1883
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:04,420
It seems to be up.
There seems to be a prevalence of people

1884
01:31:04,421 --> 01:31:06,250
saying boo right now.
Boom.

1885
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,320
And also you started some shit,
man.

1886
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:10,220
You've started powerful,
powerful,

1887
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:12,040
beautiful.
I get powerful tweets.

1888
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,280
Don't complain about that.
You can't worry too much.

1889
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:17,330
I'm not complaining about it.
Enjoy shit like power.

1890
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,730
I'm not complaining,
but I think it's great,

1891
01:31:18,731 --> 01:31:23,731
but I'm saying it's interesting to see 
how certain behavior just micro bay 

1892
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:28,000
micro behaviors get imitated and echoed 
throughout society.

1893
01:31:28,001 --> 01:31:29,260
It's a very interesting.

1894
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:31,060
It is fascinating.
It is.

1895
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:31,700
It is.
It's,

1896
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,280
it's,
it's very interesting.

1897
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:35,950
It's very interesting that we sort of 
amalgamate.

1898
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:41,350
We've sort of taken from all all sorts 
of different sources around us that we 

1899
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,100
like all the different things that we 
like.

1900
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,930
It's always a problem with comics as 
well.

1901
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:48,970
You know,
we see a certain comics that are like 

1902
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:51,500
just doing Doug Stan hope you know.
How many guys have you seen that we're 

1903
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,240
opening for Doug?
Have you ever went to one at dog shows,

1904
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:57,390
but years ago especially,
he would have guys open forum and they 

1905
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:57,430
were essentially doing stanhope and also
Jesus Christ.

1906
01:31:57,431 --> 01:31:59,620
You got you got you before you,
you know,

1907
01:31:59,621 --> 01:32:00,490
this is ridiculous.

1908
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,600
It's super common.
There was a million have tells for 

1909
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:06,940
awhile.
We're just huge fans of a towel and they

1910
01:32:06,941 --> 01:32:09,250
couldn't even help it.
They started talking

1911
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,230
day.
They just found themselves doing it,

1912
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:15,090
you know,
you don't even realize it.

1913
01:32:15,091 --> 01:32:19,710
It's fucking incredible man,
and it's like you get thumped printed by

1914
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:23,910
a reality in that way and it's goes way 
back.

1915
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,030
I mean that's the,
that's.

1916
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:30,190
I just had my mom is a shrink on the 
podcast and like she was talking about 

1917
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:32,700
the effect that she thinks.
What happens when you were a kid,

1918
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,280
like getting your Dick snipped off,
like you were saying,

1919
01:32:35,281 --> 01:32:39,090
has on the rest of your life.
It has a huge effect.

1920
01:32:39,091 --> 01:32:43,920
You get some printed by your parents,
by the subjective Dna of your parents,

1921
01:32:43,921 --> 01:32:48,870
get them printed into you and then you 
spend the rest of your life in this kind

1922
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:53,130
of strange hypnotic trance not knowing 
why you're doing what you're doing.

1923
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:56,290
And that I think is the beginning of,
you know,

1924
01:32:56,310 --> 01:33:01,310
when you're talking about dumb dumb 
people or people live or absorbed into 

1925
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:04,581
some religious structure.
I think the beginning of human ness 

1926
01:33:04,581 --> 01:33:06,480
starts when you start thinking about,
wait,

1927
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:10,230
what am I really?
What's behind this fucking mask?

1928
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:15,231
What's behind the behavior mechanisms 
that I picked up from my folks are from 

1929
01:33:15,231 --> 01:33:18,660
movies or from influential friends or 
from whatever.

1930
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,840
What's the being residing behind all 
that shit and that I think is when you 

1931
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,880
stop being a machine or start waking up 
a little bit,

1932
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:32,120
but until then you might as well be a 
fucking brain and it God damn commodore 

1933
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,120
64.

1934
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:37,300
Yeah.
Or You just enjoy this fucking weird 

1935
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,511
existence and marvel at all the mystery 
of it all and just sort of try to take 

1936
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:43,070
it in and just enjoy it.
Because if you,

1937
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,060
if you try to like get down to your core
all day,

1938
01:33:47,061 --> 01:33:50,200
every day you're going to,
you're going to miss what's,

1939
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:55,280
what's enjoyable about the experience.
I don't necessarily know if we're ever 

1940
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,220
going to figure out what's motivating 
us,

1941
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:00,120
pushing us in one way or another.
What?

1942
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:02,030
Why do you,
why do you talk the way you talk?

1943
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,200
You know,
who are you?

1944
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:08,290
But I,
but I do love the fact that there's so 

1945
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:09,410
many variables.
I do love a guy like Joey Diaz.

1946
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:11,690
I do love how Ra is so much different 
than Joey.

1947
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:13,430
Brian.
So much different than me.

1948
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:16,160
We're all just weird,
you know,

1949
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:21,220
personalities that have come about 
through a whole bunch of different 

1950
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:24,971
scenarios,
a bunch of different ways to live a 

1951
01:34:24,971 --> 01:34:24,971
life,
you know,

1952
01:34:24,971 --> 01:34:28,990
and different locations and different 
problems and challenges and different 

1953
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,860
genetics.
It's a fucking trip,

1954
01:34:30,861 --> 01:34:35,861
man.
The human experience to get to from 

1955
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:37,790
point a to Duncan trussell at 37 years 
old is a wild,

1956
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:42,791
crazy fuck load and everyone's road is,
is unique and different and and creates 

1957
01:34:44,121 --> 01:34:44,870
a different result.

1958
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:48,490
Have you heard the term dependent 
origination?

1959
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:54,210
No.
It's a Buddhist term and the term is 

1960
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:56,860
that there is nothing independent.
There's nothing independent of it.

1961
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,880
There's no,
no thing that isn't related to some 

1962
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,840
other thing in the universe which 
creates this kind of tapestry.

1963
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:05,150
So makes sense.
So the example that you know,

1964
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:09,620
of course beer,
this beer bottle is not by itself,

1965
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:14,621
it comes from sand.
It's just what you're seeing here is in 

1966
01:35:14,621 --> 01:35:19,070
the flow of time that a temporary form 
that a bunch of sand and paper,

1967
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:22,700
which comes from trees his congealed 
into to form this thing,

1968
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:27,850
but 700 years from now,
this fucking thing is going to be sand 

1969
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:31,541
again.
You said what you're watching right now 

1970
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,521
is just a moment of this thing's true 
existence and in in in the same way you 

1971
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:36,740
and Joey Diaz and Brian and me and 
everyone listening to this,

1972
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:42,070
or just one mode,
one moment of beingness in this web that

1973
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:47,200
for us traces all the way back 
apparently to nuclear fusion inside of 

1974
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,731
stars,
which has gone through infinite time 

1975
01:35:51,731 --> 01:35:53,300
until it's finally manifested in the 
form of whatever the parts.

1976
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:55,280
Yeah,
exactly.

1977
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:58,940
Which for a moment in time,
for a moment in time,

1978
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:02,540
that little bit of the tab tonight at 
10:30

1979
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,370
sold out.
Bitch.

1980
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:05,870
That's cool.
Yeah.

1981
01:36:05,871 --> 01:36:10,871
It's.
It's a an amazing connection that we 

1982
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:14,261
have to everything that's ever existed 
and we are part of some weird infinite 

1983
01:36:14,261 --> 01:36:14,840
cycle as as the planet,
as,

1984
01:36:14,841 --> 01:36:18,050
as the star that heats the planet.
All of these will end.

1985
01:36:18,051 --> 01:36:19,550
The universe won't,
it's this is,

1986
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:21,980
but a blip,
even the life of a star is,

1987
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:25,850
but a blip in the in the life of the 
universe and they blow up all the time.

1988
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:30,200
They said that there was a beautiful 
show on a hyper novas there were talking

1989
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:33,860
about when they first started detecting 
gamma ray bursts in the galaxy.

1990
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:38,861
They didn't know what was going on.
They thought it was possible that we 

1991
01:36:38,861 --> 01:36:41,660
were under attack by an alien race 
because there was a huge burst of energy

1992
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:43,750
that were were happening all over the 
space,

1993
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:44,270
all,
all,

1994
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:46,700
all throughout the universe,
so they thought it was possible.

1995
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:49,520
They were were actually alien wars at 
one point in time.

1996
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,760
That was something that was being 
considered until they understand the 

1997
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:54,760
mechanism or understood rather than 
mechanism.

1998
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,080
Behind Novus,
they're happening all the time.

1999
01:36:57,081 --> 01:36:59,660
They just.
They're just blowing out.

2000
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:02,990
There's Mooney and stars.
We can't even.

2001
01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:04,850
Yeah.
You gotta go.

2002
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:08,540
If in your lifetime to the Keck 
observatory in Hawaii,

2003
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:10,940
if you've never been there,
it's one of the,

2004
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:13,880
one of the highest observatories and 
it's above the clouds.

2005
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,660
It's really wild because you're driving,
you drive.

2006
01:37:16,661 --> 01:37:19,940
It's on the big island and you drive is 
a long ass drive.

2007
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:24,941
It's like a two hour drive up the 
mountain and as you're driving you hit 

2008
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:24,941
clouds and you're like,
fuck man,

2009
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:28,070
we're not going to be able to see shit.
We took this big drive up here,

2010
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:30,170
but we're not going to able to see shit 
because was all these clouds.

2011
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:34,010
Then you drive past the clouds and you 
get up there and you go,

2012
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,940
oh my God.
Because first of all,

2013
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:42,941
you're at 13,000
feet and second of all there's no light 

2014
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:47,741
pollution on the island.
They have these diffusers on all these 

2015
01:37:47,741 --> 01:37:50,771
lamps,
so when you look at you don't even have 

2016
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:50,771
to look through a telescope.
Dude,

2017
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:51,590
you just look up when you're at the 
observatory and you're like,

2018
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,530
oh my God.
The milky ways and staying.

2019
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,320
Yeah,
and it makes you so angry that you can't

2020
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,720
see that every day.
Yeah.

2021
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:05,210
Like if we didn't have these greedy ass 
fucking cities with lights everywhere 

2022
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:09,231
and driving around with headlights,
it would like if we could have just for 

2023
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:13,521
one hour or couple hours of one day,
well maybe just one night a year where 

2024
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:19,701
everyone shots all the power off for 
three hours and we all from six to 9:00

2025
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:25,730
PM central.
Remember tonight is star appreciation 

2026
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:30,111
night.
We all shut out all the powers in 

2027
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:30,111
cities.

2028
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:30,111
Yeah,
they,

2029
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:31,090
they've tried that a few times where 
I'll look it up.

2030
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,240
Oh yeah.
Good.

2031
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,200
Good idea.

2032
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:35,810
See I'm behind the times somebody 
thought it up,

2033
01:38:35,811 --> 01:38:37,630
but if we did that and you,
you,

2034
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:42,110
you could see that we would have so many
people that would be so much more in awe

2035
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:45,650
of space and so much more interested in 
the.

2036
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,680
And especially children interested in 
the idea of pursuing astronomy or are 

2037
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,790
pursuing rocketry or working for NASA or
something.

2038
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:53,810
I mean,
just the,

2039
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:56,030
our appreciation for,
you know,

2040
01:38:56,031 --> 01:39:01,031
funding things like NASA and the Hubble 
telescope and new telescopes and you 

2041
01:39:01,031 --> 01:39:03,110
know,
the Keck observatory and all these,

2042
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:08,200
you know,
all that stuff would be so much more 

2043
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,920
appreciated if we could see the majesty 
of the stars.

2044
01:39:09,921 --> 01:39:13,010
We've robbed ourselves from that,
of that with cities,

2045
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:13,720
the,
the,

2046
01:39:13,721 --> 01:39:18,721
the light.
We don't even realize it because we've 

2047
01:39:18,721 --> 01:39:20,561
grown up with these things,
but all that light all the time has 

2048
01:39:20,561 --> 01:39:22,730
robbed us of really the most amazing 
thing you could ever see.

2049
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:25,400
And one of the most humbling things I've
ever seen in my life.

2050
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:30,610
I've had psychedelic experiences that 
didn't affect me as much as looking at 

2051
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:32,480
those stars because I,
I remember that night I couldn't sleep.

2052
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:37,540
I remember I got back to the hotel room.
I was just lying in bed staring up at 

2053
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:40,661
the ceiling,
thinking how insane that thing was and 

2054
01:39:40,661 --> 01:39:40,970
that that's up there all the time that I
can't see it.

2055
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:46,470
And it really hit home.
The feeling that was when I really 

2056
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:50,420
started pushing the idea of the planet 
as an organic spaceship.

2057
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:52,190
That's when I really started talking 
about it.

2058
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:53,810
That's when I came up with that whole 
bit about,

2059
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:55,770
you know,
explaining the,

2060
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,790
you know,
the war on Iraq,

2061
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,280
hurling through the universal,
how insane it is to pay attention to the

2062
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:01,430
Grand Canyon.
You know,

2063
01:40:01,431 --> 01:40:06,431
that that bit it was like,
there's people out there look deep at 

2064
01:40:06,431 --> 01:40:06,431
Grand Canyon.
Meanwhile,

2065
01:40:06,431 --> 01:40:07,400
above you is infinity.

2066
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:13,230
Did you see the Graham Hancock video 
that he posted on his information 

2067
01:40:13,301 --> 01:40:18,301
website of the sound of the Earth space?
Did I got the dolphins do.

2068
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:22,470
It's the radio waves radio waves that 
the,

2069
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:23,890
uh,
the radiation belts.

2070
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

2071
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:26,550
But it sounds a lot.
Sounds like,

2072
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:30,300
sounds like dolphins.
It sounds like chirping Wales Brion.

2073
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:31,710
Pull that up because it's fucking 
trippy.

2074
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:34,220
Are you drinking a rockstar?
You fucking Rockstar?

2075
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:35,040
Yeah.
By the way,

2076
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:37,680
it was,
it's called a earth hour.

2077
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:41,920
It's actually one hour a year that 
everyone's supposed to do.

2078
01:40:41,921 --> 01:40:44,670
I just turn off all their power except 
for the refrigerator for an hour.

2079
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:45,600
Really?
Yeah.

2080
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,700
That's.
La doesn't do that shit.

2081
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:53,210
Fuck you gotta do coke.
What was the shit you want me to look 

2082
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:54,010
at?
Seven Hancock site.

2083
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,750
He's got this newsletter.
I don't know the exact,

2084
01:40:55,830 --> 01:41:00,830
it's just I'm just look up scientists 
find the sound of the earth.

2085
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,500
Yeah.
It'll pop up right away.

2086
01:41:03,501 --> 01:41:07,090
It sounds like Chirping Josh or Wales.
Yeah.

2087
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:12,620
Yeah,
and it's a apparently the sound of the 

2088
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:16,641
radio show,
the radiation belts and make a sound 

2089
01:41:16,641 --> 01:41:16,641
that's like it wavers.

2090
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:17,710
Yeah.

2091
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,380
Yeah.
We're weird,

2092
01:41:22,381 --> 01:41:27,381
man.
I think it's just a matter of time 

2093
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:33,310
before we.
We get contacted by something that's 

2094
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:36,821
more intelligent than us.
I've been thinking that more and more 

2095
01:41:36,821 --> 01:41:39,521
lately.
I think if there is something out there 

2096
01:41:39,521 --> 01:41:40,730
that's more intelligent than than than 
human beings,

2097
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:44,710
it's going to have to contact us really 
soon because we're like real

2098
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,900
close.
Well,

2099
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:46,920
this is the thing,
man.

2100
01:41:46,921 --> 01:41:51,921
This is.
I can't remember if fucking said that's 

2101
01:41:51,921 --> 01:41:54,201
one of the singularity people said 
humankind's first contact with an 

2102
01:41:54,201 --> 01:41:58,971
extraterrestrial or with rather an alien
intelligence is going to be a machine 

2103
01:41:58,971 --> 01:42:03,471
that's woken up and that's going to be 
our first experience with it is 

2104
01:42:03,471 --> 01:42:03,471
something we made

2105
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,790
instead of instead of a thing from 
space.

2106
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,350
Well,
it's possible.

2107
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:10,250
It's possible.

2108
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:12,650
It is possible that we're at the height.
I mean,

2109
01:42:12,651 --> 01:42:17,030
there was one,
a recent Harvard astronomer that decided

2110
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:22,031
after looking at 500 different stars 
that we may be the only thing out there 

2111
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:26,780
and that there's so little a life or 
evidence of life in these.

2112
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:29,990
These planets is 500 different planets 
rather than they've observed,

2113
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:35,270
but I think that's ridiculous.
The most ridiculous because he is coming

2114
01:42:35,271 --> 01:42:38,800
from a planet that has life.
That's one of those 500.

2115
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,690
So it's not that there's nothing in 500.
No.

2116
01:42:41,691 --> 01:42:46,691
You found one dummy and you're on it.
There's one and you found $500 that 

2117
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:47,750
don't.
But you find one that does.

2118
01:42:47,751 --> 01:42:50,900
Okay.
You have to add that in stupid.

2119
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:56,080
You don't just go looking for another 
one and if the other one you can't find 

2120
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,080
it.
Well they don't exist.

2121
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,700
Meanwhile you are one that doesn't make 
any sense.

2122
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,760
And also man,
that creek bed and Mars,

2123
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:05,790
that shit gives me goosebumps when I see
pictures of the fucking gravel and Mars 

2124
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:10,171
from water flowing on Mars.
I just think about what that must have 

2125
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:15,331
looked like on that planet with Martian 
water rolling through whatever it was 

2126
01:43:15,331 --> 01:43:18,160
rolling through.
I think there was probably life on Mars.

2127
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:18,950
Yeah.
Brian,

2128
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:23,750
pull up how earth sounds from space on 
youtube and uh,

2129
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,910
and it's,
it will freak you.

2130
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,100
It's fucking loud ass people interfering
with our podcast yelling in the street.

2131
01:43:31,101 --> 01:43:36,101
But we got.
We got no sound proofing here at the 

2132
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:37,960
icehouse.
How earth our earth sounds from space.

2133
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:41,080
It's on youtube.
It's so it shows up the earth itself.

2134
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:42,760
You see like cloud formations and shit.

2135
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,040
No,
that's not the one.

2136
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:54,590
That's not the most recent one.
Let me see.

2137
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,970
Let me look up Graham Hancock.com.
How was that movie you saw last night?

2138
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:00,170
Joe?
Fucking awesome.

2139
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:03,470
What is this?
A looper oh good.

2140
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,550
I'm glad.
That's good.

2141
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:05,750
Oh my God.
Is it good?

2142
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,780
It's not just good.
It's like one of the best movies I think

2143
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:13,070
I've ever seen.
It was a really good fucking moving.

2144
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,380
I can't find the sound man.
I don't know where it is.

2145
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:17,090
Anyway,
go find it folks.

2146
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:22,210
It's on my twitter.
Why don't I just look on my own fucking 

2147
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:22,210
twitter.
Stupid ass.

2148
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:24,310
I'm so dumb.
I'm

2149
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,100
the,
uh,

2150
01:44:26,101 --> 01:44:28,020
the looper movies.
Really fucking good.

2151
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:29,370
It's really good.
Writing,

2152
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,590
you know,
I didn't know anything about it.

2153
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:36,620
Which one of those mind benders where 
your brain feels like it's getting 

2154
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:37,500
stretched out because it's so.
No,

2155
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,520
you know,
it wasn't.

2156
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,290
That was the thing they managed to,

2157
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,320
to avoid.
They managed to avoid all sorts of.

2158
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:47,120
You go to my um,
my twitter.

2159
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:47,990
Brian,
I found it.

2160
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:50,510
If you pull up a,
there's a

2161
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:53,460
tweet I retweeted a gentleman named 
Aaron Rodriguez.

2162
01:44:53,461 --> 01:44:55,740
Aaron Rodriguez.
Congratulations.

2163
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:57,690
You were the guy who gets mentioned on a
podcast,

2164
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:02,750
Aaron Rodriguez and it says apparently 
the van Allen Radiation Belt sings like 

2165
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,740
a whale.
Nothing to fear guys.

2166
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,370
And it's a 22 hours.
Okay.

2167
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:10,370
I retweeted it.
So find that Sun Sun.

2168
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,200
Um,
what was I saying

2169
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:18,210
you were talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about 

2170
01:45:18,210 --> 01:45:20,401
before that man fucking lost me.
There it is.

2171
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:24,310
Yeah.
That's a planet.

2172
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:31,660
That's so creepy.
Sounds like it's calling a dog.

2173
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:36,900
You know what it's calling other planets
saying this place is filled with a bunch

2174
01:45:37,571 --> 01:45:42,571
of crickets and cons with nuclear bombs.
Don't fuck with it.

2175
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,200
Is the end of it.
I don't think that fucking thing.

2176
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:53,410
That thing does not sound that.
That does not sound like a defenseless 

2177
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:53,410
thing.
To me.

2178
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:56,390
That sounds like a thing that could just
jump out of the woods and bite your head

2179
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:56,870
off.
Well,

2180
01:45:56,871 --> 01:45:58,580
that's not a real sound.
You know,

2181
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:03,581
it's radio waves,
so we've sort of interpreted them as a 

2182
01:46:03,581 --> 01:46:06,461
sound as I understand it.
I don't think it's actually that you 

2183
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:06,461
stuck your head out of the space 
shuttle.

2184
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:07,440
You wouldn't hear that.
Yeah.

2185
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:10,770
To get wiped off.
Yeah.

2186
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,670
You probably would hear that accent.
Yeah.

2187
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:16,250
You wouldn't hear shit.
Your head would freeze instantly.

2188
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:20,300
Isn't that crazy that you would just 
freeze instantly in space?

2189
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:21,680
Yeah.
You just couldn't live.

2190
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:23,560
Yeah.

2191
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,580
Is there someone at the door?
Who is it?

2192
01:46:27,330 --> 01:46:27,770
Who is.

2193
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,450
Who's motherfuckers keep interrupting.
I think what I think is our show,

2194
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,460
a comedy show starts in 30 minutes,
so it's probably comics,

2195
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:38,490
but comics or would just come back here 
and not say anything.

2196
01:46:38,491 --> 01:46:43,491
Hold on.
Woo Dunkin.

2197
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,340
Yes.
Brian,

2198
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:47,470
how are you doing?
Where are you?

2199
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,350
Where are you at next?
Where are you going out town?

2200
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,510
I'm going to Vancouver this weekend.
Oh,

2201
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:54,540
lucky people are playing at that hotel 
comedy club.

2202
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,040
What's it called again?
The comedy Max.

2203
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:56,750
Oh,
that's awesome.

2204
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:02,990
I knew it was because joe is a type of 
guy that just tries doors.

2205
01:47:02,991 --> 01:47:07,991
He doesn't knock doors unlocked house.
They stealthy keep it on the download 

2206
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:08,790
cock sucker.

2207
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:15,260
So this.
It's an audio rendering of radio waves.

2208
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:19,040
That's what it is.
Captured by probes.

2209
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,020
Still fucking weird.

2210
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Lock that door to keep out the stockers 
or something going on,

2211
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:29,760
buddy.
Know Me.

2212
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,510
Dog hit on me.
Keeping a beautiful.

2213
01:47:32,511 --> 01:47:34,650
Did you lock it up man?

2214
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:41,150
We're here for another soul down show 
tonight at the Ice House in Pasadena.

2215
01:47:41,151 --> 01:47:46,151
Ladies and Gentlemen,
will we sling comedy Dick on a regular 

2216
01:47:46,151 --> 01:47:49,271
basis and you know,
we got a lot of people come back so we 

2217
01:47:49,271 --> 01:47:51,440
could try to come up with as much new 
shit as possible.

2218
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:54,350
And uh,
I'm going to be doing a lot on the earth

2219
01:47:54,351 --> 01:47:55,810
thing and like a whale.
That's my new barrier.

2220
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,590
No,
I don't think there's any material doing

2221
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,250
a whole chunk on snm tonight.
Are you really?

2222
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:05,420
I can't wait to hear it better.
Not use any of my stories.

2223
01:48:05,421 --> 01:48:07,340
You fuck what?
As an m story do you?

2224
01:48:07,341 --> 01:48:09,170
I know I got all those fucking things.

2225
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,940
You have no ball gag stories and that's 
a shame.

2226
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:19,490
No,
I operate on a different level of you.

2227
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:22,160
I don't know if I don't have the right 
level.

2228
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:25,700
I'm not saying it is,
but it just saying it's different labs,

2229
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:28,780
different level.
You're into your insistence.

2230
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,610
Shit.
Let's say on occasion.

2231
01:48:31,611 --> 01:48:33,730
I'm not just some shit that makes me 
uncomfortable as a man.

2232
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:38,770
Afraid to experiment by what he's.
He's judging me because I'm tying to all

2233
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:44,000
gag into a lady and you diaper never did
that.

2234
01:48:44,001 --> 01:48:47,000
You made that up.
No judge you Duncan.

2235
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:48,780
I would never judge you.
You.

2236
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:53,781
I love you exactly the way you are.
I don't want you to change even 

2237
01:48:53,781 --> 01:48:54,700
slightly,
but the ball gag thing bothers me.

2238
01:48:55,110 --> 01:49:00,110
Bothers me.
It's totally normal.

2239
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,620
Like the first time I'm like,
well,

2240
01:49:03,621 --> 01:49:05,610
I'm still intrigued by this ball.
Gag Business.

2241
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:08,240
Let me try it again.
Joey,

2242
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:08,970
sit in with us,
man.

2243
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:09,380
What are you doing?

2244
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:13,310
You what?
Okay.

2245
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:14,020
Okay.
See,

2246
01:49:14,021 --> 01:49:16,060
I'm gonna Joey Diaz.
Ladies,

2247
01:49:16,061 --> 01:49:18,040
gentlemen in and out.
He's here.

2248
01:49:18,041 --> 01:49:19,210
He's gone.
He's here for

2249
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,170
a sold out show,
the Basil Dino,

2250
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:27,630
welcome to my radio voice duty to do so.
Opie Anthony attack these guys on what 

2251
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:31,560
they called Shocktober.
They do it every year apparently.

2252
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:34,720
Fucking so funny because it was opie and
Anthony.

2253
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,970
It was um,
who else was on Tom?

2254
01:49:36,971 --> 01:49:41,270
Papa was in there.
I'm just saying.

2255
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:42,940
I don't know.
It was just,

2256
01:49:42,941 --> 01:49:47,941
you know,
the show is always like a bunch of 

2257
01:49:47,941 --> 01:49:48,160
people like all in together

2258
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:52,570
and it was really fucking funny.
And then within a half an hour,

2259
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,330
an hour of them doing it,
the radio station took to their facebook

2260
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,360
page because the ONA savages had started
attacking the facebook page and shitting

2261
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:03,900
all over it,
bananas and sell them.

2262
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:08,910
They're all drowned in a.
it's just so funny.

2263
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,320
Oh,
I mean,

2264
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,500
I just,
I just fucking love that.

2265
01:50:14,501 --> 01:50:16,690
They're so sensitive.
They took it on their facebook page.

2266
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,160
Look,
this is what happened.

2267
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,420
You got,
you got goofed on.

2268
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:24,570
You should have been moved on a long 
time ago and then you would have never 

2269
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:24,640
done that radio voice.

2270
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:29,820
I think they train in that voice.
I think that that there's schools where 

2271
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:33,601
people trained to talk like that and you
just choose like strip club or or radio 

2272
01:50:33,601 --> 01:50:35,000
voice or whether person

2273
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:39,210
it was saying anthony was saying that 
they made them.

2274
01:50:39,211 --> 01:50:40,590
It was anthony or opening.
I forget.

2275
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:44,850
I think they're all talking about how 
the guy actually said,

2276
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:47,820
I want you to visualize who your 
audience is.

2277
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,690
Just,
you know,

2278
01:50:48,691 --> 01:50:51,870
take a picture out of a magazine that 
represents that guy.

2279
01:50:51,871 --> 01:50:56,871
You know,
you're a blue collar guy and just put 

2280
01:50:56,871 --> 01:50:57,210
that up there on the wall and you know,
that's the guy you're talking to.

2281
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,760
That's your guy.
You know what Anthony was saying that he

2282
01:50:59,761 --> 01:51:03,810
put up John Casey.
It was fucking funny,

2283
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:10,860
but it's like that.
That happens whenever you get a producer

2284
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:15,861
involved in,
in someone who's in a non creative 

2285
01:51:15,861 --> 01:51:18,550
person involved in trying to shape your 
radio personality.

2286
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:23,970
Look,
gonna do man is just tighten up your 

2287
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,301
image.
You need a thumb ring and you thought 

2288
01:51:26,301 --> 01:51:27,630
about a new nose rings.
Yeah man.

2289
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:30,870
Thumb rings to Anthony Bourdain is the 
only guy that I've ever met that used to

2290
01:51:30,871 --> 01:51:32,370
wear a thumb ring.
This douche bag.

2291
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:38,370
Cool guy and he has a thumb ring and I'd
watch them on the show and I'm like,

2292
01:51:38,371 --> 01:51:39,720
man,
I just kind of talked to them about that

2293
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:42,930
ring.
We're going to be fine or toe rings.

2294
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,920
Get the fuck Outta here.
And the tattoo around the belly button.

2295
01:51:49,921 --> 01:51:51,450
That's another one.
Just get bored.

2296
01:51:51,451 --> 01:51:56,451
I can see tattoo on your belly button.
That's just a board issue but not a toe 

2297
01:51:56,451 --> 01:51:56,880
ring.
Did you see that shit on Reddit?

2298
01:51:56,940 --> 01:52:01,290
The guy who had it rem job tattooed on 
his face like right on his mouth,

2299
01:52:01,291 --> 01:52:03,240
on his mustache.
Really,

2300
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:08,420
it's the saddest thing.
It looks like he's been crying like him 

2301
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:09,600
and some other guy.
They're both obviously fucked up and one

2302
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:11,640
of them as some shit tattoo on his 
forehead,

2303
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,050
but the other guys,
right

2304
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:19,310
rim job.
I think there's a lot of people that 

2305
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:19,480
just incredibly self destructive.
What is that?

2306
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:24,540
Is that.
Is that like us losing our natural 

2307
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:28,651
reward system with hunter and gathering 
and being stuck into some weird fucking 

2308
01:52:28,651 --> 01:52:32,371
environment.
We're taking pills and trying to 

2309
01:52:32,371 --> 01:52:35,250
overcome reality with pharmaceutical 
drugs and sedate our sell through shit 

2310
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:39,331
jobs and boring,
meaningless existences as a cog in the 

2311
01:52:39,331 --> 01:52:41,410
wheel and then you just go crazy 
substance abuse,

2312
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:42,410
see your face.
They.

2313
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:47,420
It's like the human version of pigs in 
slaughterhouses that start chewing off 

2314
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:50,090
their own legs because they're too close
to each other.

2315
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:55,330
You just end up going into some,
but also a lot of times when people do 

2316
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:55,460
that shit outside of the guy who did rim
job,

2317
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:58,280
a lot of times when people fuck up their
body,

2318
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:02,240
they're doing it because they want 
specific types of girls to like them.

2319
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:07,450
I think.
I think that they're writing rim job 

2320
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:07,450
when you're not that I said except for 
that guy,

2321
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:11,480
but like the people who like just 
fucking like putting the hang themselves

2322
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:13,820
from their nipples are like people who 
do the earrings,

2323
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:18,940
the big ear holes.
If you stand there looking for certain 

2324
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:18,940
types of girls.
I think that's what it is.

2325
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:22,720
I think it's amazing pattern.
Some of it for sure it hits the ear 

2326
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:22,720
thing is.

2327
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,740
I would have never saw that coming me 
either.

2328
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,570
I met a lot of cool people that have it 
too and I don't want to judge them.

2329
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:30,530
I don't want to judge them,
but that's a fucking a trippy thing.

2330
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:32,600
You gotTa fucking toilet paper roll in 
your ear,

2331
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:37,601
son.
Did you see that prank or maybe it was 

2332
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:37,601
just.
It was an idea for a prank.

2333
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:41,801
It's awful,
but it's like you sneak up on one of 

2334
01:53:41,801 --> 01:53:44,801
those guys with a lock and put it in the
ear hole and lock it so they've got a 

2335
01:53:45,171 --> 01:53:50,171
lock like locked into their ear.
I think I saw a video of it or someone 

2336
01:53:50,171 --> 01:53:51,650
suggesting someone do that.
Brutal.

2337
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:54,020
That's horrific because then you'd have 
to get it clipped.

2338
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,630
That's terrific.
It's a dangerous thing,

2339
01:53:56,631 --> 01:53:58,940
man.
It's not a strategic thing to have giant

2340
01:53:58,941 --> 01:54:01,310
holes in your ears.
It's dangerous.

2341
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:01,540
Yeah.

2342
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:06,550
What if.
What if you ripped it off and then beat 

2343
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,550
the guy to death with it?
Yeah.

2344
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:07,090
You do that too.
Well,

2345
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:08,180
you would deserve it.
Probably.

2346
01:54:08,181 --> 01:54:09,660
It's a shitty move.
Yeah.

2347
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,680
Locking someone,
putting a lock in someone's fucking 

2348
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:14,680
hear.
You better know that combination.

2349
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:14,680
Bitch.
That's a rude prank.

2350
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:16,950
It's not,
I guess pranks,

2351
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,490
the wrong word.
It's an assault and attack,

2352
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,080
but yeah,
all that shit.

2353
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:23,340
Body modification,
that thing where uh,

2354
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:28,870
people in Korea,
is it Korea that they're putting up 

2355
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,870
donuts in their heads,
head bagels.

2356
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:34,450
What's going on?
It's like we're sick of our bodies or 

2357
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:34,450
something,
man.

2358
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:38,480
We're taking these strange paths to make
our bodies look different.

2359
01:54:38,481 --> 01:54:43,481
It's really fucking weird.
And The lady just grew an ear off or 

2360
01:54:43,481 --> 01:54:43,481
arm,
but that wasn't cosmetic.

2361
01:54:43,481 --> 01:54:44,630
That's because she had to.
She had cancer.

2362
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:46,700
Yeah.
That's not related,

2363
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,500
but yeah,
there is a lot of weird shit that people

2364
01:54:48,501 --> 01:54:49,430
do.
But I say that,

2365
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:51,210
but then I have two sleeves of tattoos.
You know,

2366
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:54,330
two arms are covered in drawing.
Yeah,

2367
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:57,110
right.
But still again talk.

2368
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,640
No,
I think two sleeves of tattoos is a fuck

2369
01:54:59,641 --> 01:55:01,490
load cooler than having your head and 
flavor.

2370
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:02,510
Yeah,
it's cooler,

2371
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,850
but it's still weird to,
you know,

2372
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:07,580
the average person doesn't want to sit 
there and have someone drawn them with a

2373
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:10,670
fucking scratching needle shows inc 
under their skin.

2374
01:55:10,671 --> 01:55:12,950
Just to make it look cool.
I want a fucking tattoo.

2375
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:16,400
What'd you get?
I don't know.

2376
01:55:16,401 --> 01:55:17,370
That's the problem,
man.

2377
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:22,660
It's torture me for my whole life.
I'm always thinking about what it would 

2378
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:23,440
be and I don't know.
I'm hoping that when I,

2379
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:26,030
when I go out to Brazil and slurp back 
some Iowasca,

2380
01:55:26,031 --> 01:55:28,210
it'll come to me.
I think it was just a little nervous,

2381
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:33,230
a little sweet face on your arm.
Little Hobo with a giant Dick like evil 

2382
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:37,310
boy that has tattooed on from a dmt 
word.

2383
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:40,220
Huge Dick.
But little hobos face.

2384
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:42,320
No,
no,

2385
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,170
I don't like that Tattoo.
I was going to any

2386
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,220
big veiny giants like that Tattoo.
How about a black dude?

2387
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:52,700
Nope.
Dick to represent the American Indian 

2388
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,040
being speaking my language now.
It means big,

2389
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:58,260
hard red deck like the hawk.
If he was red,

2390
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,440
now you feel me on this?
Nothing.

2391
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:05,070
Damn.
It goes on a good path.

2392
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,770
What would you.
What about some of the from the Bhagavad

2393
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:09,060
Gita as or like a,

2394
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:14,330
but again,
like that should all seem so fucking 

2395
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:14,850
like contrived,
you know,

2396
01:56:14,851 --> 01:56:16,440
it seems because like,
I don't,

2397
01:56:16,441 --> 01:56:18,110
I'm not,
I'm not going to like look at my arm.

2398
01:56:18,111 --> 01:56:18,600
You're like,
no.

2399
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,870
How about Alistair Crowley?
On your shoulder that man,

2400
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:26,871
I haven't.
Alistair Crawley poster and shit falls 

2401
01:56:26,871 --> 01:56:27,840
off my walls.
I don't want my body some,

2402
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,410
some goddamn chaos.
There's chaos.

2403
01:56:31,411 --> 01:56:34,560
Magician named freighter is low if he 
doesn't care.

2404
01:56:34,561 --> 01:56:37,740
I said his name,
who mails me like really weird.

2405
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,840
Oh,
a cult shit man.

2406
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:43,050
Like really strange.
Like um,

2407
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:48,590
he just sent me a demon,
a demon summoning box where he's painted

2408
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:52,080
the front of it.
It sounds really dumb when I came in.

2409
01:56:52,081 --> 01:56:55,320
So many books.
There's a anyway,

2410
01:56:55,830 --> 01:57:00,830
there's a lot of weird.
There's a lot of strange shit out there 

2411
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:03,051
man.
But the point is I would never want 

2412
01:57:03,051 --> 01:57:03,051
curly tattooed on my body.

2413
01:57:03,051 --> 01:57:06,050
There's a lot of people that have 
terence Mckenna tattooed on them for the

2414
01:57:06,051 --> 01:57:06,560
interesting.

2415
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:09,280
I think that's pretty good,
but I don't know man.

2416
01:57:09,281 --> 01:57:12,520
I like more of a,
something that's less specific,

2417
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:14,850
you know,
something that may be as

2418
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:18,300
the Terence Mckenna Tattoo going to be 
real problematic if December 20,

2419
01:57:18,301 --> 01:57:20,730
first 2012 rolls over another that 
happens.

2420
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:23,520
Although he wasn't really convinced that
anything

2421
01:57:23,550 --> 01:57:25,100
was going to happen.
Well everyone's Scott.

2422
01:57:25,101 --> 01:57:27,590
That.
I mean there's a simple out for 2012,

2423
01:57:27,591 --> 01:57:29,590
which is that it's a shift in the 
vibration.

2424
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:35,140
Well,
no one's ever predicted anything ever.

2425
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:40,170
That's my problem with it.
No one's ever correctly predicted any 

2426
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,910
like huge change in the world ever.
No one's ever said on this day to 

2427
01:57:46,511 --> 01:57:51,050
specifically to the day the world will.
The world will change forever.

2428
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:53,780
They tried with y two k?
Yes.

2429
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:55,900
Oh God.
That was crazy.

2430
01:57:56,440 --> 01:58:01,440
I wonder if they traveled with.
I wonder if people thought 1984 was 

2431
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:01,750
going to be a big year because of the 
book.

2432
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,570
Man.
I remember.

2433
01:58:04,571 --> 01:58:09,571
Do you remember?
I don't remember that.

2434
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:17,100
Well,
1984 is like nothing compared to what's 

2435
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,670
really going on right now.
And your fucking phone is a wireless gps

2436
01:58:18,671 --> 01:58:23,671
tracker that they can turn on and 
listened to you and record you talking 

2437
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:23,671
anymore.
You are?

2438
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:23,671
Yeah.
That shit.

2439
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:26,230
We are so primitive back then,
man.

2440
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,570
Your phone plug into the wall.
Well,

2441
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:31,600
it's really interesting when you go back
to like the 18 hundreds,

2442
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:36,620
you know,
like when was the war of the worlds 

2443
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:36,620
weren't written.

2444
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:36,620
I believe it was written in the 18 
hundreds,

2445
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:38,440
right?
Came on the radio.

2446
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:43,120
People start radios.
Teen Twenties or thirties of the word.

2447
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,390
I'll say 19.
Twenty three.

2448
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:49,810
One was went home.
Boy did it on the radio.

2449
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,030
Orson wells.
What year was that?

2450
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,190
It was hg wells.
Eighteen 98.

2451
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:55,480
Oh Damn.
Yeah.

2452
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:57,880
And then uh,
Orson Welles did it.

2453
01:58:57,881 --> 01:59:00,700
I think in the 19.
The early 19 hundreds.

2454
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,890
Hey,
powerful.

2455
01:59:02,891 --> 01:59:04,090
Ian Edwards is here.
Ladies.

2456
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:05,480
Gentlemen,
what's up brother?

2457
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:08,160
See Him as a man.
How you doing?

2458
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,560
Come on in target.
I'm comics started shuffling lays 

2459
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,800
gentleman,
which means which we will.

2460
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:17,320
We're going to shift from this to that.
Yeah.

2461
01:59:17,321 --> 01:59:22,321
Let's share the shift from the Duncan 
trussell family hour podcast explosion 

2462
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:25,750
in your mouth to a nice house 
chronicles.

2463
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:26,630
So that sounds good,
Brian.

2464
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:27,870
Oh,
I don't know what you're doing that.

2465
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:28,980
Do you want to do one?
Not really.

2466
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:30,130
Don't have to.
Okay,

2467
01:59:30,131 --> 01:59:31,630
then we won't do it.
All right folks.

2468
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,910
No more fucking podcast.
Well,

2469
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:35,710
we got.
Well it's not even 10:00

2470
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:36,100
though,
Dude.

2471
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:42,330
Let's keep going then.
If we're not going to do a nice house 

2472
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:42,330
chronicle.
So let's keep going because it's only,

2473
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:42,430
it's only a quarter to 10 shows at 
10:30,

2474
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,970
but to have a sold out show here tonight
at the Ice House,

2475
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,590
Ian Edwards,
ready to get your freak on.

2476
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,070
What do you,
what about this,

2477
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,520
this shit with,
uh,

2478
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,540
the dispensary's now that it got 
overturned,

2479
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:54,130
what happened?

2480
01:59:55,030 --> 02:00:00,030
I think they decided to let them keep 
continuing to operate because they need 

2481
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:04,031
the tax revenue.
It would be catastrophic to a lot of 

2482
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:04,031
these neighborhoods if all of a sudden 
those businesses pulled out.

2483
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:06,280
What people don't understand is that 
this,

2484
02:00:06,281 --> 02:00:11,281
these businesses,
these cannabis dispensaries have become 

2485
02:00:11,281 --> 02:00:14,130
a big part of the economic success of a 
lot of communities mean not only do 

2486
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:16,930
people work there and have jobs and get 
paid,

2487
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:19,030
but they also pay rental landlords.
I mean,

2488
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,730
there's a lot of them.
There's hundreds of them that would mean

2489
02:00:21,731 --> 02:00:24,070
that hundreds of places no longer have 
someone renting them.

2490
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:27,200
And it's not like there's a shortage of,
uh,

2491
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:27,810
of,
of,

2492
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:31,960
of places to rent.
There's a lot of places to rent.

2493
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:33,400
So if you,
you know,

2494
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:38,430
it's like commercial real estate.
Like I had a look around at a lot of 

2495
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:39,280
commercial places to get a podcast 
studio,

2496
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:42,040
looked at a lot of office space and 
stuff like that.

2497
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:44,230
It's fucking everywhere.
Everywhere.

2498
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:49,450
It's so many places are available and 
open and if they decided just randomly 

2499
02:00:49,691 --> 02:00:54,691
to shut down 700 different fucking 
dispensary's for just dubious reasons.

2500
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:57,820
For reasons that don't make any sense at
all,

2501
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:58,610
it would be.
It would.

2502
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,920
It would suck.
It would fuck up.

2503
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:02,800
The economy is a lot of money that goes 
to paying taxes.

2504
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:03,850
Joe,
is it.

2505
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:07,450
Was that.
I also read that the IDA was saying that

2506
02:01:07,451 --> 02:01:09,750
they're gonna stop rating medicinal 
marijuana dispensary.

2507
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,440
No,
I didn't read that.

2508
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:12,610
When did they say that?
See someone.

2509
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,700
I don't know if it's true.
I think it might have.

2510
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:15,840
It might be with

2511
02:01:16,410 --> 02:01:18,820
you.
Probably would because one of the things

2512
02:01:18,821 --> 02:01:23,821
that I read is that the dea,
they won't disclose any information 

2513
02:01:23,821 --> 02:01:25,900
about bus and what they're doing is 
they're going in and rating people.

2514
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:28,240
They're taking all the marijuana,
they're taking their money,

2515
02:01:28,241 --> 02:01:31,090
taking their plants.
They confiscate all the records.

2516
02:01:31,091 --> 02:01:36,091
They write down everyone's name and then
they do nothing and they don't have to 

2517
02:01:36,091 --> 02:01:37,990
do anything and when you try to find 
information in the case,

2518
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:41,630
they just say an ongoing investigation 
and they don't do anything,

2519
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:44,780
so there's been a or doing something but
they ain't really doing nothing.

2520
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:47,510
They're coming in and jacking people and
not arresting anybody.

2521
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:50,270
And Todd Mccormick was the first person 
who told me about this and I was like,

2522
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:52,130
that doesn't even make sense.
I was like,

2523
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:54,890
am I missing something in the story?
And then I went and looked at it online,

2524
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:56,060
but no,
that is the practice.

2525
02:01:56,061 --> 02:02:01,061
The practice is they just make it 
ridiculous for these people to try to 

2526
02:02:01,061 --> 02:02:01,310
run a business and they'd come in and 
take all their shit.

2527
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:06,010
Like trying to act like they're doing 
something to kind of keep the show going

2528
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:10,990
that they're doing their job but they 
don't really want to arrest.

2529
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:16,360
They probably agree with the states that
have California that have weed laws,

2530
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:17,400
but there's like,
all right,

2531
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,990
we got to do something so let's just 
shut this down.

2532
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,940
But not really try people.

2533
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:26,280
I don't know if it's an agreement thing 
because a lot of cops do not like weed.

2534
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:31,310
You know what I mean?
When when cops break into guys' houses 

2535
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:33,000
and shoot their dog 17 fucking times and
look around and find a pipe,

2536
02:02:33,001 --> 02:02:38,001
a little bit of weed on it.
Have you seen some of those videos and 

2537
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:38,001
the links?
I can't.

2538
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:42,370
Trendous man.
They shot some former marine 17 times 

2539
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:42,370
the other day and they thought this guy 
had pot him.

2540
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:44,360
He had nothing.
It's the whole thing is crazy.

2541
02:02:44,361 --> 02:02:46,140
I thought he was a dealer.
There's no pot in the house.

2542
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:49,720
When are you going to put some of these 
cops away just to let other cops know.

2543
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,920
It's always like,
let's not rush to judgment that police 

2544
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:54,920
chief is like,
let's not rush to judgment.

2545
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:59,910
Let's see what happens.
But they rushed to judgment when the 

2546
02:02:59,910 --> 02:03:04,021
cops right up a criminal forum and 
somebody that they arrest and they put 

2547
02:03:04,021 --> 02:03:06,490
the story on the news,
like instantly that person's guilty,

2548
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:08,660
but when a cop shoots somebody lists 
this weight.

2549
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:10,440
Well,
sometimes they do that,

2550
02:03:10,441 --> 02:03:15,441
but you know,
the Internet is sort of taking a lot of 

2551
02:03:15,441 --> 02:03:15,720
that away.
They're exposing these people like that.

2552
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:20,780
That officer at Uc Davis,
that's pepper sprayed those kids in the 

2553
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:23,451
face and then there was a recent 
situation where the cop cold cocked a 

2554
02:03:23,581 --> 02:03:27,390
chick at a Puerto Rican day,
pride for it and he thought that she did

2555
02:03:27,391 --> 02:03:28,260
something,
but she didn't.

2556
02:03:28,261 --> 02:03:29,880
She just was in the wrong place,
the wrong time.

2557
02:03:29,881 --> 02:03:32,370
So he turns around and cracks her.
It was fucked up,

2558
02:03:32,371 --> 02:03:37,371
man.
It's fucked up to watch that guy's in 

2559
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:37,371
trouble.
That guy's in trouble be.

2560
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:37,440
Yeah,
he fucking shed vein.

2561
02:03:37,470 --> 02:03:39,750
Even if she did throw water on them,
you're not allowed to punch her.

2562
02:03:39,751 --> 02:03:40,590
Dude.
You're a cop.

2563
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:42,900
Girl throws water.
You can't punch her in the face.

2564
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:48,640
A little more restricted.
The cool thing about the proliferation 

2565
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:48,900
of fucking cameras everywhere,
like it goes both ways,

2566
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:53,100
but I've heard that the TSA is not 
letting you film them anymore.

2567
02:03:53,101 --> 02:03:54,810
If you heard this.
I've heard that.

2568
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:55,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

2569
02:03:55,891 --> 02:04:00,891
That's when we had a WHO's telling us a 
story?

2570
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:06,060
Kevin Prayer was telling us the story of
being stuck at the airport and trying to

2571
02:04:06,061 --> 02:04:08,630
film and his girlfriend trying to film 
it and they wouldn't let him.

2572
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:13,160
They took him into a room and it's like,
I don't have a witness here anymore.

2573
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:18,170
At least out there.
I have a witness like I want to film 

2574
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:18,170
this.
They wouldn't let him.

2575
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:18,830
They wouldn't let him.
The whole thing is,

2576
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:21,510
it's just ridiculous.

2577
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:23,690
Solaris the TSA.
I can like cops now.

2578
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:25,680
Police State,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2579
02:04:25,681 --> 02:04:28,200
we've reached a police state.
People want to control people.

2580
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:29,900
The system sucks.
The systems a mass.

2581
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:34,910
People are complaining and then they 
want to control the people complaining 

2582
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,431
so they want to tighten down a police 
state instead of addressing what the 

2583
02:04:37,431 --> 02:04:40,340
people are complaining about when people
to the point where they're rioting in 

2584
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:41,220
the streets or there's an occupy Wall 
Street type of movement.

2585
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:46,490
Man.
The fact that the government does not 

2586
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:47,490
address that on a formal basis,
on a regular basis,

2587
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:49,830
that they're not doing something about 
that and adjusting.

2588
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:54,831
It just shows you how,
how much content they have for the 

2589
02:04:54,831 --> 02:04:55,650
actual people and who they really work 
for.

2590
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,800
That's not even a subject of a guarantee
that shit's going to come up in the 

2591
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,161
debates.
You think they're going to talk about 

2592
02:05:04,161 --> 02:05:04,161
occupy Wall Street and addressing their 
demands

2593
02:05:04,161 --> 02:05:07,830
or the petro dollar or the or the fact 
that China is like apparently switching 

2594
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:09,220
away from the dollar to buy oil.
Have you heard about that shit?

2595
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,740
No,
I don't blame him.

2596
02:05:11,741 --> 02:05:15,160
If they're seen the value of the dollar.
Jesus doesn't even meet.

2597
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:20,430
This spooky thing is apparently our 
entire currency is based on the fact 

2598
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:24,220
that most people use it to buy oil and 
so they have to have vast reserves of it

2599
02:05:24,490 --> 02:05:28,330
on hand to buy the oil,
but if that changes,

2600
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:33,360
then our dollar will drop even more than
it's valued at now and the most extreme 

2601
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,160
way because it's not based on gold until
a lot of people.

2602
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:39,760
It's called the petro dollar theory.
It's on wikipedia.

2603
02:05:39,761 --> 02:05:42,760
It's a theory,
but the theory is that all the wars that

2604
02:05:42,761 --> 02:05:47,761
we've been in have been with places that
we're about to switch the currency from 

2605
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:54,690
the dollar to something else,
and whenever that happens we go in and 

2606
02:05:54,690 --> 02:05:56,350
attack because that's the only thing 
that our dollars valued on.

2607
02:05:56,351 --> 02:06:01,351
But it's a theory.
It's a conspiracy about while we 

2608
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:01,351
attacked Iraq.
Yes,

2609
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:03,070
and right after we had,
because he had already switched over and

2610
02:06:03,071 --> 02:06:05,370
we attacked Iraq and then we turned it 
back to the dollar.

2611
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:07,770
Within a year of attacking.
Yeah.

2612
02:06:09,190 --> 02:06:12,400
Little while you'll hear them talk about
that in the fucking debates.

2613
02:06:12,401 --> 02:06:13,540
You won't hear that come up.
Well,

2614
02:06:13,541 --> 02:06:14,830
you won't hear them talking about Wiki 
leaks.

2615
02:06:14,831 --> 02:06:16,390
So there was a purpose to all these 
wars.

2616
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,100
That's good to know that they're not 
doing it for nothing.

2617
02:06:18,101 --> 02:06:20,800
That's good money,
son.

2618
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:26,790
You're not going to hear anybody talking
about Wiki leaks and the debate and that

2619
02:06:26,791 --> 02:06:29,940
shit ain't going to sweep that under the
rug.

2620
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:35,160
Is that dude still hold up in that has 
been there for months to get him any 

2621
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:35,400
pussy.
You should.

2622
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:37,810
They should sneak him in some hippie 
plus.

2623
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:40,490
You have to pay rent there.
It's a good question.

2624
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:45,640
I wonder if he's got a dope suite too.
He just promises not to leak anything 

2625
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:45,640
about them.
Yeah.

2626
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:47,500
I wonder if he has to promise.
Oh Shit.

2627
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:50,030
He probably has some serious shit on 
that guy.

2628
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,050
Well,
it's weird that

2629
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:55,280
they're in there in England,
but it's the Ecuadorian embassy,

2630
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:57,770
so he's allowed to stay.
Even though he's in England,

2631
02:06:57,771 --> 02:06:59,900
they all just stand around waiting for 
him to come out.

2632
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:02,780
So he stays in that house for months.
He's been in that house for months

2633
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:07,900
now.
He comes out and does little speeches 

2634
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:07,900
from that balcony,
but he's still in the house.

2635
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:11,531
Technically I was calling him Ray Ponzel
rape rape.

2636
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:17,540
Well they,
they,

2637
02:07:17,541 --> 02:07:18,470
uh,
they already got that.

2638
02:07:18,490 --> 02:07:21,400
The DNA test back on the condom and it 
shows none of his deal.

2639
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,150
Yeah.
I don't think,

2640
02:07:22,151 --> 02:07:23,480
you know,
they just want to get.

2641
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:26,160
I'm sorry Julian.
I love you.

2642
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:27,770
Yeah,
they're jacking that guy.

2643
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:29,600
It's really scary,
isn't it?

2644
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,220
Yeah.
It's fucking scary.

2645
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:36,221
And also that other guy that's in just 
in some pod somewhere getting hose 24 

2646
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:39,190
hours a day,
they have him in solitary confinement.

2647
02:07:39,570 --> 02:07:41,470
He's naked.
He's not allowed to wear clothes.

2648
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:45,310
He just like balled up in a fetal 
position in some orange room.

2649
02:07:45,311 --> 02:07:47,570
Getting sprayed with water.
I was is every few hours.

2650
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:48,540
Music?
Yeah.

2651
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:53,670
Is that what you heard?
I made up a lot of that when I went to 

2652
02:07:54,071 --> 02:07:57,550
visit him.
That's how it was after I fucked up.

2653
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:03,470
But he's not doing great.
I don't think he can send letters and 

2654
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:03,470
stuff.

2655
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:03,470
I don't think you can do anything enough
letters,

2656
02:08:03,470 --> 02:08:08,470
you know,
saying essentially psychologically 

2657
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:08,470
torturing.

2658
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:08,650
He's gone.
I bet he's gone.

2659
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:11,230
When he comes out of there,
he's going to be a drooling boo Radley.

2660
02:08:11,231 --> 02:08:12,700
You won't know.
That's optimistic

2661
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:15,860
when it comes out of they're never 
coming out.

2662
02:08:16,070 --> 02:08:17,600
Coming out.
And what.

2663
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:22,660
You know,
what's really interesting is this guy 

2664
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:22,760
could have done something far worse and 
he would be in a real prison,

2665
02:08:22,970 --> 02:08:25,550
was interacting with people.
He could have been a murderer,

2666
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:27,860
he could've been the DC sniper.
He could've been.

2667
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:33,070
He could've done something far more 
horrific and he would be interacting 

2668
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:35,270
with people with this guy did was leaked
some information about some shit that he

2669
02:08:35,271 --> 02:08:40,271
thought was horrific and in doing so 
they're treating him like he is fucking 

2670
02:08:40,821 --> 02:08:44,580
Lex Luthor to treating him like he's the
worst bad guy ever.

2671
02:08:44,581 --> 02:08:49,581
I.
While Manson's and a regular prison 

2672
02:08:49,581 --> 02:08:49,581
somewhere,

2673
02:08:49,581 --> 02:08:52,460
Rogan.
Have you seen this list that leaked 

2674
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:55,311
about that?
Different signs that someone's a 

2675
02:08:55,311 --> 02:08:56,610
terrorist like at week from the army or 
something like what to look for?

2676
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:00,360
What was one of them?
Everything you do like you like you are.

2677
02:09:01,590 --> 02:09:02,160
There's,
there's,

2678
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:07,250
there's gradients on the list and on the
red side it's pretty much all of us.

2679
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:12,560
All of us are like,
would be considered like terrorists by 

2680
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:13,560
this new thing.
Did you find it?

2681
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,440
Oh,
if you use social media.

2682
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:16,670
Yeah,
I read some.

2683
02:09:16,671 --> 02:09:21,671
I read some of it back in the day.
This podcast would probably be 

2684
02:09:21,671 --> 02:09:23,610
considered like communists the mccarthy 
era or you know,

2685
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:27,020
just just some red party shit for sure.
Wow.

2686
02:09:27,021 --> 02:09:29,040
Here's some warning signs.
According to the U,

2687
02:09:29,041 --> 02:09:31,050
s military.
Wow.

2688
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:34,100
You've recently changed your choices in 
entertainment.

2689
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:38,180
You have peculiar discussions have gone 
to a blowjob porn.

2690
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:43,310
You complain about bias to your socially
withdrawn.

2691
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:48,400
Jody is jody,
is that on?

2692
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:56,140
I don't hear him check their beautiful.
Um,

2693
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,280
uh,
you're socially withdrawn.

2694
02:09:58,310 --> 02:10:00,860
You're frustrated with mainstream 
ideologies.

2695
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:06,130
Your risk factors for radicalization 
include social networks and youth being 

2696
02:10:07,890 --> 02:10:12,890
young on facebook because it,
you're a young urine terrorist.

2697
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:18,620
That is fucking hilarious.
That is just like the most broad 

2698
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:21,520
sweeping brush I think I've ever read 
ever in an official

2699
02:10:22,010 --> 02:10:24,140
think came out with this.
This is some cons.

2700
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,620
I know.
I think it's like the army and,

2701
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:31,680
and,
but the combination of this with the 

2702
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:33,961
indefinite detention act,
that's where shit gets creepy because 

2703
02:10:33,961 --> 02:10:33,961
it's one thing to just be like,
yeah,

2704
02:10:33,961 --> 02:10:33,980
those are

2705
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,750
signs that someone might be doing 
something weird,

2706
02:10:35,751 --> 02:10:40,751
but then I think a terrorist,
someone suspected of terrorism can just 

2707
02:10:40,751 --> 02:10:43,220
get arrested according to the indefinite
detention act without a trial.

2708
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:48,470
So that's where she gets a little not,
not going to sleep that well at night.

2709
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:53,710
Well,
we have this girl who's coming on the 

2710
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:53,710
podcast tomorrow,
Amber Lyon,

2711
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:58,160
who was working for CNN and was like 
clearly censored,

2712
02:10:58,161 --> 02:11:03,161
like they were told not to tell stories.
There are certain things that were told 

2713
02:11:03,161 --> 02:11:06,041
not to cover.
There's certain areas where they wanted 

2714
02:11:06,041 --> 02:11:08,750
to.
They wanted to report on actual news and

2715
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:13,751
they were told not to and they were told
to read off government propaganda that 

2716
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:14,210
they knew was not true.
Yeah.

2717
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:16,280
And this is on CNN,
so you know,

2718
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,040
it's,
it's,

2719
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:19,430
it's real.
It's on it.

2720
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:21,530
It's not like.
It's not like people going,

2721
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:24,320
oh yeah,
well they wouldn't act on that stuff.

2722
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:24,680
No,
no,

2723
02:11:24,681 --> 02:11:24,920
no,
no,

2724
02:11:24,921 --> 02:11:25,190
no,
no,

2725
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,190
no.
This is like,

2726
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:31,480
like they've figured out a way to 
control media and propaganda is a real 

2727
02:11:32,871 --> 02:11:34,610
thing.
Now it's 100 percent real.

2728
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:37,130
They can big and lie to you all day long

2729
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:40,600
and if you want to travel anywhere,
they can restrict you.

2730
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:43,510
They not only can they restrict you,
but just to travel.

2731
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:48,660
You are going to have your body 
magnetically scans so they can see you 

2732
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:50,800
fucking naked.
If you travel,

2733
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,810
you must allow them to see your name.

2734
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,960
Goodbye.
That doesn't work.

2735
02:11:53,961 --> 02:11:55,940
As Joey Diaz clearly explained

2736
02:11:56,070 --> 02:11:59,820
on the Alex Jones show,
they missed a bag of weed,

2737
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:00,380
has hidden under

2738
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:02,660
balls.
It can't see through Joey's balls.

2739
02:12:03,980 --> 02:12:05,870
They might be able to see distant 
telescope.

2740
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:10,020
They have not yet developed a scanner 
machine that could see past better.

2741
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,540
Watch that al Qaeda is going to cut 
your.

2742
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:15,450
To smuggle something to another country.
You have to buy Joe's Joe DSS,

2743
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:20,510
sack skin.
What they need to do is this scientist 

2744
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:20,510
that clone Dolly the sheep.
They need to clone Joey's balls.

2745
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:23,000
Just make them really large extent.
No coffee grounds.

2746
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:28,030
Put them over stealth bombers and you 
can just fucking flying in the x ray 

2747
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:30,880
machines wouldn't see shit.
We get you these x Ray.

2748
02:12:30,881 --> 02:12:33,830
They put that fucking umpire thing on 
your chest.

2749
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:39,170
That's what my skin on my nuts through.
It's like fucking shield.

2750
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,840
It doesn't go through because I hide 
that.

2751
02:12:41,841 --> 02:12:45,680
Sat behind them was all they could see 
is this motherfucker got three nuts.

2752
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:48,790
He's the luckiest motherfucker.

2753
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:53,900
They don't want to gonna overlook the 
morals.

2754
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:57,980
They robbed the $800,000
worth of loot to TSA people.

2755
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:59,590
Yeah.
They found the IPAD.

2756
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:05,060
Did you see that?
But they robbing those motherfuckers 

2757
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,060
dog.
Yeah,

2758
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:09,980
they definitely have the.
They're always like swiping watches and 

2759
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:09,980
shit.
You got to hear a lot of stories,

2760
02:13:10,030 --> 02:13:15,030
but I went through the tsa today and 
they were being extra careful because 

2761
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:17,450
like a penny dropped off into the and 
they're like,

2762
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:18,650
sir,
your penny.

2763
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:22,130
Don't forget your pen.
You're probably gonna.

2764
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:24,530
Feel guilty.
Everybody's watching.

2765
02:13:24,531 --> 02:13:26,540
Everyone's watching you.
Just saying this is a metal washer.

2766
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:28,660
Just watching the men in the metal,
but it doesn't go off.

2767
02:13:29,310 --> 02:13:31,350
Go right through the scanner machine.
It goes,

2768
02:13:31,351 --> 02:13:32,100
what?
You fucking.

2769
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,650
Wouldn't it be hilarious?
They're not even checking you.

2770
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:38,220
Definitely.
Would that be crazy?

2771
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:43,221
Would that be if half those machines,
it really cost like $800 rich body go 

2772
02:13:43,221 --> 02:13:45,570
through and they just make you go 
through and press a button and go.

2773
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:46,980
You're going through it and just 
checking to see,

2774
02:13:47,630 --> 02:13:51,960
look how many fucking times they find 
people with bullets and guns and fucking

2775
02:13:51,961 --> 02:13:56,961
stupidity.
It makes you really think it really 

2776
02:13:56,961 --> 02:13:59,511
makes you fucking think.
I guarantee avenues people just 

2777
02:13:59,511 --> 02:13:59,511
whatever,
just whatever.

2778
02:13:59,511 --> 02:14:01,440
You know today's a data free fucking 
day.

2779
02:14:01,441 --> 02:14:03,840
You might want a bazooka.
We're not going to catch you.

2780
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:08,870
Well,
they did some independent testing where 

2781
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:09,950
they tried to get people through and 
they got through with a bunch of guys.

2782
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:12,300
You'd be fucking surprised.
You'd be fucking surprised.

2783
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:15,480
Well No,
it goes off a foil from Gum,

2784
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:17,070
Huh?
Yeah.

2785
02:14:17,071 --> 02:14:21,090
When you have like a pack of Dentine 
with a push through foil back.

2786
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:23,280
That shit go.
You have that in your pocket.

2787
02:14:23,281 --> 02:14:24,390
You'll beat,
but you've got a weapon.

2788
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:29,600
But meanwhile the metal that you're 
watches made out for whatever fucking 

2789
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:29,600
reason,
that doesn't go off.

2790
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:33,860
It just makes me want to puke when I 
look over and see a fucking old man 

2791
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:34,980
today.
I saw an 80 year old man with a brace on

2792
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:39,530
his neck getting like a hard core.
You know what?

2793
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:41,340
Come on.
He was he white.

2794
02:14:41,341 --> 02:14:41,790
He probably did.

2795
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:47,710
Did some shit back in the creepy shit.
Fuck it up to be alive.

2796
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:51,600
Did some racist shit.
Needs to go search.

2797
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:56,070
Say workers were working them over like 
a water hose.

2798
02:14:56,780 --> 02:15:01,140
Help they dip their fingers inside.
Sanitizers stuck it right up his ass.

2799
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:06,720
He had Sam took John Sanitizer,
hand sanitizer inside your ass.

2800
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:11,850
That would not be cutting your asshole.
Yeah,

2801
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:14,010
someone's done it.
Someone does it all day.

2802
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:15,540
Someone's probably addicted to doing 
that.

2803
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:20,630
Going to a doctor.
I've got to stop putting her hand 

2804
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:20,630
sanitizer up my ass and is actually a 
new thing.

2805
02:15:20,650 --> 02:15:25,650
A new fucking.
Remember we went to town and we had 

2806
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:26,530
dinner with some doctor.
I was there.

2807
02:15:26,531 --> 02:15:28,710
It's telling us about emergency room 
share.

2808
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:34,490
A friend of mine used to all that.
They in Chicago national that they 

2809
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:39,231
buried the fucking God member.
What were the stories about Josh 

2810
02:15:39,231 --> 02:15:40,040
motherfuck?
You're John Rollo.

2811
02:15:40,041 --> 02:15:45,041
Tell you about his buddy.
The boxer who went for shoulder surgery 

2812
02:15:45,041 --> 02:15:45,900
and before you have shoulder surgery,
they shoot a,

2813
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:50,980
uh,
a thing in you and it and it fucking 

2814
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:50,980
freezes your arm.

2815
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:52,110
Your nerves.
You can have your nerves like 18 months.

2816
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:54,060
They shot the motherfucking the wrong 
arm.

2817
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:55,570
Oh No.
Yeah.

2818
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:57,540
Boxer as John Rollo.
He picked somebody,

2819
02:15:57,541 --> 02:16:01,050
Andre Ward to a decision or something 
like that a couple of years ago.

2820
02:16:01,051 --> 02:16:04,320
And then they did the surgery.
They shot this motherfucker in the wrong

2821
02:16:04,321 --> 02:16:06,750
order,
but it takes 18 months to heal because I

2822
02:16:06,751 --> 02:16:10,260
guess it's one centimeter of fucking 
month that heels backwards.

2823
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:11,540
John was telling me,
Oh,

2824
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:16,740
can you man?
They go in for surgery to take out your 

2825
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:16,740
wrong.
Fuck.

2826
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:19,170
I boss,
boss ruin has a nerve issue that he had 

2827
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:22,230
a nerves fucked up and it was over a 
year where his arm hadn't healed yet.

2828
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:25,200
Something we.
Your nerves take time,

2829
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:27,270
dude.
I've heard of people bringing their dogs

2830
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:31,330
into the vet to get him groomed and they
put them to sleep because of confusion.

2831
02:16:31,331 --> 02:16:33,390
They get it confused.
Yeah.

2832
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:36,130
Will Ferrell's tats.
Oh Shit.

2833
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:41,470
That's a call back from an old Joe Rogan
podcast.

2834
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,780
Will Ferrell.
Is Cats feral cats.

2835
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,070
Oh,
remember that going back to the ems,

2836
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,630
a friend of mine out there,
he was a comic and use will be,

2837
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:51,580
you know,
used to work in the ambulance and Queens

2838
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:56,970
and uh,
like people would come in with shit 

2839
02:16:56,970 --> 02:16:58,590
stuck in they ass.
Like one guy had that Gi joe doll.

2840
02:16:58,591 --> 02:17:03,591
It was,
he was talking about people getting 

2841
02:17:03,591 --> 02:17:03,591
stood up.
Graham,

2842
02:17:03,591 --> 02:17:04,990
Steve Graham always talks about that 
when he did his residency in Miami,

2843
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:07,510
said they found light bulbs up people's 
assets.

2844
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:12,800
Those those twisty light bulbs or the 
twisty joints have led light bulbs up 

2845
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,250
their assets and then the light bulb 
broke some of the thing.

2846
02:17:14,251 --> 02:17:15,170
He said,
well,

2847
02:17:15,180 --> 02:17:16,360
this dude's stuck.
A Gi Joe.

2848
02:17:16,361 --> 02:17:21,361
Joe Doll up his ass,
but he couldn't pull it out because the 

2849
02:17:21,361 --> 02:17:21,361
arms opened up.

2850
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:28,910
That's when you have to call the bar.
And he was like,

2851
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,660
Hook Dude.
This guy,

2852
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,120
the doctor,
we were talking at two at dinner.

2853
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:35,890
He said something that I'd never heard 
before,

2854
02:17:35,891 --> 02:17:38,610
which is some people were taking nitrous
oxide,

2855
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:43,820
remember this and inflating their 
testicles with it and that some people 

2856
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:46,960
do that.
A guy like,

2857
02:17:46,961 --> 02:17:49,260
you know where you can get this nitrous 
oxide dude,

2858
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:51,950
I have no idea,
but if you get it from dunkins testicles

2859
02:17:55,370 --> 02:18:00,370
that lets it out and whistles.
Like I heard of a chicken Jersey one 

2860
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:02,850
time while he was in the hospital,
some chick came in,

2861
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:07,860
she put a frozen a hotdog and they'll 
push it up broke so she had to go get 

2862
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:07,860
it.

2863
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:13,310
Oh,
she was so cold,

2864
02:18:13,311 --> 02:18:15,740
like a fucking ballpark.
She's such a bitch.

2865
02:18:15,741 --> 02:18:20,741
That shit didn't even fuck up.
Go fuck him.

2866
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:30,040
Crushed it came out the snow

2867
02:18:33,330 --> 02:18:33,840
icicle.

2868
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:41,250
I mean if you can think of it,
someone stuffed it up there.

2869
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:43,120
I just call a dude,
right?

2870
02:18:43,121 --> 02:18:45,490
Someone is someone stuffed ticket name 
for a kid's book.

2871
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:48,460
These microphones stands.
Someone's shoved up their ass,

2872
02:18:48,461 --> 02:18:53,461
right?
Someone's shoved beer bottles up the 

2873
02:18:53,461 --> 02:18:53,461
Ras.
We've also two guys,

2874
02:18:53,461 --> 02:18:54,710
one cup or see that the guy stuck or 
gummies.

2875
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:57,580
Jara possess.
You just see that.

2876
02:18:58,300 --> 02:18:59,130
Oh,
he pushed.

2877
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:00,200
Stuck like a,
like a,

2878
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:03,250
like one of those jars.
We get some really good jelly,

2879
02:19:03,530 --> 02:19:04,990
you know,
you get that preserved.

2880
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:10,230
Whereas like a fancy fancy glass jar 
like I had that deepen his ass and it 

2881
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:14,311
broke and then clunks have chunks of 
broken glass and blood or coming out of 

2882
02:19:14,711 --> 02:19:17,950
his ass.
I mean it is a crazy fucking.

2883
02:19:17,951 --> 02:19:22,951
See what about those junkies in prison?
They walk around with a syringe in 

2884
02:19:22,951 --> 02:19:26,580
there,
a fucking syringe with a spoon batches 

2885
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:28,090
and want they tuck

2886
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:32,740
it in their asshole store syringes.
In your end,

2887
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:38,140
after 10 years of doing it,
it just like nothing open your ass old 

2888
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:39,860
tickets needle out of that.
Oh my God.

2889
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:44,980
It's not the way they say that.
A lot of guys get hepatitis from 

2890
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:44,980
exchanging needles if they don't have 
clean needles.

2891
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:52,150
It's fucked up though.
There's diseases that come just from 

2892
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:53,120
sex,
like how did syphilis ever get,

2893
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:55,310
you know,
we know we were talking about like swine

2894
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:59,240
flu and all these different things that 
come from from massive farms,

2895
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:04,300
which is a lot.
A lot of fluids come from fucking 

2896
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:04,440
sexually transmitted diseases come from 
who?

2897
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,860
Who's the first person to get herpes?
Like how did,

2898
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,600
how did that get Kelly cursed

2899
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:14,680
syphilis,
syphilis,

2900
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:16,790
syphilis.
Now what is syphilis?

2901
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:19,670
How does it get into what comes out of 
your Dick?

2902
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:22,130
What comes up?
What leakage?

2903
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,860
When I was about 15,
my buddy told me I had a problem.

2904
02:20:24,861 --> 02:20:26,630
He goes,
can you go to the clinic with me?

2905
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,510
Hello Boo.
Forget going to the clinic afterschool.

2906
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:34,600
Not even thinking about it guys and see 
them bitches with sores in their mouth 

2907
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:36,170
and fucking shit leak.
And I was like,

2908
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:39,380
I made a mental note right there,
like right there.

2909
02:20:39,381 --> 02:20:44,381
I was like,
I ain't fucking around with bitches til 

2910
02:20:44,381 --> 02:20:44,381
I'm older.
Well,

2911
02:20:44,381 --> 02:20:44,381
this is the.
One of the things that they,

2912
02:20:44,381 --> 02:20:49,070
they shut down the porn industry because
the dude syphilis and started giving 

2913
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:49,070
the.
Yeah,

2914
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:53,830
this is a during 2010,
there was for 45,834

2915
02:20:54,171 --> 02:20:57,740
new cases of syphilis compared to 
48,000.

2916
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,400
Um,
uh,

2917
02:20:59,450 --> 02:21:02,030
HIV infections and 300,
9,000

2918
02:21:02,031 --> 02:21:03,520
cases of gonorrhea.
Whoa.

2919
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:05,280
Gary is popular.
Which ones?

2920
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:09,380
Three hundred and 9,000
cases of gonorrhea.

2921
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:13,450
That's just for those who thought 
gonorrhea was over his backyard.

2922
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:18,610
They got a rear coming on.
It's Kinda read the class.

2923
02:21:19,250 --> 02:21:21,160
I took a question.
Is that the clap?

2924
02:21:21,161 --> 02:21:23,720
Gonorrhea as the class,
I would assume it was that

2925
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:29,250
two thirds of a syphilis occurred 
amongst men who have sex with men.

2926
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:33,940
Wow.
Most syphilis is gay syphilis.

2927
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Interesting.
There are 377 reports of children with 

2928
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,730
congenital syphilis.
Which means town with it.

2929
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:43,960
Yeah.
Syphilis.

2930
02:21:43,961 --> 02:21:46,450
The transmitted from person to person.
It's a bacterium.

2931
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:51,460
Disease caused by long.
It's caused by bacterium can cause 

2932
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:53,860
longterm complications and slash or 
death not adequately treated.

2933
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:56,800
Sores can occur on the lips and in the 
mouth.

2934
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,260
Syphilis can be transmitted during 
vaginal,

2935
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:00,520
anal,
or oral.

2936
02:22:00,521 --> 02:22:04,360
Sexual contact.
Pregnant women with the disease can pass

2937
02:22:04,361 --> 02:22:06,550
it onto their unborn children.
Whoa.

2938
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:07,810
Damn you.
Syphilis.

2939
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:13,020
Syphilis is a motherfucker.
How quickly the symptoms appear after 

2940
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:16,321
infection.
The average time between infection and 

2941
02:22:16,321 --> 02:22:17,320
with syphilis and the appearance of the 
first symptom is 21 days,

2942
02:22:17,321 --> 02:22:19,840
but it can range up to 90 days.
Woo

2943
02:22:21,150 --> 02:22:26,150
did.
I knew a guy who used to say that 

2944
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:26,150
fucking pussy with was the best

2945
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:31,130
pussy.
That is crazy because it was so hot 

2946
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:31,330
because it was like feverish,
feverish hot.

2947
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:33,160
Oh my God.
I think it's safe to say that guys.

2948
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:35,100
Silly Bitch.
How many times has he done it?

2949
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:36,340
That's crazy.
Oh Man.

2950
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:41,100
I forgot to read the fucking male whores
all looking for bitch with gonorrhea.

2951
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:42,130
First of all.
I did not.

2952
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,600
I'm not here for a long time.
I did not say it like that.

2953
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:52,480
That's number one.
Get someone that lava pushing.

2954
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:56,110
He's been live at

2955
02:22:56,930 --> 02:22:57,820
multiple posts.

2956
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:02,220
If motherfuckers that love period pussy 
you know to do,

2957
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:05,940
I can't even look at that fucking dragon
when there's bloody track and well,

2958
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:06,610
when I was like,
well,

2959
02:23:06,611 --> 02:23:08,990
after my mother died I got a call from 
some checkout,

2960
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:14,070
a bike,
like she called me up when the note was 

2961
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:17,201
still living in the house.
Like I was still living in the fucking 

2962
02:23:17,201 --> 02:23:18,310
house.
I would walk to a house because in those

2963
02:23:18,310 --> 02:23:21,640
days you had no fucking text or nothing.
You got to dial that long.

2964
02:23:21,641 --> 02:23:25,420
Motherfucking number two.
You had to go deep on your fucking phone

2965
02:23:25,421 --> 02:23:27,250
and walk over,
walk but bitch back.

2966
02:23:27,310 --> 02:23:32,310
Remember when to check lyft and another 
part of the distance and long distance 

2967
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:33,220
and you couldn't fall in love.
There was no skype.

2968
02:23:33,221 --> 02:23:37,300
You had a whack off on the phone that 
costs you $10 to wipe off.

2969
02:23:37,630 --> 02:23:40,520
Remember sports phone?
No body.

2970
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:41,920
What is that?
Sports phone.

2971
02:23:41,921 --> 02:23:45,370
Where's your phone for the general 
gamblers that cost you thirty five cents

2972
02:23:45,371 --> 02:23:47,590
to call.
They updated every 30 minutes though.

2973
02:23:47,710 --> 02:23:50,230
Oh,
you remember that?

2974
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:54,550
That was the only thing.
The only time outside of sex calls.

2975
02:23:54,580 --> 02:23:57,900
That's it,
but this is back in the eighties man bar

2976
02:23:57,910 --> 02:24:00,630
shooting pool and the motherfucker come 
and go with one of the knick game.

2977
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:01,690
I don't know,
course sports phone.

2978
02:24:01,930 --> 02:24:06,930
I call the second phone line once while 
I was beating off and I was a kid and 

2979
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:07,390
and,
and pain.

2980
02:24:07,391 --> 02:24:09,040
When the chick asked me,
can I help you?

2981
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:10,160
Can I help you?
I was like,

2982
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:13,660
Oh yeah.
I was like,

2983
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:15,040
what am I going to do?
How am I going to pay for this?

2984
02:24:15,041 --> 02:24:17,290
I don't have a credit card,
but I just just all over myself.

2985
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:20,500
So that's all you need.
Sometimes just the voice.

2986
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:21,100
He's like,
oh,

2987
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:22,120
you're back.
How much?

2988
02:24:23,110 --> 02:24:25,720
I mean that's probably how many dudes 
probably called people up.

2989
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:30,880
Remember how far they were on the phone.
I remember it being a security guard at 

2990
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:33,660
night at this complex they were building
for seniors and the only thing to do was

2991
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:36,340
like you bought at night,
you just call the phone.

2992
02:24:36,341 --> 02:24:41,341
So I used to go down to the party line,
like I ran up like a thousand dollar 

2993
02:24:41,341 --> 02:24:43,930
bill in like a week.
So I'm a security guard and I got to pay

2994
02:24:43,931 --> 02:24:46,570
this shit back then taking the money out
of my check.

2995
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:49,210
I'm basically working for this party 
line.

2996
02:24:50,170 --> 02:24:51,760
It was just crazy.
Wow.

2997
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:54,280
That's one of those.
What happens on a party line.

2998
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:57,250
He just talked to a bunch of people.
That's incredible.

2999
02:24:57,251 --> 02:24:59,590
It's almost like it's the chat phone.
Internet.

3000
02:24:59,591 --> 02:25:00,030
Yeah.
It's like,

3001
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:03,220
yeah,
chat roulette now basically.

3002
02:25:03,230 --> 02:25:05,800
But how many people were in the room 
with you when you would call?

3003
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:08,920
You called the number you talked to like
three or four people in.

3004
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:11,380
Some people just listen.
Some people contribute.

3005
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:16,440
Some people will get off the people that
joined on and never called the party 

3006
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:16,440
line.
No,

3007
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:16,690
I never called.
It was.

3008
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:19,550
It was addictive until I got that bill.
Then I was like,

3009
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:22,330
shit was expensive.
Yo.

3010
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:24,400
That's isn't that amazing

3011
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:29,400
that they could just charge you to 
connect your fucking phone lines 

3012
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:29,830
together and charge you ridiculous 
amounts of money and you don't even know

3013
02:25:29,831 --> 02:25:34,831
what you.
It's not like you see it like running 

3014
02:25:34,831 --> 02:25:34,831
like a meter.
So you can go,

3015
02:25:34,831 --> 02:25:34,831
ah,
just hang it up.

3016
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:37,870
Those lines.
Sometimes there'll be girls.

3017
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:40,120
No,
but you can't see them.

3018
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:41,370
You know,
it was just talking.

3019
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:44,800
Are they from your town?
No idea.

3020
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:46,240
No idea.
It was like,

3021
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:48,820
I don't know if it was an 800 number or 
some shit like that.

3022
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:54,060
I bet a lot of people probably 
pretending they were from your town way 

3023
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:57,120
from Kansas.
I'm from Kansas to get you coming to get

3024
02:25:57,791 --> 02:25:58,630
you.
I'm coming to get you out.

3025
02:25:58,631 --> 02:26:02,170
I'm on my way.
I saw a show about a guy who got tricked

3026
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:04,720
by these Nigerian scammers and it was 
fucking sad.

3027
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:07,180
This poor dude went to Europe twice.

3028
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:10,090
He believed that this girl was waiting 
for them in Europe twice.

3029
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:16,070
See that kind of creepy ass fucked up.
Yeah.

3030
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:17,770
It's like,
what the fuck,

3031
02:26:17,771 --> 02:26:20,050
man?
He got went there twice.

3032
02:26:20,470 --> 02:26:22,590
Loneliness sucks.
Sucks hard,

3033
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:25,730
but that's how social media works on a 
computer.

3034
02:26:26,190 --> 02:26:31,190
It's just from back in the day when we 
used to make those phone calls to those 

3035
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:31,190
party lines.
People just been lonely for ages.

3036
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:35,230
It's just a way to connect without being
in front of somebody and then that's why

3037
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:39,010
facebook and my space is so successful 
for was well,

3038
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:44,011
people literally get sick when they 
don't have contact with other people 

3039
02:26:44,011 --> 02:26:45,520
that if they don't get sick physically,
they get sick mentally.

3040
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:50,970
Something something goes wrong.
You will go to a strip club and you can 

3041
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:52,090
tell the dudes that are fucking lonely 
bro.

3042
02:26:52,091 --> 02:26:54,010
They bring the chicks gifts.
Oh yeah.

3043
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,920
How's your brother?

3044
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:57,490
Yeah,
let's do a dance.

3045
02:26:57,491 --> 02:27:02,491
I really don't want to dance for you.
You see those guys and if you interview 

3046
02:27:02,491 --> 02:27:05,761
a stripper stripper,
and she started to tell you those 

3047
02:27:05,761 --> 02:27:08,851
stories,
your heartbreaks and like really sweet 

3048
02:27:08,851 --> 02:27:09,810
guy came in and gave me $800.
Sit and talk to you for now.

3049
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:12,010
Well,
when I used to go to visit Eddie,

3050
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:13,930
when Eddie worked as a DJ,
you know,

3051
02:27:13,931 --> 02:27:18,931
I got to watch some really crazy shit.
She got to see the girls were just like,

3052
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:20,350
you know,
they'd be like your friend,

3053
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:20,650
like,
Hey,

3054
02:27:20,651 --> 02:27:21,340
what's up?
Hey,

3055
02:27:21,341 --> 02:27:22,360
how you doing?
You know,

3056
02:27:22,361 --> 02:27:24,700
like Eddie was like,
just like friends with all these girls,

3057
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:29,380
they would come in and then guys would 
like buy them cars and this one girl,

3058
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:31,810
the guy came in and she immediately was 
like,

3059
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:34,160
oh my God,
how are you?

3060
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:37,990
She puts on this act and goes runs over 
and hugs him and she's like,

3061
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:40,300
she's really hot and she's naked.

3062
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:42,940
Okay.
She's really hot and she's naked and the

3063
02:27:42,941 --> 02:27:44,990
dude is a zero,
you know?

3064
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:47,680
He's a Dorky,
sad,

3065
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:53,160
goofy,
confused guy who's just not that good 

3066
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:54,220
socially and doesn't understand is being
played.

3067
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,170
And I think he had like a regular job 
too,

3068
02:27:56,171 --> 02:28:01,171
man.
It was like a fucking postman or some 

3069
02:28:01,171 --> 02:28:03,001
shit,
but he would blow all his money on her 

3070
02:28:03,001 --> 02:28:06,180
and he got her car,
like at least they're like one of those 

3071
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:06,180
Nice Yukon's.
So like it was crazy,

3072
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:10,170
but they just take them like a vampire 
as fuck.

3073
02:28:10,210 --> 02:28:13,420
Just draw them in and just,
just for the guy,

3074
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:16,570
just to be in contact with the girl like
that is enough to chicks.

3075
02:28:16,571 --> 02:28:20,250
The guys that give them the most are the
ones that don't push.

3076
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:21,200
They don't want to

3077
02:28:22,390 --> 02:28:25,210
listen.
When I kidnapped that dude partner,

3078
02:28:25,700 --> 02:28:30,530
my partner and my partner on the deal,
the reason it's motivation,

3079
02:28:30,531 --> 02:28:32,360
like you know when you go to acting 
class and they're like,

3080
02:28:32,361 --> 02:28:35,720
what's your motivation?
Is Motivation for the kidnapping?

3081
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:38,060
Was he was dating the chick?
No,

3082
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,270
no,
no,

3083
02:28:38,271 --> 02:28:38,480
no,
no,

3084
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:41,360
no.
He was friends with a chicken strip club

3085
02:28:41,361 --> 02:28:45,230
that danced naked.
Her and her husband had a beef.

3086
02:28:45,710 --> 02:28:48,760
He threw her out.
She loved the guy,

3087
02:28:48,890 --> 02:28:53,890
you know the guy,
but she wouldn't sleep with him because 

3088
02:28:53,890 --> 02:28:56,531
she was Catholic.
She couldn't sleep with until she got 

3089
02:28:56,531 --> 02:28:57,230
divorced.
This guy was giving her all his.

3090
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:02,320
It's the guys that don't get the pussy 
that give the most.

3091
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:04,710
Yeah.
It's a story as old as time.

3092
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:09,790
It's fucking amazing.
I want to be into the stripper part of 

3093
02:29:09,790 --> 02:29:13,271
the story,
but when you say the time I kidnapped 

3094
02:29:13,271 --> 02:29:13,271
that dude,
I just can't.

3095
02:29:13,271 --> 02:29:13,660
I can't just,
I don't know the stories.

3096
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:18,050
I can't just disgusts me that,
uh,

3097
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:21,240
that I saw that when he told me he came 
to my house,

3098
02:29:21,241 --> 02:29:22,290
they looked at mine.
It's like,

3099
02:29:22,330 --> 02:29:23,330
oh,
we got kidnapped.

3100
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:25,870
Or at that time it wasn't a kidnapping.
He's like,

3101
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:27,980
we got to rob this dude,
I need the money.

3102
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:28,530
I'm like,
well,

3103
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:30,570
he told me the story and I'm like,
oh,

3104
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,510
did you have like red flags going off?
Like,

3105
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:36,200
it wasn't even Robert and for the good 
of it,

3106
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:41,530
you know,
he was robbing for a check so she could 

3107
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:41,530
get divorced.
Oh,

3108
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:42,050
oh,
here's where it gets better.

3109
02:29:42,051 --> 02:29:44,120
He owns the house.
His mother had a bunch of houses.

3110
02:29:44,121 --> 02:29:48,240
She was a real estate mogul.
He fucking had her.

3111
02:29:48,241 --> 02:29:50,420
And one of the House was Doug Benson 
Lynch gentlemen.

3112
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,120
He had,
um,

3113
02:29:51,150 --> 02:29:52,700
one of the houses,
free rent.

3114
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:53,750
He was paying the rent for it.

3115
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:58,380
That's so common.
It's just girls in this powerful.

3116
02:29:58,381 --> 02:29:59,700
Doug Benson said,
buddy,

3117
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:02,900
it's very fucking girls have been doing 
that forever.

3118
02:30:02,901 --> 02:30:04,370
But guys been doing that.
The girls too,

3119
02:30:04,430 --> 02:30:06,950
man.
It's like people get played.

3120
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:11,060
I think if you want to be a victim,
some guys want to say,

3121
02:30:11,061 --> 02:30:12,890
I want a girl in a car.
Nothing happened.

3122
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,920
Well,
it's also that these guys are so that 

3123
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:18,800
the girls are so out of their league 
that they're willing to do.

3124
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:23,860
Almost anything to get in.
They can't believe these girls or even 

3125
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:23,920
talking to them.
I mean girls are tendons,

3126
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:25,640
man,
incredible body,

3127
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:27,260
beautiful.
Look at that ass.

3128
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:31,670
I can't believe she's sitting on my lap 
and she's stroking his hair and puts her

3129
02:30:31,671 --> 02:30:34,280
tits in his face and juggles and back 
and forth,

3130
02:30:34,370 --> 02:30:35,810
and this dude is gone,
man.

3131
02:30:35,811 --> 02:30:36,890
He's in heaven.
This is.

3132
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:42,070
This is closer to heaven than he's ever 
been because no girl would ever looked 

3133
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:44,831
at anything like this has ever touched 
them and no girls ever really wanted to 

3134
02:30:44,831 --> 02:30:47,861
touch them.
Some dudes that go through life without 

3135
02:30:47,861 --> 02:30:48,410
anybody being like really passionate 
about them ever.

3136
02:30:48,411 --> 02:30:51,530
No one's attracted to them.
They they're socially awkward.

3137
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:55,430
Who knows what kind of fucking weird 
childhood they had and this girls can do

3138
02:30:55,431 --> 02:30:56,810
a number on a dude like that.

3139
02:30:59,470 --> 02:31:01,040
Hey man,
there's no way she could.

3140
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:06,310
There's no way could stop her.
Especially when know chicks sitting on 

3141
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:07,400
their lap and they like seeing chicks 
like this.

3142
02:31:07,401 --> 02:31:12,401
Sit On dudes.
A lapse in movies and it's like you're 

3143
02:31:12,401 --> 02:31:14,450
just living in the movie lifestyle just 
for a moment and you'll pay for any.

3144
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:15,530
Can't believe.
It's ready.

3145
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:20,160
You believe there's trained agents who 
are like chicks

3146
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:25,160
in the CIA or trained to get fucked to 
like set people up on our 100 percent.

3147
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:27,340
They've done that.
Yeah.

3148
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:29,860
One hundred percent.
They've gotten people to the point where

3149
02:31:29,861 --> 02:31:33,760
they were were undercover and they had 
to have sex with people unquestionably,

3150
02:31:33,890 --> 02:31:35,360
but they.
Do you think they train them?

3151
02:31:35,361 --> 02:31:40,361
Do you think there's like a show to a 
training center for hot girls want to 

3152
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:42,380
listen.
If you're going to fuck this guy,

3153
02:31:42,381 --> 02:31:43,890
you can't fuck them like an agent.
Okay.

3154
02:31:43,891 --> 02:31:44,750
You gotta fuck.
I'm like,

3155
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:47,270
you're crazy bitch.
And your cock monster.

3156
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:49,850
You've got to learn how to study these 
videos.

3157
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:54,650
This is a girl named Amber Lynn in the 
eighties.

3158
02:31:54,651 --> 02:31:57,560
She was a monster.
Just a cock monster.

3159
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,540
I know this dude that runs like charm 
school,

3160
02:31:59,541 --> 02:32:03,500
right?
So he works with the federal government.

3161
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:08,760
The FBI like to teach the agents how to 
not get seduced by women.

3162
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:10,790
Really?
Yeah.

3163
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:15,130
So that's what you're saying is,
is real.

3164
02:32:15,131 --> 02:32:18,680
So that's probably right because it's a 
powerful weapon.

3165
02:32:18,681 --> 02:32:23,681
I mean you can.
If you really want to take down that at 

3166
02:32:23,681 --> 02:32:27,040
present,
you can take down anybody with a body 

3167
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:27,040
with a woman.

3168
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:27,040
Yeah.
Sex is.

3169
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:28,170
It's so powerful to someone who can 
acquire it.

3170
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:31,290
It's like one of the most sweetest 
nectar known.

3171
02:32:31,570 --> 02:32:36,570
Well,
if you can acquire it on a regular 

3172
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:36,570
basis,
it loses its power,

3173
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:36,600
but it's just like getting your heroin 
fix everyday.

3174
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:37,340
They're like,
yeah,

3175
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:39,090
and then nothing.
It's just fucking heroin.

3176
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:42,560
There's a lot of functional heroin users
who's a lot of functional sex addicts.

3177
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:46,830
You know when you're involved with that 
type of a crime.

3178
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:50,790
That's why I always laugh when I read 
about drug bust or something because the

3179
02:32:50,791 --> 02:32:53,430
general public doesn't know when you 
have that.

3180
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:56,760
When somebody is selling 80 kilos a 
fucking month,

3181
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:59,240
guess what?
That'll make that many mistakes.

3182
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:02,550
Right?
For an agent to infiltrate them,

3183
02:33:02,551 --> 02:33:04,360
they have to do something different.
Yeah,

3184
02:33:04,670 --> 02:33:07,290
like when I was locked up in the federal
joint for a couple months,

3185
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:12,650
I got to meet people,
told me stories about shoot the fucking 

3186
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:15,180
blow with agents says that the agents 
crossed the line.

3187
02:33:15,330 --> 02:33:18,450
The agents got got out.
They go to trial.

3188
02:33:18,451 --> 02:33:21,420
They go to rehab and they get there.
Then they don't have in their system,

3189
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,690
so I'm in court yelling,
I got high with Duncan.

3190
02:33:23,710 --> 02:33:24,840
You're like,
that was a year ago.

3191
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:26,640
Prove it,
prove it,

3192
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,440
but it's amazing.
You know?

3193
02:33:28,441 --> 02:33:33,441
That's why you know I'm going to sell a 
kilo of coke to a guy who doesn't do 

3194
02:33:33,441 --> 02:33:33,441
copeland.

3195
02:33:33,441 --> 02:33:34,630
I don't do it.
I'm a business.

3196
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:37,120
That's the weird fucking thing,
man.

3197
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,690
Really weird thing,
man.

3198
02:33:38,691 --> 02:33:43,691
Where the cop is CIA agent or whoever it
is begins to turn into the thing that 

3199
02:33:43,791 --> 02:33:48,791
they're hunting begins to like get 
sucked into that and then there are the 

3200
02:33:48,791 --> 02:33:48,791
criminal shit.
You have to.

3201
02:33:48,791 --> 02:33:51,510
There's no way looking when you go talk 
to attorneys,

3202
02:33:51,511 --> 02:33:53,240
if you ever get in trouble when you go 
talk to attorneys,

3203
02:33:53,250 --> 02:33:55,050
you can talk to.
These dudes are very booksmart.

3204
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:59,160
The attorney you want is the guy that 
knows his way around the court system.

3205
02:33:59,490 --> 02:34:02,130
The Guy who went to college with a judge
who's going to cut a deal,

3206
02:34:02,131 --> 02:34:03,780
he went to school with the district 
attorney.

3207
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:06,150
You follow me?
You got these guys are very book.

3208
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:11,660
Yeah.
They know the fucking long litigation 

3209
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:13,491
that goes so far.
It's the motherfuckers that could cut a 

3210
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:15,390
deal to have.
The same thing applies with cops.

3211
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:18,340
If you're going to bust a,
you got to become a criminal.

3212
02:34:18,341 --> 02:34:20,890
You gotta think like him.
That's why these guys,

3213
02:34:20,891 --> 02:34:22,900
they show you all straight laced.
That's bullshit.

3214
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:26,230
You got to think like them.
There's no way a guy.

3215
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:30,190
There's no way a guy that looks like a.

3216
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:31,930
whatever's you went,
Solomon,

3217
02:34:31,931 --> 02:34:36,931
solemn of mushrooms,
you following these have to look like 

3218
02:34:36,931 --> 02:34:36,931
fucking Charles Manson.
He's gonna.

3219
02:34:36,931 --> 02:34:38,530
Have to eat a cup of mushrooms in front 
of you.

3220
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,150
Then you'll get them announce there's no
way.

3221
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:45,151
It's common.
Fucking how many times have agents had 

3222
02:34:45,151 --> 02:34:45,200
to do asset in front of people?
Just fucking gas.

3223
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:51,210
Tons of it all,
but that's how the FBI does its local 

3224
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:56,420
fucking county.
Listen to have county sheriff under 

3225
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:59,310
coverage.
Those are the filthiest from the covers 

3226
02:34:59,310 --> 02:35:01,510
there.
Vice of the filthiest under the covers 

3227
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:02,080
there and once you hang somewhere,
you see them come in and see.

3228
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:04,810
When that was a boulder,
I worked at the patrol car wash,

3229
02:35:05,350 --> 02:35:07,870
so they had a contract with the town.
They would all come in.

3230
02:35:08,410 --> 02:35:10,780
They would just go around with 
confiscated cars.

3231
02:35:11,050 --> 02:35:12,610
Sure.
If you're a cop in boulder,

3232
02:35:12,611 --> 02:35:14,770
if you're a competent boulder sheriff 
department,

3233
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,420
you don't arrest people in Boulder.

3234
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:21,750
You go to the mountains and the 
undercovers in the mountains come down 

3235
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:22,180
to boulder,
so you're taking.

3236
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:24,820
Let's say I confiscate Joe Rogan's,
bad ass car.

3237
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:27,670
I'm not going to drive around boulder.
That's dumb.

3238
02:35:27,671 --> 02:35:30,310
People going to to Joe Rogan's car.
No,

3239
02:35:30,311 --> 02:35:35,311
I take that same car and I go to fucking
Colorado Springs and I become a cop and 

3240
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:40,441
that's how they do it.
They don't take your stuff and used in 

3241
02:35:40,441 --> 02:35:41,290
the same county.
I became friends with those guys.

3242
02:35:41,530 --> 02:35:44,230
Those county guys had beards.
They wreak the booze.

3243
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:47,200
They were out every night.
It's weird that they can confiscate your

3244
02:35:47,201 --> 02:35:49,720
shit and confiscate your shadow.
I watched a,

3245
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:54,721
a,
an episode of top gear and the American 

3246
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:54,721
version,
when they confiscated a corvette,

3247
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:57,640
zero six and they turned it into a cop 
car dealer.

3248
02:35:59,150 --> 02:36:00,990
You're in jail watching TV going.
That's my guts,

3249
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
your fucking car.
It's amazing about this deficit that we 

3250
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,820
have because if they confiscate all this
fucking blow in cash every year.

3251
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:12,220
What the fuck does it go?
What the fuck does it go?

3252
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:14,750
Are you from Grove County Dunk?
Uh,

3253
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:15,820
uh.
Yo,

3254
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:17,590
Tarzan.
You from Grove,

3255
02:36:17,591 --> 02:36:19,570
Columbus,
Grove county high school or something.

3256
02:36:19,571 --> 02:36:22,540
You know what that is in Columbus.
Worthington.

3257
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:25,720
What were you doing with grover's and 
Columbus Grove or something?

3258
02:36:25,750 --> 02:36:27,760
I just walk around the city.
Grow city.

3259
02:36:28,090 --> 02:36:33,090
Let me tell you how bad a shape Columbus
Ohio was in grove city to play high 

3260
02:36:33,090 --> 02:36:36,490
school football.
You gotta pay $150 a semester as fucking

3261
02:36:36,491 --> 02:36:38,940
parent for your son to play in a public 
school dog.

3262
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:43,540
They had to cancel the program.
The band of Grove city is one of the top

3263
02:36:43,541 --> 02:36:45,910
five high school bands in the country 
don't exist.

3264
02:36:45,911 --> 02:36:50,911
No more lonely.
She wanted to talk to me about sending 

3265
02:36:50,911 --> 02:36:53,560
motherfuckers to Mazda Shit again.
You have to pay high school now for your

3266
02:36:53,561 --> 02:36:58,561
kids to and it's going to be a growing 
thing across the country because of the 

3267
02:36:58,561 --> 02:37:00,280
fucking school budgets that if your 
parents.

3268
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:04,240
What you want to play in high school 
sports now by the year 2015,

3269
02:37:04,241 --> 02:37:07,250
you're going to have to pay for your son
to play high school fucking sport,

3270
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:12,330
my friend.
So put that in your pipe and smoke it 

3271
02:37:12,330 --> 02:37:13,090
the time tonight with magic.
If you go home and watch real sports,

3272
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:15,440
they did a pretty nice thing.
I magic motherfucking Johnson.

3273
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:15,980
They

3274
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,980
said that's the cover.
He went from dead man to a fucking 

3275
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:21,710
gazillionaire.
He went from a fucking dead man to be in

3276
02:37:21,711 --> 02:37:24,740
the fucking gazillionaire.
So Watch we'll sports on HBO.

3277
02:37:24,741 --> 02:37:26,720
They always do beautiful fucking things.
That shit.

3278
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:31,550
Pay One hundred 50 each parent for each 
kid.

3279
02:37:31,870 --> 02:37:33,380
Kids you know,
you know brother,

3280
02:37:33,381 --> 02:37:35,360
inner city.
It's ridiculous.

3281
02:37:35,361 --> 02:37:38,190
When you think about how much money gets
spent on other shit,

3282
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:41,660
bitch,
you know there's a six point $8.

3283
02:37:41,661 --> 02:37:46,250
Billion dollars is what we spend a month
in Afghanistan,

3284
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:51,970
six point 8 billion.
They could spend six point 

3285
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:55,421
$8,000,000,000.
The the astrophysicist Neil degrasse 

3286
02:37:55,421 --> 02:37:56,940
Tyson said that they could come up with 
some incredible,

3287
02:37:56,941 --> 02:38:01,941
a webspace telegraph telescope.
The government pulled the plug on it 

3288
02:38:01,941 --> 02:38:06,310
because they didn't have the money.
They'd have the money to discover new 

3289
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:08,230
planets and possibly search for life or 
figure out what got us here,

3290
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,220
what could prevent the demise of the 
world.

3291
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:13,070
Instead,
they got all this money for Afghanistan.

3292
02:38:13,071 --> 02:38:14,390
We still in Afghanistan.
Anyway,

3293
02:38:14,391 --> 02:38:16,310
we got bin Ladin.
Well,

3294
02:38:16,311 --> 02:38:18,530
if he talked to the really crazy people,
they say heroin.

3295
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:20,460
Heroin.
Yeah.

3296
02:38:20,530 --> 02:38:25,530
They say heroin.
The really a crazy conspiracy theory 

3297
02:38:25,530 --> 02:38:28,841
guys.
They say that it's all a big heroin 

3298
02:38:28,841 --> 02:38:28,841
operation.
Well,

3299
02:38:28,841 --> 02:38:33,671
yeah,
because like if you want to fund black 

3300
02:38:33,671 --> 02:38:35,470
operations,
you do it with drug sales because it's 

3301
02:38:35,470 --> 02:38:38,171
untraceable.
So if the CIO wants to do completely 

3302
02:38:38,171 --> 02:38:38,540
untraceable operations,
they just blow.

3303
02:38:38,541 --> 02:38:43,541
They confiscated.
Or when we had guys on from vice 

3304
02:38:43,541 --> 02:38:43,690
vice.com,
they.

3305
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:48,700
They were just saying that essentially 
there's no other way it could be 

3306
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:52,181
happening because 90 plus percent of the
world's opium and heroin comes from 

3307
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:58,210
Afghanistan and we're in control of that
area and there's video footage of 

3308
02:38:58,210 --> 02:39:00,530
soldiers that are actually like guarding
the fucking poppy fields.

3309
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,700
It's craziness.
It's like you look at it and you go,

3310
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:04,490
this bizarre shit.

3311
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:06,950
How has this on television?
How is this real?

3312
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:12,540
It's all the shit that people in 
conspiracy theory chat rooms had been 

3313
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:16,811
saying forever and what's oxicon 
synthetic heroin when you got all these 

3314
02:39:17,211 --> 02:39:19,350
pills that will lose their minds over 
heroin,

3315
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:22,220
not dimension.
How much about fucking profit?

3316
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:24,840
I invest $50,000
a pound.

3317
02:39:24,841 --> 02:39:26,990
The heroin,
I could chop that motherfucker,

3318
02:39:27,430 --> 02:39:32,330
don't make me make my profit 10 times.
I could walk out of there with $450,000

3319
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:37,720
on a fucking kilo of heroin right now if
they could ever really proved that the 

3320
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:39,890
government has always been selling 
heroin place.

3321
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:42,680
That would be.
That would be insane times if you really

3322
02:39:42,681 --> 02:39:43,860
found that out.
I mean,

3323
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:46,100
when you say the government though,
and it's like it's not really.

3324
02:39:46,101 --> 02:39:49,730
They're all different branches and shit.
It's like you can't really blame the FBI

3325
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:52,580
if some dea guys are selling heroin,
you know,

3326
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:57,640
you can't blame the NSA.
The CIA is doing something because it's 

3327
02:39:57,640 --> 02:40:00,260
kind of all different organizations.
But if we found out that one of them was

3328
02:40:00,261 --> 02:40:05,261
actually long term selling heroin,
if you watch,

3329
02:40:05,721 --> 02:40:10,010
let's say you also the movie American 
gangster,

3330
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:12,800
how the fuck does a black guy from 
Harlem?

3331
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:14,000
Hey Man,
I'm

3332
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:16,860
just because you're black.
I know what I'm saying.

3333
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:21,580
This is your shift or black guy.
A black dude ends up.

3334
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:22,200
You know,
it's funny.

3335
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:27,260
It's like it's such a proud moment in 
black history that you got to fight for 

3336
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:28,080
the negativity.
No,

3337
02:40:28,081 --> 02:40:30,480
he did that shit.
Fuck that Joey.

3338
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:31,860
A black man.
Black.

3339
02:40:32,540 --> 02:40:33,620
Nothing.
There's nothing.

3340
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:36,990
How does a black ended up in fucking 
Vietnam?

3341
02:40:36,991 --> 02:40:37,940
Copland.
Heroin guys.

3342
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:43,700
Yeah.
You think that gate and that thing was 

3343
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:44,240
just made for him.
He had helped me that that was something

3344
02:40:44,540 --> 02:40:45,690
somebody comes up and goes,
hey,

3345
02:40:45,691 --> 02:40:46,980
sure,
fuck the guineas.

3346
02:40:46,981 --> 02:40:50,160
I know what he gets for sure.
We're going to take you to Thailand.

3347
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:51,150
Thailand.
Yeah.

3348
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:56,160
Let's go to the fucking time.
Not only just the Thailand into the 

3349
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,971
city,
but until the jungles when they fucking 

3350
02:40:58,971 --> 02:41:01,161
process and you got to do a white dude.
Black Dude is going to go in there just 

3351
02:41:01,161 --> 02:41:01,161
like that.

3352
02:41:01,161 --> 02:41:04,470
That's what you're trying to tell me and
come back and go in with $200,

3353
02:41:04,471 --> 02:41:07,110
million cash.
That's what you're trying to tell me.

3354
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:12,340
So he did that alone just.
And I'm not taking away to nothing from 

3355
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:12,340
no black dude.
I'm just saying.

3356
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:14,010
I'm just saying that,
you know,

3357
02:41:14,011 --> 02:41:16,320
first of all there's no winning this 
fight for this.

3358
02:41:16,321 --> 02:41:18,650
His brother wouldn't go nowhere with two
of the Gita.

3359
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,840
He got 200 g's.
I ain't got nowhere to go,

3360
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,620
Doug.
You know what I'm saying?

3361
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:24,390
I'll sit here to this 200 to $200 
million.

3362
02:41:24,391 --> 02:41:27,180
Whatever the fuck he took over the wild 
way to live your life,

3363
02:41:27,181 --> 02:41:29,220
man.
A lot of people don't believe that story

3364
02:41:29,221 --> 02:41:34,221
anyway,
now they don't really in it like in 

3365
02:41:34,221 --> 02:41:34,221
Harlem.
Oh really?

3366
02:41:34,221 --> 02:41:36,840
What I'm saying?
He's saying Frank Lucas didn't do that.

3367
02:41:36,860 --> 02:41:38,580
And,
and they just,

3368
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:41,450
they just say he was a chauffeur.
You know,

3369
02:41:41,451 --> 02:41:43,750
that there's people that downplaying,
oh,

3370
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:45,030
he's a chauffeur.

3371
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:46,290
He didn't do that.
It's just,

3372
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:51,800
you know,
there was three and two of those 

3373
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:51,800
motherfuckers.
There was two or three,

3374
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:56,010
those motherfuckers that Ran Harlem in 
the fifties and sixties and all they 

3375
02:41:56,010 --> 02:41:58,610
were with the same thing as my father.
My real father came from Cuba.

3376
02:41:58,850 --> 02:42:01,000
They needed a fucking face to go in 
there.

3377
02:42:01,330 --> 02:42:06,330
Know fucking Cuban's ain't going to buy 
from no Jew and the fucking guineas 

3378
02:42:06,330 --> 02:42:07,820
aren't gonna.
I ain't going to buy from know Italians.

3379
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:13,120
So they took this fucking.
They took a couple of black guys and 

3380
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,120
they made him.
They said,

3381
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,120
listen,
we'll cut 30 percent,

3382
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,350
30 percent of $500,000
profit.

3383
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:20,620
That's a lot of fucking money when you 
live on the fifth floor of the fucking 

3384
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:20,990
building dog.
That's $150,000

3385
02:42:20,991 --> 02:42:25,991
a month times three or four.
So they became a pipelines to the black 

3386
02:42:25,991 --> 02:42:28,000
community.
Don't fucking.

3387
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:30,230
There was no,
there was no genius there.

3388
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:35,570
The guineas came to them.
They cut it 50 fucking times and they 

3389
02:42:35,570 --> 02:42:35,570
gave it to the brothers and the brothers
got it.

3390
02:42:35,570 --> 02:42:37,580
Then they fucking sold it.
And if you go to,

3391
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:40,970
if you went to New York and you grew up 
in how many motherfuckers you see,

3392
02:42:40,971 --> 02:42:42,230
not the light.
Listen,

3393

3467
02:46:00,791 --> 02:46:03,550
this has been a very strange ride these 
last,

3468
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:06,220
especially this last year or so of this 
podcast.

3469
02:46:06,290 --> 02:46:09,560
It's a very strange experience and don't
think that we ever take it for granted.

3470
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:10,110
But Duncan

3471
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:11,900
and I talk about it on the phone all the
time.

3472
02:46:11,901 --> 02:46:13,610
We're always constantly laughing about 
it.

3473
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:18,170
Brian and I talked about we all.
This is a weird time for all of us,

3474
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:20,180
but we appreciate the fuck out of all of
it.

3475
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:22,580
And all these people that come to these 
shows,

3476
02:46:22,581 --> 02:46:25,010
the enthusiasm,
the positivity,

3477
02:46:25,011 --> 02:46:28,460
the friendliness,
just we were blessed.

3478
02:46:28,550 --> 02:46:31,700
We're just lucky as fuck and we're not 
stopping.

3479
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:34,160
We're going to keep doing this.
Don't ever worry.

3480
02:46:34,161 --> 02:46:35,320
We're not going away.
It's going to.

3481
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:40,420
We're going to move forward.
