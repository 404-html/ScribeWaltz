1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,500
Stupid little fucking tube of
paper that sucks in danger,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,710
dangerous chemicals,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,560
and you're telling me that I should be
worried about the end of the world you're

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,710
in.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,790
The world is happening right now.

6
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,570
I'm watching it.

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,171
You're inhaling,

8
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:10,351
you're,

9
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,690
you're addicted to a fucking little stick.

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,740
So true.

11
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:13,970
Yeah.

12
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,060
You're under the world's already here.

13
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,160
Stupid I,

14
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,380
the world is not
necessarily predetermined.

15
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,450
We who knows how this is
all going to turn out.

16
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,300
That's part of the fun of the movie.

17
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,030
That's part of the fun of
the theatrical production.

18
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:27,900
That is your life.

19
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,320
It's true.

20
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,630
If we knew everything that
was going to take place,

21
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,160
it would be so boring.

22
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,260
If you knew that you were now in heaven
and you get to bang some chick anytime

23
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,050
you want for the rest of your life and
you get to eat all the food you want it

24
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,770
for the rest of life,

25
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,660
you think that it would be awesome,

26
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,210
but it's not without risks,

27
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,980
not without failure.

28
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,630
You need all those things.

29
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,531
Human being,

30
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,180
you need to reach struggle.

31
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,080
You need struggle.

32
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,950
It's part of,

33
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,040
we are some sort of a
monkey that creates things.

34
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,390
And if we don't create things,

35
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,980
whether you create ideas,

36
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,840
whether you create relationships,

37
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,950
whether you create houses,

38
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,820
whether you create jokes,

39
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,350
wherever the fuck you put forth,

40
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,210
that's what makes human beings happy.

41
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,240
If you're just living in the clouds
banging chicks and eat and food,

42
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,640
you would fucking live in hell.

43
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,900
You don't think you would,

44
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,850
but eventually you would be in hell.

45
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,900
You'd be in some weird situation where
a giant part of what it is to be a human

46
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,430
is removed from the equation.

47
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,970
Yeah.

48
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,520
And it just goes back to what
we talked about with Welfare.

49
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:23,721
You,

50
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:23,910
you,

51
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,040
you've got to work to get something.

52
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,150
You can't just get it.

53
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,610
There has to be a struggle
or you don't evolve.

54
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,490
And as soon as you introduce
the option of no struggle,

55
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,810
you introduced the option of,

56
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,141
you know,

57
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,970
and people think that the
struggle is over financially.

58
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,010
It's one of the reasons why
when people are successful,

59
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,791
a lot of people go,

60
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,271
oh man,

61
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,020
he sold out.

62
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,853
Um,

63
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,131
you know,

64
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:42,000
he's not hip anymore.

65
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,420
The,

66
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,580
the struggle is never financial.

67
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,270
The stroke did.

68
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,710
The best part about overcoming
the financial struggle
is now the struggle gets

69
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,150
to be about thoughts and ideas.

70
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,420
Now the struggle gets to be about creating
shit and now the struggle gets to be

71
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:59,010
about getting the center of what the fuck
this is getting to the center of what

72
00:01:59,011 --> 00:01:59,910
is this life?

73
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,070
And you can guess what
you can think about.

74
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:06,090
What is this life a whole lot more when
you're a comedian that gets to wake up

75
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,030
at one in the afternoon and it doesn't
necessarily have to do anything all day,

76
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,150
and you can sit in front of your computer
computer drinking coconut juice and

77
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,800
smoking pot and reading online.

78
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,460
You can think things through in a manner
that the average person just never get

79
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:18,040
a chance to do.

80
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
And you ever have that opportunity
to get paid for it too.

81
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,560
That's what kind of standup is
putting it into a funny light,

82
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,230
but kind of like surprising people
with where you're taking your idea.

83
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,801
Yeah,

84
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:26,520
that's what I mean.

85
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,850
Yeah,

86
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,091
it's,

87
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:27,390
it's,

88
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,400
it's putting forth something you have.

89
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,610
It's,

90
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,600
and it's gotta be hard,

91
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,020
man.

92
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,560
I write shit sometimes and I'm a
fucking gold and man this bit sucks.

93
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,060
There's something missing in this bit.

94
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,280
Like I know it's Dan but
I don't know it's there.

95
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,630
And then there's this thing that I have
just figured out how to do like over the

96
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,160
last couple of years where
I used to have a theme,

97
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:44,671
like I would say,

98
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:44,941
okay,

99
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,470
today I'm going to write about Viagra,

100
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,390
we're going to sit down and going
to write some shit about Viagra.

101
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,850
And then I would start about that
and maybe it would go in a different

102
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,271
direction,

103
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,500
but not too far off path.

104
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,890
Now I just sit down and I open
up a page and I just let it go.

105
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,360
I just get high as fuck
and I let it all go,

106
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,980
whatever crazy thought I have.

107
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,270
And then in the morning I get up sober
and then I look at what I wrote and I go,

108
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,970
what the fuck am I talking about?

109
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,800
Like some I write shit sometimes when I'm
high and I go back and read it and I'm

110
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,041
like,

111
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,620
this doesn't even seem
like it's me writing this.

112
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:17,801
Like,

113
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,850
who the fuck wrote this?

114
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,410
It makes sense sometimes.

115
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,190
Yeah,

116
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,030
sometimes.

117
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,750
Yeah.

118
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,010
Sometimes it doesn't though,

119
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,930
but that's part of,

120
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,050
that's part of the whole zone that you
get into when you're creating something

121
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,570
and you can't be afraid of looking
silly for so many years where you never,

122
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,980
you never even smoked a joint.

123
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,813
Do anything.

124
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,360
Yeah.

125
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,781
What was your,

126
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,614
what was your turn,

127
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,760
what did Stan hope gets you?

128
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,381
No,

129
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:40,631
no.

130
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,464
Eddie Bravo.

131
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,640
Eddie Bravo for sure.

132
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,474
100%.

133
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:43,931
He,

134
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:44,380
uh,

135
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,140
he was a really good at Jujitsu and uh,

136
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,650
we were hanging out together just because
we took classes together and he gave

137
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,780
me some private lessons
and tied me up and it not,

138
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,381
we,

139
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:53,591
uh,

140
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,640
I was training with this guy.

141
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,860
Other guy was taking private
lessons with his black belt.

142
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,820
It's a very nice guy.

143
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,571
He had good intentions,

144
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,130
but I could roll with him,

145
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,000
but I knew his game,

146
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:01,661
you know,

147
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,720
and you get to a certain point
where you could roll the guy like,

148
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,510
you know,

149
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,850
I could tap them out and it very rare,

150
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,200
but occasionally I can
get them with something.

151
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,020
And part of it was him like being Roland
Nice with me and real easy with me and

152
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,740
let me get things.

153
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,970
But also I knew his game.

154
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,300
Right?

155
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,100
But when you start
rolling with someone else,

156
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,030
you realize,

157
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,181
oh,

158
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,800
you got to roll with a
bunch of different people.

159
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,380
You can't just roll with one
person because Eddie Bravo
just went right through

160
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:20,531
me.

161
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,364
He just destroyed me.

162
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,950
Part of it was because he was
way better than me and really,

163
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,101
uh,

164
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,330
an amazing Jujitsu guy.

165
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,360
Like he's a genius,

166
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:27,250
a Jujitsu genius,

167
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,084
a true genius,

168
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,200
every sense of the word.

169
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,780
But it was also because I sucked.

170
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,360
I thought it was good cause I
knew how to wrestle with one guy.

171
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,560
I knew his weaknesses.

172
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,930
I was physically a little faster
than him and I can do things.

173
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,100
But then I started
rolling with other people.

174
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,970
I was getting tapped all the time.

175
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,200
I was like,

176
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,291
oh,

177
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:40,541
okay.

178
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,710
I got a joint class.

179
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:41,921
Right?

180
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,754
So anyway,

181
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,810
Eddie said,

182
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,000
you know,

183
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,700
I'd be happy to give you
some private lessons.

184
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:45,910
I said,

185
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,600
oh awesome.

186
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,470
So we went out,

187
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,131
we got some lunch,

188
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:49,060
get some private lessons,

189
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,380
and we started talking about creativity
and life and music and stuff.

190
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,230
Cause he's a musician and he said that
he writes his best stuff and he's stoned.

191
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,861
And I was like,

192
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,030
that doesn't even make sense.

193
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,580
Like you're high and you're,

194
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,670
I'm thinking when you're high.

195
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,030
I was like,

196
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,181
Oh,

197
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:01,990
you dope.

198
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,231
You know,

199
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:03,064
you'd lose her.

200
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,341
You know,

201
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:03,720
like the,

202
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,060
the,

203
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,590
the moments in my life
where I had been drunk,

204
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,060
I was embarrassed about those moments.

205
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,340
I never like look back at
a time I was struggling.

206
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,170
I can now.

207
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,330
Right.

208
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,550
You know,

209
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,871
now,

210
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:11,240
you know,

211
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,950
we'll like,

212
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,270
ah,

213
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,580
there were fucking hammered and we're
talking shit at the bar and it's fun.

214
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,260
That to me,

215
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,510
um,

216
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,880
you know,

217
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,161
I'm,

218
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:18,730
I'm in control of my shit now.

219
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:18,930
Right.

220
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,480
So what if me and Brian and
Joey Diaz do shots at the,

221
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,850
the,

222
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,310
in the green room and the Portland,

223
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,611
uh,

224
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:24,971
you know,

225
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,804
a helium.

226
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,490
I don't feel bad about that.

227
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,540
I feel like we had a good time.

228
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,081
It was crazy.

229
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,920
The next day I had a headache.

230
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,890
You know what I mean?

231
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,510
But back then I was embarrassed about
anything that I did that wasn't positive.

232
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,330
And anything that I did that
cut might make me a loser.

233
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,820
Anything that I did that my keeping.

234
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,930
Yeah.

235
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,763
Yeah.

236
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,501
So he,

237
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:41,770
uh,

238
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,970
he was so adamant about how we'd
made him like a really creative,

239
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,331
and I was like,

240
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:46,631
all right,

241
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,141
let's do this.

242
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,441
Come on,

243
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,190
pull over.

244
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,551
So,

245
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:48,821
uh,

246
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,191
we,

247
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:49,480
we,

248
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,680
we smoked pot and then we
had some ice cream and uh,

249
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,720
and it was amazing.

250
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,340
It was the greatest ice cream
I've ever had in my life.

251
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,250
And I couldn't believe that marijuana
made this cream so fucking good.

252
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:02,390
I had an ice cream Sundae with hot
fudge and it was the most incredible.

253
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,080
I,

254
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,960
the sensation of eating
the food was so heightened.

255
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,430
I felt like a fool.

256
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,560
I felt like I can't believe that all my,

257
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,700
and that started.

258
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:10,911
That was,

259
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,240
yes,

260
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,073
that was it.

261
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,710
You know,

262
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,720
it was like I was talking to him
and he's this fascinating guy.

263
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:15,981
I mean,

264
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,690
Eddie is a very fascinating guy.

265
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:18,320
He's very,

266
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,131
he's a free thinker.

267
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:20,930
He had a really hard childhood man.

268
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,640
My childhood was not,

269
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,110
my childhood was not,

270
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,460
not terrible.

271
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,260
It wasn't that it wasn't ideal.

272
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,460
I have a lot of shit happened to me.

273
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,690
I think a lot of us did,

274
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,710
all of us here did,

275
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,860
but his was horrific and because of that
he developed disability to just fuck

276
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,604
you.

277
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Like push people away,

278
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,220
like focus on his goals and
see things in a different way.

279
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,491
You know,

280
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:43,760
he had,

281
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,930
he had this ability to like,

282
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,080
he's got this ability to look at life
and break things down and a lot of times

283
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,710
when we have conversations he comes at
it from a completely different angle than

284
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,130
I do,

285
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,460
you know?

286
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,600
And I like that about you too.

287
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,830
You will often do that too.

288
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,430
And Duncan,

289
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,450
we'll do that all the time.

290
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,740
I love when people,

291
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,620
like when I have a friend that's
a close friend that's very smart,

292
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,230
that will take things in a different
way and I don't necessarily always agree

293
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:03,830
with them,

294
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,191
but it's a,

295
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,180
it's a fascinating thing.

296
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:05,810
It's almost like you,

297
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,380
if you,

298
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,350
if you value their opinion and if you
talk to them about things like you have

299
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:09,891
one more,

300
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,660
you out there interpreting,

301
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,720
interpreting the world from
another possible angle.

302
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,520
It's so important.

303
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,641
It's,

304
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:14,901
yeah.

305
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,610
And so I met him and right away I knew,

306
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:16,821
I'm like,

307
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,840
this guy is smart as fuck.

308
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,300
He's,

309
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,130
he's a Weirdo.

310
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,650
He's figured out some shit about your
Jitsu and if you can get that good at

311
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,400
Jujitsu and like you can get that at it.

312
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,210
A lot of fencing.

313
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,100
You're a bad motherfucker.

314
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,120
And he's a little guy.

315
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,571
I'll get,

316
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,470
he's not strong at all.

317
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,220
So he got really good at Jujitsu all based
on technique and leverage and he does

318
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,180
everything the right way.

319
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,160
So you,

320
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,410
you,

321
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:33,801
you,

322
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,120
you learn from a guy like that.

323
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,541
So I,

324
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,530
I met him and I was like,

325
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:36,771
okay.

326
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,600
So obviously there's
some good to this week.

327
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,070
You can't think that it's all bad.

328
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:40,810
Who,

329
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,080
who,

330
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,140
who do you think is the best?

331
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,940
Uh,

332
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,060
I couldn't believe that my whole life.

333
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:44,960
I thought it was for losers.

334
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,111
This is,

335
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,180
imagine you sitting there the
first couple of times he's like,

336
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,770
I can feel it in my hands.

337
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,613
Heady.

338
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,181
Oh yeah.

339
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:50,990
It was totally like,

340
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,890
I'm like,

341
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm a complete rookie shit.

342
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
I remember Joey Diaz.

343
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,390
I said something to Joey Diaz once.

344
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,224
He goes,

345
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,370
look at this fucking rookie.

346
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,420
Get the fuck Outta here.

347
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,190
I forget what I said to him.

348
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,530
What are some rancher ideas?

349
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,440
Some crazy,

350
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,540
some crazy rookie uh,

351
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,360
pod experience.

352
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,430
I was timid to me.

353
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,390
I was calling him like,

354
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,310
it was the most profound
thing that I ever heard.

355
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:10,760
He goes,

356
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,650
get the fuck out of here
with that rookie shit.

357
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,950
He talking to me without
getting high mother fucker.

358
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:16,790
That's what's going on.

359
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,590
Joey Diaz will break things down.

360
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,070
I'm can't get not cock sucker.

361
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,690
That's just unbelievable.

362
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,111
If you ain't,

363
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,130
I buy two in the afternoon.

364
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,150
Go Fuck Yourself.

365
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,930
There's actually a a t shirt that we
put out on hire dash [inaudible] dot com

366
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,980
sold out instantly.

367
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,000
We got new ones coming out,

368
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:32,271
folks.

369
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,104
I swear to God,

370
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,280
I got a lot more this time.

371
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,270
I'm buying as many as you can and
proceed to go to the Joey Diaz we'd fund.

372
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,750
So all the t shirt money is right now.

373
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,200
He's got a fat check come to them.

374
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,791
You'll keep him in.

375
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,624
We'd for weeks.

376
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,680
So this,

377
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,770
that tee shirt should pay for all of
Joey's weed for the rest of his life.

378
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:49,604
That's my goal.

379
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,690
If we keep,

380
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,081
you know,

381
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,620
if he makes enough money off this tee
shirt every month just to cover off his

382
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,381
weed expenses,

383
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,700
plus a few,

384
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,050
a few nice dinners here and there.

385
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,750
I think it's this fucking
winner of a shirt,

386
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:00,931
man.

387
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,764
I can't wait to wear it.

388
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,611
I don't even have one.

389
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,444
We don't even have one.

390
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,150
It says if it's based on something
you said once in the podcast,

391
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:06,870
and by the way,

392
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,920
he says all the time,

393
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,660
it wasn't just that moment.

394
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,400
He says it all the time now.

395
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,540
He says it all the time.

396
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:12,991
He says,

397
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:13,590
if you ain't hot,

398
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,951
he'll go.

399
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,540
He'll call me up sometimes
and I'll answer the phone.

400
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,230
We'll just go,

401
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,270
if you ain't I buy two in the afternoon,

402
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,860
go fuck yourself dog.

403
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,450
I am playing dog.

404
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,590
I ain't playing right now.

405
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,870
I got the banana bread from the Russians.

406
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,320
Fuck that.

407
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,890
Banana bread.

408
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,690
Banana bread is the bomb.

409
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,540
Diggity son.

410
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,590
Yeah.

411
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,500
Where does this banana
bread is to psychedelic?

412
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:31,771
Right.

413
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,300
I fucking gave me a heart attack.

414
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,590
I was blown away by your share ideas,

415
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,870
impersonations and cock sucker.

416
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,680
I can only do a couple of impressions,

417
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:38,514
but I can do them.

418
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,230
Geez,

419
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,871
that's not that good.

420
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,591
If he was in the room,

421
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,424
I could really do them.

422
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:41,940
I can.

423
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,020
I can imitate people.

424
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,780
It's okay.

425
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,613
Did you,

426
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,930
were you on Mad TV during with Matt?

427
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,843
Her was on,

428
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,150
no.

429
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,610
Oh,

430
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,300
okay.

431
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,651
There's this,

432
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:51,800
that guy we had on this show.

433
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,630
If you ever seen Ikea Heights.

434
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,231
No.

435
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:54,700
What does that,

436
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,080
it's a,

437
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,913
these guys that now,

438
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,460
this Guy Matt Rung who was also on Mad TV.

439
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,294
We had them on you,

440
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Tommy stickers and Christina show.

441
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,761
Uh,

442
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,880
but he was talking about how he was
on this thing that you can find on the

443
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:05,211
Internet.

444
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,260
It's fucking hilarious.

445
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:06,860
Where these,

446
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,780
this comedy trip goes into an Ikea.

447
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:12,620
They do like a CSI type
show in the middle of Ikea,

448
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,310
like without Ikea knowing like they
have employees or that are a part of the

449
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,490
production that will like take like
the employees of Ikea and like get them

450
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:23,240
distracted and then they'll have
like full on like gun guns and cops,

451
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:23,900
shootouts,

452
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,690
you know like in the middle of
like a bedroom in Ikea and they,

453
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:30,020
so they use Ikea as a stage for CSI.

454
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,390
It's fucking hilarious.

455
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,530
It's one of the funniest things.

456
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,170
They had to stop doing it because they
just were getting kicked out every

457
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:36,640
episode,

458
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,160
like intercompany kicks away.

459
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,280
Oh this is really cool that

460
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,890
these guys are actually doing
a TV show in a status Ikea yet.

461
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,800
And instead it's like really funny and,

462
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,270
and it's all him prompts using,

463
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,770
yes,

464
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,490
it's Ikea Heights dotcom and they're in
a kitchen now and then they're in the

465
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,683
basement.

466
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,290
That's fine as ideas where you go,

467
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,990
why the fuck didn't I think of that?

468
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,590
I know.

469
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,780
And I guess supposedly like they can't
do it anymore because they've just gotten

470
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,581
too much trouble.

471
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,890
He keep doing it changes a malt.

472
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,371
Walmart.

473
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,830
I'd say the last one they did kia heights,

474
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,803
Ikea Heights.

475
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,481
Last one they did,

476
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,880
they had like a Zombie attack
or something like that,

477
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,330
so they just had some bs.

478
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,660
But I was thinking instead of doing
it again and getting in trouble,

479
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,190
Ikea act like they move like,

480
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,730
cause like you know how like in TV
shows they moved to different cities.

481
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,290
So like Kmart,

482
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,680
Kmart Boulevard or something like that.

483
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,080
And that'd be the whole show.

484
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:30,860
But they probably,

485
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,251
we will,

486
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,900
we probably don't even need
to give them that idea.

487
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,670
They thought of that idea.

488
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,190
Must must've thought they
couldn't have said yes,

489
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,641
it's over.

490
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,720
They're kicking us out now.

491
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,620
They're going to go somewhere else.

492
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,110
[inaudible] dot com or something.

493
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,270
Ikea heights.com and the podcast we had
mad on was a your mom's house number 14

494
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,950
squad

495
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,581
on iTunes.

496
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,211
Hilarious.

497
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:47,880
Dude,

498
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,190
that's a great idea.

499
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:49,761
Every now and then,

500
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:49,971
you know,

501
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,170
one of those ideas comes along,

502
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:51,501
we'd like,

503
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,080
wow.

504
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,460
Yeah.

505
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,290
That's one of,

506
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,591
that's a,

507
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:53,861
that's a,

508
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,790
that's stellar.

509
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,653
It is.

510
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,570
That's what I love about,

511
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:58,961
you know,

512
00:11:58,961 --> 00:11:59,231
I love,

513
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,760
I love being in the comedy community
is such an interesting community,

514
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,080
you know?

515
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,241
I mean,

516
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,010
it feels weird to even say
that you're a part of it.

517
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,251
We're all,

518
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,960
we all have this weird sort of,

519
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,950
I dunno,

520
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,761
you don't,

521
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,150
you have like a weird sort of like
a humility about the business and,

522
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:13,371
you know,

523
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:13,581
it's,

524
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:13,710
it's,

525
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,000
it's a,

526
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,790
it's a weird thing to even say like,

527
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,151
yeah,

528
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:16,391
you know,

529
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm a problem freshen up comedian.

530
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,760
That's what I do.

531
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,400
It seems like it all seems like
I won't enter that discussion.

532
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,631
It's,

533
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,091
it seems,

534
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,170
it seems odd and weird.

535
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,370
Somebody said to me,

536
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:24,611
you know,

537
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,310
you're professionally funny
and my buddy Jimmy Burke said,

538
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,210
you are professionally,

539
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,320
so I'll show you is you are a pro.

540
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:29,891
And I was like,

541
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:30,221
oh boy,

542
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:30,640
that's a,

543
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,361
it's a wide,

544
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,260
so it's a weird thing.

545
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:32,441
It's,

546
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,150
it goes contrary to the idea of being,

547
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,710
or what makes you funny
in the first place.

548
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,410
But,

549
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,820
um,

550
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,200
but being a part of the community,

551
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,380
like you having people like you as
a friend and having people like,

552
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,011
you know,

553
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,240
uh,

554
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,310
nick Swardson come over and Corolla
come over and all these people that I'm

555
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:45,461
like,

556
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:45,790
wow,

557
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,260
nick Swardson's hanging out here.

558
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,221
Yeah.

559
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,890
And Adam Carolla's really sitting
there and you're really sitting there.

560
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,170
It's the fucking greatest thing ever.

561
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,730
The great,

562
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,030
the greatest community to be a
part of people who make you laugh.

563
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,893
It's true.

564
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,150
It's like a part of this
fraternity or something.

565
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:01,901
I always feel like,

566
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:02,111
you know,

567
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:02,680
boy,

568
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,320
when you've done the road and when
you've been on stage and you know,

569
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,660
so different audiences are so different.

570
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
You don't know how they're gonna respond.

571
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,881
You've got,

572
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,870
you've gone through something and we were
at the backstage of the UFC and it was

573
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:17,110
a big UFC event and it
fucking place was packed.

574
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,220
But Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly showed
up and I saw Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly

575
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,410
and I shot towards them like a slingshot.

576
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,100
Like I made a beeline to them because I
knew that's where the fun talk was going

577
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,020
to be fun.

578
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,670
You know,

579
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,780
Jimi fucking doors there
and Bobby Kelly and Kelly's,

580
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,560
I've known Bobby Kelly since
we were like 21 kills me.

581
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,810
Bobby was with Allen,

582
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,570
the monkeys and Dane Cook and that they
were an Improv troupe and I was the

583
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,210
headliner and they would open for
me and we did a bunch of those,

584
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:43,930
uh,

585
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,180
uh,

586
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,420
cuckoos a addict already comedy huts.

587
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,360
So we worked together a bunch of times
when those guys were just coming up.

588
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,040
I was like a couple of
years ahead of them,

589
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,140
but they were,

590
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,690
they were close.

591
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,170
I've been,

592
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,351
yeah,

593
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,060
I hung out with Bobby
Kelly like back in the day,

594
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:55,600
like,

595
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
so I've known him since you ain't even
know him bobbing and Dan for a long

596
00:13:58,721 --> 00:13:59,051
shore.

597
00:13:59,051 --> 00:13:59,831
I've known Dan forever.

598
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,350
I knew Dan before he ever
did stand up on his own.

599
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,400
He did it in a troop.

600
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,480
He did it in the Allen,

601
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,210
the monkeys.

602
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,630
What they would do is they
would do sketches and uh,

603
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:07,871
you know,

604
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,850
they were taking chances.

605
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,760
It was creative stuff.

606
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,330
And then they would each do stand up.

607
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,960
They would each do like five minutes
of standup and then I would go on stage

608
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:14,381
after them.

609
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:14,950
And it was like,

610
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,783
it was kind of like,

611
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,950
oh,

612
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,000
I wouldn't say like they,

613
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,600
they,

614
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,431
they were opening,

615
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,350
but it was so much different
than an opening act.

616
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,490
They had a lot of shit going on.

617
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,280
Like they did.

618
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,320
It was interesting to you guys,

619
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:23,630
man.

620
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,190
Yeah.

621
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,581
So,

622
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,414
and you know,

623
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,680
so I've known Bobby since,

624
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:27,071
like I said,

625
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,270
I was like 24,

626
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,540
you know,

627
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,980
and he was probably a couple
of years younger than me,

628
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,720
like maybe 21 crazy.

629
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,193
I see them and man,

630
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,270
it's what we were saying.

631
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:34,841
It's like these are,

632
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,290
these are like,

633
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,520
these are like soldiers.

634
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,500
They're like feller fellow,

635
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,800
a fellow travelers in this
weird world of show business.

636
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,390
I'd have a lot of pride in it.

637
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,180
I do too.

638
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,571
I was,

639
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:48,880
I did a New Year's eve show and I was
in Ontario at the Improv and it was just

640
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:49,391
packed.

641
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:49,511
And,

642
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:49,900
and,

643
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,440
um,

644
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,110
I was,

645
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,250
we were about to count off

646
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,083
the new year and I,

647
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,370
I remember just stopping and I
had the mic in my hand and I went,

648
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,480
I really meant this too.

649
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:56,781
I said,

650
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,380
you know,

651
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,000
I feel like a successful person.

652
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,250
Like I can't believe I get
to do this for a living.

653
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,911
And I said,

654
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:02,840
if I died tomorrow,

655
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,171
I got,

656
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,510
I can't complain comparatively to what,

657
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:06,950
how most people have to live their lives,

658
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,700
their treasury.

659
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,870
And I get paid to make people
laugh for two hours a night and I,

660
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,830
and I get to do whatever
I want when I want.

661
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,390
It's like the lottery.

662
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,530
It's not easy,

663
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,393
you know,

664
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,030
inventing yourself.

665
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,800
There's a lot of lot of weird shit that
goes on in the creating of material and

666
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,660
the going up there and
fucking around with it.

667
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,411
And two,

668
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:24,850
you know,

669
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,810
and it never gets easy in a way.

670
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,010
Like it really doesn't,

671
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,870
that's why it's so
satisfying when it comes out.

672
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,351
I just did it.

673
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,110
Just like we were talking about with
Welfare and the lottery and all that shit

674
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,120
with you have to have,

675
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,520
the only thing that's different
to me is relationships.

676
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,181
Relationships.

677
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,020
I want no work.

678
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,651
Yeah,

679
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,010
I agree.

680
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,200
I want friendliness and love.

681
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,783
I don't want to work.

682
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,431
That's a good point.

683
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:45,261
I don't have to work for that.

684
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,250
I want to fight all the time.

685
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,100
Like there's people that think that
you have to fight and I think that's,

686
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,150
that's a crock of shit.

687
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,080
You just got to find something like that.

688
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,240
But he a nice person and find
someone that doesn't want to fight.

689
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:53,880
Comedy.

690
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,770
Comedy is one of the things,

691
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,440
like I just did a,

692
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,120
a benefit with Garry Shandling
and Kevin Nealon and uh,

693
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,660
um,

694
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,050
uh,

695
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,150
Brad Garrett who killed me and Ray Romano.

696
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,390
What'd you guys do this at?

697
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,120
The Wilshire theaters
for children with AIDS.

698
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:05,811
And uh,

699
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,970
it was this last weekend and
we all went up and did it.

700
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,541
We all eat.

701
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,500
Did I did a half hour.

702
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:09,950
But you know,

703
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,810
the rest of the guys did
like 20 minutes and it was,

704
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,860
we just had so much fun.

705
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,850
It was so fun.

706
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,430
And it was,

707
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,691
it was,

708
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,010
everybody was a hilarious,

709
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,050
and Brad Garrett fucking kill me.

710
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,570
He's waiting for him in Long Island,

711
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,430
east side Comedy Club in
1991 killin Doris Roberts.

712
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:26,540
And she was in the audience just like,

713
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,000
well,

714
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,620
how old are you?

715
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,810
She was 91 when she did the
shelf or credit going in,

716
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,651
how are you drinking?

717
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:31,371
Are you drunk sweetie?

718
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:31,551
Yet?

719
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:31,910
You know,

720
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,170
and he was killing everybody.

721
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,460
This black woman was in the,

722
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,780
and the thing that she was really old,

723
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:36,170
it goes,

724
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,550
look at her from the civil war.

725
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:38,960
I must be so different now for you,

726
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:39,291
isn't it?

727
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:39,531
I mean,

728
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,364
killing him,

729
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,200
he was amazing.

730
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,310
Or the civil rights and
he just saw a reference,

731
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,720
but he was fucking killing the room.

732
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,470
And then we were all backstage and I,

733
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,040
and I'm letting you know,

734
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,880
Garry Shandling and,

735
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,610
and all these guys are in some ways,

736
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:49,851
you know,

737
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:50,240
big,

738
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,481
you know,

739
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,530
they've done a lot of stuff in comedy
for 2030 years and they were all talking

740
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,190
about how did they just all have
so much reverence for comedy?

741
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,540
And it's still not easy.

742
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,390
No matter what and it's still
a challenge and you're still,

743
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,620
you better respect that bitch.

744
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,380
Better respect,

745
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,360
better respect that bitch.

746
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,051
Cause if you don't,

747
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,590
you'll be up on stage realizing you didn't
respect it and eating it and it was a

748
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,440
bunch of people paid to
see you don't so true.

749
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,730
That motivates the fuck out of me.

750
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,441
Ever gets old.

751
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,460
You're gonna be on stage for an hour,

752
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,430
my friend bring the money.

753
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,080
You said that one time I did.

754
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,370
I remember long time ago,

755
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,260
this was fucking 13 years ago,

756
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,470
I did Friday nights or something that
you were emceeing and I got up and I did

757
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,940
this weird story and you were like,

758
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,200
and you were like really
comment and he said,

759
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:27,381
you know,

760
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,090
you'd do the most usual shit.

761
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:29,750
He goes,

762
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,420
but you could ever do
that shit on the road.

763
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,040
In some cities they'd be like,

764
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,140
fucking Purdue gotta bring the money.

765
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,190
If you're going to do an hour,

766
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,000
you've got to bring the money.

767
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,331
Guess what?

768
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:41,330
You gotta be fucking funny for an hour
because people lose their attention span.

769
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,880
That room gets quiet quick.

770
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,400
Even if you're a famous Michael
Richards out on the floor,

771
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,050
so people get an Andrew,

772
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,560
they're on your side for five minutes.

773
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,340
You got five,

774
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,180
maybe seven,

775
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:55,870
maybe if you're Brad Pitt
and then [inaudible] and
it just fucking tumbleweeds

776
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,741
turns the other way.

777
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,220
I hear a dog bark in the distance
and they fucking hate you.

778
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,170
It turns the other way.

779
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,680
Charlie Sheen it off stays.

780
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,640
What a surprise.

781
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,740
Monetizing his madness.

782
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:05,550
As at one of my,

783
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,450
one of my friends says,

784
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,650
that is a good way of putting it.

785
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,880
Jeremy Piven said that he goes,

786
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,500
we sanitize it was a smart guy.

787
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,413
Yup.

788
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,720
That is what it is sort of.

789
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,021
I mean,

790
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:13,770
it's also,

791
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,041
you know,

792
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,580
he's trying to figure out some way to
get the public on his side because he's

793
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,170
got some giant lawsuit coming up.

794
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,340
Crazy.

795
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,000
You think?

796
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,810
I mean,

797
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,530
winning,

798
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,340
winning,

799
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,173
winning,

800
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,883
winning.

801
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,371
He's,

802
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,204
he's uh,

803
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,560
with a goddess.

804
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,783
That's a guy.

805
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,810
Fuck.

806
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,500
That's a guy.

807
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,740
Cocaine and who just hasn't been
living in the real gain confidence.

808
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,090
That's 25 years of fame.

809
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,451
By the way,

810
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,284
in Hollywood,

811
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,440
you're an alien and Graham
rocks and winning and Warner
Brothers still has his a

812
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:43,324
speak posts.

813
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,873
Rocks.

814
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,061
Yeah.

815
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:45,960
Brian thinks it's all,

816
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,070
Brian thinks it's all a scam to make
two and a half men the biggest show ever

817
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,440
next season when he comes back
and his triumphant return,

818
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,940
he thinks it's all orchestrated.

819
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,450
The horrors banner of their show.

820
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,220
Corechange choking,

821
00:18:59,221 --> 00:18:59,641
choking,

822
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,590
porn stars almost threatening to
stab his wife winning if you got,

823
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,100
has he got a lawsuit coming?

824
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,851
Yeah,

825
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,241
he does.

826
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,910
Apparently according
to Hollywood insiders.

827
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:09,830
Oh,

828
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,130
from,

829
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:10,963
from cvs.

830
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,760
Yes.

831
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,820
Apparently it Connie dog,

832
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,621
Hollywood insiders.

833
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,860
He actually has a very good point because
the guy didn't show up for work late.

834
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,580
It wasn't like he was missing set
shoots and costing them money.

835
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,900
He was always fucked up.

836
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,610
They knew it was fucked
up from a long time ago.

837
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,730
They hired him under the premise that
he was his party animal and guess what?

838
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,170
That's what he fucking plays on the show.

839
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,780
He plays a watered down version
of the real life job chain.

840
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:31,290
Exactly.

841
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,090
It sounds like a big dick contest.

842
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:33,871
That's what it sounds like.

843
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,960
It sounds like him and that guy who was
the executive producer there waving the

844
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:41,220
dicks around and the executive producer
doesn't want this junky back on his set

845
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,180
and he wants to move on,

846
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,760
but he's going to ruin a lot
of fucking people's jobs.

847
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,870
Stay was that he was able to,

848
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,310
he could strangle a girl everything else.

849
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,450
And then he made fun of Chuck Lorre on
that radio show and that's when he got

850
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,220
fired.

851
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,980
Well that Chuck Lorre guy we talked about
on the show before about all the shows

852
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:56,820
that he's produced.

853
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,260
He produced grace under fire.

854
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,250
He proves Roseanne.

855
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,090
He produced Sibbel.

856
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,470
He had to deal with con after comment
after comment and he developed the ability

857
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,670
to put his fucking foot down.

858
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,550
You know?

859
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,310
And that's why he's so successful.

860
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,570
He's fucking good at what he does.

861
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,640
I guys got a gang of TV
shows and listen man,

862
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,630
the bottom line is Charlie Sheen was
probably very creatively unfulfilled.

863
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,110
You know,

864
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,060
and it's not to say the two and
a half men wasn't a good show,

865
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:18,421
cause one,

866
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:18,721
honestly,

867
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:19,441
I never watched it.

868
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,360
I've never seen a single episode.

869
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:21,780
Not Bad.

870
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,351
So I don't know.

871
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,540
I watched like maybe one scene once.

872
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm happy for Jon Cryer isn't
the nicest fucking human being.

873
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,800
I met him a long time ago.

874
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,090
We did a college together and um,

875
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,800
stand up.

876
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,910
I don't think he did.

877
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm pretty sure it was him.

878
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,840
It was,

879
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,270
he's about to,

880
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,410
cause he was in a movie before then.

881
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,011
I couldn't believe that.

882
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,370
I saw,

883
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,530
there was one of the first guys that
I ever saw that had been in a movie.

884
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,440
I did a standup at this college.

885
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,380
Then he did something else.

886
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,700
It was like bigger than the same college.

887
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,553
I'm pretty in pink.

888
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,801
It was something,

889
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:47,020
yeah,

890
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,660
somewhere on those.

891
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,690
I'm pretty sure it was Jon cryer long,

892
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:49,931
long,

893
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,710
long time ago.

894
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,180
But the point is that,

895
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,570
you know,

896
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,990
he would probably mean the guy was
in fucking platoon and Wall Street.

897
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,440
He was in two huge Oliver
Stone's smash movies.

898
00:20:59,441 --> 00:20:59,711
I mean,

899
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,210
and they were brilliant performances.

900
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,250
So when he's playing this silly guy and
this silly show year after year making

901
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:06,791
mad,

902
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,361
mad loot,

903
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,410
the money piles up.

904
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,070
But then the ability to break away
from the mundane becomes more and more

905
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,570
extreme.

906
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,140
It's just like the Catholic girl
that wants to suck a dick and he's,

907
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,370
he's not being challenged as a grown man.

908
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
You didn't give yourself
a fucking problem.

909
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,880
You're going to find a
way to challenge yourself.

910
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,260
You're going to create
a problem for yourself.

911
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,390
That shit happens all the time.

912
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,450
You get somebody to get to exactly what
they want and they're a little too young

913
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,130
to handle it or they get
exactly what they want.

914
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:32,290
They have no where else that they don't
have the imagination and figure out

915
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,250
where else they can grow.

916
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,930
They get in the fucking trouble.

917
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,800
Too much money,

918
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,880
no imagination,

919
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,780
and you didn't earn it.

920
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,081
You're,

921
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:38,740
you're fucking,

922
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,730
even if you did or do respect the Charlie
Sheen is trying to do is apparently

923
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:44,020
it's trying to evolve his show,

924
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,900
so he's bringing comics and
Russell Peters is going to come on.

925
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,750
He's going to tell us about
it because Russell's been,

926
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:49,570
I was in it for him.

927
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,380
He's great.

928
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,170
Someone please on Twitter
verify Russell Peters,

929
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
the Real Russell p.

930
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,413
That's him.

931
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,070
So he can't get verified.

932
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,211
Wait,

933
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:01,480
he's having guests on the show
are comics opening form comics.

934
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,130
What they do is the comics,

935
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:06,740
we'll interview him and there's video of
him interviewing Russell Peters where,

936
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,330
or Russell Peters rather interviewing
Charlie Sheen were Charlie sheen talks

937
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:14,530
about accidentally leaving his gun out
and Kelly Preston was living with him and

938
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,090
she dropped the gun and shot her.

939
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,030
It shot the toilet and it
ricocheted and hit her.

940
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,300
Yeah,

941
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,491
yeah,

942
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:19,870
yeah,

943
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,141
yeah.

944
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:20,740
She got hurt.

945
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,573
How does that happen?

946
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,940
That's,

947
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,520
you know,

948
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,640
Tracy Junkie Shit on a gun though.

949
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,290
I don't think that usually goes off.

950
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,860
Yeah,

951
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,070
it very well could have been.

952
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,250
Charlie just has good
writers for the show.

953
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,560
He,

954
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,220
they've probably learned from the mistakes
of the past that they actually have

955
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,780
to make this thing interesting because,

956
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,910
well that's what they're doing now.

957
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,390
But I mean the story's a true story,

958
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,370
but apparently who knows
how much of it's true.

959
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,350
But Russell Peters was interviewing him.

960
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:41,800
That's how it didn't.

961
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,220
Then Russel says a bunch of Lou really
funny lines in between it and just fucks

962
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:46,000
around with it.

963
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,580
And so now that sort of
become sort of a show,

964
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,450
you know,

965
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,940
but I think they need to incorporate
other things like they need to incorporate

966
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,560
music and some other shit.

967
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,610
I think I should just,

968
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,840
and I,

969
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,600
I haven't thought about Charlie
Sheen and like three weeks.

970
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:58,931
Yeah,

971
00:22:58,931 --> 00:22:59,764
but that's you.

972
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,670
That's you.

973
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,090
That's guy.

974
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,500
He's got everybody's [inaudible].

975
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,341
He's got it.

976
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,300
He's got something there.

977
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,060
If there's some sort of an
interest moves to the country,

978
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,800
he starts dragging together a show.

979
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,851
That's what I'm saying.

980
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:10,870
I mean it's kind of fascinating.

981
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,003
Who knows?

982
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,281
I mean,

983
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:12,521
look,

984
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,220
the guy that whoever the fuck
the guy is inside of him,

985
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:18,010
that was the guy that was in Wall Street
or was the guy that was in platoon.

986
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,390
That guy is a bad motherfucker.

987
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,190
And if you could find who that guy is,

988
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:21,640
you know,

989
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,260
people lose their way and regain it.

990
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,173
It happens.

991
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,880
You know?

992
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,210
And it might be through this humility
that he gets out of getting fired from his

993
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,100
fucking job and bested
in this Dick Contest.

994
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,990
What do these kind of like a
hundred million bucks or something.

995
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,280
So I don't know.

996
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,750
A lot of it might be in real estate.

997
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,261
A lot of it's,

998
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:38,740
you know,

999
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,040
a lot of,

1000
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,930
a lot of times too,

1001
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,000
when he was making more money than any
human being had ever made on a sitcom,

1002
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,070
he was making $2 million a fucking,

1003
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,303
he's definitely got mine.

1004
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,173
He's got some cash.

1005
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,810
If he doesn't,

1006
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,250
he's crate almost bought a hooker hotel.

1007
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,650
There was a train goes by,

1008
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,040
buy a house having that much money.

1009
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,830
Yeah,

1010
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,310
but that's some haterade the haterade.

1011
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,590

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,260
The Internet Gurus never heard

1014
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,890
Peter read his old dude.

1015
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,460
I bet you if you look up Charlie sheen
bankruptcy or Charlie sheen like,

1016
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,570

1018
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,810
You're hoping right now.

1019
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,270
Lucian Charlie was going broke and he

1031
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,520
running.

1032
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,353
Joe Rogan.

1033
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,860
He's very good at what he does.

1034
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,270
A poop back and forth.

1035
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,410
Good Luck Charlie.

1036

Smoke weed and stay
away from that cocaine,

1037
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,093
those highs.

1038
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,770
There's not,

1039
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,050
there's not the good blow always.

1040
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,480
Nobody ever did blow and went,

1041
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,811
yeah,

1042
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:42,531
I had all these problems.

1043
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:46,310
They did a bunch of blow and then it
fucking worked out in the history of the

1044
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:46,611
world.

1045
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:47,450
That's never been said.

1046
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:47,810
Yeah,

1047
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,650
that's not good.

1048
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,760
That stuff's bad for you.

1049
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,451
That's tough fries.

1050
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:51,290
You're fucking Noggin.

1051
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,930
Did you know Jimmy Hendrix
died when he was 27 yeah.

1052
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,370
It's not crazy to Janis Joplin.

1053
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,371
Jim Morrison,

1054
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:58,791
Morrison.

1055
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,361
Cause I've ever,

1056
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,200
I have any,

1057
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,120
any sense of delusions of grandeur.

1058
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,140
Just look at what Jimmy Hendrix compost
and it was only 27 he said no Internet

1059
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,490
Sandlin how about what that by the time
our 24 I mean like cashmere and led

1060
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:12,674
Zepplin want,

1061
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,050
they were like 2120 that's ridiculous.

1062
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,861
Ridiculous.

1063
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:16,850
Like thinking about that.

1064
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,040
They were writing fucking,

1065
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,730
they were all educated.

1066
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:21,010
They all read a shitload.

1067
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,300
Jimmy page has a whole fucking library,

1068
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,660
like a huge library of like
I'm black magic and stuff.

1069
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,350
Wow.

1070
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,570
Jimmy page's is that scholar.

1071
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,350
He,

1072
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,060
they all those guys have read a lot.

1073
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,280
I had this different station back then
had this conversation the other day with

1074
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:36,440
the lovely Brittany Palmer.

1075
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,180
She's one of the ring girls with USC.

1076
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,073
She's very nice.

1077
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,020
She's dating my buddy.

1078
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:40,610
That's Ronnie.

1079
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,210
Yeah,

1080
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,560
no,

1081
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,393
she's,

1082
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,690
she's dating my buddy Anthony now.

1083
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,940
Powerful.

1084
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,110
Your friend Anthony's
getting some of that.

1085
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,030
My buddies,

1086
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,500
my buddy,

1087
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,690
a writer and debated guy.

1088
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,450
I just saw Brittany boom.

1089
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,081
Anyway,

1090
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:55,130
she's very nice person and
she is fascinated by the
70s and the 60s and she's a

1091
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:56,150
painter and she makes all these,

1092
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,120
she's making all these different paintings
and we were having this conversation

1093
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,200
like I'm,

1094
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:00,321
I'm,

1095
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,210
I'm the same way when I listen to music,

1096
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,340
nine times out of 10 when
I'm driving in my car,

1097
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,740
I'm listening to my iPod
and it's usually like some,

1098
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,040
some like 1970 Zeplin or it's some 1970s
almond brothers or Leonard Skinner.

1099
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,210
That shit to me just resonates.

1100
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,641
You know,

1101
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,690
when I listen to old music from
like that era for whatever reason,

1102
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,230
it just resonates and I'm trying to
figure out what is it about that time?

1103
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,880
What is it about the Jimi Hendrix,

1104
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,170
what is it about Jim Morrison?

1105
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,011
What it was.

1106
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,410
It just because it was the
first of that shit was it,

1107
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,760
was it because it was the first,

1108
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,960
this giant evolutionary
breakthrough from the,

1109
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,000
it's a combination of,

1110
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,200
of a number of things.

1111
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:37,370
One is that a lot of people back then
thought their music was counted for

1112
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:37,851
something.

1113
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:38,570
In other words,

1114
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,760
they thought that their music
could actually change something.

1115
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,870
And a lot of,

1116
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,060
a lot of what happens
with artists as cynicism's

1117
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,970
at times have a certain
cynical a of stamp on them.

1118
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,890
And I think we live in
a very cynical time,

1119
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,080
the notion that nothing
you do as an individual,

1120
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,030
certainly as an artist could
change anything at all.

1121
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,800
That's very prevalent among artists.

1122
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,720
So you don't have people
who are doing standup,

1123
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:58,161
for example,

1124
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:01,050
to try to break a social norm
or shatter a social norm.

1125
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,970
You certainly don't have
a lot of musicians saying,

1126
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,210
my music is actually influenced
the political atmosphere.

1127
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:10,350
Remember it was after we had been through
in the 70s we just spin through and

1128
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,810
we're going through a
terrible war in Vietnam and,

1129
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,100
and you know how many people died?

1130
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,410
54,000 men were killed.

1131
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:20,550
That's a huge number where if you
compare the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,

1132
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,430
it would say it was 4,000
death and a lot of injuries.

1133
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:26,010
But I'm just saying that in
a very short period of time,

1134
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,630
we'd also been through a world we'd been
through a number of that were in the

1135
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,630
Cold War.

1136
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,360
We'd been to a world war two and
everybody had an act of memory of that.

1137
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,010
That shit life really counted and
mattered and people didn't live as long.

1138
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,850
There was this,

1139
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,180
there's this idea that you better hurry
up and get through it and make your

1140
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,550
fucking stamp while you
still have an opportunity.

1141
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,680
Because if you looked around and let's
take 1974 and you looked around at the

1142
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,130
world,

1143
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,500
half the world was starving to death and,

1144
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:52,861
and,

1145
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,980
and for the them and half the world with
living under communist dictatorships,

1146
00:27:55,981 --> 00:28:00,690
which was essentially slavery and half
the world was a very dangerous place.

1147
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,524
And that war,

1148
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,970
and by the way,

1149
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,020
there was an arms race called the nuclear
arms race between the Soviet Union and

1150
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:07,651
the United States.

1151
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,030
And a lot of people really were like,

1152
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:09,511
you know what,

1153
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:11,160
we could all fucking just blow up.

1154
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:15,000
The next war is going to be where the
cockroaches and the rats are the only

1155
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:15,870
things live in.

1156
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,741
And there's always,

1157
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:19,020
there was always that saying that
if there is a third World War,

1158
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,430
I think it was Einstein who said the,

1159
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,270
the living,

1160
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,600
the living,

1161
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,620
the living will yeah.

1162
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,300
And the living will envy the dead.

1163
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:27,511
Right.

1164
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:27,711
And that,

1165
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:28,201
that a whole lot,

1166
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:28,621
that idea,

1167
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,610
cause you'll be start,

1168
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:30,150
you'll be BCIT.

1169
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,040
I don't know what's going to
start the Third World War,

1170
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:32,910
what weapons would be used,

1171
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,240
but the fourth world be fought
with sticks such a great quote.

1172
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,340
But the point is that I
think when you live in,

1173
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:42,960
in times of great uncertainty and
times of great hope and times of great

1174
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,550
violence member in this country,

1175
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:46,440
we'd come off a number of assassinations.

1176
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,370
Martin Luther King,

1177
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,540
Malcolm X,

1178
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,170
John,

1179
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,010
John Kennedy,

1180
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,910
Joe Kennedy.

1181
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,990
And it goes on and on.

1182
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,350
I mean,

1183
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,940
there was this notion that we were in
a real battle and a real social battle,

1184
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,620
um,

1185
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:57,840
uh,

1186
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,070
for our souls.

1187
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,810
Man You had,

1188
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,730
you had to governments sending
young boys off to die in a war.

1189
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,920
Most people hadn't even heard of
that fucking part of the world.

1190
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,490
And there was this idea
that we're losing them.

1191
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,210
We're we gotta,

1192
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,190
we gotta get in the streets
and say something and do
something more importantly

1193
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:11,761
if we do.

1194
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,680
So Shit will change.

1195
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,280
And people were getting to hose down and
black people didn't have the vote until

1196
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,530
1964 it was only 10 years old.

1197
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,710
So when you think about
how extreme things were,

1198
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:24,544
and not only that,

1199
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,950
but how uncertain and how it was the
beginning of so many different ideas that

1200
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,790
were competing that when,

1201
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:33,990
when you get a very term but
a society in turmoil usually.

1202
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,190
And what's very positive about it is
you want to cross current of ideas.

1203
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,410
You want ideas bashing heads,

1204
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,030
like fucking rams.

1205
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,470
And,

1206
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,700
and when you have that provided
you keep the violence out of it,

1207
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,650
but there's always gonna
be a little violent.

1208
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,420
But when you have that and people who,

1209
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:48,830
who,

1210
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,730
where they're fighting for
their souls with an idea,

1211
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,010
you're going to get something
pretty fucking cool.

1212
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,671
And you're,

1213
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:58,180
and you're going to get certainly very
volatile artistic expression and a lot of

1214
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:01,450
that expression can very well
be a miles Davis who was saying,

1215
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,430
I'm a black man in America with,

1216
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,701
you know,

1217
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,220
and I still don't feel free
or whatever it might be.

1218
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,420
Or You could have,

1219
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:07,990
um,

1220
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,530
beeper.

1221
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,590
I love Bieber is candy
compared to think about it,

1222
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,660
how much music counted back then?

1223
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,230
Right?

1224
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,940
Jazz was the only place that a lot
of black people could really express

1225
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:19,301
themselves,

1226
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,010
honestly through a fucking horn.

1227
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,390
So if your heart's broken,

1228
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,200
you are the sing it or you
shoot it through a horn
because if you say otherwise,

1229
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,930
you're going to get fucking
hung or shot or arrested.

1230
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,780
That's what it was to
be black in the 1940s,

1231
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:32,201
50s,

1232
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:32,651
60s,

1233
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,030
and even the 70s for a lot of them,

1234
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,290
that's the bottom line.

1235
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,310
It goes on and on.

1236
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,780
So things were way more extreme.

1237
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:38,350
And I think,

1238
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,531
uh,

1239
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,090
in today's world where
everything's at the,

1240
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,880
at the touch of a button where
everybody has plenty to eat,

1241
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,260
even if it's not healthy food.

1242
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,280
Um,

1243
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,260
and we feel safer and I don't think,

1244
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:48,280
and I think we're cynical,

1245
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,400
I don't believe that what we do and
what we say can really change the world.

1246
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,300
And back then you did

1247
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,150
the thing is the numbers
just to many the humans now,

1248
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,020
no,

1249
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,760
I mean there's still people
that rage against the machine.

1250
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:59,470
You don't kind of believe
the same kind of shit.

1251
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,340
I think we're going to face another,

1252
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:01,590
uh,

1253
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,520
we're going to face,

1254
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,570
we're always going to face challenges
as people and as a world and those

1255
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:09,450
challenges may very well bring
into question our own survival.

1256
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,310
I don't think so for a long time.

1257
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:11,810
I don't know.

1258
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:11,980
No.

1259
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,110
What's really changed in the world?

1260
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,700
This thing run right now?

1261
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,470
The Internet?

1262
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:15,700
Yes.

1263
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,950
Is this really the big change?

1264
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:19,290
Very much the way we are right now.

1265
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,650
Our parents were never like this.

1266
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,023
These is,

1267
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,760
we're never held and it
gives more potential Joe for
the notion that all of us

1268
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:31,761
could get together and springboard into
an idea and a major shift in colleges.

1269
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,810
Something like this.

1270
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,040
Like right now live,

1271
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,240
there's 2000 people listening to us
live and this is a tiny fraction of the

1272
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:42,030
amount of people that will listen
to us over the next few months.

1273
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:42,601
You know,

1274
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,340
it's going to be hundreds
of thousands of people.

1275
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,140
And these people,

1276
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:48,090
when they start looking at the world,

1277
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:49,170
the way you're talking about it,

1278
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:49,681
the way you know,

1279
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,210
stepping back and describing and say,

1280
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:51,870
what is it?

1281
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,101
What,

1282
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:53,160
what is it to live with?

1283
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:53,641
Passion.

1284
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:53,941
What is,

1285
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:55,260
what is important in this life?

1286
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,560
What is,

1287
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,430
what is the fun?

1288
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,630
Where's the enjoyment?

1289
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,050
Where's the,

1290
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,470
where's the real true
passion in this world?

1291
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:02,490
Like what is it for you?

1292
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:03,121
What is it for you?

1293
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,450
And if you don't fucking find that
your life's not going to be fun.

1294
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,900
That's right.

1295
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,760
And if don't get saddled down by debt,

1296
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,090
don't get caught up in a lot of,

1297
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,480
but also have backing on that.

1298
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:13,860
Great Point is,

1299
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,340
is you've got to find a way
to keep yourself inspired.

1300
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,330
Yeah.

1301
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,200
Find ways.

1302
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,220
I don't care what it is,

1303
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,470
just truly be doing what you enjoy doing.

1304
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,353
You'd be

1305
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,040
stoked that those fires.

1306
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:29,220
And one of the things about standup
is the fear of bombing also gives you

1307
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:33,150
another added incentive and motivation
that I think some artists are without,

1308
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,861
you know,

1309
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:35,890
and they just produced
books are just producing,

1310
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,120
you know,

1311
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,620
they're just wait for reviews.

1312
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,150
But the fear of actual being in front
of someone when they don't like you,

1313
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,130
that's so much more intense
than a shitty review.

1314
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,020
It sure as cause you feel it right away,

1315
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:45,450
man.

1316
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:45,740
Yeah,

1317
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,250
and it's not,

1318
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,611
it was just,

1319
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:47,440
I mean look,

1320
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,620
just life is temporary and we all need
to wrap our fucking heads around that.

1321
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,150
If we all just step back,

1322
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,590
this whole world is moving on momentum
and that is our number one problem as a

1323
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:57,891
race.

1324
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:01,400
We're moving in the way that our
ancestors had been moving and we don't,

1325
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:02,870
no one ever just stops and goes,

1326
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:03,171
whoa,

1327
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:03,441
Whoa,

1328
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:03,711
whoa.

1329
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:05,870
Let's just settle down and talk this over.

1330
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,520
Let's have a 30 day summit where we all
the leaders of the world get together

1331
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,540
and try to figure out how are we going
to redesign the human race to make us all

1332
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,590
function together?

1333
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,090
How is there going to be a,

1334
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,560
a,

1335
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,220
a reasonable distribution of the natural
resources of the earth so that one

1336
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,730
country doesn't grow rich because they
have the fucking missiles and the nuclear

1337
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:27,170
bombs and that somehow or another,

1338
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,460
it's distributed amongst everyone.

1339
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,610
So we get to some sense of fairness
and all work together to make sure that

1340
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:33,410
people don't have too many fucking babies.

1341
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,170
So we don't run out of
food on this crazy rock,

1342
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,441
like,

1343
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:36,681
let's,

1344
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:36,951
let's,

1345
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,020
let's organize this thing
and let's do it together.

1346
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,040
The only way that's going to happen is
the kids that are in college right now

1347
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,600
who are listening to shit like this,

1348
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,100
who are going online and researching
the world and looking at things in a way

1349
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:50,060
that we never had the,

1350
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:50,270
uh,

1351
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,230
the ability to,

1352
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,810
and the access to information
that we never had access to.

1353
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,501
And they're,

1354
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,650
they're getting a chance to see the
world from a fresh eyes and fresh

1355
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,740
perspective and realize that
this is some weird thing.

1356
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:03,200
We're all running in the same direction,

1357
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:04,820
hoping that someone
knows where we're going.

1358
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,000
They're,

1359
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,240
they're,

1360
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,481
they're,

1361
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:07,191
they're the future.

1362
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:07,431
You,

1363
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,860
you college motherfucker
with the Bong right now.

1364
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,723
This is for you.

1365
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,873
Change the world.

1366
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,530
Just figuring out a way to sift
through all the information.

1367
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,000
There'll be some in the system right
now that will be sensitive to it and the

1368
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,240
next wave will integrate.

1369
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,090
And the next wave of people that are
trying to be politicians would be like,

1370
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:24,770
Gary Johnson will be like Ron Paul.

1371
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,670
They'll realize there's
freedom and love and,

1372
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:26,861
and,

1373
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:27,080
and,

1374
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,990
and telling the truth and really trying
to do the right thing instead of being

1375
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:32,090
some bitch to a corporation,

1376
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,180
which is the most common,

1377
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,310
most politicians are.

1378
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,410
Most politicians are little hookers there.

1379
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:40,160
Stick their ass up in the air and some
corporation comes by and drop some money

1380
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,870
and their pussy and that's what they are.

1381
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,580
And that's what we have to realize.

1382
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:43,951
We don't do.

1383
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:44,900
You don't have to be like that.

1384
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:45,890
What the fuck?

1385
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,723
Who Cares?

1386
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,900
The fear factor guy and the guy from a
hangover to telling you how to run this

1387
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:51,900
world by channeling,

1388
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,700
take notes.

1389
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,600
Take blame the weed for the
last five minutes of this rant.

1390
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,711
But it's true,

1391
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:58,011
man.

1392
00:34:58,011 --> 00:34:58,340
You know,

1393
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,020
and I hear it,

1394
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,100
and not to say that this
is why we're doing it,

1395
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:01,281
but I,

1396
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:04,040
I hear it all the time that this
podcast changes the way people think.

1397
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,001
And uh,

1398
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:05,481
I think,

1399
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:05,900
uh,

1400
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,141
you know,

1401
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,960
having a guy like you in my life has
definitely changed the way I think.

1402
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,681
And,

1403
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:10,100
um,

1404
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,820
I think,

1405
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,181
you know,

1406
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:12,170
all of us together,

1407
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,200
we help each other and I'm very happy and
very proud that we can dig and put out

1408
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:18,644
this resource,

1409
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,970
not just for entertainment,

1410
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:20,161
this,

1411
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:20,961
this podcast,

1412
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:21,590
but also,

1413
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:21,890
you know,

1414
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,860
it gives you an opportunity to hear
another point of view that you might not

1415
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,180
come in contact with in your life.

1416
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,010
I don't know too many people like you,

1417
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,520
you know,

1418
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,700
it's,

1419
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,050
and it's hard to cultivate them.

1420
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,410
I've done a real good job of trying to
keep as many interesting people in my

1421
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,820
life as possible because I think it's,

1422
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,800
it's an enriching and I love you,

1423
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,860
love conversations with you.

1424
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:39,540
We have the craziest
fucking conversations.

1425
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,930
Yeah.

1426
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,710
But we have had more on a regular basis
since I put together this podcast and we

1427
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:44,780
have the last few years.

1428
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,660
That's why I like doing it.

1429
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:46,381
That's why I call it up.

1430
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:46,611
I'm like,

1431
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,480
I want to do your podcast
so we can hang out and talk.

1432
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:48,950
We're,

1433
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,240
we're,

1434
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,521
we're,

1435
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:50,850
we're very lucky in life.

1436
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,050
But you do get busy.

1437
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,741
This is so,

1438
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:53,551
this is actually,

1439
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,320
these are great
conversations that we have.

1440
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,500
They're fucking awesome that you never
really do when you're just hanging around

1441
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,580
because a lot of it's grab ass.

1442
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,530
You just getting distracted
by a bunch of other people.

1443
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:04,530
But it's focused for forced to sit
down and focus and talk about what's

1444
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:05,700
important to you.

1445
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,320
You figure things out as you're talking.

1446
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,591
You could,

1447
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:08,880
you imagine all the people that are,

1448
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,400
if you imagine if you're standing
in front of 400,000 people,

1449
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,600
you would never be,

1450
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,910
feel so free to talk and be boring.

1451
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,350
God,

1452
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,520
you'd be terrified.

1453
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,110
I'd be by be releasing Doug.

1454
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,590
I do whatever I could and,

1455
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,500
and 4,000 people we did 50 with,

1456
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:25,860
uh,

1457
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,700
with Jimmy Norton.

1458
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:27,800
We did a crowd of 50,

1459
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,250
and it was definitely
a different experience.

1460
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,271
We're going to do more of those.

1461
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,080
We're going to do more of those.

1462
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,870
Um,

1463
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,010
uh,

1464
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,000
we got three this week.

1465
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,620
We got a red as easy tomorrow.

1466
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,240
And then we got Doug Benson on Wednesday.

1467
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:36,901
All right,

1468
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:37,530
bitches.

1469
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,790
Thank you to the fleshlight.

1470
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,610
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click
on the link and enter in the code name

1471
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:42,990
Rogan,

1472
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,990
you'll get 15% off the
number one sex toy for men.

1473
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,820
You want one?

1474
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,653
Did I ever give you one?

1475
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,281
I'll give you one.

1476
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,031
Did you use it?

1477
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,350
Did you fuck holes in it already?

1478
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,880
Subscribed to a death squad on iTunes.

1479
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,110
It's Brian Reichel,

1480
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
Aka Aka red band.

1481
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,840
He's got a whole network
of funny comedians that we
were all friends with and

1482
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:04,421
they have a,

1483
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:05,610
a bunch of different shows.

1484
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,900
Your mom's house with Thompson Gora is
particularly excellent as is the the

1485
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,450
skeptic tank with Ari Shaffir.

1486
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,330
That's fucking awesome.

1487
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:12,810
One.

1488
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,640
And then the noise show with Sam Tripoli.

1489
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,410
We have Lexi belt at night on the
nightly show and they're not there.

1490
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,330
They're really fun.

1491
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,370
And if you're looking for
some free entertainment,

1492
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,180
it's available on iTunes and on desk
squad.tv San Francisco this weekend.

1493
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:25,080
Almost sold out.

1494
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
Get on at bitches.

1495
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
Don't sleep.

1496
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,460
I got a lot of new shit.

1497
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,290
I haven't been in Edmonton.

1498
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,740
Comics come to where?

1499
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:33,210
Where's it?

1500
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,950
Edmonton and Alberta.

1501
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:35,730
Canada,

1502
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,540
which is the shit.

1503
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:36,861
So,

1504
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:37,220
uh,

1505
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,741

1506
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:38,041
Sam,

1507
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,680
Tripoli and Thompson Gore at Cobb's,

1508
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,941
I believe it's Thursday,

1509
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:42,750
Friday,

1510
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:42,750
Saturday.

1511
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,840
I think Saturday is already sold out
and most of Friday and Thursday are sold

1512
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,090
out to south Wednesday.

1513
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:48,690
How's Wednesday this Wednesday?

1514
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,100
Sal's comedy hole in La.

1515
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,670
Eight o'clock.

1516
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:50,911
Yeah.

1517
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:51,750
If you go to South County,

1518
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,441
the whole.com,

1519
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:54,360
it's very fucking sketchy place.

1520
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,400
They don't have real like,

1521
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:55,550
no,

1522
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:55,980
it's great.

1523
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,691
It's really deep.

1524
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,530
You can't like buy tickets online.

1525
00:37:58,531 --> 00:37:59,580
RSVP though.

1526
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:01,380
And there's all up and RSVP.

1527
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,740
Yeah,

1528
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,573
there's only 80 seats.

1529
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,230
It fills up and it's fun.

1530
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,910
And I can old school,

1531
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,270
New York kind of spot where
they did an alternative comedy,

1532
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:09,631
you know what I mean?

1533
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:11,100
It's a good place to fuck around.

1534
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,310
I sometimes will go on stage.

1535
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:13,960
It was just an idea there and just ramp,

1536
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,400
you know,

1537
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,510

1538
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,270
it's a really,

1539
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,590
it's only like eight or 90 people.

1540
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,370
Shazamm me too.

1541
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:19,140
I'm going to do it first.

1542
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,270
Oh No.

1543
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:21,691
My prints.

1544
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:21,831
No.

1545
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:22,664
As soon as we get out of here.

1546
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,071
All right,

1547
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:23,261

1548
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:23,881
