1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,260
Usually I have it,
but it goes away after a month or so.

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:03,970
I've had it for like four months.
Pretty solid.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,560
Ooh.
And we live Cam Haynes.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,300
Hey Dude,
buddy.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,140
I'm good.
How are you?

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm good.
Welcome to California.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,840
I know.
And that this place is amazing.

8
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,850
It's pretty bad ass,
right?

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,730
Yeah,
we did the,

10
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,310
we did the grand tour and I'm ready to 
lift.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,180
Yeah,
we're gonna.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,700
We're going to shoot first and I don't 
want you,

13
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,480
you want to have poor accuracy.
No,

14
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,090
you're,
you're whole motto of run,

15
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:28,924
lift.
Shoot.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,020
Shouldn't be chute lift,
run or shoot,

17
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:32,854
run,
lift.

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,160
I Dunno.
Do you,

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,033
do you,
you've run in the mornings and then you 

20
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:37,981
run at night too,
right?

21
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,460
Yeah.
You have a problem.

22
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

23
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,290
That's a problem.
Yeah.

24
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,430
That's too much.
Well,

25
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,370
I just fell back on that.
Moderation is for cowards.

26
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,630
So that like pretty much covers any 
psycho over doing in excess.

27
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,350
I'm like just,
he can be like,

28
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,580
no,
I'm just not a coward.

29
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,500
And what about overtraining?
Is that bullshit?

30
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,393
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,200
It's totally bullshit.
But you were saying before,

32
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,940
that's when you were 20.
You're 50 now,

33
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,774
but when you were 20,
you could never do what you can do now 

34
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,670
when you're 50 now.
So if you tried to do what you do now at

35
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,220
50 when you were 20,
wouldn't it be overtraining?

36
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,540
I'm confused.
Well,

37
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,640
I mean,
if you weren't in shape enough,

38
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,950
obviously you're in great shape.
Could you do this all the time?

39
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,053
But if you weren't sure

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,490
and you tried to keep this up like what 
you're doing right now?

41
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,780
Yeah,
no,

42
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,770
I,
I feel,

43
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,030
I dunno.
I feel good.

44
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,040
Who was here?
Jamie?

45
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,590
Somebody just walked in delivery.
Oh,

46
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,910
okay.
Um,

47
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,880
so when you were 20,
did you do anything?

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Um,
I mean,

49
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,780
I've always been active.
Right.

50
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,663
You know,
I always played sports and ran at 10 k 

51
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,404
in the summers and things like that.
So just worked out a little or 

52
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:45,710
something.
Yeah.

53
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,330
Yeah.
I just wanted to lift a little bit,

54
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:50,440
but not to the level I'm at now.
Yeah.

55
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,920
Well,
when I look at your instagram,

56
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,150
I get tired.
Yeah,

57
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,030
I do.
Because you're doing all that shit,

58
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,540
especially that shit.
You're dealing with a outlaw strength.

59
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,380
Yeah.
Eric.

60
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,213
Eric,
yeah.

61
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,870
Yeah.
I lost trength on instagram.

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,540
You guys are doing ridiculous amounts of
reps.

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,620
Yeah,
we do.

64
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,930
It's,
it's all about the reps and it's like,

65
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,700
uh,
I dunno.

66
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,583
And like I say,
your body gets used to what you ask of 

67
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:13,700
it.
You know?

68
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,580
If I would have tried to do that exact 
same thing when I was young,

69
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,601
no way.
I mean,

70
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,090
it'd be probably be so sore.
I couldn't do anything for a week.

71
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,321
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

72
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,400
Also when I was looking at,
I was like,

73
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,234
if you stopped doing this,
how long will it take before it slides 

74
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,344
off a one day?
Because when I don't work out for one 

75
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,570
day,
I'm skinny,

76
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:35,180
fat and weak.
How might no for real?

77
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,014
Like how many days,
what's the longest you've ever taken 

78
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:40,430
off?
Oh,

79
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,060
probably hunting.
Oh,

80
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,040
okay.
If I'm at home,

81
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,380
I don't,
I would never take any time off.

82
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,760
But when I'm hunting,
because that's what I'm,

83
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,930
you know,
therefore.

84
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,980
Right.
But when you're hunting,

85
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:49,814
at least you're hiking a lot of physical
activity and there's a lot going on 

86
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:55,700
there.
But I want to watch your videos,

87
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,740
those instagram videos of you guys.
Okay.

88
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:00,190
We're going to do a hundred reps of dog 
to do a hundred reps

89
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
of that.
Yeah.

90
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,103
Cause right now I told you I'm suffering
through this little tendinitis things 

91
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,970
I've been trying to fight off.
I saw,

92
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:09,670
I see all those reps and my elbow starts
hurting when I'm looking at the screen.

93
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,491
Yeah.
You know,

94
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,400
people ask me about,
my joints are about,

95
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,503
you know,
cause they're battling different things 

96
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,120
like that.
And I have no idea.

97
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:20,060
I mean I just,
I don't have,

98
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,640
I've been lucky where I don't have 
injuries.

99
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,190
You know?
I mean that's very disappointing.

100
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,053
Yeah.
I mean I,

101
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,690
you know,
my banged up a little bit,

102
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,610
but um,
you know,

103
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,444
I've talked to you before where I've had
to take an advil every day and I'm not 

104
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:36,960
anymore.

105
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,793
Well w tell that story because that's a 
crazy story and I've talked about it on 

106
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:44,670
the podcast without you being here,
but I called you after Rhonda.

107
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:49,020
Patrick did a podcast with me and she 
was telling me about the dangers of what

108
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,440
they call nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatories.

109
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,680
That's what I can profane is right.
And she was saying it,

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,750
it ruins your gut biome and then it 
actually causes inflammation.

111
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,273
And so that people that are taking advil
every day for inflammation don't even 

112
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:05,370
realize that taking all that advil 
actually is causing inflammation.

113
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,204
Right?
Yeah.

114
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,133
So you quit.

115
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,830
I quit.
And uh,

116
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,664
then I wasn't,
and I almost think it was maybe placebo 

117
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,940
a little bit because it's like not only 
did it not help after a while,

118
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,150
but it made it worse,
essentially the inflammation.

119
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,330
So after hearing that,
and you know,

120
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,270
who's ever going to question Rhonda 
Patrick,

121
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,190
and I would never,
so I'm like,

122
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,240
well,
I'd better stop that.

123
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,940
So,
um,

124
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,290
since then I haven't been taking 
anything.

125
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,750
And then I have taken,
there's this,

126
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,360
there's this,
you can get at the health food store.

127
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,010
It's called Kratom.
Oh yeah.

128
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,090
You ever heard of that?
Yeah.

129
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,560
That,
that seems to help.

130
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,310
You know,
they're trying to outlaw that stuff.

131
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,710
Apparently that's that Kratom stuff.
I had Chris Bell on the podcast,

133
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:53,711
he's doing a documentary about Kratom 
and he did that documentary bigger,

134
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:54,650
stronger,
faster.

135
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,840
And yeah,
I know who he is.

136
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,580
He brought in some guys that sell Kratom
and they were explaining what it does.

137
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:06,581
And I tried it and when I tried it,
apparently if you take it in low doses,

138
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,610
it's like almost a mild stimulant,
which is what it felt like to me.

139
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,593
But if you take it in higher doses,
it relaxes you and it's really good for 

140
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,900
pain.
And Chris has had a hip replacements.

141
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,240
What'd he say about it?
Was a positive or not positive?

142
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,060
There's no negative.
There's no downsides to it.

143
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:25,520
It's not addictive.
It's not bad for you.

144
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,660
It's a,
it's an herb.

145
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,640
It's not toxic at all.
Right.

146
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,860
So that's,
I mean if it,

147
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,370
so of course the government's trying to 
make it illegal.

148
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,950
Oh,
I,

149
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,950
you can't have stuff out there that 
actually helps.

150
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:34,784
Yeah.
They're trying to label it with fucking 

151
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,820
heroin and shit and it's just,
they're so crazy.

152
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

153
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,683
No,
it's a,

154
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,360
but I think that's helped.
But other than that,

155
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,110
I don't take any,
I mean nothing and I feel great.

156
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,240
That's crazy.
That's amazing.

157
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,970
So when you're doing all these reps,
like,

158
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:51,804
so you do and you,
you do these crazy things on like the 

159
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,610
lat pull down machine where you,
you do the whole stack,

160
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,280
right?
The goal

161
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,430
is 20 of the stack of everything.
That's fucking ridiculous.

162
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,370
So how do you not get like joint pain 
that doesn't have anything?

163
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,350
No.
So just because you do it all the time,

164
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm not sure.
Addition to it.

165
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,460
I can't make me want to do it.
I know it's,

166
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,290
but I don't want people to,
uh,

167
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,960
I mean it's taken a while to work up 
there.

168
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,801
Right.
So,

169
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,280
I mean,
I,

170
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,113
I don't want people to go and try to do 
that right out of the gate and then get 

171
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,474
hurt because that's what I think that's 
what frustrates people more than 

172
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,224
anything is when they're excited to make
a change of lifestyle change and then 

173
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,060
they,
something happens and then,

174
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,973
you know,
they get hurt.

175
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,240
Yeah.
I was doing chin ups,

176
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,313
um,
three or four times a week I decided I 

177
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,400
was going to do 50 chin ups,
uh,

178
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,250
at least three or four times a week.

179
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,200
Just,
just make sure I did them all the time.

180
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,080
And then on top of that I was doing 
heavy cleans,

181
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,990
90 pound cleans with kettlebells,
cleans and presses.

182
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,900
I started getting this whole nagging 
elbow pain.

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,060
Yeah.
And I didn't want to be a pussy,

184
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,220
so I kept working out through it.
Yeah.

185
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,930
It would be fine.
Like,

186
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,150
um,
during the workout it'd be fine.

187
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,190
Like it would start to hurt at the 
beginning of the workout,

188
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,010
but then once the blood would get flown,
then it would be fine.

189
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,980
And then after a couple of weeks of 
that,

190
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,300
it my,
my arms like,

191
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,320
Hey,
fuck head.

192
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,060
Yeah,
this is enough of this.

193
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,890
Yeah.
Cleans their tough though,

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,060
you know,
things are hard.

195
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,930
I mean,
I,

196
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,300
I know,
I know what I can get away with.

197
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,000
Um,
I don't do dead lifts,

198
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,230
you know,
I used to do dead lifts.

199
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,280
I used to do all this stuff.

200
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,380
Now I'm like,
you know,

201
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,263
even though I want to do,
I want to maybe every once in a while 

202
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,770
tried dead lift and cause I know it 
feels good.

203
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,260
I mean my hamstrings feel good,
my back feels strong when you're all,

204
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,180
everything works right.
But I just know that it's just,

205
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,380
it's just not smart because there's a 
high possibility that the chick,

206
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,750
you go sell something,
something gets tweaked in the bottom and

207
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,110
then you know,
it's one side and then it's,

208
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,410
you know,
I feel it down my leg and I'm like not,

209
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,600
I don't want to be that.
You're taking that hundred 30 pound rock

210
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,480
and throw it in a backpack.
Going up mountains with that.

211
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
You still doing that?
No,

212
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,230
it's gone.
My rocks gone.

213
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,951
What happened?
The Rock,

214
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,784
I don't know.
Somebody stole it I guess so you will 

215
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,870
even in the same spot,
roller it off the side of the mountain.

216
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,490
There's some due to probably jerks off 
on that rock and away.

217
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,440
This is Kim Haines.
Rough sounds fun.

218
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,970
I wouldn't be surprised.
I've seen a lot of things online.

219
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,590
Oh yeah.
There's some,

220
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,750
there's some great people and there's 
some crazy people.

221
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,560
Oh this is mostly great people.
Yeah,

222
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,394
for sure.
I find that my interactions online or 

223
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,780
almost mostly positive,
the fuck.

224
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Like by far the problem is that's like 
having mostly non poisonous food.

225
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

226
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,800
A little bit of poison enough.
Oh,

227
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,634
you'd have to do is go to this 
restaurant one out of 10 times they 

228
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,184
fucking poison.
You'd never go back to that restaurant 

229
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,194
and yeah,
I don't even think it's one out of 10 I 

230
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,070
think that the interactions that I have 
online that are negative,

231
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:48,530
it's not even one out of 100 now.
I don't think so.

232
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,030
Those,
for me,

233
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,940
those are the ones that I am drawn to 
and I find myself,

234
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,520
I see the negative,
I go pass all these positive

235
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,710
and then I'll say something because I 
just,

236
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,544
if I'm in a bad mood after a whole day 
of getting beat down by stupid comments 

237
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,930
and I'll have to do something and then 
I'll be like,

238
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,453
why did I,
so then I go back and like try to 

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,440
acknowledge some positive ones because I
feel guilty.

240
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,503
Well,
I saw you post a picture of a bear that 

241
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,800
you shot the other day.
It was a video of a berry shot.

242
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,634
And I said,
Ooh,

243
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,050
I looked at those comments.
I'm like,

244
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,530
here we go.
Which one was,

245
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,930
it was a you,
you,

246
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,210
you shot a bear and you were opening its
mouth.

247
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,760
The children's teeth.
Oh,

248
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,520
ah,
yeah,

249
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,191
yeah,
yeah,

250
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:32,070
for sure.
And I saw that video and I was like,

251
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,900
Whoa,
that's a landmine right there.

252
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,930
I know bear,
you know,

253
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,560
bears crazy.
It is.

254
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,723
That is the,
the one animal that I think people have 

255
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,920
the most distorted perceptions up cause 
it teddy bears.

256
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,783
Because Yogi and because I really want 
to take anybody who has these weird 

257
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,240
thoughts about bears,
I just really want to bring them to John

258
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,850
and John's place in Alberta.
And I want to say,

259
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,150
why don't you are going to come hang 
around and if we're lucky we're going to

260
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:01,260
see a bear tear apart a baby bear.
Because they do that every day.

261
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,153
All the time.
They get up out of their dens and they 

262
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,570
go looking for baby bears.
Yeah.

263
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,520
And then maybe if we're lucky,
we'll see a bear get ahold of a fawn and

264
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,060
it'll be crying and it'll eat,
eat,

265
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,550
eat,
eat that thing alive.

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
They'll have a different,
they'll have a different take on it.

267
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,750
They'll be like,
kill that.

268
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,030
Yeah.
Or just people are nuts.

269
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,080
They're trying to bring wolves into 
California or Colorado Rather.

270
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,310
We're talking about bringing wolves into
Colorado.

271
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,151
Like,
okay,

272
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,860
listen folks,
you don't have to do that.

273
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,630
You don't,
you already have bears.

274
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,400
You know,
I saw this the other day.

275
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:30,234
I think I've put up,
I think it was what inspired me to put 

276
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,964
up there was a wolf video I posted.
There's some great wildlife videos out 

277
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,111
there.
Oh,

278
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:37,820
it's crazy now.
Right?

279
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,180
Um,
great.

280
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,080
Not,
not,

281
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,720
they can be emotional.
Like with that bear kill on the,

282
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,570
the delcath was crying.
That was really,

283
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,600
I don't even like to see that.
I mean I'm a hunter,

284
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,434
but,
uh,

285
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,160
there's one or these wolves were chasing
down this calwell elk.

286
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,260
And you know,
that's not a quick process.

287
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,213
And I put that up because I had seen a 
couple of celebrities and I don't even 

288
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,910
know who the hell they are.
Movie Stars I think or something.

289
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,120
But they're saved the wolf fond or some 
wolf bullshit and they're like Halloween

290
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,690
there to humans and they were howling 
like they were wolves.

291
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,300
Woof.
And it's like,

292
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,273
I dunno,
I mean wolves are great wills or I had 

293
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,140
wolves or one of my favorite animals,
you know,

294
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,720
called the Wild White Fang.
Those books.

295
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,030
I love those Jack London books when I 
was young.

296
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,970
So wolves have always held a special 
place in my heart,

297
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,460
but if they're straight killers.
Yeah.

298
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,930
So I mean I'm not hating on him for 
doing that,

299
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,780
but you just can't have wolves running 
around everywhere.

300
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,650
We can't,
you can understand right.

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,330
In my neighborhood,
yeah.

302
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,970
I was uh,
at home the other,

303
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,290
I made a recording of this cause I was 
at home.

304
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,124
My dogs are barking like crazy.
It's like nine o'clock at night just 

305
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,760
wow.
It's like what the fuck is going on?

306
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,910
And I step outside and these coyotes are
like a half a block away from my house.

307
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,020
Just scream,

308
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,933
man.

309
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,300
Those are wolves.
Those are little wools.

310
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,290
Yeah.
And they got ahold of something and then

311
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:14,291
celebrating some dude sent me a video 
that's on his page of a,

312
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,600
it's a compilation of all these videos 
from security cameras of coyotes killing

313
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,680
cats and dogs.
Yeah,

314
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
yeah.
Those are wolves.

315
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,750
That's what they do.
Those are the little bulbs.

316
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,190
That's all they are.
They can breed with wolves.

317
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,840
I mean,
they literally are wolves.

318
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,063
It's a it,
it's a fascinating thing that the 

319
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,690
disconnect that people have with 
predators,

320
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,580
you know,
and I look,

321
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,880
if I was in Idaho or Montana and I saw 
wolves,

322
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,200
I'd be pumped.
I think.

323
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:43,034
I would think it would be awesome.
But he got to keep an eye on those 

324
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,390
things,
folks.

325
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,223
Yeah.
You know,

326
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,103
there's a reason why they killed him off
150 years ago and it wasn't because 

327
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,380
they're awesome.
It's because they will kill people.

328
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,050
They will kill your kids.
They will kill your dog.

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,610
They will.
They will.

330
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,271
They,
they.

331
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:00,104
I've seen wolves in the wild.
I saw a pack on Prince of Wales Island 

332
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,330
one time.
They came down to the,

333
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,250
to the water once.
And I've seen him,

334
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,084
I had a wolf tag actually when I was in 
British Columbia hunting buffalo and I 

335
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:13,710
thought it was going to get a,
a shot at a wolf,

336
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,900
um,
up there.

337
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:15,734
But I never have,
but they give tags up there because 

338
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,570
they're trying to diminish the 
population.

339
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,720
Yeah.
I mean they have too many.

340
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,700
It's 50 bucks.
It's the same as in Alberta.

341
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,350
I mean,
you,

342
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,183
you would get our bear tags to go when 
we go up there to John and gins and you 

343
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,490
know,
$50 for a wolf tag also.

344
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,180
So it's not like there's a low number of
wolves,

345
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,490
you know,
but every time I've seen him,

346
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,560
I have been in a certain amount of awe 
just because had been like this,

347
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
this amazing animal for my entire life.

348
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,513
And I've just,
it's hard not to look at a wolf and not 

349
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,550
think regal and wild and,
and you know,

350
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,220
there's that saying that,
um,

351
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,303
you know,
you'll see bears and lions in the 

352
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,340
circus,
but you'll never see a wolf.

353
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,450
You know,
they're just,

354
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,380
and I did the commercial with the wolf 
to was amazing,

355
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,573
but uh,
well then under armor commercial you 

356
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:03,404
told him it was pretty crazy because 
they had this scene where the wolf 

357
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:09,970
snarls and they had a save that scene 
for the very end.

358
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,300
Yeah.
Because it was,

359
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,960
they said it was supposed to be me 
against a wolf going after this hill.

360
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
And then I ended up winning that little,
the story as it was told and um,

361
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,350
they needed to get to wolf snarling.
And so they brought some meat out,

362
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:28,880
gave it some meat,
but they said,

363
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,400
well,
actually gave it then took it away.

364
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,530
And obviously that's going to make any 
animal upset,

365
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,930
especially a wolf.
But they said,

366
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:39,260
once we do that,
we're done with the wolf because it's,

367
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,330
it's not going to just snap out of it 
and it's just going to,

368
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,430
that's going to be it's mindset for a 
while about it's not going to be happy.

369
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,570
Yeah,
there it is.

370
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,910
Yeah.
Go back to that.

371
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,150
I think it shows that end.
It should.

372
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

373
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,503
And that was actually,
I mean people thought that that was 

374
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,560
edited and,
and it wasn't,

375
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,753
you know,
right there with me knowledge right 

376
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,160
there with me.
Um,

377
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,143
you know,
they did a great job of putting that 

378
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,650
commercial together.
Uh,

379
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:11,060
it wasn't necessarily snarling up me or 
growling at me,

380
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,320
but it was there.
It was,

381
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,480
it was fun.
That was a big was at wolf.

382
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,570
I think it was about 130 pounds.
I mean he's tall that,

383
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,404
that's a big,
that's what surprised me is how tall 

384
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,060
they are.
Long legs.

385
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:23,571
Right.
Yeah.

386
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,560
And I think,
you know,

387
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,140
we were talking about earlier,
as far as endurance goes,

388
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:27,974
wolves I believe are the number one 
animal out there as far as they can run 

389
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,550
miles and miles and miles and they're 
tall and they can just,

390
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,840
you know,
their gate is uh,

391
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,813
you know,
whatever it allows them to go for hours 

392
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,100
and miles.

393
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,780
Yeah.
I was talking about running with my dog,

394
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,673
you know,
and he's only a year old and he's in 

395
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:48,140
such good shape now cause he runs with 
me all the time.

396
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,720
Yeah.
See if we run two miles,

397
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,940
I run two miles,
he runs seven or eight.

398
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,774
Right.
Cause he's running over and back and up 

399
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:58,610
and back and up and back and yeah,
but it's amazing.

400
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,160
Like what,
how good a shape they're in right out of

401
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,110
the box.
Yeah.

402
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,073
I mean,
he's a fucking puppy and he just books 

403
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,230
it up that hill.
Just,

404
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,300
yeah.
He turns around and looks at me like,

405
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,500
come on bitch.
I know.

406
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,390
And he comes running back to me.
Yeah.

407
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,000
Animals,

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
you know,
uh,

409
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:16,980
animals pretty much have the advantage 
over us on everything other than,

410
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,371
you know,
the,

411
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,330
I mean,
they're stronger,

412
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,390
stronger jaws.
Uh,

413
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,890
you know,
the Ma,

414
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,880
you're their muscles stronger for what 
they have.

415
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,800
Um,
we have an endurance as a advantage over

416
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,080
most animals,
like elk.

417
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,243
But,
uh,

418
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,290
luckily we have,
you know,

419
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,280
we can use our minds.

420
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,160
Well,
that is the reason why we're so weak.

421
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,503
You know,
it's so fascinating how things balance 

422
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,010
out.
It's like the US using our mind,

423
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,730
creating houses and cities and cars and 
just sitting in a chair all day.

424
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,173
It makes you soft,
but then you figured out how to make a 

425
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,270
gun.
Yeah.

426
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,490
And that balances everything out.
Yeah.

427
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,630
Unless the gun jams and then nature 
comes back into play.

428
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,910
Yeah,
yeah,

429
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,420
yeah.
All these people that are,

430
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,820
you know,
into the wolf,

431
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,470
you know,
save the wolf,

432
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,540
the wolves.
Okay.

433
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,653
Like you guys go to Idaho,
like people are freaking out up there 

434
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,270
like the wolves are okay.
Oh,

435
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,133
like they,
they're,

436
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,590
they're starting to,
you know,

437
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,760
you go to,
um,

438
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,133
Alaska.
I was in a park city recently in Utah 

439
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,660
and uh,
when I was there,

440
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,321
they,
uh,

441
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,930
we went to a store that had a wolf rug 
and I was like,

442
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,900
Jesus,
I'm like yourself selling a wolf rug.

443
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,790
And the guy explained to me,
he said,

444
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,653
well,
these wolves are all shot by the 

445
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,450
government in Alaska because they're 
overpopulated.

446
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,284
So they're in these areas where they're 
trying to protect the Moose population 

447
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,411
for these,
uh,

448
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,244
the indigenous people that are so 
subsistence hunters and live up there 

449
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,800
and they have like a certain quota.
And he's like,

450
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,340
so it's actually

451
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,173
like,
it's a good thing to sell these rugs 

452
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,390
because they're going to shoot these 
wolves no matter what.

453
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,280
They're trying to keep the populations 
in check.

454
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,383
And I think that's,
that's something that these people that 

455
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,220
have the pictures see that problem of 
like celebrities,

456
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,563
missoula.
They probably didn't think that shit 

457
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,664
through it all.
They just think this is a cool thing to 

458
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,124
be a part.
Of course everybody wants wolves to 

459
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,554
live.
I'll just go and say we've got to 

460
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,530
support the wolf,
we've got to save the wolf.

461
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,770
And so it's like,
it looks like a cool thing for you to be

462
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,210
a part of.
I think one of them was,

463
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,930
would have been Lisa Bonet Aa isn't,
she's like kind of a hippie.

464
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,400
Right?
She's a super hippie.

465
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,540
Yeah.
She's got a nose ring.

466
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,680
Yeah.
Everything.

467
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,870
She's always,
she's pretty,

468
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,340
I remember that.
But yeah,

469
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,183
remember it's in a find that bill cosby 
was mad at her cause she was naked in a 

470
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,104
movie.

471
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,640
Remember she was naked and Angel Heart 
had mickey work and he was mad at that.

472
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,150
Huh?
Who's mad at that net?

473
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,160
Funny.
Yeah.

474
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,880
Funny how things work out.
It's ironical.

475
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,260
Yeah.
It is ironical.

476
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,780
I mean,
I look,

477
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,300
I dunno,
I think wolves are awesome.

478
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,160
Don't get me wrong folks.
Just,

479
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,110
I just don't think,
and this is,

480
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,170
this was me too,
before I started hunting for,

481
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,510
I started taking regular trips into the 
woods.

482
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,890
You know,
you don't get it.

483
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,510
You just don't get it.
You got to go there.

484
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,100
You do.
If you don't go there,

485
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,660
you don't get it.
Yeah.

486
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,281
You know,
it's,

487
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,750
uh,
we try to tell the story,

488
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,300
we're telling the story and it's getting
through to some people.

489
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,230
I mean,
I can see it,

490
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:15,810
I can see the,
there's education there.

491
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:16,644
I mean,
and I'm sure you get messages every day 

492
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,640
from people who have never hunted,
who are interested in it,

493
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,500
who just want to know what the lifestyle
is.

494
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,333
Because we,
we've sort of romanticize the lifestyle 

495
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:26,904
and,
and it's,

496
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,900
and it's easy to do because it's the 
mountains and the mountains are,

497
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,090
you know,
you get that connection and you get that

498
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,730
empowerment.
Um,

499
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,873
so I,
I think we are kind of turning the tide 

500
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:38,814
a little bit.
I got a message from a guy a while back 

501
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:45,510
maybe four or five months ago,
who was a Vegan for a long time,

502
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,100
started listening to the podcast at 
first,

503
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,910
was upset about the talk about hunting,
ran into some health issues.

504
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,450
His doctor recommended.
He started eating animal products again,

505
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,633
started with eggs,
worked his way back up to meet eight 

506
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,090
meet again.
It was getting,

507
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,000
you know,
healthy grass fed,

508
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,950
uh,
you know,

509
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,280
ethically sustained animals,
ethically raised animals,

510
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,000
decided to go hunting,
became a hunter,

511
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,510
shot his first deer,
ate as far as deer and now he's going to

512
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:15,990
be a hunter.

513
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,300
Yeah.
I mean this guy went full circle,

514
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,550
right.
And part of the journey of him going for

515
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,413
full circle was listening to people talk
about it on the podcast and realizing 

516
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,973
this idea that he had in his head that 
these people that are out there hunting 

517
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:29,514
are all people that hate animals and 
they're cruel and they're just rednecks 

518
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,774
that are going out there drinking beer 
and shooting these animals and laughing 

519
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,110
and hooting and hollering about it.
Yeah.

520
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,293
You know,
well there's a couple of points I want 

521
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,664
to make there.
One of them is your podcast has been 

522
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,920
amazing for the education part.
And I

523
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,090
mentioned this,
uh,

524
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,030
Adam and I did a podcast at the gritty 
bowman and,

525
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,020
um,
I said,

526
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,430
you know,
Joe's podcast,

527
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,440
just because the,
the type of person Joe is,

528
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,140
is as far as being open minded,
um,

529
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,690
and giving everything a chance,
not,

530
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:04,480
not coming in with biases or the same 
type of listeners you have,

531
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,660
you've kind of cultivated or,
or you know,

532
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,660
they,
they like you because I don't know,

533
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:12,310
they see themselves in you may be,
but anyway,

534
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,750
so those people have come in and listen 
to these podcasts like this without that

535
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:17,584
bias.
And when you listen to it and listened 

536
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,900
to us talk about it,
it's not the Redneck,

537
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,913
you know,
laughing cause they're killing things 

538
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,610
person.
They may have thought it's,

539
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:28,630
you know,
this whole thing,

540
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,464
this whole thing we talk about.
And so this podcast in particular is I 

541
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,724
think been a huge tool as far as 
promoting hunting and ethical hunting 

542
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:41,080
and um,
just the empowerment of being a hunter.

543
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,480
And so that,
I don't know,

544
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,970
just,
just this venue.

545
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,013
I Dunno.
I Dunno if we could ever done that 

546
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,810
without,
you know,

547
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
the Joe Rogan podcast.
It's been amazing.

548
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,460
Um,
I dunno,

549
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,250
have you noticed that?
I mean with,

550
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,720
with other things besides hunting?
Um,

551
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,960
I think floating,
uh,

552
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,910
that's a big thing.
Yeah.

553
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,420
Sensory deprivation tanks that that 
business was going under.

554
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,720
There was virtually no tank centers in 
the world.

555
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:10,554
There was a,
like one of them in Burbank and I had 

556
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,630
heard one of them was in San Francisco.
They're just,

557
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,790
they were hard to find.
There was none in New York.

558
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,540
Like one guy had one in an apartment in 
New York that you could rent out.

559
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,750
A guy had one like that in his house in 
Vegas that you could rent out.

560
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:28,170
There was none.
And now there's hundreds of data centers

561
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:30,210
all over the world and we've been using 
the form.

562
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,850
Dude,
I got one in 2002.

563
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,553
I bought a house,
the house had a basement and I bought 

564
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,690
the house with the basement just being 
for two reasons.

565
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,700
One.
Um,

566
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,080
because,
uh,

567
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:47,070
I wanted to put a tank in there and two,
because the yard was big so I could have

568
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:48,450
my dogs running around the yard.

569
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,333
Yeah.
Just wanted to have a yard with the 

570
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:51,160
dogs,
could run around.

571
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,550
Those are my two requirements for house.
Everything else was like,

572
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,720
I really don't give a shit about it.
And as long as there's the TV sits there

573
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,370
and okay,
here's where the bed goes.

574
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,470
I'm a man,
you know,

575
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:01,304
I don't know.
It's things that are living in deal 

576
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,310
sweat when it comes to houses.
That dude's just don't sweat.

577
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,660
But for me,
a big one was,

578
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:07,494
I tried to tank a couple of times at 
this place called soothing solutions in 

579
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,514
Burbank.
I don't even know if it's around 

580
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:13,830
anymore,
but um,

581
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,260
and then,
uh,

582
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,093
I put a tank in my basement and then I 
started ranting and raving about it and 

583
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:22,380
doing these youtube videos about it.
And then I got a new tank from the float

584
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:25,020
lab,
so I gave my old tank away online.

585
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,090
It had like a raffle,
not raffle,

586
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,830
but like a random draw.
I said,

587
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,753
just send me an email.
I gave an email address out and I'll 

588
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:32,664
just pick a random person.
So I literally just scroll through my 

589
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:35,994
email.
I'm like bank right there and pick this 

590
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:38,634
guy out and set my tank to him and had 
it set up and sent the salt down to 

591
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,583
them,
the little deal.

592
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,930
And then,
um,

593
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,813
that alone,
just having that contest and given away 

594
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:47,930
a tank.
Yeah.

595
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,003
And then putting together this video for
the tank at red band put together this 

596
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:55,250
really cool video about it.
So these tank centers,

597
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,750
because we talking about it on the 
podcast,

598
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:57,584
started opening up all over the world to
the point where now when you sign up at 

599
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,780
a lot of tank centers,
the first time you go there they say,

600
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,450
how'd you hear about us?
Whether it was through the Internet,

601
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,310
through books or Joe Rogan,
like I'm one of their,

602
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,520
one of the,
I'm one of the options on a lot of their

603
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,354
questionnaires and that,
that probably has had even more of an 

604
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:16,190
impact than,
than hunting.

605
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,673
Well,
it's,

606
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,910
you know,
it's amazing.

607
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:20,470
I,
I hear it all the time.

608
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,880
Well people have told me,
uh,

609
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,790
you wouldn't be anything without Joe 
Rogan.

610
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,380
That's,
that's some comments that I've gotten.

611
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,843
Go again,
you're concentrating on the negative 

612
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,351
ones.
I know,

613
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,450
but I wouldn't be bow on it if it wasn't
for you.

614
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,523
So there you go.
Well I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for 

615
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:37,010
that.
I wouldn't be the me that I am now.

616
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,780
So there you go.

617
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,020
Okay.
Well I put it cause I was like,

618
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,280
God,
I know.

619
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,130
I don't know.
I think we've talked about it before,

620
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:50,131
but this podcast gets to more,
more people than CNN.

621
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,130
Is that right?
Oh yeah,

622
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,053
yeah,
for sure.

623
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,013
So it's,
and I heard a Jordan Peterson talking 

624
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,570
about we don lemon.
That's good.

625
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,200
That's good.
Cause I,

626
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:04,200
I I trust this more than CNN.
CNN,

627
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,073
Oh,
you're a redneck.

628
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,110
You're on that Fox news tip.
Oh,

629
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,530
Fox News.
Now that's where you get your news solid

630
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,540
reporting.
That is legit.

631
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,160
That's Sean Hannity,
that guy.

632
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:17,050
I trust him with everything.
Yep,

633
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,450
I hear Ya.
But,

634
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:19,841
uh,
so,

635
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:20,674
and I heard Jordan,
you were talking about his recent 

636
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,610
trajectory.
I mean,

637
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,010
he's been,
I,

638
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,850
I'm assuming you've been brilliant in 
his whole life.

639
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,253
Well,
in the last 18 months or two years or 

640
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:31,234
whatever.
And I think a lot of that is because of 

641
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,260
here.
So I put in my phone,

642
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:36,094
I was like,
I'm going to do some research on Joe 

643
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,880
Rogan before this.
I'm going to turn the tables on him,

644
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,960
I'm going to podcast him.
So I was like putting it in there,

645
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,200
Joe Rogan influence or Joe Rogan,
uh,

646
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,870
um,
a fact or whatever.

647
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,820
And uh,
I couldn't find anything.

648
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:52,660
So I think,
I think,

649
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,920
I think I need to write something to 
quantify that,

650
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,780
but,
but yeah,

651
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,643
this gets to so many,

652
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,110
it gets so a lot of people,
but in all honesty,

653
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,400
like just being,
not,

654
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:04,234
not even just trying to be humble,
but all I'm doing is talking about shit 

655
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,400
that's out there.
It's real simple.

656
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,080
It's like I'm not really doing anything 
unusual other than that,

657
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:17,440
just being open minded,
which I try very hard to do.

658
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,413
I have,
when you say you just do this and just 

659
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,820
do that,
nobody else does that.

660
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,650
They come in with these biases.
You know,

661
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:25,390
so you say that's a problem.
Yeah.

662
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,250
You say you just do that.
That's a big thing.

663
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,210
I think people need to stop doing that.
I think that's a big part of the problem

664
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:33,910
we have in this world.
And I was talking with,

665
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,020
uh,
uh,

666
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,200
Dan Harris from good morning America.
That's what he's on,

667
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:40,690
right?
Yeah.

668
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,970
Um,
and he was,

669
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,960
he used a word that,
I love a term that I love.

670
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,790
Toxic tribalism.
Yeah.

671
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,200
You know,
so I mean,

672
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,034
you see that with CNN versus Fox News.
It's like neither one of them want to 

673
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,514
look at things subjectively.
Fox News has a very clear right wing 

674
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,063
bias.
CNN has a very clear left wing bias and 

675
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,780
they just go to war with each other.
Right.

676
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,840
And then the president's call and 
everybody fake news and you know,

677
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,550
it's,
it's hard to,

678
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,590
to see what's really going on.
People want to look at their side,

679
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,110
they want to defend their side and they 
never want to say,

680
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,490
okay,
I see this guy's point.

681
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,383
Yeah.
But you gotta be able to see people's 

682
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,010
points.
I mean,

683
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,610
that's one thing that I always say about
vegans after I make fun of them.

684
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,773
I say I s I understand why you would 
want to do that and I think it's a 

685
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,050
compassionate choice.
I get it.

686
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,060
I totally understand.
But I do and I,

687
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,943
I support their decision.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

688
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:34,914
with it.
I think you should be real careful with 

689
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,550
your health if you're doing that though.
And I'm not bullshitting.

690
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:43,110
This is not me being facetious or yeah,
I'm not being a meathead.

691
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,153
You should be careful with your health.
There's a lot of things that you should 

692
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:48,150
probably check.
B 12 is a big one.

693
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:50,710
That's a huge issue with vegans is a,
b,

694
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,520
12 deficiencies.
And I think if you,

695
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,383
if you are a Vegan,
you should consider supplementing with 

696
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:58,020
things that you don't have a problem 
with eating.

697
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:02,590
Like maybe even some cricket protein or 
mollusks like cell shelf.

698
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:04,830
If people should look into shellfish,
shellfish.

699
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,130
Not only is it are they sustainable,
but they're so primitive.

700
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,830
They don't even have like a,
a neurological system.

701
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,600
Like they don't feel any fucking pain.

702
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,070
Like,
you could eat clams all day long.

703
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,420
They don't know what the fuck is going 
on.

704
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,433
This is,
we have this idea about clams because 

705
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:21,220
they do that cause they close that 
somehow now.

706
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,083
Oh,
the poor little thing is just trying to 

707
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,140
hide like that,
that in there,

708
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,610
the oysters.
Oh,

709
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,100
okay.
I didn't know anything about it either.

710
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,160
I know about bow hunting.
Yes you do.

711
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,320
Yes you do.
But to me,

712
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,840
um,
meat tastes better.

713
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,270
Yeah.
You feel better to know.

714
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:41,080
But as you were saying,
yeah,

715
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,250
I don't have a problem with vegans or 
their diet or,

716
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,630
and I understand,
I mean,

717
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,000
you know,
if you think about,

718
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,580
um,
killing an animal,

719
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,280
nobody wants to kill animals.
Right?

720
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,270
I mean,
that's not,

721
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,330
I dunno,
that's never,

722
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,020
he didn't want to kill an animal for no 
reason.

723
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,913
No.
You want the meat of the animal and 

724
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,900
killing it and just not enjoyable.

725
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,830
You know,
it's,

726
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:07,650
it's part of the process.
Weird sense of loss,

727
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:08,180
right?
Yeah.

728
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,810
Yeah.
So I get that.

729
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,471
They're like,
well,

730
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:12,450
I don't want to,
I don't want to kill any animals.

731
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,980
I get it.
That's fine.

732
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,210
Yeah.
But yeah,

733
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,370
just having that,
you know,

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,620
the biases that come with it or is what 
causes problems?

735
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,463
Well,
there they're doing what they think is 

736
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:27,120
good to shame.
People who eat meat or attack people who

737
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:27,954
eat meat and especially attack people 
actively go out and kill the animals 

738
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,764
themselves because they think that 
somehow or another it will lessen the 

739
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,620
amount of animals that are killed.
I think the opposite happens.

740
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,530
I think it shores up people's aggression
towards vegans get it.

741
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,643
They,
they firmly plant their heels on the 

742
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,840
other side of the line and they're like,
fuck you,

743
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,320
hippie [inaudible] asshole tree hug and 
pitches.

744
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,730
Go eat your sprouts.

745
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,530
I'm going to go over here and eat 
burger.

746
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,783
I mean,
there's a lot of people that go out and 

747
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,130
eat burgers because of that.
Yeah.

748
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,580
I probably,
yeah.

749
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,463
No.
My friend Mike Hockridge from BC met 

750
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:01,210
him.
Yeah.

751
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,043
Mike.
Mike was dealing with people from 

752
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,134
Vancouver that were sending him hate 
mail because of wolves now where he 

753
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:09,904
lives.
He lives in the real British Columbia 

754
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,820
where there's fucking while olds and 
grizzly bears everywhere.

755
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,693
Yeah.
We found a a wolf kill while we were up 

756
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:19,870
there.
It was pretty wild.

757
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,060
Wolf had got ahold of a moose calf.
It just tore it apart.

758
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,090
The pack of wolves,
they're all over the place and it,

759
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,293
it's pretty fresh too,
but he's shot a bunch of them and 

760
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,114
somehow or another,
some group of people found out that he 

761
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:35,674
shot wolves and where he lives,
you get an unlimited amount of wolf 

762
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,340
tags,
right?

763
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,173
They're trying to kill wolves as much as
possible that you can kill a hundred 

764
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:42,574
words a day if you can.
Then that's totally legal because they 

765
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:48,760
have ranchers up there and like one of,
I think one of his neighbors,

766
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,370
they wolf,
it was a in the middle of the winter,

767
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,740
wolf got ahold of one of the cows and I 
got a bunch of wolves,

768
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,600
a pack.
So these people are in their house.

769
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,050
They listened to a pack of wolves,
terror plot and cow that's like,

770
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,910
you know,
a hundred yards from their fucking bed.

771
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,000
Scary freaky shit.
Right?

772
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,903
They live in the real while.
So these people were sending him all 

773
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,170
these death threats and so he said,
look,

774
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,060
every time you guys send me one of 
these,

775
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:12,970
I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts.
Yeah.

776
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,580
Radio silence.
They stopped.

777
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,960
Yeah.
He said to this lady,

778
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,490
he said,
every time you send me an email,

779
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:19,660
I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts.

780
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,800
Yeah.
Well,

781
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,443
I dunno.
I was probably in front of a keyboard 

782
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,240
going.
Yeah,

783
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,960
it's a tough one though.
That was a tough one.

784
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:29,651
Yeah.
Yeah.

785
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:30,484
You know the BC was,
they just outlawed grizzly hunting up 

786
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,880
there because of that.
They did a poll in,

787
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,920
I think Vancouver,
and I'm not only that,

788
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,260
they did a very limited email poll with 
about 3000 participants.

789
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,113
Right.
And 76% of 3000 people said that they 

790
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:49,594
didn't,
they were opposed to grizzly bear 

791
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,514
hunting.
But I think if you're going to have any 

792
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,544
kind of a poll like that,
you should have to have these people 

793
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:59,920
educated first as to what their voting 
about.

794
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,920
Do you really understand what it's like 
up there?

795
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,570
I know.
Cause if you talk to Mike,

796
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,433
Mike shot a grizzly bear in the head 
from like 20 feet away as it was trying 

797
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,444
to get into his cabin.
Like they are fucking ferocious and 

798
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,064
they're huge and there's a lot of them.
There's no shortage of grizzly bears in 

799
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,670
British Columbia now,
but it's that whole education piece.

800
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:22,750
But that's,
I mean,

801
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,870
you could take that to even voting in 
our elections.

802
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:29,500
Sure.
I mean we need to educate people.

803
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,060
People need to be educated on the 
topics,

804
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:34,510
not just hunting but everything.
But they can vote.

805
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,403
Their vote still counts.
Let's say you can't tell people they 

806
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,100
can't vote because that's fucked up.
You can't,

807
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,310
well,
you have to

808
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,860
have a certain amount of education or 
you can't vote.

809
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,310
But what they need to do is trust the 
people who do now.

810
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,283
Yeah.
You know,

811
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,273
like up there,
the biologist who are actually have 

812
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,690
boots on the ground or but,
and there are no,

813
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,480
the what grizzly are doing and how many 
there are.

814
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,770
Let's go ahead and trust those people.
You know,

815
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,530
hard to see.
When you're in Vancouver though.

816
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,980
The problem is you're in Vancouver,
you're eating at a nice Sushi restaurant

817
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,720
and hanging out with friends.
You know,

818
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:07,850
he'd go into the movies.
Everything's beautiful.

819
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,000
Vancouver,
so nice.

820
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,380
So that you look at the mountains to 
whistler off in the distance.

821
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,340
Oh,
that's so pretty.

822
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,810
Yeah.
I don't want to kill a bear.

823
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,763
Don't kill the best and now,
but if you just go on a six hour car 

824
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:19,634
ride,
just go.

825
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,170
Just keep going north.

826
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,153
Keep going north and I you car and I 
want you to go for a two mile hike into 

827
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,410
the woods.
Just go for a two mile hike.

828
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,860
And I want you to sit there for a day.
Just sit there for a day.

829
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,900
You're going to see some shit.
Right?

830
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,970
And you will realize you will,
oh,

831
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,910
this is a different world.
This world is,

832
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:40,850
this is a wild world.
Like these things out here.

833
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:43,100
They don't give a shit if people are 
real or not.

834
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,140
They are.
They're doing what they've always done.

835
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,360
The bear running around looking for shit
to eat,

836
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,313
the animals running around looking to 
get the fuck away from things that are 

837
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,490
trying to eat them.
And this is how they've always existed.

838
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,420
Yeah,
yeah,

839
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,373
I know.
And it's,

840
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,120
you know those bare and it's just like 
the,

841
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:59,330
the wolves killing the cow.
You said 20 feet from the,

842
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,320
wherever they lived.

843
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,760
I mean,
that's just what they do.

844
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,740
But,
and that's what grizzlies do.

845
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,510
Grizzlies are going to kill.
They're can,

846
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,823
you know,
if they can kill a moose calf or an elk 

847
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,744
cath or a deer fon,
they're not wasting a bunch of energy 

848
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:15,320
chasing a full grown animal around.
So they're using less energy,

849
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,360
burning less calories.
They get an easy kill.

850
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:19,760
They get high protein.
That's just what they do.

851
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:22,970
But the reason why we need to kill them 
is we're not,

852
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,010
they're never going to stop doing what 
they do.

853
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,680
We just need to control the numbers.
So how often that's happening.

854
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,543
If that's happening too often,
because there's too many of them will 

855
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:32,690
then the Moose and elk numbers go down,
you know,

856
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,610
and it's this balancing act and people 
will say,

857
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:35,444
well,
I'm just let animals take care of 

858
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:39,590
themselves.
They always have been and it's like,

859
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,931
no,
we've,

860
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,410
oh,
we've always hunted.

861
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,230
It's just now that people are saying,
well we shouldn't hunt.

862
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,910
You know,
so they're trying to take man out of the

863
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:47,744
equation.
Now.

864
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,850
Man's always been in the equation as far
as hunting.

865
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,833
Yeah.
I think people have an idea about it 

866
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,820
based on the excess that people have 
committed.

867
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:56,654
I mean,
people have committed some atrocities 

868
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,090
when it comes to animals in this country
alone.

869
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:01,640
Everyone's seen those stacks of buffalo 
heads.

870
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:06,190
And when they were doing market hunting 
in particular in the 18 hundreds and ma,

871
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,980
many people attribute that to hunters,
um,

872
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,690
erroneous Lee.
That's not really what it was.

873
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,130
What killed off all those animals was a 
thing called market hunting.

874
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,413
And this is back.
People have to realize there's no 

875
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,930
refrigerators back then.
And so,

876
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,793
you know,
you weren't like getting steaks and 

877
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,624
freezing them.
And there was not a lot of like large 

878
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,680
scale agriculture back then either.
There's,

879
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,743
there was a few ranchers and farmers,
but when people had all these animals 

880
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:33,314
that were out in the wild and they could
hire these people that were in the 

881
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,010
military,
they had just gotten done

882
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,650
with the war and they were good shots.
They would,

883
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,513
this would be a good way to make a 
living and go out there and shoot some 

884
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,734
buffalo,
bring back the tongues buffalo and 

885
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:45,904
tongue was like,
they would shoot a giant buffalo and 

886
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:51,810
just take the tongue.
They'd take the hides and you know,

887
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:54,390
sometimes they would take the meat and 
some and then they,

888
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,660
they wiped out almost everything.
They wiped out most of the deere,

889
00:35:57,661 --> 00:35:58,494
most of the elk,
most of the antelope until guys like 

890
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:02,430
Teddy Roosevelt came along well,
Whoa,

891
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:03,121
Whoa,
whoa,

892
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,990
whoa,
hit the fucking brakes.

893
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,310
Like we've got to protect these animals.
We've got to protect this land.

894
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,383
We've got to protect these animals.
We got to set up private or public land 

895
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:15,030
rather were will,
you can't do anything to it where people

896
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:15,864
could just roam and hike and camp.
And fish and hunt and do whatever you 

897
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,660
want,
and we got to make sure we protect these

898
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:22,494
animal populations because they got down
to some incredibly low number of elk at 

899
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,350
the turn of the century.
Right?

900
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,151
Yeah.
Well,

901
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:31,130
I mean they almost wiped out buffalo 
completely.

902
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:33,260
I don't know what the hell got to,
but I know,

903
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,570
you know,
is as you know,

904
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,404
as conservationists,
we like to say that hunters are 

905
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,833
conservationists now,
but so one of the figures that we share 

906
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:46,610
is that there's more animals now than 
there was a hundred years ago,

907
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,680
so I dunno know what they were a hundred
years ago,

908
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:50,360
what the numbers were.
But yeah,

909
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,860
very low.
Not only that,

910
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:55,500
there's more whitetail deer today than 
when Columbus landed,

911
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,830
although Columbus road didn't really get
here when Columbus landed in The Bahamas

912
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,520
is more white tail deer here than now.
And part of that is because of farming,

913
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,110
which is real weird.
Like,

914
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,000
like a white tail deer is a weird 
animal.

915
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,460
Yeah.
They're kind of a farm animal a lot of a

916
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:14,360
way.
Yeah,

917
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,860
it,
and it's almost like,

918
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,113
you know,
if you're doing it right as far as 

919
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:21,080
killing the older bucks,
you're almost farming.

920
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,973
You know,
you're not harvesting when they're 

921
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:24,980
young.
You're waiting till they're mature.

922
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,420
And so it's,
it's almost like,

923
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:27,560
you know,
you're letting that crop,

924
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,660
uh,
age essentially.

925
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,000
What does this Jamie,
in 1910,

926
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:32,834
the u s forest service estimated there 
were only between 501,000 elk in 

927
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,150
Colorado.
Yeah.

928
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:40,700
Holy Shit.
And now there's a hundred and what?

929
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,340
25,000.
Oh,

930
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,920
150,000.
I don't know.

931
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,980
There was a fuck a lot more than that.
The numbers of fuckload.

932
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,660
There's 10 million.
Okay.

933
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,381
It says,
uh,

934
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,214
the elk population North America stood 
at about 10 million animals before 

935
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,910
European settlers came and systematic 
wholesale hunting began.

936
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,250
Wow.
That's amazing.

937
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,203
[inaudible] Colorado became famous for 
his trophy hunting and European 

938
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:07,250
gentleman traveled here to try their 
luck,

939
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,190
Sir George Gore.
I heard that guy was a con.

940
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,830
I'm just making that up.
He's a trophy hunter.

941
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,430
He's a trophy hunter for whom Gore pass 
near.

942
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:17,264
Kremmling is named,
came from Ireland to hunt in western 

943
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:21,104
Colorado.
He shot elk and deer from the bed of a 

944
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,350
wagon.
What a Dick.

945
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,113
That's real honey.
He only took prime hides and large 

946
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:32,480
antlers and left amit to rot a boy.
What a bad person.

947
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,130
That's that sentence right there.
And that's when people think happens

948
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,710
that I don't know anybody who ever does.
That's illegal.

949
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,260
First of all,
coaching.

950
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,123
Yeah,
that's a good thing.

951
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,000
The good thing to point out is illegal 
to not take the meat rallies illegal.

952
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:46,834
To not take the mean,
you have to take the neck meet in 

953
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:50,050
Colorado,
you have to cut out the neck,

954
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,030
all edible.
And you got all the edible meat.

955
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,660
And um,
and even between the ribs,

956
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:56,494
I mean there's a little,
I dunno about if that's a law in 

957
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,250
Colorado.
I know in Alaska.

958
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,900
Yeah,
you killed a moose.

959
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,734
You,
you're even taking that meat in between 

960
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:04,571
the ribs.
I mean,

961
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,600
you're taking all edible meat there.
And so people say,

962
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,730
well,
are you one of those trophy hunters?

963
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:10,564
Or you know,
you just don't take the head and leave 

964
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,934
it to rot.
It's like,

965
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,490
you can't do that.
Why would you do that anyway?

966
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,580
It's so stupid,
but it's illegal anyway.

967
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,110
If you walked down the street,
if you,

968
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:20,944
if you eat steak and you walked down the
street and you saw like for some reason 

969
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,530
someone had put coolers of prime rib 
eyes,

970
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,870
it just sitting there,
you'd be like,

971
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,360
what the fuck is this here for?
Once we'd look around,

972
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:36,370
is there anybody here?
I've got to take this.

973
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,350
Yeah.
This can just leave this here.

974
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:39,460
Right,
so I have to do to rot,

975
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,080
so let's just do that.
When you're hunting,

976
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,480
that's just you finding it,
right?

977
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,930
Probably you would not eat it.
Now that I think about it,

978
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:47,500
you'd be like,
Whoa,

979
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,880
what is this a trap I get the point you 
were making that when I was making is if

980
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,120
you go through all the effort to go hunt
and you do eat meat,

981
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,080
of course you're going to eat the meat.

982
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,943
Not only that,
the meat you're eating is incredibly 

983
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,140
precious.
Yeah,

984
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,400
like elk meat is incredibly proud.
It's so delicious.

985
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,091
Oh,
here's,

986
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,940
here's what I know,
so when we go hunting,

987
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,580
and I can speak for myself,
I'm sure I can speak for you too.

988
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,613
For when you go hunting,
you bring back all the Mutu can you eat 

989
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:15,604
all the Mutu Canada,
that animal you like sharing it that 

990
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,410
typical,
I'll just say American,

991
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,170
but waste 40% of their food,
not,

992
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,490
I'm going to stop this.
What they buy.

993
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,640
You know how what I'm done now in the 
garbage type thing,

994
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,640
so hunters,
I know I don't do that.

995
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,910
If I kill a bowl and I bring all that 
meat home,

996
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,970
40% of that is not going in the garbage.
No.

997
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,530
You know what I mean?
So it's because we,

998
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,490
we are,
we have that connection with the animal.

999
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,670
To me it'd be,
I don't know if I'm thinking about it,

1000
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,380
it'd be disrespectful,
but I just,

1001
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:50,680
it's so it's worth,
those are so much value in it.

1002
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,590
I would never throw it in the garbage,
you know what I mean?

1003
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,310
But when you buy it at a store,
whatever,

1004
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,590
you know,
I'm not saying people are putting,

1005
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,380
you know,
40% of prime rib and the garbage,

1006
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:05,560
but just as a rule,
we waste a lot of food.

1007
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,753
I think it would be a good thing for 
every single human being to grow some 

1008
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:14,560
vegetables.
And if you eat meat too,

1009
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,660
once in your life,
kill an animal.

1010
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,180
I think everyone should do it.
I really do.

1011
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,030
There was an article that I tweeted 
today about,

1012
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,990
um,
that,

1013
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,720
I forget the subject,
that title of it rather,

1014
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,270
but it was something along the lines of 
it's not,

1015
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,940
it's not healthy to hide from the fact 
that there's,

1016
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,470
there's death involved in eating meat.
Right.

1017
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,360
I did a terrible job of paraphrasing 
that.

1018
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,550
Fun.
What that title is.

1019
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,900
So article.
Okay.

1020
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,100
We shouldn't hide the gory details of 
how meet reaches our plate.

1021
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,050
Right.
What are the chickens?

1022
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,610
Yeah.
And I think that's very,

1023
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,533
very important.
And I think that like what I'm looking 

1024
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,750
at right there,
life is fucking gross.

1025
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,310
That's her life.
Yeah.

1026
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,783
It's fucked up.
Cause I eat chickens but I don't eat my 

1027
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:03,830
chickens.
Like someone said,

1028
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,430
do you eat those chickens Mike?
Now there's like my pets.

1029
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,140
It's weird.
Right.

1030
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,000
But I'll,
I'll eat the shit out of some chicken.

1031
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,900
Yeah.
But when you,

1032
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,000
but when you think of it like that,
I mean,

1033
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,590
so when we're,
we're looking at this picture,

1034
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:18,860
I know people looking at or listening to
the podcast can't see the picture,

1035
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:19,694
but I mean

1036
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,030
we're looking at an enormous warehouse.
I mean enormous.

1037
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:23,864
It looks like several football fields 
long and it's filled with chickens that 

1038
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,390
are just stuffed on top of each other,
right?

1039
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:29,580
Yeah.

1040
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,530
And that's their life until they get 
killed.

1041
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,000
And when you think of that,
okay,

1042
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:37,530
would I rather do that or would I rather
procure my own meat hunting?

1043
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,650
You know,
everybody would say that's not right.

1044
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:46,410
And I believe hunting is a noble way of 
procuring me.

1045
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,640
And um,
I think when you look at that,

1046
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:51,474
but people don't see that.
They don't think about that when they 

1047
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:54,090
order their,
you know,

1048
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,120
chick chicken nuggets.
They're not thinking about that.

1049
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,073
No,

1050
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,430
just hungry,
just hungry.

1051
00:42:59,431 --> 00:43:02,160
It's just too easy to get food mean.
I don't think it's too easy to get food.

1052
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:04,500
That's why we're such fat toes.
That's a big problem.

1053
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,693
But it's also just,
it's also too easy psychologically 

1054
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:10,410
because we just don't have any,
any connect.

1055
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,250
I think you should have a connection if 
you're eating a living thing just seems,

1056
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,130
it just seems like you should understand
what it is.

1057
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,140
Just for your own mind,
for you,

1058
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,520
for your own,
for just a,

1059
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:25,030
for a sense of balance.
And 97% of Americans eat meat,

1060
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:30,000
meat and something like 65% of vegans 
when they get drunk eat meat.

1061
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,230
It really has some crazy number.
Some crate,

1062
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,680
it might,
it might be higher than that.

1063
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,590
I think I read it was like 84% of 
vegans.

1064
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,723
See,
I'm just making up numbers at this 

1065
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:40,254
point.
It's fine.

1066
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,790
It doesn't mean it might've been a tweet
I read.

1067
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,620
Somebody might have just made that up.
Just going to audit us.

1068
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,483
So,
but so a Vegan drunk meets like an ex 

1069
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,650
girlfriend.
Yeah.

1070
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,300
Right.
It's like an ex girlfriend.

1071
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:51,811
Yeah.
Yeah.

1072
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:52,644
So you get drunk if you're lonely,
you're taking risk and you're eating a 

1073
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:57,780
hot dog.
Is that right?

1074
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,800
Yeah.
Same thing.

1075
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,130
Yeah,
exactly.

1076
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:01,080
Saying I got it.
Yeah.

1077
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:01,914
It's a little over a third that 
confessed to a eating meat when they're 

1078
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:04,881
drunk.
Oh,

1079
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:07,110
well then it's 100% because three 
quarters or more liars.

1080
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,623
Yeah.
Surprising number of drug vegetarian 

1081
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:14,010
secretly meet.
That is an awesome picture right there.

1082
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,890
The problem with this,
this thing is,

1083
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,840
this is a third of people that they 
asked British fit vegetarians.

1084
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:20,641
Oh,
British people,

1085
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:23,430
it's totally different animal.
They fucking hate hunters.

1086
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:24,810
They love saying cunt.
Oh,

1087
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,170
did I see,
did I say,

1088
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:27,480
listen,
I think contin there.

1089
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:29,420
I say that really?
I thought I'd do.

1090
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,980
I've been looking phono flushing

1091
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,813
out.
You said effing con we didn't say 

1092
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,060
fucking gun.
No,

1093
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:43,740
that's the customer.
Yeah,

1094
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,260
they do.
They do live to say con,

1095
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,213
but they're,
they're the most delusional of there's 

1096
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,870
like South Americans.
There's no hunting.

1097
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,390
Exactly.
No hunting.

1098
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:55,680
Brazil for some strange reason.
I get a lot of hate from Brazil.

1099
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,570
They love me.
You go to Brazil,

1100
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,250
they invented that.
You husker IA.

1101
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,500
Chu Has Korea's or this shit,
man.

1102
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,300
Yeah.
Did we go to one or went Brazil?

1103
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,640
Is that where they threw the plates in 
the halls,

1104
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:06,751
right.
Oh,

1105
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:07,830
that's right.
Yeah,

1106
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,020
they threw the plate.
Yeah.

1107
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,760
They fucking chuck fruit plates like 
Frisbees and shatter them.

1108
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,200
Yeah.
They know how to party in prison.

1109
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:15,720
They do and it's just me on me.
On me.

1110
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,693
You get a beautiful card.
It's got green on one side and red on 

1111
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:20,184
the other.
A lot of people have been to these like 

1112
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:24,840
a folder to chow is a great one that's 
here in la and all over the country,

1113
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,610
but that's what they ate.

1114
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,190
They're famous for me.
When you're done with the meat,

1115
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,540
you give him the red card.
Yeah.

1116
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,523
Right?
Yeah.

1117
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,800
It's green on one side and down the 
other.

1118
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:35,700
Yeah.
You tap out.

1119
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,900
Yeah,
we go to town.

1120
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,750
Nobody can fuck with Ari Shaffir.
When it comes to that place,

1121
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,750
nobody really know.
I've never seen a look.

1122
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:46,110
When me and Ari go to eat,
generally speaking,

1123
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,450
I'm more of a glutton and him,
I'll eat more than him,

1124
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,860
but not at that place really.
There's something about like all you can

1125
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:53,694
eat.
I think maybe it's some like cause his 

1126
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,410
dad was in the Holocaust or something 
like that.

1127
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,933
Or He's just like,
because it's free because it's like you 

1128
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:04,590
could eat,
she just won't stop.

1129
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,490
I've never seen anything like it.
I go like,

1130
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,220
where are you putting all this fucking 
food?

1131
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,230
Everyone's done.
Joey Diaz has done.

1132
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,090
I'm done.
Eddie Bravo is done.

1133
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,860
We're done.
We're just sitting there like this.

1134
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,043
Ah,
are you still John Green who's still in 

1135
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:18,751
green?
He's like,

1136
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,900
I'm still on green.
Guy will come over and got lamb chops,

1137
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,430
lamb chops.
She has to bring the lamb chops.

1138
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,631
God,
I can't,

1139
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,510
I've never seen,
especially in Brazil,

1140
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,373
they're all,
they know how to do it and they have 

1141
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:32,880
grass fed meat over there too.
They're not fucking around with the corn

1142
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:33,714
fed and all that.
They don't have the sick fat cows that 

1143
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:36,354
we have over here.
But it is weird how you get a lot of 

1144
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:39,474
hate from people over there,
but it's because of the propaganda and 

1145
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,680
the,
the negative aspects of trophy hunting.

1146
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:47,514
Like when you see a guy standing there 
with a dead elephant or some shit like 

1147
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,031
that,
like,

1148
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:51,631
wow,
fuck,

1149
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:54,360
would you kill an elephant?
Like that kind of stuff in people's mind

1150
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:55,350
like,
or a giraffe.

1151
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,183
Why the fuck would you kill a giraffe?
Like people have this idea that these 

1152
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:59,760
people just go over there to kill 
things.

1153
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,690
And so this is what trophy hunting is.
So they see you with an elk,

1154
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,111
like,
oh,

1155
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:06,120
you piece of shit.
Why are you just go over there and shoot

1156
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:06,810
that thing?
Like,

1157
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,291
yeah,
no,

1158
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,900
this is my food for a year.
Like you're,

1159
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:12,990
you're going to that Goddamn steakhouse 
and you keep that thing on green.

1160
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,240
What do you think you're doing?
You're killing,

1161
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,380
killing with your credit card.
And now it's a,

1162
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,433
well,
all we can do is try to educate and 

1163
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:23,580
share the sh,
share the lifestyle.

1164
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:25,500
It's like,
I think it's important,

1165
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,680
um,
to be leaders and,

1166
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,010
and how we share that,

1167
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,843
you know,
cause I see things that I wish weren't 

1168
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:34,210
shared sometimes.
I mean,

1169
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,830
I've,
I've even made mistakes.

1170
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:36,664
I'm not trying to say that I got,
I'm dialed in and I never make them a 

1171
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:42,310
shit mistake on what I post or whatever.
But,

1172
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:43,144
um,
I just think we need to be stewards of 

1173
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,600
hunting and,
and if we do it right,

1174
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:47,763
we're not going to get everybody and 
we're not going to educate everybody 

1175
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,400
because there's some that just won't 
listen.

1176
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,400
Um,
but we can make some inroads.

1177
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,650
I think we have,
and I think,

1178
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:57,484
um,
I think it's important to relay 

1179
00:47:59,171 --> 00:47:59,630
experience.

1180
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,040
It says,
because I think there's,

1181
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:01,903
there's,
there's things to be learned from a lot 

1182
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:05,900
of experiences,
you know,

1183
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:09,890
like talking to you and talking to 
Courtney Galt,

1184
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:14,000
doe Walter about just ultra marathons 
and endurance running.

1185
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:14,834
There's something to be learned from 
that about the kind of mindset that it 

1186
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:17,684
takes to do that.
I think having these conversations with 

1187
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,400
you guys has changed the way I look at 
those things.

1188
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,271
Like,
fuck man,

1189
00:48:23,271 --> 00:48:23,991
for,
I'd met you.

1190
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:27,140
I never ran.
I'm running all the time now.

1191
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,960
I run all the time.
You look slow.

1192
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,550
I've been have you,
how much you weigh?

1193
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,890
One 96.
[inaudible] 95 the same.

1194
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,903
No,
I'm a little lighter or it was up to 

1195
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,210
like two oh four when I was a fat so.
Oh okay.

1196
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,430
That was the fastest I've ever been 
thought you look slimmer.

1197
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,353
I'm a little maybe a little slimmer 
maybe I'm like one 95 or one 91 94 is 

1198
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:46,530
when I'm pretty lean.

1199
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,290
We've got a full six pack.
Look at one 94 when I hit about two,

1200
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,780
when I get to 200 that's when I start.
I go,

1201
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:55,940
okay,
we better start doing the fasting again.

1202
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:56,803
Yeah.
When I really get into my intermittent 

1203
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:01,550
fasting,
I'll spend either 14 or 16 hours without

1204
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:02,384
eating in a day.
I want to eat for like 10 hours in a 

1205
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,933
day.
Yeah.

1206
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,640
I eat about every 30 minutes.
I'm actually starving.

1207
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,340
How you starting right now?
Now you're in a different thing though.

1208
00:49:10,341 --> 00:49:14,450
Cause I'm,
I'm eating mostly fat and you know a lot

1209
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,810
of guys are on that carnivore diet.
Now when we had that Sean Baker in here,

1210
00:49:17,811 --> 00:49:19,020
that doctor,
the,

1211
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,173
the bells,
Chris Bell and Mark Bell and those guys 

1212
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:23,444
are both on the carnivore diet.
Now they don't need anything but meat 

1213
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,230
all day.
Wow.

1214
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,970
Yeah.
Mark said he's never felt better.

1215
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,270
So just to thin it looks ripped.
If you look at his instagram page,

1216
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:34,430
he's fucking jacked.
Shredded.

1217
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,490
It's also on steroids that they're 
probably helps but,

1218
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,400
but he looks good.
Yeah.

1219
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,060
Well it's uh,
I dunno.

1220
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,870
I,
one of my favorites,

1221
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,910
she picks up because Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1222
00:49:46,911 --> 00:49:48,290
Look at him.
Look at that picture.

1223
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,710
Oh my is meat while he's eating his meat
jacked.

1224
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,960
Yeah.
Jack,

1225
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,960
Stan plus steroids.
A little bit starts.

1226
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:01,260
Right.
But whatever he's at Mark Bell.

1227
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:02,094
Yeah.
Yeah.

1228
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,960
He's a fucking animal.
Then I watched the bigger,

1229
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:06,631
stronger,
faster.

1230
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:07,540
Is that what it was?
Yeah.

1231
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,610
Yeah,
it was his,

1232
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,050
his brother was on there.
Right.

1233
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,550
Three brothers and one of them died of 
them.

1234
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,940
Died.
They hit a drug problem.

1235
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:16,220
He was a pro wrestler.
Yeah,

1236
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,270
that's the one I watched as it.
Yeah.

1237
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:21,510
It was a powerful document was,
and it was,

1238
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:22,650
it was pretty sad.
I mean,

1239
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,690
he wanted,
you know,

1240
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,280
his brother wanted to make it be 
something.

1241
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,010
It's just like a lot us,
you know,

1242
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,140
and you know,
it's hard to say.

1243
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,773
Well,
he ran into the problem that I've seen 

1244
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:35,770
many people run into those goddamn 
prescription pills.

1245
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:37,300
They're so scary.
They are.

1246
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,330
They're one of the scariest things that 
are in modern society.

1247
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:42,190
And it's something that's not talked 
about enough.

1248
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:46,150
You only hear it talked about from 
family members of people that have lost.

1249
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:48,850
People are close friends and people that
have lost people.

1250
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,450
But it's a,
it's a giant problem in this country.

1251
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:55,360
We're losing thousands of people every 
day too.

1252
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,530
Pain pills.
Yeah.

1253
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,240
Well I,
you know,

1254
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,283
I put something up not long ago about 
suicide and it was amazing how many 

1255
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,830
people sent me messages.
I mean,

1256
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,693
how many people are affected or just are
dealing with negative thoughts of their 

1257
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:16,780
own and then a little mini battles and 
it's just like that one post.

1258
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,333
I don't know.
I think people just need to know that 

1259
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,500
there's people out there that care,
you know?

1260
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,450
But I don't know how with,
when they get into that cycle of pills,

1261
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:28,570
I don't really know.
I'm not a doctor.

1262
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:31,300
I don't know how that works.
I don't know what they're dealing with.

1263
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:32,970
I just know that,
you know,

1264
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,630
social media can be used.
It can be irritating sometimes,

1265
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:38,920
but man,
it can be good,

1266
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,310
especially for people like that.
She's able to reach out and maybe,

1267
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,503
you know,
get some support or encouragement or 

1268
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:46,750
something,
you know?

1269
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,613
And it's

1270
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,750
well for someone that they admire,
like you,

1271
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:51,010
that's gigantic,
you know,

1272
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:52,780
if they can,
they can read something like that.

1273
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,660
Sometimes that's all people need.
Just a little wind in their sail.

1274
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,033
Just a little something.

1275
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,350
So something I'm gonna say I dorm thing,
I'll,

1276
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:00,131
I say,
you know,

1277
00:52:00,131 --> 00:52:01,930
it was,
it was in the news.

1278
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,290
There's a quarterback up at Washington 
state that killed himself.

1279
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,124
You know,
he's going to be the starting 

1280
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:09,010
quarterback on the football team,
21 years old.

1281
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:12,010
And he shot himself a few weeks ago.
And I didn't want,

1282
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,580
I didn't want to say that well,
because I don't want to say that.

1283
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:17,140
Well,
it's because it's an athlete.

1284
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:18,790
That's why anybody cares,
you know?

1285
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,940
But it's anybody,
it's any person who's 21 years old.

1286
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:24,820
I'm thinking what a tragedy that is.
But it just,

1287
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,920
that was in the new,
so it happened.

1288
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,230
And so that's why I put it up and for 
no,

1289
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,210
or I can't do anything.
It's not like I'm,

1290
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,380
I don't,
I'm,

1291
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,020
I just want people to be aware and just 
to have that number to call.

1292
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:36,854
And the case,
there was a 21 year old feeling that 

1293
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:42,520
exact same way and there's this 
seemingly some kid who had everything.

1294
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,270
I mean the co a college quarterback and 
it's just like,

1295
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,860
it just breaks my heart to think that 
they would get to,

1296
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:54,700
that he would get to that point where,
you know,

1297
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,593
killing himself was the answer.
And it's just harder for younger people 

1298
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,600
because they don't have,
I have a

1299
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,860
lot of life experiences and they don't 
know that like a guy like you or I who's

1300
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:04,694
lived a long time and I've seen a lot of
shit that you've gone through your ups 

1301
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:09,490
and downs and when you hit it down you 
go,

1302
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,940
well this sucks,
but I know it's going to get better.

1303
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,800
Yeah,
just got to figure out why it sucks.

1304
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:17,420
Address why it sucks.
Uh,

1305
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,463
apologize if you need to correct 
whatever the issue is that's making you 

1306
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,830
feel like shit.
Pull yourself out of it,

1307
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,913
do a bunch of positive things.
Next thing you know you're going to be 

1308
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:28,644
okay again.
Yeah,

1309
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,010
and sometimes when you're 21 years old,
you do,

1310
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,850
you think the world's over.
You know?

1311
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,713
I mean,
I remember when my girlfriend dumped me 

1312
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,350
when I was 18 I was so fucking bummed 
out.

1313
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:41,130
I couldn't imagine.
I couldn't imagine living without her.

1314
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,430
I was like,
I can't believe that this is over.

1315
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,790
I can't put you so devastated cause 
you're fucking Europe baby.

1316
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,880
18 year old baby.
You don't know Jack Shit.

1317
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,980
But when you get older and you've had 
more life experiences and more things,

1318
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:59,850
you get more perspective and you kind of
understand like what this feeling is bad

1319
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:01,200
feeling and you just know,
well,

1320
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:02,034
hey,
I just gotta get the fuck out of the 

1321
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:03,720
house.
I've got to go hang out with my friends,

1322
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:06,240
got to go do a bunch of positive things.
Go hit the gym,

1323
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,850
take a yoga class,
do something fun,

1324
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,980
and then everything's going to be okay.
You realize,

1325
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,940
hey,
you know,

1326
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,810
life's not perfect.
There's no such thing as a perfect life.

1327
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:17,730
It doesn't exist.
You're going to have ups,

1328
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:20,640
you're going to have downs.
But when you're 21 years old,

1329
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,503
it's very difficult to see that.
And also who knows what else was going 

1330
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:25,224
on in his life,
whether it was pills or whether it's a 

1331
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,133
head trauma.
And a lot of football players wind up 

1332
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,070
killing themselves.
It's not a coincidence.

1333
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,170
It's directly related to head drama.

1334
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,210
Yeah,
I'm not,

1335
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm not sure.
I don't want to speculate.

1336
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,950
I don't eat that.
It's just,

1337
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:38,784
uh,
I just,

1338
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,770
you know,
I just,

1339
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,180
it's horrible.
I get a lot of,

1340
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,930
I just,
when you said,

1341
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:47,600
well you go hang out with your friends,
it sometimes,

1342
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,710
cause I've been in certain groups where 
even my friends aren't positive,

1343
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,630
you know what I mean?
So you're like,

1344
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,490
that even makes it worse.
They can.

1345
00:54:55,491 --> 00:54:56,324
So I mean,
that's where I see the positives of 

1346
00:54:57,831 --> 00:54:58,664
social media and I wish I could respond 
to everybody who sends me a message and 

1347
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,564
just say,
Hey,

1348
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:03,730
you know,
and it's,

1349
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,630
it's Cliche,
keep hammering or whatever.

1350
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,464
But I know,
I know I get inspiration from people 

1351
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:11,300
online and if,
um,

1352
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,210
I get a shout out,
it feels good.

1353
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,430
It doesn't mean anything.
Where's your t shirt?

1354
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,140
It doesn't mean,
I don't know if it means it doesn't mean

1355
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:19,140
anything but eat some.

1356
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,990
But it does to me,
you know?

1357
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,550
And so I just know what it's like to be 
in a small town and to not,

1358
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,250
I'm not saying I didn't have any 
positive friends or whatever,

1359
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:31,460
but I would know what it feel like to 
not have anybody to really lean on,

1360
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:32,340
you know?
Yeah.

1361
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:37,340
And so I tried to think about maybe 
people like I was and a man.

1362
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,990
I just think we can,
I dunno together Shit we can,

1363
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,210
we can do a lot of positive things.
I just,

1364
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,650
it just,
like I said,

1365
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,730
it breaks my heart to think of people.
Um,

1366
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:49,880
living negative.
Yeah.

1367
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:50,790
Each day.

1368
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,623
I agree with you.
And I think that's one of the things 

1369
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:56,610
that social media can do that's positive
and also podcasts can do that's positive

1370
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,803
is it exposes you.
Like there's people that are listening 

1371
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,900
to this conversation right now that 
they're taking comfort from it.

1372
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:04,763
Like they might be either stuck in a 
shitty job or they might be alone and 

1373
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,383
they're here with us.
They're here hanging out and they 

1374
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:12,960
realize those people like us out there.
This is friendly,

1375
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,620
positive people out there.
Even if you're alone,

1376
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,410
at least you're not around negative 
twats,

1377
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,060
right?
You know,

1378
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:20,893
there's a lot of negative people around 
and it's unfortunate that they're 

1379
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:25,780
negative.
I wish you could fix them all,

1380
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,033
but sometimes life gives you these 
lessons in the form of disastrous lives 

1381
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,170
that you witness and you see these 
disasters lives and you just go,

1382
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,033
oh my God,
I gotta get the fuck away from this 

1383
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:41,620
crazy ass hole and live my life in a 
more positive,

1384
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,513
productive way because I see what can 
happen if you blame the world for all 

1385
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:46,384
your problems and you,
all you do is hate and you hate on 

1386
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:53,920
people that are successful and you hate 
on people that are whatever wealthy,

1387
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:55,440
good looking,
whatever the fic pick,

1388
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,140
pick the thing.

1389
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,290
Girls that are thin,
whatever the thing is that you hate on,

1390
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,950
there's so many people out there that 
waste all of their energy doing that.

1391
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,140
And if you're around them,
you can't fix them.

1392
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:05,974
It's so hard to fix people.
But what you can do is see what they're 

1393
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:10,654
doing that's so negative and just 
completely degrade the quality of their 

1394
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:19,840
life and just don't do that.
Recognize,

1395
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,790
recognize that this is not the way to 
live.

1396
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:25,090
And then go listen to a podcast with 
some positive people and say,

1397
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:28,450
look at this guy.
This guy's out there eating healthy,

1398
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,580
doing good things.
He lost 15 pounds.

1399
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,533
She went running and just decided to 
start doing marathons and he did this 

1400
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,360
and this guy's building a fucking house.
Like you can.

1401
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,920
You can find a lot of positive examples 
of people online today.

1402
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,813
That's,
that's one of the reasons why I'm so 

1403
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:46,450
drawn to ultra running.
I mean,

1404
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:47,284
because whether you like running or not,
the people that do that are some great 

1405
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,380
positive people.
I mean,

1406
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,640
they're savages.
Oh.

1407
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,683
But they're also,
you get so use of winning those many 

1408
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:01,270
battles in the long run.
And you,

1409
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,373
I mean,
you have to and you get strength from 

1410
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:07,450
each other.
So at the finish line or during the race

1411
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,740
is you can get a bond.
Um,

1412
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,020
there's a saying,
you know,

1413
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,080
he sheds his blood with me,
will be my brother.

1414
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,730
And it's like,
it's not,

1415
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,590
that's probably derive from war and,
and I get that.

1416
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:20,410
And it's not like a war or anything like
that,

1417
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:21,244
but it's going through a mini battle.
And when you do that with somebody and 

1418
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:27,070
you share that experience,
you get that connection.

1419
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,593
And it's like,
it's why even though I don't know 

1420
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,740
courtney that well,
um,

1421
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:37,741
I know what she does and I really look 
up to her ability to just be a beast and

1422
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,193
that whole environment,
the ultra running environment and 

1423
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:47,140
community is a,
is empowering for me for sure.

1424
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,070
And,
and that's,

1425
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,550
that's why I love even just being around
people like that,

1426
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,990
it just makes you better.
Well,

1427
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,430
they're,
they're exceptional.

1428
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:54,990
Yeah.

1429
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,710
Those are exceptional people there.
They have an exceptional mind to be able

1430
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:03,030
to endure something like a 238 mile race
through the Moab desert.

1431
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,070
You've got to be something special.
Yeah.

1432
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,213
There's,
there's a little thing in the back of 

1433
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,550
has,
has want to just sit down,

1434
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:09,763
lunches,
quit.

1435
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,520
I says,
enough's enough.

1436
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:13,420
We're already ran five miles.
Where do you want it?

1437
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,241
This is enough,
man.

1438
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:15,860
You ran a marathon.
I isn't enough.

1439
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,810
You had two marathons.
So you sit the fuck down.

1440
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,250
We just sit the fuck down and take a 
nap.

1441
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,100
But you have to be able to shut off and 
most people

1442
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,950
can't shut that off.
Can't,

1443
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,000
you know,
it's,

1444
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,150
it's tough.
It's,

1445
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:27,320
it's amazing.
I mean,

1446
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,523
um,
my brother was with me on that last one 

1447
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,490
and uh,
and it's,

1448
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,590
and it's weird to share,
uh,

1449
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:38,450
an experience like that with somebody 
because you can be similar,

1450
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,900
but in the course of something at three 
days like that,

1451
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,840
you're in low points at different times,
you know what I mean?

1452
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:45,913
And so it's really hard.
It's really hard to win each of those 

1453
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:52,430
battles because at one time when you 
might,

1454
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,840
I dunno,
it's just,

1455
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,710
it seems like that'd be easier.
But I think in,

1456
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,050
in some respects it is,
but it's,

1457
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,780
man,
it does,

1458
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,370
it's tough.
It was tough all the way around.

1459
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,130
So when you're going through a three 
day,

1460
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,770
238 mile run does it,
it,

1461
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,360
it gets bad at certain times where you 
just feel like shit and then if you keep

1462
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:20,900
going it gets better and then it gets 
bad again.

1463
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,280
Yeah.
And then it gets better.

1464
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,510
Oh yeah.
You're up and down,

1465
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:25,370
up and down the whole time.
And,

1466
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:29,270
but you know that if you keep going,
even when you feel like dog shit,

1467
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,710
you'll eventually break through and 
start feeling okay again.

1468
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,420
I don't know.
There's no guarantee.

1469
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,380
There's no guarantee.
No,

1470
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,243
there's no you hope.
Have you ever gone through a whole long 

1471
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,660
race and felt like dog shit the entire 
time?

1472
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,190
Yeah.
Which one of those?

1473
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,890
Uh,
well like the 24 hour run,

1474
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,070
you know,
cause that's usually like my first tough

1475
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:53,090
one of the years in June.
So I haven't really prepared for it.

1476
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:53,924
And now,
cause I'm always after spring bear and 

1477
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,393
uh,
I haven't been training because I've 

1478
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,624
been up in bear camp and doing whatever.
So that's always one where I know I'm 

1479
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,450
just pretty much going to be miserable 
the whole time.

1480
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,420
There's going to be no light at the end 
of the tunnel,

1481
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,660
other than one of the 24 hours is up.
So that one,

1482
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,790
I know I'm just going to have to grind 
it out.

1483
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:14,960
But,
and that's,

1484
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,960
that's where I'm like [inaudible] it's 
a,

1485
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,020
this is one day out of my life,
just do it.

1486
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,680
I'm just going to be miserable.
Um,

1487
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,261
you know,
on,

1488
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:27,800
on Moab,
that one started off and I felt terrible

1489
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,140
right out of the,
I mean I felt,

1490
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,423
I was like,
we were God don't want to think like 19 

1491
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,310
or maybe 15 miles in something like 
that.

1492
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:38,510
An aid station.
I'm going,

1493
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:40,243
this is not good cause teen miles in.
It's crazy as you were running a 

1494
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:45,650
marathon a day.
Yeah.

1495
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,530
Yeah.
So why was 15 miles so bad?

1496
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,840
Um,
I dunno.

1497
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:51,703
There's sometimes when you,
do you ever go on a run and your legs 

1498
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:55,790
just feel heavy and he just don't feel 
good?

1499
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,430
Yeah.
So that's what that,

1500
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,960
I just,
I was like,

1501
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,273
I wanted to be fresh and I want it to 
feel light on my feet and I want to get 

1502
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,980
out there.
And I was like,

1503
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,950
it's not a good sign when I didn't,
because,

1504
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,770
you know,
we just essentially started the race and

1505
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,250
it was hot and I had run out of water 
already one time.

1506
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,563
And,
um,

1507
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,400
my legs felt heavy.
And so it was a,

1508
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,593
it wasn't looking good.
And then courtney was way out ahead and 

1509
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,870
you know,
they're saying I,

1510
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:28,800
you know,
with,

1511
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:30,660
I didn't really know who she was at that
time.

1512
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,790
So we were,
me and my brother Taylor,

1513
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,990
we were thinking we'll 70 in the 70s 
would win the race.

1514
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,430
So I thought,
well,

1515
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:42,750
I want to go out and,
and aim for finishing in the 70s.

1516
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,520
And when you say seventies,
what do you mean,

1517
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:45,510
70 hours?

1518
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,220
Yeah.
So I figured,

1519
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,773
because what usually one big foot was 
high sixties in big foot's two oh five 

1520
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,150
two oh five.
And so this is,

1521
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,640
you know,
close to 35 miles further.

1522
01:02:56,641 --> 01:02:58,230
So we just figured,
well,

1523
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,450
probably seventies is going to get it 
done.

1524
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,003
And so she went out and she had,
there's an under a couple of other guys 

1525
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:05,190
with,
or I think,

1526
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,770
and they went out pretty hard.
And,

1527
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:09,360
uh,
you know,

1528
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:12,000
there's updates and where they were.
And I didn't know,

1529
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:12,834
I didn't know at that time she was the 
American record holder for the hundred 

1530
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,153
20 or the 24 hour run.
She'd run 160 miles I think in 24 hours 

1531
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:25,080
this Christ.
And so I was like,

1532
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,430
oh well they just went too fast.
You know,

1533
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:31,920
cause I had done that before and like a 
big foot the year before and I thought,

1534
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,450
well they'll come back,
you know,

1535
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,180
so meaning it'll balance out.

1536
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,700
We'd catch up or they come back.
And uh,

1537
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:39,803
I think the guys with her ended up 
dropping off a little bit and then she 

1538
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,280
never came back.
She just,

1539
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,740
well one of them dropped out,
totally tried to keep up with her and he

1540
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,210
couldn't.
Then he wound up dropping out.

1541
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:49,044
Totally.
She's a monster and she's eating Nachos 

1542
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:52,620
and candy.
That was crazy.

1543
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:53,820
Drinking beer.
Well,

1544
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,983
all these people are on like all these 
diets watching their macro nutrients 

1545
01:03:58,321 --> 01:03:58,711
and,
no,

1546
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,500
but I didn't want to say that is cause 
that,

1547
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:05,130
cause I listened to you talk to her 
about that and excuse me,

1548
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:09,720
I've seen a lot of comments about that.
But what you got to keep in mind is the,

1549
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,030
her training.
So you can't say,

1550
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,420
well I run 15 miles a week and I'm going
to eat Nachos and beer.

1551
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,170
Right.
So she's running 120 miles a week.

1552
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,750
Probably you can eat pretty much 
whatever you want.

1553
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,333
So I get that.
But it's also like I was asking her 

1554
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:29,040
about like the nutritional content of 
our food.

1555
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,233
You really monitoring how much protein 
you get versus Fido nutrients and 

1556
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:36,000
minerals.
No,

1557
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,500
no.
She's gotten it out.

1558
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,630
She probably just needs calories,
you know,

1559
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:40,710
she just,
it doesn't matter.

1560
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,470
It didn't matter what,
how she gets them just needs calories to

1561
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,540
sustain herself.
Just think for just a,

1562
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,570
the cells of your body,
you would need more nutrients.

1563
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,330
I mean who knows?
She's obviously a fucking savage.

1564
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,183
Yeah.
But who knows if she really monitored 

1565
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:58,800
her diet and ate super healthy,
she might be better maybe,

1566
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,290
which is just terrifying maybe.
Yeah,

1567
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,640
she's,
she's amazing.

1568
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,030
She's so normal to me.
Hang out with her.

1569
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,960
Like when she did the podcast,
she's just fun and laugh and look,

1570
01:05:08,961 --> 01:05:13,920
you would never imagine that Jesus like 
elite ultra marathon runner,

1571
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:18,010
I would think you'd have to be like 
super stoic and intense and just,

1572
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,520
and when you see her she's wearing like,
it looks like basketball shorts.

1573
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:22,750
Yeah.
Like,

1574
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,441
yeah,
exactly.

1575
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,420
Shorts.
It's not like,

1576
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,330
you know,
you see some of these track athletes and

1577
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:31,240
they got the tight little shorts on and 
the,

1578
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,390
and the singlet and they're like,
you know,

1579
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:35,623
she does like it with a kind of a baggy 
shirt and baggy shorts and then just 

1580
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,840
crushing people.
Crazy.

1581
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:41,763
Yeah.
She's,

1582
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,200
but I love that though.
I love outliers.

1583
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,510
A lot of people that come along with 
don't make any sense.

1584
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:47,530
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1585
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:50,110
Like did she so much better than 
everybody else?

1586
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:55,290
She won that 238 mile race by 22 miles,
something like that.

1587
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:57,784
Yeah,
22 miles ahead of the second place 

1588
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:00,454
winner.
And the guy who got second is this done 

1589
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:07,480
fucking animal has done as an animal.
She was 22 miles ahead of him.

1590
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,540
Now imagine get whupped not just 
whooped,

1591
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,583
but what 22 miles ahead by someone was 
eating Nachos and drink beer and eat 

1592
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,063
candy.

1593
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,723
I love that.
I love someone that doesn't make any 

1594
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:21,850
sense,
who is just so much better.

1595
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,260
It's just like,
wow,

1596
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,393
we got to fucking throw the,
throw a monkey wrench into this whole 

1597
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,274
idea.
The only thing I got on anybody is can 

1598
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:31,260
they pack out an elk there?
You got to,

1599
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,820
you got to sit on them.
You know,

1600
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,050
if that was the race,
you'd fuck them all up.

1601
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:39,070
But what I like about her also is I flew
home the other day,

1602
01:06:39,071 --> 01:06:44,020
I can't remember where it was from,
but I flew over like there's some in the

1603
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,450
cascades of Oregon,
there's a middle sister,

1604
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:47,800
north sister,
south sister,

1605
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:48,634
and then bachelor's where everybody goes
and skis and then broken tops right 

1606
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:52,300
there.
So I filmed it and I'm like,

1607
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,240
I tagged my brother Taylor and I'm like,
Hey,

1608
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:58,690
can we knock off all five of these peaks
in 24 hours?

1609
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,090
And uh,
and it would be,

1610
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,920
I mean,
it would be a test,

1611
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:06,220
you know,
and she commented and said she wants to,

1612
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,770
she joined us,
she wants to come do it.

1613
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,720
So I mean,
I just love that.

1614
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,730
I don't,
I don't even,

1615
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,290
she's a,
she's amazing.

1616
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,110
But that type of,
I mean,

1617
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:20,170
I guess I kind of goes hand in hand with
the eating.

1618
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:22,360
Whatever you want is also doing whatever
you want.

1619
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:25,060
You know,
like a lot of these elite athletes,

1620
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:26,230
they,
they would be like,

1621
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,950
have a schedule of races and my training
and this and that and I,

1622
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,043
you know,
whatever.

1623
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,060
I like that she's would just say,
yeah,

1624
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:35,170
I'll do that.
Yeah.

1625
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,290
It's not a race,
it's just we're just having fun.

1626
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,640
Yeah.
Or just a test.

1627
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,160
It's a,
it's an unofficial test and to,

1628
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,023
for her to want to join in.
That's probably what I love the most 

1629
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:46,414
about her and I are there established 
trails that you guys could run over all 

1630
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:49,790
those peaks.

1631
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:50,623
Um,
we did the south sister in the middle 

1632
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:57,880
sister last year and now it's uh,
getting off the south sister towards the

1633
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,530
middle sister is sketchy.
It's,

1634
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:00,850
there's no trails.
No.

1635
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:02,650
Oh,
so you just run it through the woods?

1636
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,900
It's on the side.
There's no trees.

1637
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:07,670
It's all inside of a mountain.
So it's like a shale and oh,

1638
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,250
even more sketchy.
Yeah.

1639
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,113
I'd rather run over trees yet.
Sort of now you would because you know 

1640
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,680
if there's trees are there solid ground 
there.

1641
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,551
Right.
You know,

1642
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,470
so with,
with the rocks up there,

1643
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:21,350
you don't know what's going to happen,
but you got to be stepping over shit.

1644
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,184
If there's trees there,
you might want it to a bunch of places 

1645
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:26,360
where all the trees have fallen down 
generally.

1646
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,880
Yeah.
I mean there can be a windfall in there,

1647
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:33,350
but generally you can get on animal 
trail and find your way through,

1648
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:36,200
you know,
but when it's just rocks,

1649
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,510
that's what,
that's probably the most sketchy cause.

1650
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,150
Yeah.
Cause just because there's a,

1651
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,260
you know,
I don't know,

1652
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:43,094
a thousand pound rock sitting there,
it could just just be balanced 

1653
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:48,740
perfectly.
You might step on it.

1654
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:49,783
That could be,
there's no guarantee that those rocks 

1655
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:52,310
are staying there,
you know,

1656
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,233
falls all the time.
So that's with rocks and that type of 

1657
01:08:56,241 --> 01:08:57,680
country,
super steep.

1658
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,810
It's a,
as part of it,

1659
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,020
it's fascinating to me that that is the 
appeal of sheep hunting too,

1660
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:03,854
a lot of people is that it's so 
incredibly dangerous that being up in 

1661
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:10,670
those high peaks and stepping on shale,
like on these,

1662
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:14,370
these crazy peaks where to the left is 
just a,

1663
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:15,204
a steep drop off to the right is a steep
drop off and you have a very narrow 

1664
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:20,570
place to navigate.
Yeah.

1665
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:22,370
It's uh,
you know,

1666
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:23,204
she punning they say it's not the,
it's not the animal that's the most 

1667
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:28,620
wary.

1668
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,180
It's just the country that makes it so,
I mean,

1669
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,800
they're expensive that the hunts,
but it was just what they did to that.

1670
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:39,150
It's just where they live is the draw,
you know,

1671
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,970
there,
I think with the bow,

1672
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:46,670
definitely a tough animal with a rifle.
Mostly it's just kind of getting in.

1673
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,550
If you can get your body within a range,
you know,

1674
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:51,610
you can usually get one done.
But it's,

1675
01:09:51,611 --> 01:09:53,240
it's just where they live.
Yeah.

1676
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,040
When,
um,

1677
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,800
um,
Ben O'Brien and a green tree,

1678
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,630
we're hunting tar.
Yeah.

1679
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,533
Similar thing New Zealand.
Then these crazy peaks and super 

1680
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:05,564
dangerous sketchy territory and people,
it's fascinating to me how people get 

1681
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:12,680
addicted to incredibly difficult things.
They do it.

1682
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:13,611
They say,
fuck,

1683
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,740
I'm never doing this again because it's 
terrible.

1684
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,540
And then they get back in a couple of 
weeks later,

1685
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:18,071
they're like,
shit,

1686
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:20,210
I don't want to go back.
Yeah.

1687
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:22,160
It's a god.

1688
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:22,993
I don't know what,
I don't know what type of analogy to 

1689
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:25,760
make,
but um,

1690
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,773
you know,
if you,

1691
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,830
when you've done say maybe ultras are 
marathons,

1692
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,930
it's really hard to get excited for a 
five k,

1693
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,870
you know what I mean?
When you do your key Pam and five k,

1694
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:38,290
how boring is that for you?
Uh,

1695
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,293
I,
to me this is more about the people 

1696
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:41,270
then.
Yeah.

1697
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,010
It's not for me.
I'm not that stupid.

1698
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,670
Race is the reason why I got started 
running.

1699
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,920
I couldn't believe how hard it was to do
with zero running folks.

1700
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,560
Zero.
I ran zero and then I ran a five k.

1701
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:56,270
Yeah.
And at the end of that I was like,

1702
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,820
okay,
I gotta start running shit.

1703
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,380
Yeah.
And it feels great now,

1704
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,790
right?
Yes it does.

1705
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,823
There's nothing,
nothing that feels better to me than 

1706
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,290
being older run.
I mean,

1707
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,020
you know what's crazy is my endurance 
for kickboxing is way better.

1708
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,370
Yeah.
I mean way better.

1709
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,533
Way Better.
Like I could do a hard three minute 

1710
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,370
round.

1711
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,560
No problem.
Yeah.

1712
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,940
And it's just from running these fucking
hills changes your lung capacity.

1713
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,750
Yeah.
Your lungs just expand and then contract

1714
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:24,630
and you just used to get any more oxygen
in there,

1715
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:25,580
I guess.
Yeah.

1716
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,573
Well still it's true.
You've seen those trails that I'm 

1717
01:11:27,781 --> 01:11:28,620
running on to.
It's so,

1718
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:31,620
they're so steep.
It's so much of it is just pushing,

1719
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,431
pushing,
pushing,

1720
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:33,264
pushing.
It's like you're sprinting up these 

1721
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:37,740
hills and you're,
your body's just used to those bursts,

1722
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,723
you know?
And so now when I go crazy on the heavy 

1723
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:42,680
bag,
I buy,

1724
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:42,961
buy,
buy,

1725
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:43,530
buy,
boom.

1726
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,940
And then the bell would go off and I'm 
like,

1727
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,830
oh good.
It's crazy.

1728
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,020
Like it's amazing.
It's,

1729
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,690
and it does so much for your legs to Oh 
yeah.

1730
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,550
People always ask me,
you know,

1731
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:56,550
what I do for legs?
And it's like I just run mountains.

1732
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,750
I mean,
and it's,

1733
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:58,860
you know,
yeah.

1734
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,170
There was a famous kickboxer from 
Montreal,

1735
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,063
his name was John Eve terrio.
He was like the most scary kickboxer in 

1736
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:09,150
the world in the PKA karate days.
And uh,

1737
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,080
all he did was he would run stairs.
Like that was the,

1738
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:16,650
the big workout that he ran.
He wrote a book on training and uh,

1739
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,900
you know what it takes to be a world 
champion.

1740
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,270
And one of the things that he's saying 
is you got to run stairs.

1741
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,180
He's like running stairs.
He's like,

1742
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:26,100
have been the best thing for his kicking
power for his endurance,

1743
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:27,690
for the,
I remember thinking that.

1744
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:31,190
And you're just talking about how just 
put inches on his thighs and it's just,

1745
01:12:31,191 --> 01:12:34,980
it radically increased his lung capacity
and kicking power.

1746
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,530
Speaking of,
uh,

1747
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,570
endurance,
I dunno if we were,

1748
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:42,740
but I will.
But Francis and Ghana,

1749
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,330
he got gassed out.
He did well.

1750
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,820
He tried to take steep pay out in the 
first round.

1751
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:48,780
He,
that was his,

1752
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,400
his thought was that steep pace,
not going to be a survivor.

1753
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,560
Didn't happen.
It's not good.

1754
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:53,370
It's fucked.
Yeah.

1755
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,780
And he doesn't know how to wrestle that.
Well.

1756
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,320
He's doesn't have,
he doesn't have a long background in,

1757
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,240
uh,
in martial arts at all.

1758
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,133
And Steve Bay was a very good college 
wrestler and obviously a bad 

1759
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,320
motherfucker,
you know,

1760
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,100
he took some hard shots to,
he did.

1761
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,690
You know,
that's the thing about Steve paid.

1762
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,330
It's not just that he knows how to 
fight,

1763
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:15,360
it's,
he's just fucking tough.

1764
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,790
It's just,
there's a bunch of shit going on there.

1765
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:18,624
It's experience.
It's just sheer toughness and grit and 

1766
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,730
determination.
And he also,

1767
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,840
he knows how to ride out bad moments.
Like Francis had never had a bad moment.

1768
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,610
Right.
He didn't know what the fuck to do.

1769
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,730
I think most people,
I know you,

1770
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,450
you,
you didn't,

1771
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,640
but I think most people had kind of 
assumed,

1772
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,320
oh,
Frances is gonna win this fight.

1773
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,660
I thought it's very possible.
Francis could win.

1774
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,494
The fight.
I thought it was very possible that 

1775
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,770
Francis could just newcomb in the first 
round.

1776
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,380
He's just so scary.
Yeah.

1777
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,530
Yeah.
It just takes one.

1778
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,423
No,
I've never seen anyone in all of my 

1779
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:54,060
history of watching mma.
That's so terrifying with one punch.

1780
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:54,894
Yeah.
Yeah.

1781
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,370
And he's just punching to this kicks or 
you know,

1782
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,910
they're okay.
He's not,

1783
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,750
but he's not like a,
you know,

1784
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:03,870
he's not Edson Barboza or someone who 
could put you to sleep with one kick.

1785
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:04,883
He's not kicking people.
He's just moving towards you throwing a 

1786
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:07,854
few kicks maybe.
But what he's trying to do is hit you 

1787
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:14,390
with those giant fucking canned hams 
that he calls his fists.

1788
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,520
And even when he was so gassed,
he could barely do anything.

1789
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:22,270
I was taking up,
just taste still one big tired heavy arm

1790
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,830
could do it.
Oh yeah.

1791
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:29,310
100% that guy still has unbelievable 
potential if he could get it together.

1792
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,980
But when he needs to do,
and this is critical,

1793
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:34,623
he needs to work on his ground game,
needs to work on his wrestling and he 

1794
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:41,851
needs to be with a real top flight mma 
camp who's trains him now he trains with

1795
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:46,090
the guy who found him.
Um,

1796
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,800
I forgot the gentleman's name,
but uh,

1797
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,960
the guy's done an amazing job of 
building his skills up and you know,

1798
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:53,794
in five years.
And the thing is Frances is so goddamn 

1799
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,220
good that most people,
he spars with most people,

1800
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:01,054
he fights with our fucked,
when buddy runs the top of the food 

1801
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,614
chain and got like Steve Bay,
Steve Bay can avoid all the dangerous 

1802
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,390
stuff,
drag them into deep water,

1803
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,250
get his,
get him diminished,

1804
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:15,670
diminishes his endurance and his ability
and then overwhelm them,

1805
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,780
which is what Steve Bay did.

1806
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,020
Yeah.
But Francis can learn from that.

1807
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,183
He can learn from that.
He can learn from that and he can get 

1808
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:25,230
better at all those areas that he had 
problems with.

1809
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,680
Tired.
Yeah.

1810
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,050
But he can get the endurance is 
something you can work on.

1811
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:31,270
You can work on all those things.
I just don't know how.

1812
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,880
I'm sure he worked hard.
I'm absolutely sure,

1813
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:34,983
but I don't know how hard he was pushed.
So there's a difference between working 

1814
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:39,430
hard and being pushed,
right?

1815
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,413
Like if you,
if he's trained with a guy like Cain 

1816
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,053
Velasquez,
for instance,

1817
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,530
prime time,
Cain Velasquez,

1818
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,770
if keynes in his prime,
Kate's taking him down left and right,

1819
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:49,360
he's going to try to have to get up all 
the time.

1820
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:52,090
He's doing rounds of cane.
You're going through how you get through

1821
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:55,360
five minutes of hell,
and when that bell goes off to it to end

1822
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,040
the five minutes of hell,
you're just like,

1823
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,180
Holy Shit.

1824
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,781
Yeah.
You know,

1825
01:15:58,781 --> 01:15:59,650
you've watched the,
the,

1826
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:04,620
the training camps with Daniel Cormier 
and Luke rockhold and Cain Velasquez,

1827
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,463
some of the footage.
There's a reason why those guys are so 

1828
01:16:07,211 --> 01:16:10,000
God damn good because iron sharpens 
iron.

1829
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:10,863
It's right.
Those guys are in their world champions 

1830
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,880
going at it with each other on a daily 
basis and because of that,

1831
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:21,120
that's what turned them into those 
fucking monsters they are today.

1832
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah.
Frances is just a physical freak.

1833
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,320
Yeah.
But if he was in that camp,

1834
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,480
whole leash shit.
Yeah,

1835
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,820
that'd be,
that'd be amazing.

1836
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,780
It'd be amazing to see what,
what he could do.

1837
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:32,710
Yeah.
I don't know.

1838
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,260
The problem is sparring with that guy.
Like if you're,

1839
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,650
if Francis spars,
the way they spar because dcs,

1840
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,990
they go hard.
Don't go.

1841
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,820
They go a little hard.
Isn't that kind of maybe too hard?

1842
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,610
That's the argument.
Just two arguments.

1843
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,473
There's one argument is that they're 
going through that is why they're so 

1844
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:52,730
successful in world championship fights 
that they know what to buy.

1845
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,850
They know what the fire feels like.
Yeah.

1846
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:58,500
The other thing is that they're also 
increase their,

1847
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,840
they get injured a lot.
Yeah.

1848
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,260
That camp gets injured a lot,
but it's also,

1849
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,140
there are so fucking good.
Who could,

1850
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:05,974
they got hubby.
You've never come at off Luke rockhold 

1851
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,270
Daniel Cormier Day

1852
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,780
cane,
motherfucking Velasquez.

1853
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:12,614
It's not,
you can't argue with that one camp in 

1854
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:17,180
San Jose.
That's because some of the best fighters

1855
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:19,910
that have ever done the sport.
Then on top of that,

1856
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:21,470
Josh Thompson,
you know,

1857
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,380
they had Josh Koscheck for a while and 
he was at the top of his game.

1858
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,720
Some fucking killers have come from Aka,
so you could look at it two ways.

1859
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:30,554
You could say one,
they're beating each other up too much 

1860
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:34,070
or too,
that's what you gotta do.

1861
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,340
You gotta do to be a world champion.
It's uh,

1862
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,020
it's hard to say.
I mean,

1863
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,750
I was still to this day when Kane was in
his prime,

1864
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,810
I never saw a heavyweight like that 
before ever.

1865
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,640
The fucking endurance that guy had was 
off the charts.

1866
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,913
It's not like nothing.
You would see guys just should be 

1867
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:50,563
overwhelmed.
They couldn't imagine how the fuck he 

1868
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:53,504
could do this.

1869
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,433
Like where's he getting his second round
would come around and have this look on 

1870
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,150
their face and cain would just be like,
like you just woke up.

1871
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,880
Like he's not even,
he's not even starting to really sweat.

1872
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:02,763
Yeah.
Beat the shit out him for the second 

1873
01:18:03,961 --> 01:18:04,420
round.
Pete,

1874
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:07,280
the shit on for the,
they would just wilt under the pressure.

1875
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,470
Yeah.
You see those fights where,

1876
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,000
I mean not,
not him,

1877
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,970
but I mean even now or,
uh,

1878
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,740
it's just an onslaught and you're just 
like,

1879
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,770
man,
you feel bad for well that,

1880
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,360
that uh,
who was at the other night,

1881
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,160
uh,
Chanko that did you see that fine.

1882
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:25,370
He's just quiet.
I was like,

1883
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:26,204
can this fight get over?
Because they should have stopped that 

1884
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:30,110
fight a long time.
Moodle.

1885
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,870
I should have been stopped 15 or 20 
times.

1886
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,910
Oh my God.
It was brutal.

1887
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,073
Yeah.
Mario Yamasaki said he gave her the 

1888
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,380
opportunity to be a warrior.

1889
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,760
That's what he said.
That was his,

1890
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,590
his take on it.
Oh Man.

1891
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:46,690
I mean he was getting beat up,
not just beat up the,

1892
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:50,540
did you see the stats,
the actual physical striking stats,

1893
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,170
the significant strikes.
Did she land any one?

1894
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,610
Okay.
And Valentine,

1895
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,473
she landed one like,
I think it was some unbelievably 

1896
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:02,954
overwhelming number.
Like one versus several hundred in the 

1897
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:09,290
significant strike department.
Like literally shit.

1898
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:11,760
Mike landed one pretty decent punch 
shift.

1899
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:12,594
Chank goes,
she looked like a guy up there with a 

1900
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:16,010
big heart,
elbows,

1901
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:16,851
you know,
come into,

1902
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:19,130
I mean,
just like just power guy.

1903
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,160
Sexist much.
Someone's a fucking sexist.

1904
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:24,740
Did you notice that Jamie?
Oh Jesus.

1905
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,340
That's world champion Moy.
Tai kickbox.

1906
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,780
Well it looks like a world champion 
woman.

1907
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,070
You son of a bitch.
I'm getting,

1908
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,770
I'm getting read the riot act over here.
You gotta be careful these days.

1909
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:38,480
People turn on you.
I hate that.

1910
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,890
I hate that.
That,

1911
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,030
that really irritates me.
Oh,

1912
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,530
I think I'm going.
Yeah.

1913
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,090
Why is it wrong to say she looks like a 
guy?

1914
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,920
I don't know.
She's a woman.

1915
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:49,763
You son of a bitch.
That's why I would just talking more 

1916
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:53,520
about the power.
Okay.

1917
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,000
You just don't see women.
Um,

1918
01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:00,670
you know the strikes 95 to two.
Oh,

1919
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:04,340
but you can still see women like coming 
down hard like that.

1920
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,530
Have you before?
Um,

1921
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:08,010
yeah.
Cotsen Guano

1922
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,330
cats and dogs can do that when they're 
on that,

1923
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:16,560
that,
that top position and just raining part.

1924
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,870
It's just like,
I just haven't seen it that often.

1925
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:19,591
No,
it's,

1926
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:21,960
there's not a lot of women that can 
throw down like that.

1927
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:22,794
And I've,
Valentino is one of the most well 

1928
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:25,580
rounded women in the sport.
She's,

1929
01:20:25,581 --> 01:20:28,710
yeah,
she subbed Julianna Pena off her back.

1930
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,000
She,
you know,

1931
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:32,880
she stands up and out strikes holiday 
home.

1932
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:33,983
She went toe to toe with a Amanda Nunez.
She went toe to toe with some of the 

1933
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,100
best kick boxers in the worst.
She's a world champion,

1934
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:43,850
Moy Thai fighter,
and she's just a fucking beast man.

1935
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:48,360
Yeah.
All around just bad bad ass fighter.

1936
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,850
There was an argument that she won that 
the,

1937
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:54,630
for the championship against doing is 
super close fight.

1938
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:57,660
I didn't think it was a bad decision,
but I thought it was a,

1939
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,830
it was a very close fight.

1940
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah.
It's hard,

1941
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:00,894
you know,
and it's hard for me calling fights 

1942
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,360
because of I'm calling them,
I'm just looking at what's happening.

1943
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,220
I'm trying to talk,
but I'm not scoring it,

1944
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,320
you know,
I don't score it.

1945
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,613
Score it.
You gotta keep your mouth shut and you 

1946
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:14,400
should have a piece of paper in front of
you.

1947
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,650
And you know,
Eddie Bravo used to do it.

1948
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,730
Uh,
for the UFC,

1949
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:21,030
he used to score in between rounds and 
he had a great system where he would put

1950
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:21,864
a line down the center of a paper and 
it'd be like one opponent on the left 

1951
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,600
side and the other one on the right 
side.

1952
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,673
And then he would write down like kicks 
takedowns submission attempts and all 

1953
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:33,990
that stuff.
And then defense,

1954
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:37,580
those are little categories.
And they would put checkmarks Hash marks

1955
01:21:37,581 --> 01:21:38,340
to one.
Yeah.

1956
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,173
And then he would go over why he thought
someone won and what kind of score he 

1957
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:42,570
get.

1958
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,403
He had a very good system and I think 
that's the only way to fairly judge a 

1959
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:48,691
fight.
Right.

1960
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:49,524
When your class,
it's like Valentino Shift Gencos fight 

1961
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:53,640
where you just go like,
what the fuck?

1962
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:57,060
I gave her like 10 to two.
I mean it was,

1963
01:21:57,061 --> 01:21:59,760
it wasn't so overwhelming.
I mean,

1964
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:00,151
yeah,
a 10,

1965
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:02,070
eight round is a disgrace.
It's like a 10,

1966
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:03,840
six or if you gave it just a 10,
eight,

1967
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:04,980
you'd be like,
who the fuck are you?

1968
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:06,720
[inaudible] Shit,
judge you God,

1969
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,220
that was crazy.
Yeah.

1970
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,430
Yeah.
Um,

1971
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,411
yeah,
it's,

1972
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:11,244
um,
it was a bad matchup because that girl 

1973
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,780
was there,
I believe that was her ufc debut.

1974
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:16,763
So to have a UFC debut against a woman 
who has fought for the title against a 

1975
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:21,743
world class striker,
I mean literally one of the very best 

1976
01:22:25,411 --> 01:22:30,040
strikers on the planet earth,
male or female and just on,

1977
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,073
it's not fair.

1978
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,240
You know,
that was her first fight at one 25,

1979
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:34,440
wasn't it?
Valentina's yes.

1980
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:35,130
Yeah,
yeah,

1981
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:35,791
yeah.
Well,

1982
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,460
Valentine fought,
uh,

1983
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,440
you want to,
you and Jay check in Moitai Thai and uh,

1984
01:22:40,441 --> 01:22:42,580
so she beat her.
Hmm.

1985
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,460
Um,
I think,

1986
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:49,710
I think they fought more than once,
but I believe Valentino beater.

1987
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:53,250
I hope I'm not wrong because I'm around 
a lot.

1988
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,930
I'm excited for that arose.
Uh,

1989
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,260
now in unison you want to and Jay check 
where you met.

1990
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:58,891
Yeah.
Well,

1991
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,260
you know rose trains with Valentino.
Oh,

1992
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,520
that's her main sparring.
Oh,

1993
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:03,354
really?
Yeah.

1994
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,980
Yeah.
That's a good camp.

1995
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,100
Then just those having those

1996
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,830
two there dough to work off each other.
Yeah.

1997
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,860
Phenomenal.
For rose and for Valentino,

1998
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,540
it's going to be tough for rose to come 
now as the champion.

1999
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:17,883
I don't know.
It'd be interesting to see how if it 

2000
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:23,020
changes at all.
Oh yeah.

2001
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:26,140
It will definitely be interesting and 
coming into this fight,

2002
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,023
what's fascinating to me,
even though rose one by first round 

2003
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:30,850
knockout,
she's the the underdog.

2004
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:32,050
Yeah.
Well it's,

2005
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:37,650
I put up that clip of it when she was 
like saying the Lord's prayer there.

2006
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:41,290
When you're up there in years talking 
about how it was terrifying or something

2007
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,820
like that.
I put up that little quip.

2008
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,650
It was,
that was crazy.

2009
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,620
Oh,
he's no one is from you guys.

2010
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,540
Yeah.
Before on fight night before the fight,

2011
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:53,380
you guys were standing there and there.
They're showing that from the way in and

2012
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,000
Oh my God,
that was classic.

2013
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,833
Yeah.
She was so in the zone that you wanna 

2014
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,400
was talking shit to where you're going 
to fuck you up.

2015
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,610
I'm going to fuck up your bogey.
I'm boogie woman.

2016
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,020
She's talking all this crazy shit to her
and rose just going,

2017
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,990
our father who art in heaven,
I won't be that name.

2018
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,670
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done.

2019
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:14,290
And she was like in this zone where you 
want to put her fist on her nose.

2020
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:17,110
And she didn't even flinch.
That was the only one that,

2021
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:21,220
and I said because they had something 
off about fighter of the year I think.

2022
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:23,830
But that was,
I get fired up for all the fights,

2023
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,730
but that was the only fight that I was 
standing up.

2024
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,880
Like I was cause the Washington at home 
and I'm just like,

2025
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:32,380
oh my God.
You know,

2026
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:37,390
cause she was landing those that hard 
punches and it was,

2027
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,410
I dunno.

2028
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,990
It's amazing.
Yeah.

2029
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,290
It was amazing.
Amazing.

2030
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,473
A lot of people thought she had a chance
by submission because I'm a units is a 

2031
01:24:45,101 --> 01:24:47,440
really good submission artist and she's 
really fast.

2032
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,780
Like she'll throw up flying armbars and 
shit.

2033
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:51,910
She's wild.
Crazy chances.

2034
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:54,780
Yeah.
But for her to win by k like that,

2035
01:24:54,781 --> 01:24:56,440
it was like,
holy show it.

2036
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,590
I know it.
I was so pumped when Daniel Cormier just

2037
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:02,200
starts yelling out the thug.
Oh my God.

2038
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,450
That was amazing.
Yeah.

2039
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,293
It was one of my favorite moments of 
doing commentary of be just being next 

2040
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:10,084
to him while he was yelling that out.
Cause it was just pure excitement and 

2041
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:15,220
appreciation and joy,
you know,

2042
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:17,960
he's just having a good time.
Does he know her then too or do they,

2043
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,420
I mean they all know each other.
Oh,

2044
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,030
how well not training together?
No,

2045
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:22,864
I don't believe so.

2046
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,420
Not the same camp.
I mean maybe she's done some training at

2047
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:26,021
Aka.
I don't,

2048
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:27,220
I'm not aware of,
but she's,

2049
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,640
she's in Colorado.
She's as Trevor Whitman and uh,

2050
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:31,240
her,
uh,

2051
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,350
boyfriend,
Pat Barry,

2052
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:33,184
who's a worldclass kickboxer,
he's a really good a MMA fighter as 

2053
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:38,740
well.
When he remember him fight in the UFC,

2054
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:41,220
he had some wild ass fight.
He's a serious striker.

2055
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,510
Pat Barry can fucking crack.
I,

2056
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:44,670
I remember,
I mean,

2057
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,850
I thought he was fighting.
Let's see who was that?

2058
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:49,684
And it's like,
I thought he was knocked out basically 

2059
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:54,580
and then landed one big one or maybe 
it's the other way around.

2060
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,600
Yeah,
he was fine.

2061
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:59,410
Check Congo Congo completely out of it.
Yes.

2062
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:03,770
And he just went in for broke and check 
Congo caught him with a crazy kod.

2063
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,220
Yeah,

2064
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,910
that was it.
I remember that fight.

2065
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,690
That was nuts.
It was nuts.

2066
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:10,910
But that's just how pat fights.
He's a wild man.

2067
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,830
He just fights wild.
Yeah,

2068
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:13,683
he's,
he was,

2069
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:16,550
I remember he was like thick and could 
punch.

2070
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,780
Yeah,
he's a tank.

2071
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,050
Yeah.
It's ruthless leg kicks.

2072
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,670
He got some of the best leg kicks I've 
ever seen.

2073
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:25,490
The heavyweight division.
Those are,

2074
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:28,880
those are those lake you into that I 
just heard you talk about the other day.

2075
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:31,400
But those low leg kicks her new thing 
nowadays.

2076
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,460
Yeah.
Well Benson Henderson started doing that

2077
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:35,294
a long time ago.
He was one of the first guys to 

2078
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,690
introduce it to mma.
But um,

2079
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,840
he had some success with it.
But not like you've seen today.

2080
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:45,080
Like you're seeing guys getting 
debilitated like really quickly.

2081
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:49,460
It must be a new,
so it's a weak spot for on humans,

2082
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:50,570
I guess.
Well,

2083
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:51,404
a hard discipline.
Their loans that Moitai fighters known 

2084
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:55,754
about forever,
that MMA fighters are just starting to 

2085
01:26:57,291 --> 01:27:00,500
figure out the same as with kickboxing 
and karate.

2086
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:04,100
There's a lot of karate moves that MMA 
fighters don't,

2087
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,960
are not good at,
but karate guys are and karate guys come

2088
01:27:06,961 --> 01:27:09,110
into mma like Steven Tompkins,
uhs,

2089
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:11,090
Thompson Thompson's,
wonderboy,

2090
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,500
wonderboy,
Tompkin,

2091
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:13,543
Tom,
she keeps saying Tompkins cause of Sean 

2092
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:17,660
Tompkins.
Uh,

2093
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,493
but a wonderboy is doing things from a 
sideways karate stance that a lot of 

2094
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,200
people aren't just don't know how to 
handle.

2095
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:28,263
Like wonderboy has these crazy front leg
side kicks in front leg roundhouse 

2096
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:32,174
kicks.
Like if you ever watched his fight with 

2097
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:35,930
a Johnny Hendricks is one of the best 
examples.

2098
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,560
He hits Johnny Hendricks,
the gut with a sidekick.

2099
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,070
And then Johnny Hendricks cause is still
there.

2100
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:43,410
So he roundhouse kicks him in the face 
with the same leg and you see Johnny,

2101
01:27:43,411 --> 01:27:44,570
he's like,
what in the fuck?

2102
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,110
Cause it's just something like,
it's amazing to see that and training.

2103
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:52,900
You don't know a lot of guys that you 
have to get a really good karate guy and

2104
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,980
most really good karate guys.

2105
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,720
He's just gonna be able to take them 
down.

2106
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,430
Yeah.
But you know,

2107
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:04,450
wonderboy is just got that style just 
dialed in and nailed and he moves like a

2108
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:07,510
snake from the waist.
Like he moves backwards from the weight,

2109
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:09,950
like he gets away from Shit and then 
fires back at Ya.

2110
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,170
He looked good and that last fight,
yeah,

2111
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:13,800
it gets jorge him on speed dial.
Yeah,

2112
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,631
yeah,
yeah.

2113
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:17,120
So that's a different style.
And so these,

2114
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:17,983
these techniques,
like he's exceptionally good at those 

2115
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:24,320
karate techniques and a lot of people 
aren't.

2116
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:29,060
And so with Moitai most of the time when
guys were learning more time,

2117
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:32,090
bringing it into mma,
they were doing a few things.

2118
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:32,953
They were throwing the leg kicks,
they were throwing the knees to the 

2119
01:28:34,431 --> 01:28:35,480
body,
the elbows,

2120
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,730
normal,
normal Moitai techniques.

2121
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:39,650
But they're missing some of the 
subtleties.

2122
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,573
So some of the better Moyie Thai 
fighters started training with some of 

2123
01:28:42,771 --> 01:28:43,604
the better MMA fighters.
And then slowly but surely those 

2124
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:46,880
techniques started leaking in.
I see.

2125
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:50,430
And then the big one now is that low 
like Kik,

2126
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,860
that low leg kicks motherfucker,
man,

2127
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:56,180
it just takes out your,
you can't condition your lower leg.

2128
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:57,210
That's what I'm saying.
It's in,

2129
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:58,580
it feels like it's a weeks.
I mean,

2130
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:00,140
cause I know,
uh,

2131
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,190
Michael Chandler,
he got

2132
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,023
caught with that and that's how we lost 
the belt and kill the nerves in his 

2133
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:06,780
legs.
And it's like,

2134
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,890
it looked like his leg was broke,
his ankle is flopping all around.

2135
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:11,724
You could,
you would swear that that leg was broke 

2136
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,423
and it must've just been those low leg 
kicks down there and just deaden the 

2137
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,130
nerve.
Yeah.

2138
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,700
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

2139
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:21,534
How many,
um,

2140
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,910
how many fighter like,
um,

2141
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,510
Gilbert Melendez,
uh,

2142
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:25,344
when he fought Jeremy Stevens,
Jeremy Stephens cracked him real early 

2143
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:29,454
in the first round without low leg kick 
and you see it immediately swelling up 

2144
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,200
and then Gilbert has fallen down on it.
He keeps,

2145
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,990
can't stand up on it.
It's crazy.

2146
01:29:35,991 --> 01:29:38,550
Yeah.
Douglas Lema and Rory Macdonald,

2147
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:43,790
Rory Macdonald in Beltour right into the
same thing right into the lower leg.

2148
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,960
It's,
he had a giant Hematoma.

2149
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:48,260
He was fucking huge.
Yeah.

2150
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,130
Yeah.
It's a devastating technique.

2151
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,480
Yeah.
Well,

2152
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,440
it's interesting.

2153
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,850
It's,
I just love that.

2154
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:58,620
I love when new elements get brought 
into this very complex sport.

2155
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,730
Yeah.
I mean,

2156
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:00,990
and that's like,
yeah,

2157
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,450
that,
that's just been an a new one for sure.

2158
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:06,090
Um,
but this Saturday,

2159
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,420
are you going to be at the keep 
hammering run this Saturday just to keep

2160
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:11,430
hammering run where?
Salt Lake.

2161
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,310
I didn't know there was one.
No,

2162
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,000
no.
I'm going to be here now.

2163
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,170
Remember that?
Uh,

2164
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,850
you went to that show?
Yeah,

2165
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:20,130
I did go to that show.
I just went to that show by accident.

2166
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,680
The western hunting close doesn't town 
skiing,

2167
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:24,380
which I fucking hate.
Yeah.

2168
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:27,000
I don't hate skiing,
but I'm not a fan.

2169
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,880
This is boring.
You just dislike it a lot.

2170
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,160
I just don't get it.
Every time I do it,

2171
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:33,510
I'm like,
maybe this time I'm going to get it.

2172
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,370
There's going to be the day where I'm an
employee.

2173
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,250
I'm going to be in bliss.
I'm going to slide down that mountain.

2174
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:42,570
People who goose cause you knew a good,
I did it for five years.

2175
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,060
I got pretty good at it.
I didn't get good at it.

2176
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:46,830
Like I couldn't enter a skiing 
competition,

2177
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:49,410
but I don't fall down anymore.
I know how to stop.

2178
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,990
I know how to ski.
I just don't get it.

2179
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:54,330
So I was there and then I was like,
what?

2180
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:57,480
There's a hunting expo and I fucking 
snuck away for a day.

2181
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:58,830
I had a great time with you.
It was like,

2182
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:00,480
this is so much better.
Yeah.

2183
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,590
So that's this weekend that show.
Oh,

2184
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,530
and you have a keep hammering run in 
Utah.

2185
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,690
Where's it at?
It's a,

2186
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,390
if it's the same place as last year,
it's this,

2187
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:10,170
right?
I mean,

2188
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:13,830
we started the capital there in Salt 
Lake Capitol building,

2189
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:15,690
and then you run a five k from there.

2190
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:16,763
Oh,
okay.

2191
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,050
Yeah.
So it's a Saturday morning.

2192
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:22,130
I'm a big fan of salt lake.
I love that town too.

2193
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,430
It's fucking great.
Yeah.

2194
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:24,660
I mean it takes people,
man.

2195
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,970
All I know there are so nice.
The best.

2196
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,660
I mean,
I know,

2197
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,400
it's weird.
There's a lot of Mormons there.

2198
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,020
I know people get weirded out by more 
ways.

2199
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:33,660
Did the nicest people.
They're so nice.

2200
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,930
Like I don't care what wacky shit you 
believe.

2201
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:39,400
As long as you're nice.
That's it.

2202
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,890
Yeah.
Just be nice.

2203
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:42,120
That's it.
Yeah.

2204
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:44,970
So that's uh,
I'm excited it's going to be,

2205
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:48,120
uh,
I think we were hoping to have,

2206
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,910
kind of want to think we had a few 
hundred last year,

2207
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:52,350
so yeah.
Nice.

2208
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,570
As can be.
And then,

2209
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:57,600
uh,
we'll do that Saturday and then we'll be

2210
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,580
back in September.
Oh,

2211
01:31:58,581 --> 01:32:00,370
cunning.
Ooh.

2212
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,530
Do you remember that?
Remember El Canyon in Utah?

2213
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,193
We only got to 470,000 views.
We're going to do a podcast when we get 

2214
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:09,550
to 500,000.
What's it out right now?

2215
01:32:09,551 --> 01:32:12,880
Jamie?
Go to the UAE hunt youtube page.

2216
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:15,100
We might have to cancel this son of a 
bitch.

2217
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:18,160
Yeah.
We're hoping to do a podcast when it hit

2218
01:32:18,161 --> 01:32:20,350
500,000,
but it petered out.

2219
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,370
It did petered out at about four,
four 71 to 70.

2220
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,150
So we got a thousand today,
so we just need a few more days.

2221
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,800
Good.
But end of the month.

2222
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:32,560
Yeah,
we'll cut and close.

2223
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,050
We'll hit it by the end of the month.
Hey.

2224
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:36,280
And then,
then also,

2225
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:38,080
uh,
this weekend,

2226
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:38,943
um,
the secretary of the Interior Zinky on 

2227
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:46,330
Friday is going to announce a,
a a big,

2228
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:49,840
I think it's a big win for 
conservationists and,

2229
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,530
um,
again,

2230
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:52,803
we're going to protect the winter 
migration routes for deer and elk from 

2231
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:58,540
development.
So that's been a big thing that,

2232
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,153
you know,
like,

2233
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:02,590
um,
I told,

2234
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:04,810
I told them when I met with them back in
Vegas,

2235
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:07,900
I don't know when it was a couple of 
weeks ago that it feels like we've taken

2236
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,970
some hits as sportsman,
as far as,

2237
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:13,330
um,
the national monuments being shrunk,

2238
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:15,550
you know,
and you can argue that both ways,

2239
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:17,420
uh,
drilling on the,

2240
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:18,400
on the coast,
you know,

2241
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:20,980
a lot of people don't like the prospects
of that.

2242
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,420
So I'm like,
man,

2243
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:26,240
we could use it when and brought up the 
winter migration routes and uh,

2244
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,273
protecting those from,
from any development just so those 

2245
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:32,140
animals can get down and get to the 
winter range.

2246
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,420
Um,
when food is hard to come by.

2247
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:35,254
And so that's,
that's going to be announced on Friday 

2248
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:39,880
that he's going to make that happen.
That's awesome.

2249
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:43,060
And now you have a position there as 
well.

2250
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:44,770
Like what,
what is your official position?

2251
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:46,263
That's it.
I'm on the International Wildlife 

2252
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:50,930
Conservation Council,
which has,

2253
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,410
doesn't have anything to do with North 
America,

2254
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:58,411
but I'm just kind of using that as an 
excuse to talk about North America.

2255
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:00,070
It doesn't have anything to do with 
North America.

2256
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,200
Now what does it have to do with,
uh,

2257
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:03,043
with that,
that's about like the trophy export ban 

2258
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,470
from Africa.
Oh,

2259
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,300
so international hunting basically.
And so it,

2260
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,313
it's a weighing in on that because it's 
like if you go to Australia and you 

2261
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:20,320
shoot some animals,
you can't bring the meat back.

2262
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:21,580
Um,
well,

2263
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:23,380
yeah,
but that's different.

2264
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,340
Yeah.
It's different.

2265
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,210
Well,
that,

2266
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:27,730
that doesn't have anything to do with 
what's going on right now.

2267
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,700
It's Africa and like with elephants 
coming back,

2268
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:33,580
so when you can't bring your trophy 
back,

2269
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,563
yeah.
Who's going to want to go shoot and not 

2270
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:38,590
just elephants because elephants are a 
whole different category,

2271
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:41,140
but who's going to go want to shoot a 
gazelle?

2272
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,121
Well,
if you,

2273
01:34:42,121 --> 01:34:44,230
if you can't bring it back.
Yeah.

2274
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:47,620
Right.
I don't know if those are regulated,

2275
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:52,621
but it's mostly elephants and you know,
in lions and lions they reversed it.

2276
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:57,380
And then trump said,
fuck that trump doesn't like it.

2277
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,340
Which is fascinating

2278
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,173
because his sons,

2279
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,470
yeah,
big hunters.

2280
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:01,310
Right,
right.

2281
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,500
He called it a horror show.
He did.

2282
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:06,200
And that's what got my attention.
It's because he said that he doesn't see

2283
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,260
how conservation helps elephants,
which,

2284
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:10,280
okay,
that's one thing.

2285
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,830
But then he said,
or any other animals and I'm like,

2286
01:35:12,831 --> 01:35:14,210
wait a second.
Okay.

2287
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:15,044
You can't,
we can't say conservation hunting as a 

2288
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,163
conservation tool doesn't help any other
animals because we've proven here in 

2289
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:22,760
North America.
It's that it's a model that works.

2290
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,990
So I didn't like how he worded that and 
lump that all on together.

2291
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,760
Now Mike was that,
I was,

2292
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:31,640
was that just a poorly worded tweet?
What's going on here?

2293
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:34,880
So then he said he's going to look at 
that ban,

2294
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,430
um,
regarding elephants because,

2295
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:38,990
you know,
if there's no value on the animals,

2296
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:40,790
we know it,
we know what happens.

2297
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,910
Um,
and if there is no hunting,

2298
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,160
it's pretty much the death sentence of 
the animal.

2299
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:47,553
Well,
we'd probably have to explain that to a 

2300
01:35:48,731 --> 01:35:50,560
lot of people that don't know what we're
talking about.

2301
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:51,394
But Africa,
there's a lot of animals in Africa that 

2302
01:35:53,651 --> 01:35:56,650
were on the verge of extinction just a 
few decades ago.

2303
01:35:57,070 --> 01:36:00,370
And what they did was,
it's a very controversial thing to,

2304
01:36:00,371 --> 01:36:03,400
especially to people that don't hunt.
But what they did was they created a lot

2305
01:36:03,401 --> 01:36:04,234
of these game preserves where they had 
these animals and they had a financial 

2306
01:36:09,701 --> 01:36:13,180
interest in keeping these animals alive 
cause people paid a lot of money to come

2307
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:14,014
over there and hunt them.
So now these animals that were on the 

2308
01:36:16,031 --> 01:36:16,864
verge of extinction just a couple of 
decades ago are thriving in record 

2309
01:36:19,961 --> 01:36:22,240
numbers,
but they get hunted.

2310
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:23,103
Yeah.
So for people that are concerned about 

2311
01:36:26,261 --> 01:36:28,630
the welfare of these animals and they're
they,

2312
01:36:28,631 --> 01:36:29,464
they're wa wildlife lovers,
they're in a weird predicament because 

2313
01:36:32,081 --> 01:36:34,480
it's hunting that's keeping these 
animals alive.

2314
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:39,040
And it seems like a contradiction.
Like how could hunting be conservation,

2315
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,690
right?
But even in this country,

2316
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,870
11% taxes on,
on bullets,

2317
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,913
on hunting equipment,
on all the different things that people 

2318
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:47,734
buy.
And this was a self imposed tax that 

2319
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,183
sportsmen put on the purchase of these 
goods so that it would go towards 

2320
01:36:54,101 --> 01:36:54,934
wildlife and billions of dollars,
billions of dollars have gone to 

2321
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,920
preserving wetlands,
preserving wildlife habitat,

2322
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:04,373
reestablishing populations of animals 
and all these different areas where 

2323
01:37:07,091 --> 01:37:07,924
they're diminished.
The amount of money that has gone 

2324
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:11,673
towards conservation from hunters versus
from Peta or the humane society or any 

2325
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:22,330
other welfare group,
it's not even remotely comparable.

2326
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,870
Hunters are making the difference there.
And we put our money where our mouth is,

2327
01:37:25,871 --> 01:37:27,040
you know,
we say we care about it,

2328
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,180
we,
we pay for it.

2329
01:37:28,181 --> 01:37:29,014
We,
we put money there to help conservation 

2330
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:31,354
and pay for the biologists and pay for 
the studies and pay for habitat 

2331
01:37:35,231 --> 01:37:36,064
enhancement.
And so that essentially is the same 

2332
01:37:38,711 --> 01:37:40,420
thing that needs to happen in Africa is,
but it's,

2333
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:41,254
it's weird to say,
well how can the United States regulate 

2334
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:46,150
what happens in Africa because we can't 
really,

2335
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,960
but we can say we're not going to allow 
the trophies you come home.

2336
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:53,110
So that pretty much stops a hunting in 
Africa.

2337
01:37:53,111 --> 01:37:53,501
So,
yeah,

2338
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:55,980
we're not saying you can or can't hunt 
can still go do it.

2339
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,813
You just can't bring them home,
which essentially stops a hunting 

2340
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:01,250
without hunting.
Those animals don't have value.

2341
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,093
No.
And no matter how you want to slice it 

2342
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:07,680
or phrase it or whatever you want,
if they don't have value,

2343
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,383
they're not going to,
it's going to be the detriment of the 

2344
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:12,360
animal of the specie.
Um,

2345
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,200
you know,
Kenya,

2346
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:18,200
they stopped hunting in 1973 and 70% of 
the animals are gone with no hunting.

2347
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,520
Yeah.
It's very confusing.

2348
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,890
It's as it seems contradictory.
It does.

2349
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:27,120
And it's like,
uh,

2350
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,140
you know,
I talked to with,

2351
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:28,921
um,
you know,

2352
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:31,470
Zinky about this also.
And so that's what this,

2353
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,513
this council was about to try to make a 
good decision on how best to regulate 

2354
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:37,253
the trophies coming home and,
and maybe we can help promote hunting 

2355
01:38:41,531 --> 01:38:43,230
and,
and how to do a ride and,

2356
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:44,970
and what it means,
um,

2357
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:45,750
as a council.

2358
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,910
So that's,
I'm involved in that.

2359
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:48,923
Um,
I use that opportunity to talk to them 

2360
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:53,160
about other things too.
But,

2361
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:54,420
uh,
so I dunno,

2362
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:57,030
I dunno where it's all gonna Kinda lead.
It's,

2363
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,313
it's a fascinating subject because 
elephants are endangered in some parts 

2364
01:39:01,951 --> 01:39:02,784
of Africa,
but Africa is an enormous place and in 

2365
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:08,010
other parts of Africa they have a 
problem with elephants.

2366
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,873
Yeah.
So going to those places and shooting 

2367
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:13,650
elephants to most people is a horrific 
offense.

2368
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,570
Yeah.
So,

2369
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:15,923
but the problem is I don't,
I don't see the amount of money that 

2370
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:20,880
someone has to pay to go and shoot an 
elephant.

2371
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:24,360
It's a crazy amount of money.
75,000 that's a lot of fucking money.

2372
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:28,350
How many people are spending $75,000 to 
go look at them or help them?

2373
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,360
They're not going to,
they're not going to know.

2374
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:31,410
And so,
and when you say,

2375
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:34,140
well that money could come from photo 
safaris?

2376
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,063
No.
And also with the one's going to pay 75 

2377
01:39:36,811 --> 01:39:39,960
grand to take a picture and for a photo 
safari,

2378
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:43,020
where they have them set up is that they
go on the pretty much the same route.

2379
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:44,790
So the habitat just gets hammered.
I mean,

2380
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:48,900
you know what a national monument or a 
national park here,

2381
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,180
the most popular places,
you know what those look like?

2382
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:52,443
Fricking dump.
So when you have those photos far as 

2383
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:57,690
they go on the same track,
basically you're hammering the habitat,

2384
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:58,553
you're not getting back to the back 
reaches where the poachers are killing 

2385
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:01,350
the animals,
you know,

2386
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:06,351
that's still happening back there.
And then to get a pride of lion in tour,

2387
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,203
you can take pictures of it.
They're still going out and shooting 

2388
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:10,300
zebras and,
and,

2389
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:13,440
and Paula and in different things.
Buffalo throwing them out there.

2390
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:14,790
So the,
so the lions are,

2391
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:15,540
they're eating.

2392
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,000
So there's still animals dying,
but they're just,

2393
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:22,800
the animals aren't benefiting from it.
So when you think of like in the Bush of

2394
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,490
Africa,
if uh,

2395
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:27,880
a farmer there has a crop and there's 
elephants getting in,

2396
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:31,920
they're thrashing his crop,
the elephant has no value to them.

2397
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:35,550
What has value as a crop?
And if the animal,

2398
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:37,920
if the elephants in,
they're trampling it.

2399
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:40,110
He just wants to elfant debt once 
they've gone.

2400
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:41,370
So he's going to shoot,
it's going to lay there.

2401
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:42,204
It's,
you're not going to benefit anybody but 

2402
01:40:43,591 --> 01:40:44,424
his crop grows and that's what happens.
It's just very hard for people to look 

2403
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:50,130
at it that way because they look at it 
like,

2404
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:51,690
no,
I don't want an elephant to die.

2405
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:53,950
No,
I want a lion to die.

2406
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:54,430
No,
no,

2407
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:55,263
no.
I don't want a zebra to die and I don't 

2408
01:40:56,171 --> 01:40:59,200
want to draft a die and we can go ahead 
and shoot that other thing.

2409
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,730
That wart hog,
the ugly thing,

2410
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:02,043
nobody gives a fuck about warhawks you 
can shoot warhawks and smile and take a 

2411
01:41:04,931 --> 01:41:05,764
picture and people are racist.
They were racist against certain 

2412
01:41:08,621 --> 01:41:10,270
animals.
That's a fact.

2413
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,081
Oh,
for sure.

2414
01:41:11,081 --> 01:41:12,010
For sure.
The fact,

2415
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:13,840
is it racism,
racism,

2416
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:18,670
race of speciesism or you speciest I am.
I sent you a video about that.

2417
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,250
Speciesist that's a fact.
But,

2418
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,290
and people way more than I like 
goldfish.

2419
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,480
And,
and with regard to lions,

2420
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:26,314
you know,
so if lions are coming in and killing 

2421
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:31,300
the goats or whatever that the say in 
Tanzania that they're raising,

2422
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,450
they're just going to put,
there'll be a dead goat.

2423
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:35,580
They'll put poison in it.
The,

2424
01:41:35,581 --> 01:41:37,090
the pride will come in,
eat it,

2425
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:37,780
they'll go die.

2426
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,290
Then no more goats are getting killed.
All those lines are dead.

2427
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,600
Well that was one of the things about 
Zimbabwe,

2428
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:44,740
right?
Um,

2429
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:47,680
was it Zimbabwe where that guy killed 
that lion?

2430
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,180
The Cecil?
Oh,

2431
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:50,014
I think so.
Yeah.

2432
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,153
That place they had to kill a bunch of 
lions because people stopped lion 

2433
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:58,300
hunting there.
And so because they stopped line hunting

2434
01:41:58,301 --> 01:41:59,134
there,
they had this excess of lions and they 

2435
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,354
were destroying the Angelo population.
So they had to go in and just slaughter 

2436
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:04,470
these lions.
Yeah.

2437
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:08,320
So the $50,000 per line that they would 
have made,

2438
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:11,380
that would have gone towards all sorts 
of different things,

2439
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:13,480
protection of the habitat,
the,

2440
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:16,930
the,
the different conservation officers that

2441
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:17,764
work in that area instead that there's 
no money and then they actually have to 

2442
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:23,980
hire someone to go and do that job.
Right.

2443
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:26,650
And this is the argument about British 
Columbia as well.

2444
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,290
This is exactly what's going to happen 
up there.

2445
01:42:29,291 --> 01:42:30,124
That the argument that you're getting 
from the people that are in the field 

2446
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:35,050
that are out there every day is that 
what's going to have to happen is you're

2447
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:35,884
going to have a bunch of problem bears.
They're going to have to hire people 

2448
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,290
that go out to these problem bears and 
it's incredibly expensive and very,

2449
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:42,620
very dangerous.
Yeah.

2450
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,400
And bears are going to die.
Yeah.

2451
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:47,790
So still still going to have of them.
Some of them are still going to die.

2452
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:49,630
Yeah.
But animals are going to die.

2453
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:50,583
You know what I mean?
Do you get mad when a bear kills an 

2454
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:55,350
antelope or when a bear kills a giraffe 
or,

2455
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:55,811
right.
Well,

2456
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:56,950
they don't really,
they're not over there.

2457
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,840
But if they were over here,
you know,

2458
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:01,120
if a bear kills a Moose,
are you upset?

2459
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:03,190
Are you only upset when a person killed 
a moose?

2460
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,930
Right.
And you know,

2461
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,230
in Africa too,
and so those animals are dying.

2462
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,363
Um,
and w when it's hunters that are doing 

2463
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,120
it,
the numbers are very controlled.

2464
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:17,200
The harvest is very controlled.
You can take x amount of animals out and

2465
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,620
this money will go towards,
you know,

2466
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:23,540
this enhancement of a waterhole,
this pain for um,

2467
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:27,070
the anti poaching unit,
which when I was over there was $1,000 a

2468
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:29,950
day to pay for guys to come in to,
to control,

2469
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,160
keep the poachers out of there without 
that money.

2470
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:34,720
Um,
none of that's happening.

2471
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:39,100
So there instead of having a very 
regulated harvest number,

2472
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:41,550
the poachers will kill hell over mini.
Yeah.

2473
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:42,723
And let's be honest about it,
the vast majority of the money is going 

2474
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:49,530
towards whatever lodge,
the owners of that for sure area.

2475
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,160
But they're also hiring people.
They are hiring people,

2476
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:54,650
but they have a financial incentive to 
keep these animals alive.

2477
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,753
It's very peaceful.
It's very problematic for a lot of 

2478
01:43:57,621 --> 01:43:58,730
people.
They don't like to hear it.

2479
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:00,770
And I've,
I've read this article that's ridiculous

2480
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:04,550
article that said that that's not true,
that trophy hunting is not what sustains

2481
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:05,870
these animals.
And you know,

2482
01:44:05,871 --> 01:44:08,990
you can get just as much from a safari.
Like that's not true.

2483
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:13,730
What you're saying is not true.
That CNN thing handled it pretty well.

2484
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:16,430
Did you watch that tracks?
What did you think about that?

2485
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:18,140
Um,
no,

2486
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,370
I,
I'm a hunter.

2487
01:44:19,371 --> 01:44:21,490
Said some stupid shit.
I didn't God,

2488
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,161
you know,
I mean,

2489
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:24,110
we talked about this earlier in the 
podcast,

2490
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:25,220
you know,
when people say,

2491
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,143
Oh,
you just want to go kill stuff and this 

2492
01:44:27,021 --> 01:44:27,854
and that.
I didn't really like when whoever the 

2493
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:31,790
hunter was,
I don't know.

2494
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:35,270
It's probably a nice guy.
But he shot a crocodile and he says,

2495
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,740
yeah,
mother effer.

2496
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:39,260
And I'm like,
what is going on there?

2497
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,393
I wouldn't know.
I've never done anything like that and 

2498
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:43,070
that,
that seemed,

2499
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:46,250
that isn't like the honorable hunter 
that I know,

2500
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,810
you know?
So that seems a little weird.

2501
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,790
I don't like crocodiles.
I might say.

2502
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:50,541
Yeah,
mother fucker.

2503
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:53,690
If I shot the crocodile crocodile,
scare the shit out of me.

2504
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:54,943
I'm here.
The one thing that scares me more than 

2505
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:58,100
any,
pretty much any animal on the planet.

2506
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:58,611
Yeah,
I know.

2507
01:44:58,611 --> 01:44:59,410
I just,
I,

2508
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:01,820
I still feel a lot of respect for the 
animal.

2509
01:45:01,821 --> 01:45:03,290
I'm joking around most of the,
I know,

2510
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,363
I know,
but I did just seem like a weird 

2511
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:06,620
reaction to me.
Well,

2512
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:09,140
especially knowing that the world is 
going to see that reaction.

2513
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:09,831
Yeah.
I mean,

2514
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:11,690
if he was just by himself and he said 
that,

2515
01:45:11,691 --> 01:45:12,524
and that was an honest reaction and 
who's still had respect for the animal 

2516
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:18,230
and it was just the fact that he pulled 
it off.

2517
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:19,940
Yeah.
It's unfortunate.

2518
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,440
It's unfortunate as,
uh,

2519
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,160
it's unfortunate to broadcast that for 
the world to see.

2520
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,900
Yeah.
I thought,

2521
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:27,763
I thought it could have been a lot worse
with regard to how hunters were 

2522
01:45:30,501 --> 01:45:31,610
portrayed.
You know,

2523
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:32,444
I mean,
um,

2524
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:36,590
even the guy who killed the lion,
he did get emotional.

2525
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,870
Um,
he showed some reverence there,

2526
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:40,010
which,
which I liked.

2527
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,260
Um,
it could have been worse.

2528
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:45,710
Uh,
they talked about how it's animals are,

2529
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,590
I guess a commodity in some respects 
with the rhinos.

2530
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:49,460
You know,
they,

2531
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:51,740
I think that guy had 1500 rhinos,
didn't he,

2532
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:54,380
on his property and uh,
you know,

2533
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:55,214
so what's better,
1500 rhinos for him to have and raise 

2534
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:01,190
and cut off the horns or zero.
Yeah.

2535
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:02,870
You know,
it's better to have 1500.

2536
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:03,681
Right?
Yeah.

2537
01:46:03,681 --> 01:46:04,514
Well,
it's definitely better for the 

2538
01:46:04,851 --> 01:46:05,684
population of rhinos as a whole because 
people don't like the idea of raising 

2539
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:12,410
something as a commodity,
raising wildlife as a commodity.

2540
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,333
I understand that.
Do you ever see the Louis through 

2541
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:18,830
documentary about wildlife in Africa 
about those,

2542
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:22,160
I forget what it was called,
but you can watch it on youtube.

2543
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,770
That to me was a,
a better piece.

2544
01:46:24,771 --> 01:46:29,360
And one of the most interesting things,
because Louie is a,

2545
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:31,970
he's a very smart guy,
but he's also a very nice guy.

2546
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,183
He just kept asking questions and 
pestering people and getting to the 

2547
01:46:35,151 --> 01:46:35,984
heart of it.
But he also showed like these fenced in 

2548
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:41,300
Lyons and they're throwing a dead cow 
over the top of the fence.

2549
01:46:41,301 --> 01:46:42,770
And the lines have been tearing it 
apart.

2550
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,450
It's fucking crazy.
I didn't see it.

2551
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,490
But it's,
it's weird because the,

2552
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,740
these lions,
they're never like,

2553
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:50,400
they're feeding

2554
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,940
him and then people go over there and 
hunt them as if it's like a wild lion.

2555
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:54,863
Yeah,
it's,

2556
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,430
it's super weird.
I couldn't hunt and offense.

2557
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,960
Um,
I cannot align in a fence.

2558
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,510
Um,
so I don't know.

2559
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,070
Yeah.
It,

2560
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,080
it's not what we call over here in 
America.

2561
01:47:08,081 --> 01:47:09,280
Fair Chase,
right?

2562
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,690
There's a,
a term,

2563
01:47:10,691 --> 01:47:14,830
that term fair chase is synonymous with 
ethical hunters in America.

2564
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,053
And this is something that most people 
aren't aware of that there's a code and 

2565
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:21,603
that code the code very slightly.
Like in some places you can use 

2566
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:25,204
electronic communication,
meaning you can use walkie talkies to 

2567
01:47:27,101 --> 01:47:29,170
locate an animal.
Like a,

2568
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:32,860
I believe you can do that in Arizona.
You definitely could do that in Nevada.

2569
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:34,950
You can't do that in Montana.
You know,

2570
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:35,784
there's,
there's different things of what people 

2571
01:47:37,121 --> 01:47:37,954
decide.
It's fair chase or ethical and it 

2572
01:47:39,821 --> 01:47:41,050
depends.
Like Colorado,

2573
01:47:41,051 --> 01:47:43,870
they won't even let you use a,
a light on your site,

2574
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,360
on your both site can have any 
electronics,

2575
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:47,783
uh,
attached to your site for whatever 

2576
01:47:48,611 --> 01:47:51,220
reason.
They just started allowing lighted nocks

2577
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,213
well that was just an Oregon too,
or they've been outlawed in Oregon I 

2578
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,520
think.
I mean,

2579
01:47:55,521 --> 01:47:56,960
I haven't used them in Oregon,
but,

2580
01:47:56,961 --> 01:47:58,460
uh,
I think they are legal now.

2581
01:47:58,461 --> 01:48:00,530
But yeah,
I mean as far as,

2582
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:03,230
so you're trying to define what is fair 
chase.

2583
01:48:03,231 --> 01:48:03,951
Right.
And so yeah,

2584
01:48:03,951 --> 01:48:06,050
there's a lot of these electronics,
this or that.

2585
01:48:06,051 --> 01:48:09,440
But what we say is fair chase is not in 
a high fence.

2586
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:14,720
Well it's definitely not feeding a lion 
in a cage and then opening up the door.

2587
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:18,050
Right when the hunter pulls up,
that is due to,

2588
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:19,760
Oh yeah,
that is what they do.

2589
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,850
It's one of the reasons why a lot of 
these lines that get shot,

2590
01:48:22,851 --> 01:48:24,860
they don't know what the fuck is going 
on.

2591
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:27,800
They're bedded somewhere.
They just lay down cause they're outside

2592
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:29,480
in this new environment.
Like where am I?

2593
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:30,423
And even know what it is because they've
been living in this very small 

2594
01:48:31,821 --> 01:48:32,654
environment and they let them out and 
they let him out right when the hunter 

2595
01:48:35,531 --> 01:48:35,980
gets,

2596
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:37,540
yeah,
that's,

2597
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:40,510
that's tougher to justify.
It's very tough to justify.

2598
01:48:40,511 --> 01:48:40,911
It's,
I,

2599
01:48:40,911 --> 01:48:42,030
I feel like it's,
it's,

2600
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,140
it's not justifiable.
Yes.

2601
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:46,810
You're not hunting anymore.
You're just murdering an animal.

2602
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,960
Yeah.
So I'm murder.

2603
01:48:47,961 --> 01:48:50,650
Murder is a person right now,
so I'm going to,

2604
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:51,873
I'm going to not address that part and 
just address hunting in general and 

2605
01:48:55,571 --> 01:49:00,571
hunting in general is what's necessary 
for the,

2606
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,400
the future of animals.
I mean,

2607
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:04,653
you had until it gets down to a number 
where maybe the white or black or 

2608
01:49:07,991 --> 01:49:11,020
whatever rhino that is,
that's only down to a hound handful.

2609
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:12,370
Obviously you're not going to hunt 
those.

2610
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:16,390
But by and large,
hunting is what keeps these animals,

2611
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:18,490
the population viable.
Well,

2612
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:19,353
and then there was also the case of 
Corey Knowles who went over there and 

2613
01:49:22,421 --> 01:49:24,310
Knowlton no,
Nolan.

2614
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,400
Corey Knowlton Knowlton.
Yup.

2615
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,310
Does that he say his name?
Yup.

2616
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,433
Sorry,
Corey.

2617
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,540
Corey Knowlton.
We got it.

2618
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:33,230
Why does he noise?
But yeah,

2619
01:49:33,231 --> 01:49:35,020
I have too many names in my head.
But anyway,

2620
01:49:35,021 --> 01:49:36,310
when cory went over there in 
cornerstone,

2621
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:38,260
the hotspot smoking.
You think so?

2622
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:41,020
No,
but that's what people like to say,

2623
01:49:41,021 --> 01:49:41,590
right?
Yeah.

2624
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:44,720
People would see a lot of stupid shit.
Seven pop quiz motherfucker.

2625
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:48,070
Shit.
But when cory went

2626
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,903
over there,
he spent a quarter of a million dollars 

2627
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:56,470
to shoot an endangered rhino,
think it was 350,000 was it that much?

2628
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:59,260
I mean it was a lot,
a lot of money,

2629
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:00,423
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And he said that it was undervalued and 

2630
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:04,534
he said the reason why the bidding 
didn't get higher it was because there 

2631
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:07,204
was so much pressure on people to do it.
But he explained very eloquently and 

2632
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:15,970
very clearly on CNN and when he did my 
podcast about all the death threats that

2633
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:16,391
he got,
what he said,

2634
01:50:16,391 --> 01:50:19,870
listen,
that rhino was killing other rhinos.

2635
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:22,360
That is why not breeding,
not breeding.

2636
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:23,194
It was,
it was an old rhino that was past its 

2637
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:25,954
breeding prime.
It wasn't breeding anymore and it was 

2638
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:30,880
killing the young rhinos.
He had killed a female that had tried to

2639
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,600
mate with and it had killed another male
and it was,

2640
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,493
they were,
these was,

2641
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:39,460
this is an endangered animal and this 
thing was killing other animals.

2642
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,601
They had decided,
look,

2643
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:43,060
we have to take this out of the 
population,

2644
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:44,283
so what is the best money for it to get 
a tremendous amount of money that could 

2645
01:50:47,861 --> 01:50:50,500
go for anti poaching efforts and all 
these different things.

2646
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,540
And so he explained it like,
he's like,

2647
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:53,374
this is,
this is an animal that they were going 

2648
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:56,344
to kill.
They had to kill it because it was 

2649
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:58,984
threatening this endangered population 
of only like a couple of thousand 

2650
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:02,164
rhinos.
Right,

2651
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:03,640
right.
Yeah.

2652
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:04,683
It's a really interesting situation.
And people would like it if that wasn't 

2653
01:51:09,701 --> 01:51:10,960
the case,
they would like it if no,

2654
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:11,794
the money is actually coming from animal
welfare groups and from wildlife lovers 

2655
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,950
who just want to see these animals 
alive.

2656
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:23,190
The difference is it's very rare that 
someone is going to give you $350,000 to

2657
01:51:23,381 --> 01:51:25,030
keep a rhino a lot.
Huh.

2658
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,790
And so that,
that's a magnified example,

2659
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:31,120
but that's pretty much what's happening 
with all the animals.

2660
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,470
I mean,
you're not getting that much money,

2661
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:35,230
but you're getting money in exchange for
their life,

2662
01:51:35,231 --> 01:51:37,570
basically.
And it's for the betterment of the herd.

2663
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:38,441
Yeah.
I mean,

2664
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:40,030
that's hunting.
Yeah.

2665
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:40,661
Right?
I mean,

2666
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:41,740
that's,
that's like,

2667
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:43,563
like I said,
very magnified because you're getting a 

2668
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:46,510
huge amount of money and there's only a 
few animals,

2669
01:51:46,511 --> 01:51:48,370
but you can,
it's easy to see,

2670
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,413
hey,
killing this one is going to save 

2671
01:51:50,471 --> 01:51:52,210
animals.
So that's really easy to see.

2672
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,700
But that's pretty much what happens with
all animals.

2673
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:56,170
I mean,
you're balancing that heard.

2674
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,710
The other thing is they ate that rhino 
and a lot of people at that Rhino,

2675
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,573
I mean,
they give you a need a way to villages 

2676
01:52:01,391 --> 01:52:05,230
and people don't know you.
You not only can you eat rhinos,

2677
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:07,570
apparently they taste good.
Same thing with elephant.

2678
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,700
Elephant apparently tastes delicious.
Well,

2679
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:12,760
do you remember in the trophy movie 
they,

2680
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:16,540
they could care less what elephant that 
guy killed,

2681
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:19,150
but they didn't like that it was small.
Right?

2682
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:21,040
Do you remember that in me?
Because they wanted more meat.

2683
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:23,200
They don't care about,
they want it.

2684
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:24,790
They care about eating.
Yeah,

2685
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:28,270
that's it.
So as far as the locals go,

2686
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:31,540
I mean,
so we here in America,

2687
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:33,310
it feels like,
you know,

2688
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:36,760
we take up these causes and it's like,
you know,

2689
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:40,210
we're the social justice warriors for 
the world.

2690
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,433
It's like we ought to probably check in 
with the people that actually live 

2691
01:52:43,871 --> 01:52:44,411
there,
right?

2692
01:52:44,411 --> 01:52:45,770
Yeah.
They want to kill the lions.

2693
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,840
Jesus Christ.
He sees a kid.

2694
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:50,600
There was a,
an article in the New York Times shortly

2695
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:53,870
after the,
the Lion Cecil the lion controversy.

2696
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:57,010
It said a in Zimbabwe.
We did not cry for lions.

2697
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:57,980
Right.
I know that.

2698
01:52:57,981 --> 01:52:58,820
Read that one.
Yeah.

2699
01:52:58,850 --> 01:52:59,451
No,
that's,

2700
01:52:59,451 --> 01:53:01,040
and that's,
that's real life.

2701
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,990
I mean,
over here,

2702
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,161
everything,
Lion,

2703
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:06,800
king,
everything lives everybody's friends.

2704
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:10,130
But Simba is my friend.
Yeah.

2705
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,530
No one's saying that.
Lions need to die.

2706
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:14,300
No,
I look,

2707
01:53:14,301 --> 01:53:15,134
I'm not in favor of those high fence 
things and the way they keep those 

2708
01:53:17,901 --> 01:53:20,630
lines.
A lot of things you've told me before,

2709
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:21,730
you wouldn't have on,
no,

2710
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,790
I'm right.
No desire.

2711
01:53:22,850 --> 01:53:23,390
Right.
So,

2712
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:26,490
but you understand teen and how it works
and,

2713
01:53:26,491 --> 01:53:28,430
and how,
what we need.

2714
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,313
Yeah.
You know,

2715
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:30,163
it's just a weird facet of human nature 
that we've sort of boxed ourselves into 

2716
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:37,830
this situation with Africa.
But Africa I think is,

2717
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:39,283
you could look to that example and,
and see how it's is a very complex 

2718
01:53:43,761 --> 01:53:44,594
issue.

2719
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,820
Especially,
let's take all the woods.

2720
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:47,654
Steve Rinella calls the charismatic 
megafauna out of the equation like 

2721
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:52,820
giraffes,
which everybody loves.

2722
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,953
Like I had a whole bit about giraffes 
and one of my comedy specials that 

2723
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,313
they're,
the one animal that you can't say is 

2724
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:02,960
like,
is not better off in the zoo.

2725
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:05,210
Yeah.
Because like other animals,

2726
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:08,270
they look like captive.
They're contained.

2727
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,240
But giraffes are so happy babies 
freedom.

2728
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:14,720
Like I used to take my kids to the zoo 
when my daughter was,

2729
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:15,883
I don't even think she was two.
She's holding out of a piece of lettuce 

2730
01:54:18,921 --> 01:54:23,921
and a fucking giraffe comes out to hedge
huge giant Tang wraps around the lettuce

2731
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:26,450
and takes it from,
and she's giggling and laughing,

2732
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:32,020
but they're so confident in giraffe 
behavior that they let babies feed them.

2733
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,200
Yeah.
That's impressive.

2734
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:34,600
Or animal like that.
And the zoo.

2735
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,030
No,
because animals are wild animals,

2736
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:39,290
you know,
done all that they're going to do.

2737
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:43,490
But what I said was that a giraffe wakes
up every day in the zoo and goes another

2738
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:45,550
day with no lions.
That's true.

2739
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:48,180
And just sort of wanders around the zoo 
having a,

2740
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:51,740
they look like they're having a blast,
but they have not a care in the world.

2741
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:54,800
They don't mind at all being in that 
fence long as you keep chucking that,

2742
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:56,240
hey,
over the side there are good.

2743
01:54:56,241 --> 01:54:57,500
Keep it coming.
Keep dead.

2744
01:54:57,501 --> 01:54:58,370
Hey,
come on baby.

2745
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:00,110
Yeah,
good to go.

2746
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:03,470
We have connections with certain 
animals.

2747
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,960
Elephants are a big one,
you know?

2748
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,790
Um,
lions are a big one.

2749
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:10,460
Giraffes for whatever reason are a big 
one.

2750
01:55:10,461 --> 01:55:11,630
Even zebras,
people like,

2751
01:55:11,631 --> 01:55:14,180
why are you shooting at a zebra?
It's too much like a horse.

2752
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,560
Yeah.
Like we have these,

2753
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:20,510
but if it's like an antelope like that,
you eat like,

2754
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:21,620
oh,
that kinda makes sense.

2755
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,493
Yeah.
Like we have these kind of makes sense 

2756
01:55:23,241 --> 01:55:24,020
animals.
And again,

2757
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,630
wart hogs.
Nobody gives a fuck about warthogs.

2758
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:28,780
There's no one out there trying to save 
the Warhawk.

2759
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:30,170
People don't even know how many there 
are.

2760
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:31,750
They don't care and care less.
No.

2761
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:32,653
This is not like people worried about 
lions and no one is out there wondering 

2762
01:55:36,111 --> 01:55:38,180
how many ward hogs are all left in 
Africa.

2763
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:40,730
I see it all the time.
It's like people will comment,

2764
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:41,720
not hunters,
IVC,

2765
01:55:41,721 --> 01:55:43,770
but they'll be like on my page and say,
well,

2766
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,150
oh,

2767
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:45,930
I don't have a problem if you kill deer 
and elk,

2768
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:47,960
but there's no reason to kill a bear.
Right.

2769
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:50,280
What are you talking about?
Have you ever had bear sausage?

2770
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:51,061
Yeah.
Well,

2771
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:53,600
if you've had bear saw and you,
you probably happen.

2772
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:54,480
But if you,
if,

2773
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:56,880
if you have,
it's Goddamn good.

2774
01:55:57,210 --> 01:56:00,720
And why is it any different?
It's the same.

2775
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,070
Why is it any different?
Yeah,

2776
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,120
it's not.
Yeah,

2777
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:07,440
so it's just what they're,
it's just what they're ingrained to feel

2778
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:08,640
about an animal,
I think.

2779
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:09,510
Well,
they,

2780
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:12,900
they seem to dog like,
so yeah,

2781
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:13,734
that's a thing.
That's the thing with people that bears 

2782
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:16,464
or seem dog like,
oh well they're portrayed as being nice 

2783
01:56:19,351 --> 01:56:20,184
and the people have them for pets too.
Like there's a lot of people that have 

2784
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:23,694
bears pets,
like a of Russian design up people and 

2785
01:56:25,761 --> 01:56:27,810
man on instagram.
Do you have lunch?

2786
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,530
Fine.
Them.

2787
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,363
This is one motherfucker as a giant 
grizzly bear that he cuddles with and 

2788
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,990
people keep sending me videos of this 
guy.

2789
01:56:33,991 --> 01:56:35,160
I'm like,
one day,

2790
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,890
I know I say this video is going to get 
dark.

2791
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,870
God.
Yeah,

2792
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:42,100
look at this guy.
It's got a sweet bear.

2793
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,120
Just chilling with this bird,
this bird month moon.

2794
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:49,350
When we hung out,
my girlfriend,

2795
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:52,860
no rubbers back,
but one day my baby.

2796
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:57,070
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2797
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:00,330
It looks like it looks like a cool bear.
It's dope bear.

2798
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,090
Look,
they're fucking awesome animals man.

2799
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:04,620
I love all of them.
Yeah.

2800
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,710
But here's the deal.
If you had a thousand of those living in

2801
01:57:07,711 --> 01:57:09,330
your neighborhood,
you'd have to thin the herd.

2802
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,620
Yeah.
You just have to,

2803
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:11,463
and the reality of all this stuff is 
super complex and I just do not think 

2804
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:18,660
you get an understanding of it from,
you know,

2805
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:21,000
in front of your laptop in Vancouver.

2806
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:22,680
You just,
you don't know for sure.

2807
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:24,870
What I like is,
uh,

2808
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:25,883
you know,
with regard to like this international 

2809
01:57:28,411 --> 01:57:30,990
wildlife council or even,
um,

2810
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:32,063
it just seems like with this 
administration and people say good or 

2811
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:39,540
bad or mostly bad,
it feels like you're listening to about,

2812
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:40,703
and that's what,
that's one thing that I would read cnn 

2813
01:57:42,641 --> 01:57:45,150
and I listened to fight.
It's like the same topic,

2814
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:47,850
two totally different slants.
So it's like what the hell?

2815
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:50,730
Who Do you believe?
So that's why I was happy to be involved

2816
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:54,030
so I can actually hear.
But still it's still hard.

2817
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:57,210
It's still hard to listen and think,
okay,

2818
01:57:57,211 --> 01:57:58,830
so what's going on?
But,

2819
01:57:58,890 --> 01:57:59,723
but with my whole thing is like,
I kind of look at it is if I got 

2820
01:58:05,551 --> 01:58:10,551
somebody online giving me advice or you 
give me advice,

2821
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:13,080
I'd be like,
well Joe knows me.

2822
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,130
I'm going to listen to him.

2823
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,173
That's why I kind of want her to be 
involved in these councils and in this 

2824
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,223
part of this decision making because 
they can listen to all of this people 

2825
01:58:21,631 --> 01:58:22,464
talking shit all day.
But if I'm there and can actually weigh 

2826
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:27,570
in,
we'll then they know me.

2827
01:58:27,571 --> 01:58:28,410
And,
and you know,

2828
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,483
it might,
it should weigh a little more and they 

2829
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,120
know your experience.
Right?

2830
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,353
And so that's why I want to be involved.
I'm not saying I'm going to agree and 

2831
01:58:37,461 --> 01:58:39,210
it's going to be exactly what I wanted 
every time.

2832
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:41,070
But,
you know,

2833
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,040
I don't know how else

2834
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,450
to do it.
I don't know how else to do it.

2835
01:58:43,451 --> 01:58:46,060
And I know that with my voice because,
you know,

2836
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:49,630
they have trusted me about whatever.
Even if they agree or don't agree,

2837
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:52,540
I'll at least get to share my thoughts.
And so that's what I did.

2838
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,433
You know,
like when I talked with Zinky the other 

2839
01:58:55,570 --> 01:58:56,440
day,
what does he like?

2840
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,020
That's what he's an avid hunter,
right?

2841
01:58:59,080 --> 01:58:59,913
Yeah.
That's what,

2842
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,630
you know,
and I've read all these man,

2843
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:06,850
you'd think he was the word just like 
trump,

2844
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:07,660
you know,
people,

2845
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,940
you'd think they were saddened to some 
people.

2846
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:11,920
But to me,
um,

2847
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:15,180
I read the outside magazine article on 
them.

2848
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,500
It sounded terrible and I was like,
God,

2849
01:59:17,501 --> 01:59:20,230
that's not good.
I read a few other things about them.

2850
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:24,280
I'm like,
but to me personally is seamed,

2851
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:26,680
would listen.
Um,

2852
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:27,903
seemed like somebody who,
if we were sitting there talking about 

2853
01:59:29,501 --> 01:59:31,750
something and we came to a decision and 
it made sense,

2854
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,030
that's what it seemed like,
like a normal,

2855
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:36,580
you know,
a well thought out person.

2856
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:38,063
Well I think he's probably got a 
tremendous amount of pressure on him 

2857
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:42,530
from a bunch of different angles for 
sure.

2858
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:43,373
All interested in making money for sure.
And they think of someone that is pro 

2859
01:59:48,241 --> 01:59:51,600
wildlife as being a roadblock to the 
money.

2860
01:59:51,710 --> 01:59:52,140
Yeah.
Like,

2861
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:52,973
Oh,
this fucking green house loving hippy 

2862
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,750
tree hugging asshole.

2863
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,433
He,
what he told me is he's concerned he 

2864
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:06,250
wants to increase hunting opportunities 
and you know,

2865
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,760
um,
public land opportunities,

2866
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,370
you know,
so that's,

2867
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,530
and that's kind of what I want to hear.
So I mean,

2868
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:16,570
maybe what would of who you're talking 
to.

2869
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:20,710
I understand that,
but it sounds as sounds good.

2870
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,573
I mean,
it gave me a better feeling talking to 

2871
02:00:23,281 --> 02:00:26,500
them then reading the other articles and
the articles about him.

2872
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:27,460
Right.
So,

2873
02:00:27,461 --> 02:00:29,160
uh,
and then the,

2874
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:31,450
his staff,
great people,

2875
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,523
like I said,
just like we'd sit here and talk and it 

2876
02:00:34,221 --> 02:00:35,054
makes sense.
And even talking with Donald Trump jr 

2877
02:00:36,851 --> 02:00:38,410
I'd be like,
God,

2878
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:39,813
I wish we could just do this right now.
Because it's like you can actually come 

2879
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:45,310
to a consensus,
make a decision,

2880
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:48,130
talk it through and be like,
that's how it should be,

2881
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,460
you know?
And it seems,

2882
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:50,343
it feels like it's different.
Politics are different because 

2883
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:54,970
everybody,
like you said,

2884
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:59,860
there's pressure from different places.
But when I think of a politician,

2885
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:00,521
I think,
you know,

2886
02:01:00,521 --> 02:01:03,480
special interest groups and these other 
people that,

2887
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,413
that are influenced him and you're 
wondering why is this for their own 

2888
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:09,670
benefit?
And so you don't really know with this,

2889
02:01:09,730 --> 02:01:10,563
it doesn't feel like that.
It feels like it's trying to make the 

2890
02:01:13,661 --> 02:01:15,100
right decision,
you know,

2891
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:15,934
without being influenced.
I know there's always gonna be 

2892
02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:18,154
influenced,
but without like the special interest 

2893
02:01:19,511 --> 02:01:20,344
type influence,

2894
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:21,281
I don't know.
You know,

2895
02:01:21,281 --> 02:01:25,060
I think the more people like you that 
are involved in this and the more people

2896
02:01:25,061 --> 02:01:26,500
like you have a say,
or at least,

2897
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:27,334
or they'd come to you for advice,
you're going to get it at least a more 

2898
02:01:31,091 --> 02:01:31,924
balanced perspective of what the 
potential hazards are and what's 

2899
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:37,660
important.
What we need to concentrate on.

2900
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,400
You know,
I think regardless

2901
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,990
of what you sing about trump,
what people were excited about about him

2902
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:48,440
as a president would be that the economy
would have an upswing and it did.

2903
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:49,933
But lately the last couple of days has 
been a massive decline in the stock 

2904
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:54,134
market.
Has been yesterday I think was the 

2905
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:58,580
biggest loss ever.
I don't understand the stock market.

2906
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:00,093
I really don't get it at a bunch of 
assholes throwing their hands in the 

2907
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:02,744
air.
There's computers that are doing a lot 

2908
02:02:03,501 --> 02:02:07,700
of the calculation that's going on.
It's too fucking confusing.

2909
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:09,980
I feel like if I just went down that 
rabbit hole,

2910
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:10,993
I'd be stuck studying the stock market 
for weeks upon weeks and I just don't 

2911
02:02:13,941 --> 02:02:15,110
have that kind of time.
Dude,

2912
02:02:15,111 --> 02:02:18,530
I gotta play techno hunt with Cam hands.
Well and I like,

2913
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:19,910
I like reading stuff.
Like,

2914
02:02:20,050 --> 02:02:20,883
you know,
the stock market's at an all time high 

2915
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:23,180
and he's making money.

2916
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:24,890
That's all I heard.
I heard that.

2917
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,690
Nothing but that.
Like jobs,

2918
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,300
like more jobs than ever,
you know?

2919
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:31,220
Unemployments and all time low.
I'm like,

2920
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:32,210
well,
you know,

2921
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:37,160
when you have a guy who was just so hell
bent on making money in business,

2922
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,840
it's good for business.
Right.

2923
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:41,330
So like that would be the benefit of 
having a guy like that.

2924
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:45,710
But then apparently there's some 
downsides to that shit and the downsides

2925
02:02:45,711 --> 02:02:46,544
are inflation and a panic.
And then once the stock market starts 

2926
02:02:51,171 --> 02:02:53,600
going south and people start freaking 
out,

2927
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:57,560
then it really goes south and now it's 
really gone south.

2928
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:58,453
Well last couple of days.
I mean it's like I live in the moment 

2929
02:03:02,191 --> 02:03:03,024
and campaigns.
I'm not here for your fucking rosy view 

2930
02:03:05,991 --> 02:03:07,400
of the future.
Sorry,

2931
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:09,050
I don't even understand the stock 
market.

2932
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:10,820
I don't understand it.
Yeah.

2933
02:03:10,821 --> 02:03:12,320
I like,
I like hearing good news.

2934
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,190
That's what I like hearing.

2935
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,430
Yeah.
I like,

2936
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:17,030
I like I get comforted here and people 
that,

2937
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:18,043
that uh,
I'm not wondering about what their 

2938
02:03:20,331 --> 02:03:21,890
intentions are.
So,

2939
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:22,753
um,
that's why I enjoyed the discussions 

2940
02:03:24,171 --> 02:03:25,640
with those guys.
And Yeah.

2941
02:03:25,641 --> 02:03:26,460
You know,
if I can,

2942
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:28,660
if you know,
I just said,

2943
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:29,673
you know,
it feels like as sportsman we took a 

2944
02:03:30,561 --> 02:03:31,394
couple of hits,
we could use something on the positive 

2945
02:03:32,991 --> 02:03:34,820
side and I think we're getting that on 
Friday.

2946
02:03:34,821 --> 02:03:35,654
So that's so on Friday are they gonna 
make new rules in terms of what you can 

2947
02:03:38,931 --> 02:03:41,300
bring back and what you can't bring back
the idea behind it?

2948
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,830
No,
that's not about the international.

2949
02:03:42,831 --> 02:03:45,210
This is about the,
the core doors.

2950
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:46,393
Yeah.
Right.

2951
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:51,730
So protection per protecting migration 
routes for the big game animals here.

2952
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,830
That's very,
it's very important.

2953
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:56,053
Yeah.
Especially for animals like mule deer 

2954
02:03:57,981 --> 02:03:59,930
whose populations aren't really that 
good.

2955
02:03:59,931 --> 02:04:00,730
But now,
yeah,

2956
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:04,070
the elk elk still need to be able to get
out of the high country out from,

2957
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:06,680
you know,
where they breed down when the weather,

2958
02:04:06,710 --> 02:04:10,880
when the weather hits to get down to 
where the feed is and if there's a bunch

2959
02:04:10,881 --> 02:04:13,580
of gas rigs in there,
knock me able to do it.

2960
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,770
Do you follow Gritty Bowman on 
instagram?

2961
02:04:15,771 --> 02:04:16,221
You Do,
right?

2962
02:04:16,221 --> 02:04:19,670
Yeah.
Brian was taking all these videos of elk

2963
02:04:19,671 --> 02:04:20,840
in evergreen.
Hell,

2964
02:04:20,841 --> 02:04:23,540
I know.
Wander right through town.

2965
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:24,433
And they're huge.
These people are just hanging out near 

2966
02:04:28,341 --> 02:04:29,174
cars.
I know they have zero fear of people I 

2967
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:32,744
know.
And they know that once they're in the 

2968
02:04:33,261 --> 02:04:35,670
town that's like they're on home base 
there.

2969
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:38,010
They're safe.
It's weird how they know that,

2970
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,810
you know.
Oh,

2971
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:40,410
I know.
I did.

2972
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:41,243
I did see that there are some nice 
animals in their crazy beautiful people 

2973
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:47,760
pulled over just checking them out and 
they're screaming and running.

2974
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:50,790
We're that they just migrate right 
through the town.

2975
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:53,430
Yeah.
So they probably figured out a long time

2976
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,030
ago,
Hey,

2977
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:56,730
just keep waving the car isn't nobody 
fucks with you.

2978
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,990
We're good to go.
But you know,

2979
02:04:57,991 --> 02:05:01,290
they have weird rules in evergreen where
you could kind of hunting your backyard.

2980
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,120
Oh really?
I didn't know that.

2981
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,020
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2982
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:05,123
yeah.
If you want a certain amount of 

2983
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:07,650
property,
I think it's like more than an acre.

2984
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:10,110
He could fucking check,
boom.

2985
02:05:10,650 --> 02:05:13,620
Watch right in your backyard.
You had a full freezer then.

2986
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:14,640
Yeah,
I mean,

2987
02:05:14,670 --> 02:05:16,920
I think that's exactly why they made 
those rules.

2988
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:20,130
Um,
I think it's by section,

2989
02:05:20,150 --> 02:05:21,120
you know,
by unit,

2990
02:05:21,330 --> 02:05:23,130
depending upon where you're at.
Right.

2991
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:26,610
But in some places you,
you literally can hunt in your backyard.

2992
02:05:26,611 --> 02:05:29,940
So I would imagine the elk avoid those 
places.

2993
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,090
I would think so.
They live pretty quick.

2994
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:33,383
Isn't it interesting they learn quick?
Well that's the one of the things that 

2995
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:37,740
they said about reintroduction of wolves
into yellowstone,

2996
02:05:37,741 --> 02:05:40,020
they figured it out after awhile.
They look okay.

2997
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:43,290
Like for in the beginning they were just
sitting ducks.

2998
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:43,921
Yeah.
You know,

2999
02:05:43,921 --> 02:05:44,754
but that was in the 90s and now we're in
2018 it's essentially the ecosystem has 

3000
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:50,424
sorted itself out and there's some good 
arguments that it's sorted itself out 

3001
02:05:53,941 --> 02:05:54,650
for the better.

3002
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:55,520
Yeah.
You know,

3003
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,423
which is,
you know,

3004
02:05:56,670 --> 02:06:01,380
for the betterment of other wildlife,
other plant species of the elk word,

3005
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,910
you know,
eating a shit load of them.

3006
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:04,740
So it's,
it's interesting,

3007
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:08,250
but also you should know that where they
brought those wolves back,

3008
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:09,440
you can't hunt.
Right.

3009
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,780
Cause this,
the greater yellowstone eco systems,

3010
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:14,940
like it's all protected.
Right.

3011
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:16,620
So maybe they needed him there.
Yeah.

3012
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:18,230
It's hard to say.
Yeah.

3013
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,730
Just don't bring them Colorado fuckers.
Don't do it.

3014
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,140
There you go.
Tell him to it.

3015
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:25,800
So what else are you going to discuss 
with Zinky?

3016
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:26,753
How often do you meet?
Like what does this job entail or this 

3017
02:06:29,311 --> 02:06:33,240
position entails on that?
Council says there's,

3018
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,463
you meet twice a year.
So I didn't really know what about or 

3019
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,020
when that's going to happen.
But,

3020
02:06:40,021 --> 02:06:42,340
uh,
for me and my,

3021
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:44,890
my whole thing is like,
well,

3022
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:48,360
if I want to get to know somebody,
I like to have them do what I do.

3023
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,613
It's like you.
And so he says he has a bow and I'm 

3024
02:06:52,771 --> 02:06:53,604
like,
you.

3025
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:54,720
I said,
what kind of bow?

3026
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:56,160
He told me kind of battle.
I'm like,

3027
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,880
what kind of,
uh,

3028
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:57,750
I said,
uh,

3029
02:06:57,751 --> 02:07:00,390
what did he have?
Like a horse got one.

3030
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:03,060
Now it's an old ball.
Oh really?

3031
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:05,160
God,
I can eat like a high country,

3032
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,180
something like that,
that,

3033
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:07,960
something like that.
But I'm like [inaudible].

3034
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:09,001
So anyway,
I said,

3035
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:09,870
well,
I said,

3036
02:07:09,871 --> 02:07:11,220
you want to shoot that Bo?
He's like,

3037
02:07:11,221 --> 02:07:11,761
yeah.
I said,

3038
02:07:11,761 --> 02:07:14,190
well,
I'll hook them up with hoyt.

3039
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,093
I'll,
I'll,

3040
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:17,420
they can't take any gifts.
Oh,

3041
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:20,030
I can't take gifts.
So I said,

3042
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:21,390
I said,
cause I said that and I,

3043
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,380
and uh,
I said,

3044
02:07:22,381 --> 02:07:23,520
well,
don't worry about that.

3045
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,260
I go to shoot your bow.
I said,

3046
02:07:25,261 --> 02:07:28,800
how about if I come back in a two d c 
there and we,

3047
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:32,640
and we shoot bows and can't give,
you can't give him a gift as a friend.

3048
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,130
I don't know that it's maybe from a 
would be an issue.

3049
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,810
It's pretty regulated.
Oh,

3050
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:40,900
that makes sense.
Taking whatever you can only take bribes

3051
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,690
under the table.
Take gifts,

3052
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,880
can't have that actual bow.
Isn't that funny?

3053
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:48,580
You could take campaign contributions.
Yeah.

3054
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:50,310
But not about,
you can't take a boat.

3055
02:07:50,311 --> 02:07:51,144
You could have lobbyists that are on 
staff that are trying to get cached and 

3056
02:07:54,401 --> 02:07:56,770
working those special interest groups.
Come on baby.

3057
02:07:56,890 --> 02:07:57,723
Well,
so next is a bow we talked about next 

3058
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:01,203
week,
me gone back there and shooting bows 

3059
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:03,363
with him.
Yep.

3060
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:06,130
And talking just about whatever,
you know,

3061
02:08:06,131 --> 02:08:08,050
just kind of helmet,
want to see his form.

3062
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:08,920
That has,
right.

3063
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,270
So,
uh,

3064
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:12,130
we're trying to make that happen.
And,

3065
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:12,964
uh,
I just,

3066
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:13,893
you know,
like I said,

3067
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:14,793
if you have somebody's ear,
you just want to be able to tell them 

3068
02:08:17,261 --> 02:08:18,820
what's important to you and that's all I
want to do.

3069
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:23,020
But I can do that generally better over 
something I care about,

3070
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:27,940
like archery or running or lifting 
weights or whatever like that.

3071
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:31,060
So that's my goal just to,
you know,

3072
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:33,460
share what's what,
because I feel like I have a pretty good

3073
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:37,360
pulse on what's important to sportsmen 
and hunters here in North America.

3074
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:38,493
And,
uh,

3075
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:40,390
so I just want to share that.
Well,

3076
02:08:40,391 --> 02:08:43,450
I know Donald Trump junior is an avid 
archer.

3077
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:46,000
Like he's really into it.
He's an avid hunter plate.

3078
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:48,080
Yeah.
And He,

3079
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:49,690
you got a chance to talk to him?
Yeah.

3080
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:50,700
Yeah.
Uh,

3081
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,090
quite a quite a while.
Yeah.

3082
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:54,670
He wants to do the podcast,
this podcast.

3083
02:08:54,671 --> 02:08:55,411
Yeah.
So he,

3084
02:08:55,411 --> 02:08:56,244
he,
you know,

3085
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:56,891
me,
me,

3086
02:08:56,891 --> 02:08:58,120
you and him can talk,
uh,

3087
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,070
talk about hunting.
Okay.

3088
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:05,020
We're in dawn,
so they smoke weed first,

3089
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,453
for sure.

3090
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:12,723
Oh,
for sure.

3091
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,580
No total normal.
I mean,

3092
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,473
cause that possible.
How's it possible that you grow up with 

3093
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:20,480
Donald Trump as your dad?
You've got a golden toilet bowl.

3094
02:09:20,481 --> 02:09:22,090
When that little kid,
that's what I said,

3095
02:09:22,091 --> 02:09:23,140
I said,
you know,

3096
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,020
I go,
cause I,

3097
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:29,030
I haven't met any of of uh,
Donald's kids except for Don Jr.

3098
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,180
So I'm like,
well,

3099
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:33,370
but I follow them on Instagram,
you know,

3100
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:34,204
you kind of get it.
I do to kind of a sort of a feel for 

3101
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:37,181
what the,
I said,

3102
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:37,960
man,
I go,

3103
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,890
you know,
in talking to you,

3104
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:41,560
I said it,
it seems weird to say,

3105
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:46,510
but seem like a normal gun,
which is your dad's a billionaire.

3106
02:09:46,511 --> 02:09:47,440
I don't know.
Is he a billionaire?

3107
02:09:47,441 --> 02:09:48,520
Right.
Oh yeah.

3108
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:52,330
So doesn't that seem,
it seems surprising.

3109
02:09:52,331 --> 02:09:55,820
He's like,
seems like just like we would be right.

3110
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:58,420
Total normal.
I mean he's,

3111
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:00,820
I fall on my instagram.

3112
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,550
I see that the pictures of his daughter,
super cute,

3113
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:04,413
the fishing pictures,
but I saw him on Tucker Carlson the 

3114
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,570
other night and I told them this and we 
were talking in Vegas and he was like,

3115
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:11,853
just laying it down for a one minute 
clip on instagram on Tucker Carlson was 

3116
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:18,670
to Fox News and laying it down.
And I was like,

3117
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:19,563
God,
I never really had followed his 

3118
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:24,700
political or is his public speaking type
life.

3119
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:26,680
So I was like,
holy crap,

3120
02:10:26,681 --> 02:10:27,514
this guy is pretty dialed in.
It's probably the plan it takes over 

3121
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:31,990
when he might retire,
you might,

3122
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:33,740
I mean,
he's 40 so he's just kind of getting his

3123
02:10:33,741 --> 02:10:33,980
feet

3124
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,813
under slides right in and that world and
trump dynasty just like they did with 

3125
02:10:38,271 --> 02:10:40,180
the bushes.
That's right.

3126
02:10:40,181 --> 02:10:42,910
Just know all of up Clinton's clenches.
You know,

3127
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,753
once you're in there,
it's like that's all they want is not 

3128
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:47,060
interesting.
It's crazy.

3129
02:10:47,061 --> 02:10:48,950
But he,
I would feel,

3130
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,510
I mean man,
well that's what said electrical guy.

3131
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,130
I wish the don junior was running for 
president.

3132
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:57,140
Yeah,
he's don junior is very reasonable.

3133
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,500
Oh Man.
Totally.

3134
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:01,220
Totally funny if he,
if he says one thing wrong,

3135
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:03,890
one thing,
one slip up of a word,

3136
02:11:03,891 --> 02:11:05,870
which by the way,
everybody does every day.

3137
02:11:05,871 --> 02:11:06,890
I do it every day.
Yeah,

3138
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:07,724
me too.
One one slip up of the word Corey 

3139
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,740
Knowlton right.
One fuck up like that.

3140
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:14,900
And then this done,
I mean,

3141
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:17,240
you see all this,
this magnified,

3142
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:22,100
ridiculous hate that comes his way.
And the attacks against him.

3143
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:24,020
And people are people right now 
listening to this,

3144
02:11:24,021 --> 02:11:27,010
probably yelling at them because they're
fucking Joe's to Ford.

3145
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:31,510
Here's a show.
It's yet.

3146
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:32,170
Yeah,
they,

3147
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:33,050
it's,
it's,

3148
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:36,860
I mean it is really hard not to get 
pissed off.

3149
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:37,723
What's really hard to be unbiased?
It's really hard to just have enough 

3150
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:41,853
amounts perspective.
And I don't think anybody does a good 

3151
02:11:43,431 --> 02:11:44,264
job as president.
I've never seen a single person do it 

3152
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:49,010
well.
I've seen Obama give very good speeches.

3153
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:51,520
I think he's very statesman.
Like I think he's,

3154
02:11:51,521 --> 02:11:52,354
he's very,
what Obama did that was a excellent was 

3155
02:11:55,611 --> 02:11:56,444
he was very composed and articulate and 
smooth and he represented a highly 

3156
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:04,364
educated,
like a high level of human being in 

3157
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:10,340
terms of his intellect and the way he 
carries himself.

3158
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:13,070
And I think that that's good for the 
country,

3159
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,173
you know?
But I think the way you look at the 

3160
02:12:15,291 --> 02:12:17,690
drone attacks,
you look at the attacks on,

3161
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:18,853
on whistle blowers and on the press,
and there was a lot of bad shit about 

3162
02:12:22,161 --> 02:12:22,994
the Obama administration and everybody 
wants to sleep sweep under the rug 

3163
02:12:25,101 --> 02:12:27,050
because I think nobody's a good 
president.

3164
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:29,780
I think it's a terrible job at it.
I didn't like how he,

3165
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:33,260
he sort of started a war on cops.
You remember when he was,

3166
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:34,940
you know,
cruise fine,

3167
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:37,910
some of the arrest they had and it 
started,

3168
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:38,893
people were looking at cops thinking,
these are the good guys are the bad 

3169
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:41,354
guys.
I didn't like that because maybe there 

3170
02:12:43,401 --> 02:12:45,230
are some bad cops,
but there's bad.

3171
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,420
Everything you do,
every job has bad,

3172
02:12:47,421 --> 02:12:48,530
whatever.
So hundred percent.

3173
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:52,350
Instead of highlighting that people out 
there protecting our interests in,

3174
02:12:52,351 --> 02:12:55,810
in serving the public,
he was highlighting the quote,

3175
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:59,270
bad cops I guess,
and it put them all in a bad light.

3176
02:12:59,271 --> 02:13:01,190
I didn't like that.
Whereas trump,

3177
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,840
he knows,
you know,

3178
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:08,200
he's highlighting good police work.
He's highlighting the military.

3179
02:13:08,451 --> 02:13:09,320
He's,
you know,

3180
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:10,870
pride in,
in Ah,

3181
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,760
the good old United States of America.
I like that.

3182
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:16,100
So I mean,
I dunno.

3183
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:16,790
Yeah.

3184
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:18,800
Well,
the thing that drove me nuts,

3185
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:22,100
the most nuts about Obama was that crazy
speech that he said,

3186
02:13:22,130 --> 02:13:24,830
if you have a business that doesn't 
choose the highway,

3187
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:25,970
you didn't build up.
Yeah.

3188
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,260
You didn't build that,
build that business.

3189
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:29,990
You don't build that like that.
That is,

3190
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,730
that is the craziest way to look at 
things.

3191
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:34,770
Yeah.
If I was his friend,

3192
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:35,640
I would say,
okay,

3193
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:37,763
this is not the way to say what he did.
I think he started like highlight the 

3194
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:43,650
victim mentality.
Everybody's a victim.

3195
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:46,380
Whereas I like trump.
He says,

3196
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,050
you're in control.
Here's your opportunity.

3197
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:52,350
Make the most of it.
I would see it very differently.

3198
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:53,184
I would have said,
if you have a business and you start at 

3199
02:13:55,141 --> 02:13:56,520
yourself,
congratulations.

3200
02:13:56,521 --> 02:13:58,680
This is what American ingenuity is all 
about,

3201
02:13:58,681 --> 02:13:59,514
but we all have to be aware,
not just you not singing that person so 

3202
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:03,510
you didn't build up.

3203
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:04,433
Yeah.
I would say we all have to be aware of 

3204
02:14:06,241 --> 02:14:07,980
that.
Without our infrastructure,

3205
02:14:07,981 --> 02:14:09,360
we would,
none of us would be able to do that.

3206
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:14,340
So we all have to support this beautiful
system that we have in an empowering way

3207
02:14:14,341 --> 02:14:15,600
instead of,
you didn't do it,

3208
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:16,900
you didn't build it.
Yeah.

3209
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:20,190
Taking credit away from people who 
worked their ass off.

3210
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:23,880
And by the way,
he's a guy who's never been in business,

3211
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,733
right?
Just,

3212
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:25,733
he's a lawyer.
He went from being a lawyer to being a 

3213
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:29,850
professional politician to being the 
president.

3214
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:30,271
Yeah.
Bam,

3215
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:31,104
Bam,
Bam.

3216
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:31,740
I mean,
this is,

3217
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:34,230
that's one thing I don't like is people 
who are like,

3218
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,080
their goal is to be a politician.
Well,

3219
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:39,660
I don't like that.
I'd like it if they were awesome at it,

3220
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:43,050
but no one that I like.
It seems like the best.

3221
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,640
Like even back in,
you know,

3222
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:45,331
that,
you know,

3223
02:14:45,331 --> 02:14:46,640
when our country was founded,
it,

3224
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:48,090
those weren't politicians.

3225
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,923
Those were guys who had influenced,
who made good decisions and then they 

3226
02:14:51,721 --> 02:14:53,640
were politicians.
You know what I mean?

3227
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:57,210
I've been watching vikings a lot lately.
It's new.

3228
02:14:57,211 --> 02:14:58,830
Show up and watch him gay.
And,

3229
02:14:58,831 --> 02:15:02,430
uh,
it seems like there's no good leaders in

3230
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:04,080
the Viking world.
There was bad leaders.

3231
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:05,730
This leader suck.
Nobody wants,

3232
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:06,623
nobody wants a Goddamn leader.
And when you're a leader of 350 million 

3233
02:15:10,261 --> 02:15:11,610
people or whatever the hell we have 
here,

3234
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:13,853
it's just impossible.
It doesn't make any sense what's going 

3235
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:16,254
on,
Jamie?

3236
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:19,050
I just looked up that quote out of 
context,

3237
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:22,890
but he said it.
He said those two sentences,

3238
02:15:22,891 --> 02:15:24,570
but not in that way.
Oh,

3239
02:15:24,571 --> 02:15:28,790
if you've got a business they,
and build up a fake news.

3240
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:31,170
Okay.
So what is the actual quote?

3241
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,180
Wait,
what's her?

3242
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:34,014
The real quote.

3243
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:38,850
If you were successful,
somebody lung,

3244
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:39,321
lung,
Davies,

3245
02:15:39,321 --> 02:15:41,250
some help,
there was a great teacher,

3246
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,630
okay?
But what does it,

3247
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:44,490
if you've got a business,
you didn't build that.

3248
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:47,130
Okay?
Somebody invested in roads and bridges.

3249
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:48,090
Okay,
here it is.

3250
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:52,980
Somebody helped create this unbelievable
American system that we have allowed you

3251
02:15:52,981 --> 02:15:53,814
to throw that have,
uh,

3252
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:55,043
that we have that allowed you to thrive.
Somebody invested in the roads and 

3253
02:15:58,741 --> 02:16:00,660
bridges.
If you've got a business,

3254
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,700
you didn't build that.
That's just a shitty way to say it.

3255
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:05,970
I don't care.
Even in context.

3256
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:07,830
Somebody else made that happen.
Yeah.

3257
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,090
Not,
not somebody else.

3258
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:14,100
We all chipped in.
Did I know that's what he's saying.

3259
02:16:14,101 --> 02:16:14,934
But it's a shit way to say it.
It's a shit disempowering way to say it 

3260
02:16:18,631 --> 02:16:19,610
is.
That's what I don't like.

3261
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:22,650
Takes credit away from the people that 
there's a way to do that.

3262
02:16:22,651 --> 02:16:25,110
There's a way to phrase that that needs 
an edit and rewrite.

3263
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:26,123
And by the way,
how the fuck could even have time to do 

3264
02:16:28,411 --> 02:16:30,190
that when you're writing.
I mean,

3265
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,053
you're writing under the pressure of 
being the president of the United 

3266
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:34,600
States.
I totally sympathize.

3267
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:37,480
I get it.
I'm not saying I would have done better.

3268
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:39,670
I would have done way worse,
but it still sucks.

3269
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:41,980
Yeah.
It's just not a good way to say things.

3270
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:45,040
You're going to do that.
I don't,

3271
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:48,370
you said you said disempowering and 
that's exactly right.

3272
02:16:48,371 --> 02:16:49,810
And so,
um,

3273
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,320
it feels like this is,
there's a different tone right now.

3274
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:55,000
And I'm not saying,
you know,

3275
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:57,220
our president is perfect.
Just say white people.

3276
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:59,470
You like my people.
I'm not saying that at all.

3277
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:03,760
I'm not saying that at all,
but I'm just saying nobody's perfect.

3278
02:17:03,761 --> 02:17:06,550
But I liked that part of the message.
Well,

3279
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:08,110
he definitely has that part of the 
message,

3280
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:10,030
but he's obviously said a bunch of 
stupid shit too,

3281
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:13,240
but he's also a guy flies off the cuff.
I mean this,

3282
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:17,470
we have to take into consideration what 
this guy was his entire career.

3283
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:21,910
He's a giant larger than life 
personality with crazy hair,

3284
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,060
who puts his name on everything and then
he ran for president.

3285
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:29,170
Of course he's going to stay that guy 
when he becomes president.

3286
02:17:29,171 --> 02:17:31,240
We go down to know now that you're 
president,

3287
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:33,490
it's like when you,
when you're in,

3288
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:35,950
if you're playing beauty and the beast 
and you're the beast,

3289
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:36,963
you've got to act like the beast.
Now you've got the role and actually at 

3290
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:39,713
the like,
why are you still acting like hugh 

3291
02:17:40,631 --> 02:17:41,464
grant?
Yeah.

3292
02:17:41,510 --> 02:17:42,343
You know you can't,
I know it's the role of being the 

3293
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:47,110
president is this,
you know,

3294
02:17:47,130 --> 02:17:50,920
this majestic top of the mountain that 
we look at like,

3295
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:52,100
oh,
he's the guy.

3296
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,930
He's the main dude where you're supposed
to act like the president.

3297
02:17:55,931 --> 02:17:56,290
Like,
yeah,

3298
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:58,120
that's what they say.
He's not presidential.

3299
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,670
He never has been.
But you know what?

3300
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:02,630
He's been a leader,
you know,

3301
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:04,300
so here's what I know.

3302
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:05,343
I don't see anybody,
I don't see isis over here bombing the 

3303
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:10,270
shit out of the United States anymore 
cause they're almost,

3304
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:12,300
they're all dead.
There's a lot.

3305
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:13,180
Well,
there's a lot,

3306
02:18:13,181 --> 02:18:16,180
but they were never bombing the shit out
of the United States and trying to a few

3307
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:19,120
dummies that snuck over here and did 
some stupid shit here.

3308
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:20,410
Horrible Shit.
Yeah.

3309
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:23,770
Look,
the one thing that the military has said

3310
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,633
and friends of mine that are in the 
military and guys like Tim Kennedy that 

3311
02:18:27,281 --> 02:18:28,270
rejoined.
Yeah,

3312
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:33,840
he said that they feel like for the 
first time in a long time,

3313
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,313
the military is basically got the 
handcuffs off and that they are allowed 

3314
02:18:40,361 --> 02:18:44,080
to do things the way they think would be
best.

3315
02:18:44,081 --> 02:18:44,914
Right.
And a lot of people don't like to hear 

3316
02:18:46,241 --> 02:18:46,991
that.
They like to say,

3317
02:18:46,991 --> 02:18:47,824
well no,
the politicians are supposed to control 

3318
02:18:49,361 --> 02:18:50,194
the military and it's supposed to be,
you're not supposed to allow the 

3319
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:53,950
generals to make the decisions.

3320
02:18:54,350 --> 02:18:56,200
There's a,
there's a debate back we need,

3321
02:18:56,260 --> 02:19:00,040
and this is again like a lot of other 
things because a very complex,

3322
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:03,100
nuanced conversation that you'd have to 
have all the facts at your disposal.

3323
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:04,173
I don't know either do it,
but I can say they're not bombing the 

3324
02:19:06,371 --> 02:19:09,070
shit of the United States and sound like
a complete redneck.

3325
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:11,050
Right.
And that's how I see it.

3326
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:12,153
But I understand there is,
I mean you need a stride a military 

3327
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:15,813
because the world has some dark places 
and anybody who doesn't think that you 

3328
02:19:18,401 --> 02:19:19,234
need a strong military,
you need to pay attention to what the 

3329
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:23,770
fuck is going on in Syria,
in North Korea,

3330
02:19:23,771 --> 02:19:28,771
and a lot of parts of the world where 
they there chaos and this is a,

3331
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:34,160
an entirely real possibility anywhere,
anywhere that exists,

3332
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:35,233
it can exist here.
If you see horrible tyranny and 

3333
02:19:37,731 --> 02:19:39,860
destruction and chaos and other parts of
the world,

3334
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:43,130
the only reason why it's not here is 
because of geography.

3335
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:45,560
If they can get there,
they can get here.

3336
02:19:45,561 --> 02:19:45,990
If,
if,

3337
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:50,540
if things can go sideways in Iran or 
Iraq or wherever the fuck it is,

3338
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:51,523
they can go sideways in America too.
And if you don't think that we need 

3339
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:54,613
military,
your God damn crazy cause I would love 

3340
02:19:57,951 --> 02:19:58,784
it if we didn't.
I would love it if we lived in this 

3341
02:19:59,601 --> 02:20:01,760
utopian world where everybody treats 
people the way you were.

3342
02:20:01,761 --> 02:20:02,594
I would,
well you don't have to worry about if 

3343
02:20:03,711 --> 02:20:04,544
you were in our neighbors,
I would never worry about you invading 

3344
02:20:05,871 --> 02:20:06,704
me.
You know I'd be like Oh cam is never 

3345
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:10,760
going to like bring a gun over and 
fucking take over my house.

3346
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:13,670
He's a nice guy.
If the world was like that,

3347
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:15,620
it would be wonderful.
It would be wonderful.

3348
02:20:15,621 --> 02:20:16,454
But right now it's not currently right 
like that and people that I know like 

3349
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:22,910
Tim Kennedy,
a guy who's been there,

3350
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:25,190
I was done that got like Jocko willink.

3351
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:29,150
The guy has been there.
Those are the guys that I turned to when

3352
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:31,070
I want,
when I want to know like what's going on

3353
02:20:31,071 --> 02:20:33,740
over there.
I want to get a real perspective.

3354
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:34,873
You want to get a real perspective for 
someone who's been in active duty in a 

3355
02:20:38,481 --> 02:20:39,314
combat situation,
who's been to these horrific parts of 

3356
02:20:41,571 --> 02:20:42,404
the world.
Right.

3357
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,783
They can tell you what's going on and 
when they tell you that it's a better 

3358
02:20:46,491 --> 02:20:49,220
situation that the military has the 
handcuffs off.

3359
02:20:49,310 --> 02:20:51,230
I listened to them.
That's a good sign.

3360
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,720
Yeah.
I,

3361
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:55,100
yeah.
I talked to Tim at shot show and he,

3362
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:55,963
you know,
I about going back in and he said that 

3363
02:20:57,891 --> 02:20:59,040
same thing.
I mean,

3364
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:00,920
I don't know.
It just,

3365
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:04,070
it feels like a,
I dunno,

3366
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:08,180
it feels better that we're not having 
the terrorist issues over here anymore.

3367
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:08,661
Yeah.
I mean,

3368
02:21:08,661 --> 02:21:10,670
I really wish that everyone would come 
back home.

3369
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:12,470
I really wished that no one was in 
Afghanistan.

3370
02:21:12,471 --> 02:21:14,660
I really wished that we weren't the 
police people for the world.

3371
02:21:14,661 --> 02:21:15,494
I really wished that we're not sending 
young people to die and in foreign wars 

3372
02:21:18,861 --> 02:21:19,694
that don't make any sense to you or I or
anybody that really knows what the fuck 

3373
02:21:22,101 --> 02:21:22,934
is going on there.
But this is the world we live in right 

3374
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:26,020
now.
Yeah.

3375
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:28,520
You know,
energy it the best we can protect us,

3376
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:30,770
protect people here.
Yeah.

3377
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:33,440
And hopefully protect people there too.
You know,

3378
02:21:33,441 --> 02:21:34,274
it's just now that's why you got to 
respect the people that are over there 

3379
02:21:37,221 --> 02:21:39,320
doing that and,
and he does just like,

3380
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:42,500
you know,
what a sacrifice,

3381
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:43,820
you know,
and it's uh,

3382
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:48,170
I want to never take it for granted that
there are,

3383
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:50,090
you know,
we're safe here.

3384
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:50,924
Things are going on,
but just what's the sacrifices made by 

3385
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:54,710
people in the military?

3386
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:56,240
It's a,
I never want to forget it.

3387
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:57,733
Yeah.
It is a very controversial subject with 

3388
02:22:00,831 --> 02:22:03,620
people because um,
if you're on the left,

3389
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:06,680
you want less military,
you want less war,

3390
02:22:06,681 --> 02:22:09,260
you want less violence,
you want less everything and that,

3391
02:22:09,261 --> 02:22:10,094
that's a totally reasonable position.
But I think in a lot of ways it's like 

3392
02:22:13,671 --> 02:22:14,504
wildlife,
like you're talking about it as someone 

3393
02:22:16,971 --> 02:22:20,180
who's never experienced it.
And I think once you experience it,

3394
02:22:20,210 --> 02:22:22,100
and once you've been to these parts of 
the world,

3395
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:22,934
at least my perspective,
based on the descriptions that I've 

3396
02:22:25,861 --> 02:22:28,440
gotten from people that have been there 
or that it's,

3397
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,343
it's way more complex.
There are just parts of the world that 

3398
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:33,580
are fucked.
Yeah.

3399
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:35,063
Now,
yeah,

3400
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:36,390
it's an,
it's not black and white,

3401
02:22:36,391 --> 02:22:37,890
that's for sure.
And I think it's going to take many,

3402
02:22:37,891 --> 02:22:38,724
many generations for those parts of the 
world to become a better place for 

3403
02:22:43,411 --> 02:22:48,410
people to live in and then sort of catch
up to what we think of as civilization,

3404
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:49,260
the Western world.

3405
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:50,640
And Yeah.
You know,

3406
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,713
I mean,
you're looking at parts of the Middle 

3407
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,153
East where the women in Iran are risking
their lives and their safety by not 

3408
02:22:57,301 --> 02:22:59,160
wearing a religious outfit.
Yeah.

3409
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,023
There's all these protests where these 
women are on the streets were not 

3410
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:03,294
wearing the hijab and they're walking 
around and they risk being imprisoned 

3411
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:07,500
now.
It's amazing.

3412
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:10,830
Fucking crazy.
And these women are brave as hell,

3413
02:23:10,831 --> 02:23:11,664
man.
And they're out there just saying fuck 

3414
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:13,494
this enough already.
And they're taking pictures like that 

3415
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:17,004
and they're,
they're putting it up on social media 

3416
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:19,770
and you know,
there's a,

3417
02:23:19,771 --> 02:23:24,180
a big revolt there right now where 
people are just tired of it.

3418
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:26,730
They want fucking freedom,
you know,

3419
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:28,740
and they see what's going on in the rest
of the world.

3420
02:23:28,741 --> 02:23:29,574
They have the Internet,
they didn't get a chance to see what's 

3421
02:23:31,201 --> 02:23:32,034
going on in America.
And that's one of the things that we 

3422
02:23:33,721 --> 02:23:36,020
always have to remember about America.
Yeah.

3423
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:38,310
America might be fucked in some ways and
there's,

3424
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,583
we definitely have issues,
but there is more opportunity and more 

3425
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:45,114
possibility for you to do what you want 
to do here than almost anywhere on the 

3426
02:23:48,511 --> 02:23:50,790
planet earth as a fact.
That's a fact.

3427
02:23:50,810 --> 02:23:51,900
Yeah.
That's a fact.

3428
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:52,734
And there's more art that comes out of 
here and there's more comedy that comes 

3429
02:23:55,381 --> 02:23:56,850
out of here.
There's more,

3430
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:59,790
there's so much shit,
more movies.

3431
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:00,683
There's,
there's a lot of great shit that comes 

3432
02:24:02,371 --> 02:24:03,450
out of this one spot.

3433
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:04,570
Yeah.
It's a,

3434
02:24:04,571 --> 02:24:06,250
it's a great place to,
I mean we're,

3435
02:24:06,251 --> 02:24:09,880
we're blessed to live here and have w 
we've only known this,

3436
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:10,833
you know,
and I couldn't imagine living someplace 

3437
02:24:12,791 --> 02:24:17,140
where it wouldn't matter how smart or 
how hard of a worker you are or how,

3438
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:20,680
you know,
whatever talented you were,

3439
02:24:20,681 --> 02:24:23,590
you weren't getting out of there.
And that's how it is in some places.

3440
02:24:23,591 --> 02:24:24,600
And so,
you know,

3441
02:24:24,601 --> 02:24:28,060
in here it's not like that.
And Man,

3442
02:24:28,061 --> 02:24:29,860
I just,
I just hope we never,

3443
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:32,980
I never need to forget that and I never 
want to forget that.

3444
02:24:32,981 --> 02:24:33,814
And I just hope other people just 
realize that because it's not like I've 

3445
02:24:36,671 --> 02:24:38,080
been everywhere.
But I just,

3446
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:38,973
I know that the,
the challenge is like the women have 

3447
02:24:41,710 --> 02:24:43,600
that you were talking about.
It's like,

3448
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:46,090
I couldn't imagine that.
Yeah.

3449
02:24:46,170 --> 02:24:46,700
Look,

3450
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:50,300
one of the reasons why I'm Pro America 
is cause I'm pro human being.

3451
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:51,950
Yeah.
And I think there's more,

3452
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:52,993
there's more chances for people to be 
who they really want to be and become 

3453
02:24:56,151 --> 02:24:58,100
what they really want to be here.
You know?

3454
02:24:58,101 --> 02:25:03,101
And I support a lot of left wing ideas,
equality and freedom and gay marriage.

3455
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,090
I think he should be able to do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

3456
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:09,350
I mean,
go have fun,

3457
02:25:09,351 --> 02:25:12,020
just be nice.
Don't just do b,

3458
02:25:12,021 --> 02:25:15,320
you just go be you.
So when you know,

3459
02:25:15,321 --> 02:25:16,154
people see me and they like spent like 
to see this giant American flag behind 

3460
02:25:19,941 --> 02:25:22,250
me and they think immediately,
oh,

3461
02:25:22,251 --> 02:25:23,590
right wing,
oh,

3462
02:25:23,591 --> 02:25:25,330
fucking conservative.
All right.

3463
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:25,961
Or whatever.
This is,

3464
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:27,730
what is this?
What do you support?

3465
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:29,110
Imperialism,
you support this?

3466
02:25:29,111 --> 02:25:33,040
Like no,
I support the idea of what America is.

3467
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:34,750
Yeah.
That's what I support.

3468
02:25:34,810 --> 02:25:35,770
Yeah.
Yeah,

3469
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,570
me too.
Fuck yeah.

3470
02:25:38,390 --> 02:25:39,350
Woo.

3471
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:46,700
So elk hunting September and we back 
same spot going to the desert rat.

3472
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:47,710
Is that,
is that locked in?

3473
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:50,560
Hell yeah.
That was crazy.

3474
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:52,330
Yeah.
That's a beautiful place.

3475
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:53,193
Now.
I know.

3476
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:54,940
That was one of the most fun times I've 
ever had.

3477
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:56,140
Yeah.
Well we're getting it.

3478
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:57,940
We're going to do it again.
I'm excited.

3479
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:00,520
Me Too.
470,000 views.

3480
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:04,060
That video was a lot of fun to make too,
man.

3481
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:05,770
I just wish that they had put in,
uh,

3482
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:08,920
the,
the elk that you shot your elk,

3483
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:11,350
you did wind up shooting out a,
an elk,

3484
02:26:11,351 --> 02:26:12,184
but did,
did the,

3485
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:16,090
the video that did not get the actual 
Arrow hitting the elk on camera.

3486
02:26:16,091 --> 02:26:17,980
So what the issue was,
it's tough.

3487
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:20,230
You know,
bow hunting is hard,

3488
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:24,250
you know,
in film and so it's,

3489
02:26:24,251 --> 02:26:25,150
uh,
you know,

3490
02:26:25,151 --> 02:26:28,120
we do the best we can to tell the story.
Um,

3491
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,330
I don't think it does tell the story 
very well.

3492
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:32,920
No,
but we do the best we can.

3493
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:34,020
It is hard,
you know,

3494
02:26:34,050 --> 02:26:36,340
I mean she'd be a lot longer.
That's what I think.

3495
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,480
I think,
um,

3496
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:40,390
I think that things should have been at 
least an hour and I think,

3497
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:41,224
um,
even then it wouldn't have told the 

3498
02:26:41,921 --> 02:26:44,920
whole story because you look at it like,
it's one of the things that uh,

3499
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:47,610
I've told a friend when we were watching
uh,

3500
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:49,030
a hunting show before,
they're like,

3501
02:26:49,031 --> 02:26:49,870
wow,
it looks so easy.

3502
02:26:49,871 --> 02:26:51,460
They just go out there and they always 
shoot something.

3503
02:26:51,461 --> 02:26:52,294
I'm like,
man,

3504
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:54,940
to shoot one of these shows,
like we were watching meat eater.

3505
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:56,620
First of all,
meat eaters,

3506
02:26:56,621 --> 02:26:59,260
one of the rare shows that they'll have 
a lot of shows where they don't,

3507
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,153
they're not successful.
Like I've done two different shows with 

3508
02:27:03,011 --> 02:27:04,210
them.
We were weren't successful.

3509
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:07,390
We just go out.
There are seven days most hunting,

3510
02:27:07,391 --> 02:27:08,050
most hunting.

3511
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:08,883
Yeah.
So when you boil all that down to 22 

3512
02:27:10,841 --> 02:27:12,320
minutes with commercials,
yeah.

3513
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:16,000
It just looks like it inevitably you're 
going to get to about 18 minutes in,

3514
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:18,040
someone's going to shoot something.
Yay.

3515
02:27:18,041 --> 02:27:18,874
They got it.
It seems like you're shooting things 

3516
02:27:21,071 --> 02:27:23,110
that are definitely going to be there,
but that's not,

3517
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:24,930
that's not the case.
Now.

3518
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,830
There's no guarantee,
especially with the ball,

3519
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:29,680
especially with the bow.
I and I think,

3520
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:31,690
well,
I mean we can film on ourselves.

3521
02:27:31,691 --> 02:27:33,970
We can feel ourselves as long as we 
want.

3522
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:34,863
That's what I think we should do.
I've been thinking about that a lot 

3523
02:27:36,531 --> 02:27:37,364
because I was frustrated by that whole 
thing and this archaic idea that 

3524
02:27:40,151 --> 02:27:40,984
everything has to be 10 minutes long.
You're talking to a guy that does a 

3525
02:27:42,551 --> 02:27:43,384
three hour podcasts that talking for 
quite a while today and millions of 

3526
02:27:47,141 --> 02:27:48,550
people listen to this,
so I just,

3527
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:49,690
I don't buy it.

3528
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:53,290
I think it's an archaic,
antiquated way of looking at things.

3529
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:56,830
I don't think it's right and I think 
this idea that people have an incredibly

3530
02:27:56,831 --> 02:27:58,750
short attention span.
Listen,

3531
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:04,170
people are consumers of entertainment 
and especially people who love hunting.

3532
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:08,230
I watch a lot of videos.
I watch a lot of hunting videos.

3533
02:28:08,231 --> 02:28:12,040
I'll watch a lot of videos on science.
I launch a lot of shit.

3534
02:28:12,041 --> 02:28:15,040
I watch hours and hours of stuff,
things that I'm interested in.

3535
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,110
The people that are interested in elk 
hunting.

3536
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:18,273
They don't want to just see a couple of 
guys laughing and joking around and an 

3537
02:28:20,831 --> 02:28:21,980
Arrow hits a big bowl

3538
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,300
and everybody's happy.
No.

3539
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:24,770
They want to see like what,
what?

3540
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:26,330
What happened?
Like what was the struggle?

3541
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:28,570
There was a lot of struggle.
There was a lot of damage.

3542
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:31,130
We did have to keep hammering.
That was fun.

3543
02:28:31,490 --> 02:28:33,470
That was,
that was that one clip was hilarious.

3544
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:34,910
That was told,
by the way,

3545
02:28:34,911 --> 02:28:36,920
folks who listen to this or watching 
this,

3546
02:28:36,921 --> 02:28:39,920
if you watch that clip of Cam and I,
that was not rehearsed now.

3547
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:41,900
That just came out of nowhere.
We were just fucking around.

3548
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:44,780
We will keep hammering.
He's been around a little while,

3549
02:28:44,781 --> 02:28:47,320
so he's been around a long time.
They thought that was the origins of it.

3550
02:28:47,470 --> 02:28:50,120
Did that.
That was because that's how good we sold

3551
02:28:50,121 --> 02:28:51,230
it.
Yeah.

3552
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:54,650
That's how good we sold that thing.
Yeah.

3553
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:58,260
Well that's your sense of humor and I 
think most people are not aware of that.

3554
02:28:58,270 --> 02:28:59,230
This is what you say.

3555
02:28:59,230 --> 02:29:00,063
That's fair.
You have a very funny dry sense of 

3556
02:29:01,941 --> 02:29:03,230
humor.
You know?

3557
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:05,000
That was a,
that was fun.

3558
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:05,871
Yeah,
we had,

3559
02:29:05,871 --> 02:29:08,090
it was a lot of fun.
So let's come in.

3560
02:29:08,091 --> 02:29:08,924
This time is Adam to green tree.
You're going to come down a alert to 

3561
02:29:11,721 --> 02:29:12,530
Utah?
Yes.

3562
02:29:12,530 --> 02:29:13,250
Oh,
I don't know.

3563
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:14,150
This is,
listen,

3564
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:15,530
underarmour.
His shit together.

3565
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:17,060
This is what we need.
Remy,

3566
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:18,750
Warren,
Adam Green Tree.

3567
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:20,900
John Dudley,
Cam Haines,

3568
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:22,360
me,
Ben O'brian.

3569
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:24,590
Make it happen.
Salad.

3570
02:29:25,220 --> 02:29:26,930
Wrap it up.
Make a video.

3571
02:29:26,931 --> 02:29:29,510
An hour long.
How about just under armour?

3572
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:30,433
Let me film it.
I just let me handle this because I 

3573
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:35,870
don't know what the fuck you're doing.
I think 10 minutes.

3574
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:37,110
I know.
I think we can,

3575
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:38,630
uh,
I just want to,

3576
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:39,613
man,
I've always wanted to just share a 

3577
02:29:42,561 --> 02:29:46,900
hunting adventure.
Just the real hunger adventure.

3578
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:50,000
Give it to constant content.
Uh,

3579
02:29:50,390 --> 02:29:52,940
the time to develop the story.

3580
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,460
Just,
just let it evolve.

3581
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:58,310
You know?
Do you watch those hush and guys on a,

3582
02:29:58,311 --> 02:30:01,430
on youtube now I have great videos.
Are they good?

3583
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:03,710
Yeah.
And they've got a lot of content in.

3584
02:30:03,711 --> 02:30:07,190
One of the things that you really get 
out of their content is you really get a

3585
02:30:07,191 --> 02:30:08,024
sense of how difficult it is.
And mostly what they're doing is public 

3586
02:30:10,791 --> 02:30:11,571
land hunting.
Well,

3587
02:30:11,571 --> 02:30:13,300
born and raised.
There's that stuff,

3588
02:30:13,301 --> 02:30:14,310
that group of guys.
Yeah,

3589
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:16,430
I'll watch that.
I watched those guys too.

3590
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:17,323
Yeah.
But one of the beautiful things about 

3591
02:30:18,561 --> 02:30:21,040
youtube is there's no time parameters.
No.

3592
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,820
And people,
yeah.

3593
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:23,683
I mean we are just kind of locked into 
this 22 minutes with the commercials 

3594
02:30:26,841 --> 02:30:29,810
type thing from the outdoor channel and 
it doesn't need to be,

3595
02:30:29,811 --> 02:30:30,644
like I was talking with a brand and 
shockey about this back at [inaudible] 

3596
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:38,810
and he's so talented as far as a film 
maker goes and,

3597
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:39,913
and uh,
even in womack who put together our 

3598
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:42,464
Utah,
I mean without the handcuffs of a time 

3599
02:30:44,121 --> 02:30:44,960
restraint.

3600
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:47,690
I just think there's,
the sky's the limit.

3601
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:48,763
I agree too.
I think the story should be what the 

3602
02:30:50,631 --> 02:30:54,230
story is and just say,
just make it what it is.

3603
02:30:54,231 --> 02:30:55,064
You don't,
I don't give a fuck of it's 40 minutes 

3604
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:58,580
or an hour and 40 minutes.
People will watch it.

3605
02:30:58,640 --> 02:30:59,940
People will watch it.
Yeah.

3606
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:03,050
And the ones who don't,
they weren't going to watch it anyway.

3607
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:04,273
The ones that,
the idea that like you get it in 10 

3608
02:31:05,961 --> 02:31:08,690
minutes and somehow or another it's more
digestible in 10 minutes.

3609
02:31:08,691 --> 02:31:11,690
Like stop.
That's not real.

3610
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:12,763
This is a,
people have these weird ideas in their 

3611
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:16,670
head about things like,
oh,

3612
02:31:16,671 --> 02:31:19,470
but the statistics show that more people
watch 10 minute videos.

3613
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,723
Well if you want him watch videos about 
babies chewing bubblegum or some stupid 

3614
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:24,810
shit like that.
Yeah,

3615
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:26,070
yeah,
the 10 minutes.

3616
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:27,053
But you're supposed to be showing 
respect to what is one of the more 

3617
02:31:31,621 --> 02:31:36,110
difficult and misunderstood pursuits in 
the United States.

3618
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:37,760
Right.
And that's bow hunting,

3619
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:40,410
right?
It's incredibly difficult and incredibly

3620
02:31:40,411 --> 02:31:41,244
misunderstood.
And I think it's a noble pursuit and I 

3621
02:31:44,461 --> 02:31:45,294
think it's also,
it's one of the more intriguing things 

3622
02:31:48,660 --> 02:31:50,850
and more interesting things I've ever 
done in my life.

3623
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,380
Well,
I know,

3624
02:31:52,381 --> 02:31:54,510
and I don't know if you captured all in 
one film,

3625
02:31:54,511 --> 02:31:55,660
but I just know that,
you know,

3626
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:56,543
if somehow we could capture the,
just the more of the journey because 

3627
02:32:00,361 --> 02:32:02,280
there's people that don't know anything 
about it.

3628
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:06,210
This one or know how to get started.
I don't know if you'd have one film that

3629
02:32:06,211 --> 02:32:07,044
I'd do all of that,
but I just know that there's people 

3630
02:32:08,311 --> 02:32:10,440
hungry for knowledge out there that 
we're,

3631
02:32:10,441 --> 02:32:11,274
we're reaching even with this podcast or
with social media that haven't been in 

3632
02:32:14,521 --> 02:32:17,130
great.
So it's like we're making these films to

3633
02:32:17,131 --> 02:32:19,170
people who already hunters,
right.

3634
02:32:19,180 --> 02:32:20,013
I already know everything.

3635
02:32:20,310 --> 02:32:21,143
And so to them,
oh we got to do this in a short period 

3636
02:32:23,221 --> 02:32:24,054
of time of those are gonna get bored 
because they've done this a million 

3637
02:32:25,351 --> 02:32:27,540
times themselves.
Well does bullshit.

3638
02:32:27,570 --> 02:32:29,350
No.
That we need to,

3639
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:31,560
to make it for the masses.
Exactly.

3640
02:32:31,561 --> 02:32:32,890
Cause that's who we're reaching now.
Yeah.

3641
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,010
I mean it's the millions and millions 
and millions.

3642
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:37,740
We're reaching more people than actually
by hunting licenses.

3643
02:32:38,010 --> 02:32:41,370
So we need to keep that,
keep re need to remember that.

3644
02:32:41,670 --> 02:32:42,503
Yeah.
And the idea that you're even reaching 

3645
02:32:44,611 --> 02:32:46,290
hunters,
that they're going to get bored after 10

3646
02:32:46,291 --> 02:32:47,850
minutes.
That's crazy now.

3647
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,110
Yeah.
Cause I'm like you,

3648
02:32:49,111 --> 02:32:52,530
I watch all sorts of hunting stuff,
especially you and me.

3649
02:32:52,531 --> 02:32:57,180
We're in attaining is fuck let it roll.
Yeah.

3650
02:32:57,210 --> 02:32:58,710
Like the uh,
what,

3651
02:32:58,711 --> 02:33:00,210
what were we saying?
Oh yeah,

3652
02:33:00,211 --> 02:33:01,650
with the,
with the um,

3653
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:03,690
chicken tied to the dog neck.

3654
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:09,180
It was one of the funniest things cams 
ever said.

3655
02:33:09,330 --> 02:33:10,850
He was talking about,
uh,

3656
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:12,600
this guy,
his dog was,

3657
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:15,270
my dogs killed a few chickens and I'm 
like,

3658
02:33:15,271 --> 02:33:16,104
fuck,
how'd you get your dog to stop killing 

3659
02:33:16,831 --> 02:33:18,030
chickens?
He goes,

3660
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:18,893
oh,
we tied a dead chicken to his neck and 

3661
02:33:21,181 --> 02:33:23,460
cam goes and she's tired.
Dead stripper to your neck.

3662
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:30,810
And it was just out of the blue and I 
was fucking crying,

3663
02:33:30,811 --> 02:33:31,644
laughing.
But that,

3664
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:33,150
that was one of the funniest things you 
said.

3665
02:33:33,151 --> 02:33:35,130
But there was one other one.
What was the other one?

3666
02:33:35,131 --> 02:33:37,710
We had a hard time remembering it.
Remember the other one that you had said

3667
02:33:37,711 --> 02:33:38,910
before?
Yeah,

3668
02:33:39,150 --> 02:33:43,470
it was even funnier than that.
But my point is he's got fucking standup

3669
02:33:43,471 --> 02:33:45,660
comedy timing.
That sounds like something that,

3670
02:33:45,661 --> 02:33:47,220
like one of my comic friends would've 
said,

3671
02:33:47,250 --> 02:33:48,150
oh,
okay,

3672
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:50,830
I wish I could remember the other one 
was another one that was funny.

3673
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:53,910
Or I now fuck I now,
God dammit,

3674
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:55,473
we laughed about it.
The dead stripper tied your neck for a 

3675
02:33:57,391 --> 02:33:58,500
long,
many times.

3676
02:33:58,501 --> 02:34:00,090
Many times.
It's also too,

3677
02:34:00,091 --> 02:34:04,140
at the end of the day,
kind of exhaust higher delirious dinner.

3678
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:06,310
Yeah.
That's sort of,

3679
02:34:06,311 --> 02:34:08,430
the timing comes in.
Exactly.

3680
02:34:08,580 --> 02:34:09,413
Well,
it's like those hunting camps are so 

3681
02:34:10,741 --> 02:34:12,680
much fun.
Like you at the end of the day,

3682
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:15,200
you and me and Ben sitting around 
laughing,

3683
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:17,660
cracking jokes,
it's half fun of it.

3684
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:18,963
The family up there,
the land family love those guys of the 

3685
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:22,110
earth.
No,

3686
02:34:22,110 --> 02:34:24,790
Tom Land and his boys,
they just,

3687
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:26,620
it's just,
it's just fun to be,

3688
02:34:26,621 --> 02:34:28,290
they feel like family when you go back 
up there.

3689
02:34:28,310 --> 02:34:30,100
He'll feel,
feel that this year,

3690
02:34:30,101 --> 02:34:31,570
you know,
he's a great guy.

3691
02:34:31,571 --> 02:34:34,180
The whole staff they had there was 
fantastic.

3692
02:34:34,181 --> 02:34:35,014
It says a,
an awesome place and it's such a 

3693
02:34:37,031 --> 02:34:39,010
beautiful piece of land.
You know,

3694
02:34:39,011 --> 02:34:42,910
this is 240,000 acres.

3695
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:43,910
Yeah.
And that's,

3696
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:44,980
that's,
you know,

3697
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:45,903
I know we're probably wrapping this up,
but so when you talk about hunting and 

3698
02:34:48,611 --> 02:34:49,750
conservation real quick,
you know,

3699
02:34:49,751 --> 02:34:54,190
on that piece of property 240 they could
make more money by running cattle on it,

3700
02:34:54,370 --> 02:34:55,450
right?
Do you realize that?

3701
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:56,583
But if they ran cattle on it,
the habitat would be thrashed right 

3702
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,720
there.
The water sources,

3703
02:35:01,721 --> 02:35:04,330
it'd be thrashed.
All those flowers,

3704
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:07,540
the grouse that lived there gone because
it's just cattle.

3705
02:35:07,541 --> 02:35:09,790
But if his goal was making money,
they could just do that.

3706
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:10,833
But the goal is,
is to make money but also enhance the 

3707
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:14,950
habitat and that's,
you know,

3708
02:35:14,951 --> 02:35:16,900
hunting is the best way to do that.
Yeah.

3709
02:35:16,901 --> 02:35:18,970
And it's,
it's just a magical place.

3710
02:35:18,971 --> 02:35:19,804
Like the mule deer that we saw wandering
around his big mule deer and they have 

3711
02:35:23,111 --> 02:35:25,330
everything there,
all sorts of different wildlife.

3712
02:35:25,331 --> 02:35:27,190
It's this and it's gorgeous country to 
do.

3713
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:29,080
It is beautiful.
Yeah.

3714
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:31,720
All right,
let's wrap this bitch up.

3715
02:35:31,721 --> 02:35:34,000
Cameron.
Our Haynes on Instagram,

3716
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,893
and is that the same as twitter?
But you don't even use twitter really 

3717
02:35:36,221 --> 02:35:38,710
right now on facebook.
You use facebook at all anymore.

3718
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,330
Little bit.
People die off that,

3719
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:41,350
right?
Instagram's got,

3720
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:43,570
instagram's got it right now.
All right.

3721
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,040
Um,
and uh,

3722
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:46,450
next,
next video.

3723
02:35:46,451 --> 02:35:49,900
We make folks be about four hours long.
No,

3724
02:35:50,060 --> 02:35:51,100
you can't.
The video,

3725
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,410
the hunting video.
We're going to keep hammering.

3726
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:55,240
We're going to keep hammering.
Bye everybody.

3727
02:36:02,070 --> 02:36:02,903
Okay.
