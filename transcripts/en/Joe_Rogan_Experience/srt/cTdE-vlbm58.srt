1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,803
Good.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,393
Four,
three,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,630
two,
one.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Live Brian Red Ban.
Feeling Buddy.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,210
Great.
Feeling it in here.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,600
Angry.
Alright.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,820
Sore.
But I got it.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,220
I love this new studio.
It's so amazing.

9
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,710
It's crazy how much stuff you're going 
to have in here.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,910
It's going to be bad ass.
Yeah,

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,620
we're working on it.
We're making it happen.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,200
Before we do this,
I have to apologize.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,810
I have to apologize for something I said
last week,

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,703
last Tuesday in passing,
we were watching a corey feldman clip 

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,070
and uh,
corey feldman was doing this crazy dance

16
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:45,071
and Greg Fitzsimmons was in and Corey 
Feldman had some little tight jacket and

17
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:50,531
it's just weird song he was saying and I
said that jacket was wearing that jacket

18
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:55,270
when he was young and he got diddled 
his.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,120
I was trying to make Greg left,
right?

20
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,580
You're trying to say fucked up things to
make comedians laugh,

21
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:02,870
which is what we do and we get together.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,703
We say the most heinous shit,
but I felt terrible after somebody 

23
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,010
pointed it out.
Like I didn't even remember saying it.

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,413
Some pointed out.
And then Saturday I watched it and I 

25
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:18,050
felt so terrible because the especially 
like out of context,

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,250
like it's just me laughing about him 
getting detailed.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,490
Right.
And it just,

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,060
it's horrible.
Anything that's taken out of context,

29
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:28,140
like that's going to make you feel weird
if you don't see that,

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,870
but there's no excuse like what it is.
It was,

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,783
you swing it a lot of pitches when you 
do an live podcasts and sometimes you 

32
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,270
hit yourself in the Dick with a bat.
And that's what I did.

33
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,340
It was,
it was totally wrong.

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,070
It wasn't,
it wasn't funny.

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,030
I took a swing at it was,
it was the wrong thing to do.

36
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,380
It was what the best way to describe it 
is.

37
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,620
It was thoughtless because I didn't 
really didn't think I was just trying to

38
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,390
say something fucked up to make greg 
lap.

39
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,970
I wasn't thinking like this is a real 
person.

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,160
And I've watched him the other day in a 
movie man.

41
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:01,994
I saw him in Gremlins.
I was watching gremlins with my kids 

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,810
after.
Actually we did the podcast before.

43
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,000
I watched the clip though,
because I didn't,

44
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,960
I hadn't seen,
you know,

45
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:16,820
I do it and then I'm done with it,
but I didn't think about it.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,790
I said,
you know,

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,910
first of all,
he was doing the Michael Jackson thing,

48
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:20,744
you know,
he wears a Michael Jackson jacket and 

49
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,230
dance like Michael Jackson.
He didn't.

50
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,130
He said Michael Jackson didn't even do 
anything to them,

51
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:28,100
so it didn't even make sense.
It was just a stupid line to say,

52
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:31,820
but I felt terrible.
I couldn't sleep Saturday night.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,930
I felt really bad.

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,620
I felt really bad.
I felt bad for a bunch of reasons.

55
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,454
One,
I felt bad because it's a mean thing to 

56
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,920
say and I didn't.
I didn't mean it to be.

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,950
Even though it was just,
I was just trying to be funny.

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,993
You know patrice o Neal said something 
once when he was defending opie and 

59
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,630
Anthony,
he was saying,

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,740
when someone says something really funny
or the same person says something really

61
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,260
fucked up,
it all comes from the same place.

62
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,060
Like they're trying to do the same 
thing.

63
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,370
They just miss you know.
But that was without a doubt,

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
the worst miss,
the most embarrassing to me.

65
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,110
I'm the most depressing the most.
Uh,

66
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,973
what's the best way to describe it?
Just so disappointed that I did that 

67
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,830
because he is a,
he was a kid,

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,813
you know,
I don't even think he actually got 

69
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:23,560
molested.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,130
I think he was actually saying that 
Corey Haim got molested and he didn't.

71
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,520
Well,
that would make sense where I,

72
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,400
Corey Haim did so much drugs,
you know,

73
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,870
if he did get molested.
But.

74
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,943
Well,
I started looking into this shit more 

75
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,310
and more recently like Hollywood 
molestation with children.

76
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,540
It's,
it's no joke,

77
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,280
man,
like just as.

78
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:46,000
It's no joke with sexual harassment and 
assault with women.

79
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,834
When you see me,
this Harvey Weinstein thing and these 

80
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,140
other directors now are getting in 
trouble for the same thing.

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,880
The same kind of shit happened to a lot 
of kids that were involved in,

82
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
in these child movies.
You don't think about that when you're 

83
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,800
just trying to crack a joke.
And I just want everybody know if,

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,260
if you were disappointed,
there's no.

85
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,820
If you were disappointed in me,
there's no way.

86
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,590
You were more disappointed in me than I 
am disappointed in me.

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,700
I didn't sleep Saturday.
I had a hard time sleeping last night.

88
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,623
I felt bad about it all day.
I felt terrible and I went to underwood 

89
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,960
farms.
You know what an underwear ad farms is a

90
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:20,890
great family.
Time.

91
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,990
Had a good time with the kids.
You know,

92
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,390
we're picking out pumpkin's and doing 
all this stuff,

93
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,830
but the entire time I was there there's 
like this blanket of like,

94
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,780
how did I say that?
Why did I say that?

95
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:36,730
Like sometimes you'll say something 
fucked up and then after you did it,

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,030
like you can't believe you said it like 
it.

97
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,230
Especially when we're doing this live.
Right.

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,513
If you and me were just out at a diner,
we would probably say that and laugh to 

99
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:47,410
each other because no one's getting hurt
by it.

100
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,870
We're just making each other laugh and 
we do that all the time.

101
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,704
Right.
We say started shit to each other all 

102
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,864
the time,
but when other people hear it and then 

103
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,300
the guy hears it,
like of course you heard it.

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,210
Like that's just wrong,
you know,

105
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,770
I didn't mean to have that impact and I 
didn't think about it.

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,760
It was very thoughtless,
so I was extremely disappointed myself.

107
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,163
But what's interesting about it,
trying to look at it from a different 

108
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,600
perspective,
trying to like examine it,

109
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,434
like the feeling of doing something that
you shouldn't have done that might have 

110
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,780
hurt someone's feelings because you were
senseless and thoughtless.

111
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,060
That feeling is a terrible feeling and 
it's,

112
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:31,630
it's weird.
Like it overcomes your whole day.

113
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,464
Like,
no,

114
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,563
I don't think anybody knew because I was
still having fun with the family and 

115
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:38,770
everybody was laughing.
We did a lot of kid stuff.

116
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,600
But at the end of the day that was with 
me all day.

117
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,531
I mean,
it was just,

118
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:48,550
it was like a fucking wet blanket that I
was carrying with me,

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,230
like a depression blanket.
And um,

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,450
there's no,
uh,

121
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,710
there's no other way to put it.

122
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,590
Then you know that I'm sorry and then I 
shouldn't have done it.

123
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,460
But what I was thinking while it was all
happening,

124
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,294
I was like this feeling of letting a 
bunch of people down and hurting 

125
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:12,170
someone's feeling,
doing something in a mass way,

126
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,093
like on the Internet.
This is a new feeling like before you 

127
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,040
could,
people could be upset at you,

128
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,550
maybe someone you know or people you 
work with and it's a bad feeling.

129
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,710
But this is a different kind of bad 
feeling.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,250
It's an intensified bad feeling.
Especially like the way I did it because

131
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,084
it's so stupid.
And I would think that at this age I'm 

132
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:32,414
50.
I would see like a don saying stupid 

133
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,870
shit.
Obviously I'm not,

134
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,590
you know,
I'm,

135
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,423
I'm not done.
Like that's the fucked up thing about 

136
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,160
being a person.
It requires constant diligence.

137
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,410
Like you have to constantly pay 
attention to your thinking.

138
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,550
You have to constantly pay attention to 
the way you behave and who you are.

139
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,330
You can't just go off the cuff.
And the other thing,

140
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,320
it's making me think of,
you know,

141
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,980
doing this sober October thing.
And um,

142
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,293
obviously I love pot and uh,
I've always loved pot and I've been a 

143
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,180
regular pot smoker for 20 years,
but what,

144
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,260
there is a difference in my personality 
when I'm not smoking pot,

145
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,360
grumpy,
uh,

146
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,380
more,
more tense,

147
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,740
less kind and I have to like catch 
myself before I get upset about things.

148
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,280
Whereas when I'm high or if I even then 
I'm not,

149
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,370
if I'm,
if I'm not even if I'm high,

150
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,050
but if I'm just smoking on a regular 
basis,

151
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,243
I'm way more mellow,
way more relaxed about things and way 

152
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,880
more.
Um,

153
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,880
I guess the right word is humble.
It's not like I'm cocky when I'm sober,

154
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,860
but I'm like really aware,
much more aware of gratitude.

155
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,950
And Fortunately I'm lucky and 
appreciative of my friends.

156
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:49,040
I want to hug people more.
Like pod has a lot of,

157
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,874
for me from my fucked up brain has a lot
of really positive effects as a lot of 

158
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:54,914
really positive personality effects.
But I think I might be downplaying my 

159
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,044
dependence on it.
Like I think that might've been going 

160
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,590
like that's nothing.
I'll just fucking quit pot.

161
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,260
It's nothing man.
I don't know about all that.

162
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,120
Um,
my dreams.

163
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,890
Here's another thing.
You remember him,

164
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,540
dude,
I don't remember them.

165
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
They're fucking crazy.
They're all wolves and bears and 

166
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,910
drowning and falling off buildings and,
and fucking lava coming at you.

167
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,460
It's all primal shit.
Wow.

168
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,960
It's weird,
man.

169
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,310
I'm having all these,
uh,

170
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,670
these Predator dreams.
It's,

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,780
it's very strange.
Like,

172
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,170
um,
I had these dreams,

173
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,004
these,
these cart almost cartoon wolves at 

174
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,160
these giant feet and they will like 
running through the woods and uh,

175
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,620
somehow or another trying to get away 
from them.

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,600
I had a dream that I was for some reason
I was crawling through some fucking cave

177
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,010
and there was an enormous bear inside 
this cave and it was looking at me and I

178
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,290
was like,
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

179
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,124
And it was like trying to figure out 
whether or not the bear was going to 

180
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:56,730
come after me,
but I mean super vivid.

181
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,133
I don't,
I don't remember my dreams when I was 

182
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,200
getting high and last I took the Alpha 
brain before I went to sleep.

183
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,243
That,
that will fucking spark you up some 

184
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,140
crazy lucid dreams.
But other than that,

185
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,770
I would just sleep good.
I never had a problem sleeping.

186
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,510
I'd get up in the morning and I'd be 
fine.

187
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,793
But there is a,
there is a big difference between me 

188
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,350
when I'm using pot and me when I'm not 
using.

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,420
I'm noticing the same thing with Ari and
those are.

190
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,660
He gets a little more intense about 
things,

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,553
a little more upset about things.
He's fucking gets really mad at people 

192
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,140
on comments.
He fucking fights with people online.

193
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,080
They call them a Welsh fuck you.
I'm not a wheelchair.

194
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,790
He's like super intense.

195
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,610
Have you ever switched in it?
They.

196
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,800
Have you done anything more since you've
done this?

197
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,460
Like are you drinking more coffee 
everyday,

198
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:44,950
are you?

199
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,160
No.
Well I'm doing so much goddamn yoga that

200
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:51,870
because we have this hot yoga challenge 
and the hot yoga challenges,

201
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,723
you have to do 15 in a month.
Well my dumb ass did one the first week 

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,180
and two the second week.
So yeah,

203
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,320
so I've been on a rampage where,
um,

204
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,740
I've done eight straight days of yoga in
a row as of today.

205
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,451
Wow.
Yeah.

206
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,800
And I have four more to go.
Um,

207
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:12,720
so the Thomas biggest problem.
Tom?

208
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,580
A week?
Yeah.

209
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,903
Black Ford to do though.
I mean I have until next Tuesday so I 

210
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:20,780
could kill it on,
on Thanksgiving.

211
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,090
The 31st could be my last one,
but I'm not going to do that.

212
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:23,924
I'm banging them all out this week.
We're doing it together for the first 

213
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:26,600
time.
Ari?

214
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,580
Tom Burton.
I would do it together.

215
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:30,230
I don't want to say where.
And I don't want to say when,

216
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:31,790
because I don't want you fucking freak 
showing up,

217
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,070
but we're going to do it together one 
day this week.

218
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,470
You also,
that's what Tom's biggest problem is.

219
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,780
It's just he's so busy trying to fit in 
you,

220
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,330
you,
you kind of do a 90 minute hot yoga,

221
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,310
which I thought was insane because 
they've never done it.

222
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,110
Right,
right.

223
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,470
Every 90 minutes is a long time.
Well,

224
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,280
I do it every week,
but I usually only do it once or twice a

225
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,114
week.
And now I've done eight fucking days in 

226
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,590
a row as of today.
It's rough.

227
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm shredded though.
Son.

228
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,683
Ken Shredded my bobby.
I'm burning off so many fucking 

229
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,510
calories.
I actually had blood work done today,

230
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,583
so I'm very interested to see what my 
mineral levels are live because I'm 

231
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:09,920
sweating out so much and I'm not really 
supplementing minerals that much.

232
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,340
I might have to do that.
I do that on a regular basis,

233
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,090
like every three months I get blood work
done.

234
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,040
The sealer where my nutrient levels are.

235
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,930
I just found this company,
I don't know if you've heard of it.

236
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:18,764
I think it's called like simply well and
it's like they have all these DNA tests 

237
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,260
that you can do,
so I ordered the testosterone test,

238
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,303
but they also have our gi tests.
They have all these tests and they send 

239
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,700
it to you.
You spit in a vial,

240
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:29,900
it takes some hair or something like 
that.

241
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,150
And then it's kind of like 24 and me.
What words?

242
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,340
Like the DNA testing,
but they have it for everything.

243
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,174
Vitamin D deficiencies and.
And you could have it like on a 

244
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,410
subscription where you get it done 
every.

245
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:42,170
They send you a new kit every three 
months to see if it's changed.

246
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,520
Nice.
A testosterone.

247
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,770
That's what I got.
I just got it yesterday.

248
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,740
Huh?
Um,

249
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,560
so to get off this corey feldman thing,
just the end of the day,

250
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,600
I just want to say that,
uh,

251
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,680
that I'm sorry,
and if I disappointed anybody,

252
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,410
I'm sorry to it.
Just when you,

253
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,560
you know,
comedians try to say fucked up things to

254
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:02,140
each other and I was talking to Colin 
Quinn about this the other night.

255
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,400
Collin was at the comedy store and I 
told Carl and I were talking.

256
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,861
I go,
man,

257
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,030
I miss tough crowd.
He goes,

258
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,170
oh,
I miss it so much.

259
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,010
He goes,
but you know what?

260
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,170
We could never fucking do it today.
He goes,

261
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,053
[inaudible].
Think of the things that Patrice and 

262
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,890
nick depaulo would say to each other.
He's like,

263
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,080
if you did that today,
people would have riots.

264
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,700
They would be protesting.
They would,

265
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,560
they would try to have the show shut 
down.

266
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,690
Comedy central would freak out.
People get fired.

267
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,130
I was like,
you probably right.

268
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:27,220
But that was like the best show ever on 
comedy set next to the Chappelle show.

269
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,660
No,
next to South Park.

270
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:30,490
Okay.
South Park number one,

271
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:31,810
Chappelle show,
number two,

272
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,990
tough crowd number three in my opinion.

273
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,170
South Park still go in for it.
They,

274
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,660
they,
they don't give even the video.

275
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Fuck.
They have this new video game.

276
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:43,610
It's called butt hole fractured,
but whole fractured saw that I saw that,

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,503
but it's a,
there's like a part where you're like 

278
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:46,844
these little boys and you're dressed up 
as strippers and you're in a strip club 

279
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,310
getting lapped at.
You're doing lap dances for guy,

280
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:55,280
so you're on a guy's junk and rude.
It's such a good kid.

281
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,950
So,
so anyway,

282
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,100
these moments where you fuck up these 
terrible feelings,

283
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,890
like this is how I'm looking at it.
I wish I could take it back,

284
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:04,671
but I can't.
Right?

285
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:05,504
There's nothing you can do.
And if people are mad at me now because 

286
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:08,420
of that,
you're right.

287
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,513
You know,
I don't,

288
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,210
I'm not trying to make any excuses for 
myself.

289
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,050
I shouldn't have said it.
But when you do have these moments where

290
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:15,884
you fuck up and you feel terrible,
there are an amazing opportunity to 

291
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,080
grow.
You know?

292
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:24,530
And I think people need to look at stuff
like that this way,

293
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,453
or at least I've been looking at stuff 
this way for the last like 10 years or 

294
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,354
so.
And it's made a big impact in my life 

295
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,693
because I think regular change happens 
in like a regular change and growth 

296
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:40,511
happens in like a grinding slow sort of 
progress or progression.

297
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,560
But when you,
when something fucked up happens,

298
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,020
when you do something fucked up and you 
get that terrible feeling,

299
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,393
you have this opportunity for these 
leaps of understanding and these bad 

300
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,770
feelings that happen.
They're just,

301
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,723
it's a big alarm to let you know.
And one of the things that I was 

302
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:03,920
thinking about is that human beings now,
the way we interact with each other,

303
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:04,754
like there's this,
there's a lot of pressure now on people 

304
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,800
because it's all this call out culture.
You know,

305
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,350
people are getting mad that people are 
doing dumb shit.

306
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,420
Like white girls wearing braids,
you know,

307
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,470
cultural appropriation that going after,
you know,

308
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,540
white guys wearing dreadlocks and people
are mad that people are dressing up like

309
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,460
Geishas and they're calling them out 
there.

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
There's a lot of silliness to all this 
shit,

311
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,550
but what's interesting about it is 
everyone is expressing their displeasure

312
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,840
and pleasure of things there.

313
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,683
They're expressing their anger with 
things and their happiness with things 

314
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,760
at a level we've never seen before.
And I think people that experienced this

315
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,400
like if it makes sense.
Like it's one thing if somebody gets mad

316
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:47,380
at you for something like,
you know,

317
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,520
you shouldn't be wearing that blue hat 
man.

318
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,730
You know,
I'm in the crips and you know,

319
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:53,564
we,
we only support red hats or is it the 

320
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,820
bloods?
I don't even know.

321
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,260
I think the bloods,
the crips or blue,

322
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
right.
If someone gets mad at you for something

323
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:00,794
that doesn't make any sense that stupid,
but if someone gets mad at you for 

324
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,590
poking fun at someone being molested,
that that bad feeling is valid.

325
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,580
Right.
And I think these bad feelings that like

326
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:17,330
Donald Trump must feel 24 slash seven,
like there is probably.

327
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,164
I mean part of it.
I think part of the reason why he so 

328
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,720
angry at people and bitter and barking 
and fake news.

329
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,710
I think he feels like shit all day long 
because you know,

330
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,450
this guy checks his twitter,
you know,

331
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,250
he does check,
he reads his company,

332
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,810
he's a fucking ego maniac,
right?

333
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,900
So he's paying attention to new shows to
talk shit about him.

334
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,140
He's paying attention to late night 
comedians that make jokes about him.

335
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:41,930
He's paying attention to center.
He can't help himself.

336
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,973
He's constantly commenting on it and he 
hears all these people laughing at him 

337
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,544
and mocking him and he uses all these 
people that think he's a terrible 

338
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,424
person.
I read his twitter when he'll put up a 

339
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:51,944
comment,
he'll put up something on twitter and 

340
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,710
then I'll read the comments under it.
It's like,

341
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:58,880
Holy Shit.
People just go hard at him.

342
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,100
You know that motherfucker reads that 
stuff,

343
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,963
you know?
He does and he's also involved in a 

344
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,274
lawsuit,
several lawsuits now where he's blocked 

345
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:07,604
people on twitter and they're 
questioning the constitutionality of 

346
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:12,854
someone being able to block someone from
commenting whether the president of the 

347
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,280
United States.

348
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,113
I mean this is a new way to communicate.
You don't want to hear what people have 

349
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:21,410
to say because it's negative.
Well that's,

350
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,160
you know,
we're not,

351
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,900
we're so people are questioning this in 
court,

352
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,840
but I think that that feeling that's 
hitting this guy,

353
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,410
he might be too old for it and he might 
not be ready for it in his he.

354
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,070
So he's got so many things wrong with 
them to begin with.

355
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:34,904
You know,
with his,

356
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,870
the way he treats the world and his,
his ego and the way he's the,

357
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,813
the,
the non presidential and non statesmen 

358
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,544
like behavior that people thought was 
cute when he was running for office and 

359
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:50,420
the LLC is a giant problem when he's 
threatening war with nuclear weapons,

360
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:55,250
with Korea and shit like that.
But this thing is a new thing.

361
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,140
Is this,
this swarm of bad feeling and in return,

362
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:00,974
good feeling when something good happens
is a new thing and I think that it's 

363
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:05,654
going to shape the way human beings 
interact with each other in a really 

364
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:10,274
radical way.
Because I don't think it's ever existed 

365
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:14,030
like this before.
It hasn't

366
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,423
really has and if you,
if you look at it is if it's a good 

367
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,440
thing or a bad thing.
Like,

368
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,230
I forget what I was listening to the 
other day where when you were a kid,

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,510
uh,
you used to just go outside,

370
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,250
say bye mom,
and then come back at night,

371
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:26,510
you know,
when it's time for dinner,

372
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,490
eat dinner,
then you go play some video games,

373
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:32,000
go to bed now it's like the 
communication between your mom and stuff

374
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,220
like that is so much more intense.
Constant.

375
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,160
It's constant all day long.
It's like if you're not there,

376
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:41,960
you're getting texted by your daughter's
son and it's like constant communication

377
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,060
where it's more parenting.
So that's good.

378
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,330
Do you facetime with people all the 
time?

379
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

380
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,573
Yeah.
I mean remember when we were a kid that 

381
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:49,980
was some jets and shit.
Yeah.

382
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,530
I heard George Jetson do it on your 
phone.

383
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,364
I do a phone call.
I was talking to my on my phone the 

384
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,660
other day and I'm like,
I am doing Dick Tracy right now,

385
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,950
but better than Dick Tracy.
Right.

386
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,893
Dick Tracy's was bullshit to answer my.
I was in the steam room the other day 

387
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,500
and my phone and I was like,
ah,

388
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,590
I can answer it.
Yeah.

389
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,440
Hey,
what's up?

390
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,770
Because it actually has a cell phone 
chip.

391
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,820
Yeah.
This guy was at my door.

392
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,610
I was like,
just go in.

393
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,453
I'm not there,
but just go in and pop out of the 

394
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,240
bushes.
Shaking your hand.

395
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,074
Right.
She's got the moon apartment building 

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,150
that make yourself comfortable.
Come on in some of my package.

397
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,033
Oh,
you can take the concept or coming at 

398
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,570
Fedex.
Guy should be here soon together.

399
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,520
Take pictures of you too.
I like Brown and I like to Fedex Elf.

400
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,570
It's cool too.
We don't fuck around with DHL.

401
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,423
Got a disease last time.
Oh Dhl on track to Dhl was like the RC 

402
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,450
Cola of delivery services.

403
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,940
Totally is RC Cola.
Like if someone said,

404
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,440
hey,
do you want to own RC Cola?

405
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,071
You'd be like,
yeah,

406
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,660
fuck yeah,
it's a lot of money,

407
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,550
but you know,
it ain't Pepsi,

408
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,693
which is.
There's got to be some people out there 

409
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,503
that look huge RC Cola fans that have 
like RC Cola tee shirts on shit has got 

410
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,000
to be dialed.
RC Cola.

411
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,280
Super underrated.
That diet.

412
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:11,811
Right?
What are,

413
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,540
what are all these obscure ones like 
Figo Wu Tang,

414
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,460
au fait with Mr Pitts.
CP CP that.

415
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,380
What's that bad ass root beer?
IBC.

416
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,430
IBC.
That stuff is fucking fantastic.

417
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,480
Yes.
God.

418
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,650
Damn.
That stuff's good.

419
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,310
I wish that she wasn't bad for you 
because God damn it.

420
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,144
Taste delicious.
That is the best fucking root beer on 

421
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,514
the planet that I've experienced.
I've tried to not drink sodas much 

422
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:38,964
lately.
That's my Arnold Palmer honor poem or 

423
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,590
somebody new thing like I go through.
So like,

424
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,060
that's like an old person thing,
right?

425
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,320
Arnold Palmer?
I am.

426
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,850
I get it.
Like it's so funny.

427
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,400
I get Arnold Palmer's now.
I drink them all day long.

428
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,780
It's like living delicious.
Yeah.

429
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,180
Little little lemon in there.
Now let me ask you this.

430
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,290
Um,
because I don't think

431
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
that I would have ever done this many 
yoga.

432
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,030
No,
I wouldn't have done this many yogis.

433
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,864
And I know I wouldn't have taken a month
off weed and I know it would have taken 

434
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:03,864
a month off.
Well,

435
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,070
the mother booze.
Not Hard.

436
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,530
I mean,
the only thing that I went the other day

437
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:11,310
to a Mexican restaurant and I wanted a 
margarita so bad have to,

438
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,220
we having,
they had these delicious uh,

439
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,200
um,
there were rib eye tacos.

440
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:16,891
I was like,
oh,

441
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:20,190
that looks good.
They fucking with Habanero sauce on.

442
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,840
I'm like,
give me a fucking marguerite.

443
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,400
Oh Shit.
I can't have one.

444
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,980
It really hurt me.
He could have a fake Margarita.

445
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,940
Nope.
Can't have it.

446
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,430
I wanted a beer too.
I wanted a beer and a Margarita.

447
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,830
Um,
but that's not hard,

448
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,723
but I would have never done this.
Might take a week off or something like 

449
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,214
that.
I would never have taken a month off if 

450
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,320
weren't doing this challenge.

451
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,970
What would you do?
Like,

452
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:47,320
what kind of challenge would you do?
I tell you,

453
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:49,450
hang in there and stick with it because 
a lot of people don't know,

454
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,140
but you lost like 70 pounds once,
over,

455
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:55,840
like a short amount of time.
You went crazy.

456
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,530
Brian broke up with his girlfriend.
Fiance.

457
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,310
Yeah.
Same thing.

458
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,980
It's all semantics.
Anyway.

459
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,270
Broke up and said,
you know what?

460
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,670
What am I gonna do with this?
Right.

461
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,750
You got a picture of a all skinny.
Look at the edge is Jesus Christ.

462
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,970
Jesus is still not the guy on the left 
though.

463
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,640
Boy,
you got to 43 to 45 to one 63.

464
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,440
Wow.
Look how skinny legs.

465
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,280
Lower righthand side.
Dude,

466
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,090
you're a cute little bitch.
Little look at that.

467
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:26,500
We'll get the phone.
You're holding up.

468
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,350
It's my job to look at that phone.
Isn't that hilarious?

469
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,690
That back then that phone was the shit.

470
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,823
And if you had that,
now you would assume that you live in 

471
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:40,180
like assisted housing.
I still have that phone to you.

472
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,840
What do you do with it?
Sits in a box in storage texts.

473
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:48,150
Isis with a burner phone.
But this.

474
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,500
So you,
you.

475
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,650
So what did you lose?
How much did you lose their two?

476
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,880
40th five to one 63.
Jesus Christ.

477
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:55,780
Dude.
Eighty two pounds.

478
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,090
Eighty two pounds.
More than I thought I had lost.

479
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,340
You lost a shitload of fucking weight,
man.

480
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
That's amazing.
That's weightwatchers right there buddy.

481
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,240
So you did it at one point in time.
By the way,

482
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,790
what the fuck is going on with your 
underwear line?

483
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,050
Like where is it?
Is it like,

484
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,910
oh,
I did that.

485
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,300
The,
if you did it,

486
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,370
it's right above the peers.
That's the Deq root.

487
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,550
Look at the picture of you holding up 
the old pants.

488
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,780
Yeah,
that's crazy.

489
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,643
That's just crazy.
And that wasn't even my biggest pants 

490
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,920
either.
That's crazy.

491
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,583
Well,
okay.

492
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,420
What would it take?
What would,

493
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,100
what,
what would you be interested in doing?

494
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:29,420
What kind of challenge?
My challenge is I talk,

495
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,363
I've been talking to Hinchcliffe about 
this and a few other people because one 

496
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:37,921
of the biggest things for a lot of us is
smoking and it's cigarettes and uh,

497
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,460
I've been trying to get like we had nine
slash 11 last year.

498
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,370
It was supposed to be nine slash 11.
We had a month notice.

499
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,380
All of us were supposed to click on nine
slash 11.

500
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:49,070
So we went and forget the date said,
click,

501
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,580
click,
click,

502
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,280
let it go.
It comes out of your mind is so simple,

503
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,820
so easy.
You're so used to say,

504
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,693
but then I was the only one that did it.
I did it for two days and then everyone 

505
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,123
else didn't do it and they're all 
smoking when you're at the commissary 

506
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,860
and all your friends are smoking around 
you.

507
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,290
It's almost fucking.
And Tony smokes a lot.

508
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,183
Tony smokes a lot.
A lot of people smoke a lot at the 

509
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:09,910
comedy store.
So my whole thing was like,

510
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,680
hey,
let's,

511
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,180
let's quit cigarettes and everyone 
seemed down on it.

512
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,680
Then yesterday I was like,
Hey,

513
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,600
we still quitting next month cigarettes.
And I was like,

514
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,870
man.
So you guys are going to do in November?

515
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

516
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:22,660
I was going to try to quit and.
Well listen,

517
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,613
why don't.
Why don't we set up a chair at least 

518
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:25,720
when I get back from Columbus,
Ohio.

519
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,554
I'll be there next month.
Let's think of a challenge that you 

520
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:33,970
could do and who would you do it with?
You need like Tony Hinchcliffe for sure.

521
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,380
No sugar.
This is,

522
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,600
this is you for a month.
No sugar,

523
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,640
no booze,
no cigarettes.

524
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,800
He would lose 30 pounds just doing that 
without having cigarettes.

525
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,020
I'd gained weight because cigarettes 
actually like,

526
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,910
I think it's like your heartbeat and 
stuff.

527
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,620
Like when you quit cigarettes,
you start munching more like on food.

528
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,703
You use again,
a lot of weight if you use it as an 

529
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,340
appetite suppressant.
I use it for breakfast.

530
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,150
Isn't it also,
isn't it also a stimulant though?

531
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,040
It's a stimulant.
Um hmm.

532
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,453
I definitely need to lose weight,
but I also more importantly I want to 

533
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,130
quit cigarettes.
Like the drinking I.

534
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,823
that's easy.
Like I quit drinking the other day for 

535
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,900
like four days and I smoked while.
You mean I didn't train for four days.

536
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,050
I smoked weed though instead next day I 
had,

537
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,520
I was like,
why do I have a hangover?

538
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:27,470
It was a weed hangover.
Like we'd hang on.

539
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,304
Yeah.
I didn't even realize that when you 

540
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,030
first start smoking weed used to have 
these.

541
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,320
Like the next day you're like,
man,

542
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,600
I smoke so much weed.
I feel like dumb or something like that.

543
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,513
The next morning I hadn't had.
It had been wild because usually when 

544
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,300
I'm smoking I'm drinking.
So I was blamed on the drinking.

545
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,080
Like God damn,
I feel like hungover.

546
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,130
Well,
I've never had a weed hangover.

547
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,150
I don't think you're going to have one.
When you start smoking,

548
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:47,984
you're going to be a so fucking high.
You're going to smoke half a joint and 

549
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,614
be like,
oh,

550
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,500
I want to be handled.
I'm legitimately nervous,

551
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,170
legitimately nervous about smoking pot 
again.

552
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,710
But here's my real concern.
I'm really wondering like,

553
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:01,544
what is going on where I am dreaming so 
much more vividly without pot and is 

554
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,830
that a bad thing that I'm not dreaming 
when I'm smoking pot?

555
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,260
Like am I somehow or another doing some 
damage?

556
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,440
Yeah,
I think so.

557
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,940
I think,
I think for sure that marijuana,

558
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,860
if you smoke a lot of marijuana that you
don't have as good a dreams.

559
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,723
I don't,
I don't think you realize you are not a 

560
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,220
neuroscientist.
Dr Brian,

561
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,300
Dr Brian here,
Dr Red Band.

562
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,440
But what exactly do you think is what's 
causing the lack of dreams?

563
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,730
Another thing you might have,
you know,

564
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:37,040
thc in your fat and so you're getting 
thc,

565
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,150
you know,
still,

566
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,321
you know,
burning off.

567
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,330
Especially since you're doing yoga.
It's probably like,

568
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,213
you know,
it's probably still fucking with you a 

569
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,300
little.
I don't know,

570
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,163
maybe I don't know,
but I mean we got high before most of 

571
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:52,070
the podcasts with comedians.
I got high before most comedy shows,

572
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,090
so that's like three,
four nights a week at least now I take a

573
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,760
day or two off and it was nothing super 
easy to do.

574
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,370
It was never a problem,
but I never took a month off.

575
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,640
So when I would take a day or two off,
even if I go on vacation,

576
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,960
right,
if I went on vacation,

577
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,550
I would take a week off people.

578
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,383
People were mocking me relentlessly 
online before I told everybody that I 

579
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,920
was taking the month off when they 
started doing all this.

580
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,500
Pray for Joe People was going,
Joe,

581
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,480
uh,
I don't,

582
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,570
uh,
in quotes,

583
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:20,230
I don't smoke weed on vacation Rogan,
like,

584
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,480
that's not a problem.
It's not a problem,

585
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,570
but it,
it was just like,

586
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,540
you know,
I'd be in Europe or something like that,

587
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,980
you know,
you can't get weed,

588
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,690
don't bring it with you,
you don't wanna go to jail.

589
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,670
So just don't smoke weed.
It was no problem.

590
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:36,260
So I was like,
I don't need pot.

591
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,123
It's not an issue and I don't need it.
Obviously I've gone through this whole 

592
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,900
month,
but I'm really.

593
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,340
I'm stunned at

594
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,510
the differences in the way I'm dreaming.
Like stunned.

595
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,300
Like I never expected it to be so 
extreme,

596
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,340
so vivid every night I'm having fucking 
crazy dreams every night

597
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,343
and they're almost all primal.
They're almost all like animals and 

598
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:06,401
waterfalls and fucking ocean and it's 
all a lot of falling,

599
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,993
like a lot of like

600
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,870
balancing on shit.
Like Ooh.

601
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,590
It's interesting.
Weird.

602
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,360
I think I'm too busy.
I've been thinking about that lately.

603
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,433
I think I'm too busy.
I think I do too much shit and I never 

604
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,310
thought that before.
I never thought that.

605
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:25,360
But you would think that like smoking 
pot would make you think you're too busy

606
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
but not smoking pot.
It makes me think I'm too busy.

607
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,820
It makes me think that

608
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,630
you're probably thinking clear though in
some ways.

609
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,610
You know,
your mind's not fogged with.

610
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,421
Like,
you know,

611
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:39,590
you're overthinking about music instead 
of like life,

612
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,940
you know?
Yeah.

613
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,800
Well,
food does not taste as good.

614
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,440
Tell you the food's way better when 
you're smoking.

615
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:47,270
Weed is good.
Movies aren't as good.

616
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,590
Music doesn't sound as good.

617
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,250
I think the key to it is using it 
occasionally.

618
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,990
I think that's the key.
I think marijuana,

619
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,843
like daily,
Terence Mckenna talked about this many 

620
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,213
years ago and he was a,
he was a daily smoker and one of the 

621
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:07,880
things that he was saying he was doing 
some sort of a lecture and he was saying

622
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:12,881
that the correct way to do marijuana is 
to not do it for a long time and then do

623
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:17,480
as much as you can stand and then just 
fucking hold on.

624
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,740
And that's how he would do it.
He would do,

625
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,620
um,
cannabis when he was doing it correctly,

626
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,410
when he wasn't like a,
an inveterate daily smoker.

627
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,030
He would do it like a psychedelic who 
would do it in these big bursts where he

628
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:32,720
would,
you know,

629
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,610
and he was recommending like that's the 
way to do it.

630
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:38,810
And that people will think they know 
what cannabis is if they smoked cannabis

631
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:39,644
on a regular basis.
You don't really know like the way to 

632
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:45,170
really know what it is is to take a lot 
of time off

633
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,290
or obviously eat one of Joey's edibles.
No,

634
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,790
I don't do edit was anymore.
That's one thing I quit completely.

635
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,624
I don't fuck with edibles at all.
I would like to see what happens with 

636
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,440
Joey.
If he took a week off,

637
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,750
a month off,
joey would be violent.

638
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,310
He would attack people.
Yeah.

639
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,170
It took a month off of edibles or 
whatever.

640
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:02,004
Right.
Did you ever give it up for lent choice 

641
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,490
about religious?
Give it a full month dog.

642
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,200
He's going to be here Friday by the way,
folks.

643
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,123
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

644
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,550
Um,
but if he did take a month off,

645
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,250
I mean he didn't take a month off weed 
though.

646
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,390
I don't think it was smoking.
I think it was just eating it.

647
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,750
Yeah.
He told me that once he told me he was,

648
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,260
I can't do these fucking edibles 
anymore.

649
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,790
The too much.
Too Much Joe Rogan.

650
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,170
I'm fuck it up.
I'm taking too much.

651
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,270
It's messing me up.
The next time I saw him,

652
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,670
next time I saw him,
he was down and stars to death.

653
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,640
Literally the next time I saw him,
I go,

654
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,620
how much?
How many milligrams was 1:25

655
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,020
throwing down to slash 25 milligrams 
stars of death.

656
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,220
I'm like,
you are a monster.

657
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,980
You saw the episode

658
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,420
where he passed out right on the 
microphone.

659
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,030
Right?
I can't even see.

660
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,223
He's looking at life to be like slits 
like he's like barely crack in the page 

661
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:58,380
of a book.
Like hilarious.

662
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,390
I was listening to his latest episode.
It's Felicia Michael.

663
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:03,700
So who has a new movie that I'm in 
called pervs.

664
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,260
Uh,
where we went through this.

665
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,413
When those strip things,
we put the money in and the curtain 

666
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:10,390
comes up and there's a woman naked 
masturbating.

667
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,673
Well,
Felicia did this movie where she asked 

668
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:15,160
me to do.
It's in north Hollywood,

669
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,460
deep in north Hollywood where you 
shouldn't go and it's so great.

670
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,320
You're eating this growth sections in 
north Hollywood.

671
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,740
Growth in this curtain comes up and 
there's all these cameras.

672
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,753
Just this woman.
They're masturbating while asking me 

673
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:30,274
questions and it's so hard to answer 
when there's somebody doing that and 

674
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,490
you're just like,
what kind of question?

675
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,920
Like,
uh,

676
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,813
just like sex questions and stuff.
I don't remember because it was so long 

677
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,360
ago.
I forgot I even did it.

678
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,270
But,
uh,

679
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,310
Felicia was on the other day and 
listening to Lee on that,

680
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,380
like he's leads never been to a strip 
club before,

681
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,360
but his little voice when he chimes and 
he's like,

682
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,850
I've never been to a strip club 
authority.

683
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,180
Never been scared of him.
He said,

684
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,000
I want to take that guy to a strict so 
bad.

685
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,150
Why is he scared?
He don't know.

686
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,103
He,
I think it's a money thing because he's 

687
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:04,420
just like,
I just don't get it.

688
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:05,254
You pay the money.
Then they tried to get money that 

689
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,883
someone told a story recently about 
Jeremiah Watkins trying to took them to 

690
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,090
a strip club and he freaked out and just
like ran out the back base.

691
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,260
Same kind of thing.
Like he,

692
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,850
I don't know if he's ever been to one or
doesn't want to go or.

693
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,660
Yeah,
he uh,

694
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,120
he looked at the ground and walk from 
the front.

695
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,270
Never looking up all the way to the pack
out the back door.

696
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,650
Yeah,
I did.

697
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,650
I did get a day.
It,

698
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,593
it's just crazy.
I did a show with George Perez and 

699
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:35,170
Compton at a strip club in Compton.
And let me tell you,

700
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,004
man,
that was one of the most eye opening 

701
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,130
like,
that exist.

702
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,690
We walk in,
there's stripper.

703
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,490
The stripper just came up to me and he 
goes,

704
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,030
hey honey,
look at this pussy ass all the babies.

705
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,810
You want to get it?
He wants some of this written.

706
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,130
I'm like,
Whoa,

707
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,350
what?
She look like a,

708
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,620
like a baby Mama.
Like I don't know,

709
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,893
address that's still baby hand sticking 
out of her probably blue baby here and 

710
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,310
shoot.
Attractive.

711
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,450
No,
there was,

712
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,313
there was a few,
but then every time you talked to them 

713
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:07,211
you're like,
Oh,

714
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,590
if I fuck up,
I'm dead.

715
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,423
You know,
like she was like,

716
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,460
yeah,
it was pretty crazy for hostile.

717
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,730
What about the clientele?
Uh,

718
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,290
well they,
they,

719
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,310
they were mostly there for us,
like they,

720
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,220
George just pretty much we had the whole
club board ourselves.

721
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:23,080
I've always all people coming to see the
show.

722
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:23,914
So it was strippers too though.
And strippers to what was the idea that 

723
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:27,664
you would get people in there for the 
show and then the girls would dance for 

724
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,400
them afterwards?
Yeah.

725
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,263
And while we're doing the show,
they were coming and sitting on table 

726
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,510
and hey,
you want to go get him?

727
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,690
But sex upstairs just making that up.

728
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,030
Or was it was it was foreign.
Whatever you want.

729
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:49,390
Pretty much play,
but I even fucking scary.

730
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,770
Yeah,
if you go to a bad neighborhood,

731
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,920
I mean there's levels to everything,
right?

732
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,550
Like the,
the levels of stress and pressure that a

733
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,384
check has to deal with.
If she's a stripper in a really bad 

734
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:04,820
neighborhood like that.
That's how diamonds get developed.

735
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,890
Son Diamonds in a,
in a fluffy pillow,

736
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,843
you know,
you're gonna,

737
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,340
you're not gonna make a diamond on a 
tempurpedic mattress.

738
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,080
Fucking pressure.
Serious.

739
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:18,914
Serious pressure man.
Like when you see one of the street 

740
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:22,214
hookers walking in a bad neighborhood,
it looks like that's where they all 

741
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:29,591
worked with Tom and Brian Callen met his
ex girlfriend walking the streets.

742
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,270
That was harsh.
That is,

743
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,130
that's when.
That's when you just go,

744
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,220
whoa.
What?

745
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,880
He was outside of the coach and horses 
on sunset,

746
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,053
you know,
that place where Stan hope used to love 

747
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,190
that.

748
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,420
It's closed now.
But is it?

749
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,770
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure that's too bad.

750
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,590
Yeah,
that was a good little joint.

751
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,310
I remember Ralphie may rest in peace.
We,

752
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:56,780
we were supposed to meet Ralphie there 
and Ralphie showed up an hour later.

753
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,580
I'm like,
what the fuck?

754
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:02,630
Ralphie look in the backseat and he had 
like 13 boxes.

755
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:04,730
Those Jalapeno poppers from Jack in the 
box.

756
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,540
Oh my God.
He just had gone off on holiday.

757
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:12,541
Pino poppers.
Poor Ralphie when he,

758
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:13,604
um,
he had his stomach stapled and when he 

759
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,190
had a stomach stapled for some reason he
couldn't eat meat.

760
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,480
Like there's something about the 
operation they did.

761
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,410
It made him have a real issue with meat.
But he still loved to cook it.

762
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,480
So used to barbecue.
We went over his house once and he,

763
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,710
he,
he's a fucking killer.

764
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:36,620
Cook.
Ralphie makes some barbecue sauce,

765
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,420
baby,
big baby barbecue sauce.

766
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:39,254
I went to his house and he cooked like 
this whole thing and got to eating meat 

767
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:43,610
at the time.
Oh yeah,

768
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:44,150
he,
he,

769
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,630
he got his staples removed.
I mean he did himself.

770
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,050
He just ate right through those staples.
Yeah.

771
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,040
He had this idea that he was gonna lose 
all this weight and then it,

772
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,480
it did kind of work for like a couple of
days.

773
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,760
Well the problem was he was so big that 
like if he said he lost weight,

774
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,421
like,
like,

775
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:07,780
okay,
how much you know,

776
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:09,800
he,
he'd say he lost 100 pounds and you'd be

777
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,490
like,
I'm about.

778
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,340
I believe you.
It's hard to tell.

779
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,750
You know,
it's like you couldn't.

780
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,863
But imagine like how strong his legs 
must've been the strongest feet in the 

781
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:20,924
business.
Like that guy I could probably kick 

782
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:24,140
through a fucking building.
Think about it.

783
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:27,050
Like if he,
if he's carrying around 500 pounds,

784
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,670
imagine if I took you and I threw 300 
pounds of weights on your back.

785
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,523
You,
you're just walking around with 300 

786
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:36,290
pounds everywhere you go.
I wouldn't be able to do it.

787
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,150
Like I lift weights all the time and I 
wouldn't be able to do it.

788
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,360
I'd be like,
what the fuck man be.

789
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,480
You'd walk everywhere.
Buster was giving us cool Ed.

790
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,320
He had those calves,
you know,

791
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:49,590
those fat dude calves.
They did a develop this model.

792
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,620
But if you could like,
look at the musculature in his legs,

793
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,870
I bet if you get through all the fat and
his arms,

794
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:59,520
his arms like normal size arms,
but I bet he had some jacked fucking Lee

795
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,350
Haney quads.
Yeah,

796
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,720
I would imagine that that's a tender 
meat down there.

797
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,530
Like it's weird when you see people that
have those big calves,

798
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,470
but they're always blue like that.
Diabetes legs.

799
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,240
That's rough.
That diabetes blue.

800
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,130
Yeah.
That's super common though,

801
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:14,611
right?
Yeah.

802
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:15,444
There's a homeless homeless guy by,
by my house just hanging out at 

803
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:23,280
starbucks and he hasn't so bad where 
it's blistered and every time he walks a

804
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,950
little blood squirts often do ribs down 
his leg.

805
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,200
It's the grossest thing ever.
He's homeless.

806
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,160
Uh,
yeah.

807
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,120
He's fat.
Yeah,

808
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:30,954
he's huge and what's weird about Burbank
is there was another guy that had like 

809
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,440
this big nose,
like it was a,

810
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,713
like he looked like a,
it was some kind of weird sis nodes 

811
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:41,610
where it's like the size of like a,
like a pineapple,

812
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,770
and he looked like Bernie Kozar,
whatever.

813
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:44,604
That old guy.
I'm Bernie coats are aware of what her 

814
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,160
back for the Brown.
No,

815
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,060
no.
What's Bernie that sports?

816
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,260
I,
Bernie,

817
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,840
they go to sports accommodator the only 
guy.

818
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,880
Howard cosell either had like a hardcore
sound.

819
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,350
No,
like huge though.

820
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,880
You're like the only guy who knows less 
about sports and,

821
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,100
but uh,
all the people in Burbank college like,

822
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,360
Hey,
we'll fix your nose.

823
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,910
Like people are so nice.
Like I'll pay for your nose to get fixed

824
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,960
and he wouldn't,
uh,

825
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,350
yeah.

826
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,510
Bigger than that.
Like imagine that knows times 100.

827
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,880
What was the dude that was the cubs guy?
Crazy glass.

828
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:20,370
Hey Harry.
Harry.

829
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,450
Harry Carey.
Didn't he have like a list now?

830
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,333
He just,
he was like really big glasses and he 

831
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,054
just talked to real crazy.
Will Farrell did a great impression 

832
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,980
town.
Hi,

833
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:30,980
I'm.
Hi Carrie,

834
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,950
you would feel like a homeless guy would
be skinny.

835
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,840
I'd be like the ultimate diet.
No food,

836
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,703
a lot of walking.
Well the only food that we're eating 

837
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,290
probably is like fast food,
like fast food,

838
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,770
so fucking cheap.
The other day.

839
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:50,350
Arby's has this new steak.
You should go to Venice,

840
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,213
Venison Burger or something.
I think they have elk only in a couple 

841
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,473
places,
but they have venison and a bunch of 

842
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:55,620
places.
Yeah,

843
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,210
Venison.
I had it yesterday.

844
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,090
It's like having a steak on a on too.
But,

845
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,550
but it was only $5 and it was great.

846
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,470
It was a real life.
It's venison.

847
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,050
They do these mass executions of deer in
some,

848
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,750
some places where they,
uh,

849
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:14,220
they have to eradicate these deer,
like to get a little too crazy.

850
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,310
I would imagine that's probably where 
they're getting some of their meat from.

851
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,050
Yeah.
Because it's lonely for a limited time.

852
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,800
Only in limited places.
Well you can only hunt them for so long.

853
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,663
Like if it's in during hunting season,
you're not allowed to sell it 

854
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:27,270
commercially.
Like hunting meat.

855
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,340
Like there's,
you can buy farm raised deer,

856
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,370
they might have that,
but I think like a,

857
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,343
I think it's illegal.
I'm pretty sure it's illegal to sell 

858
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,260
wild game.
Like to actually sell it,

859
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,120
sell it.
I don't think you could sell the meat,

860
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,530
but I have some for you.
I have my,

861
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,160
I have elk Jerky for you.
Oh,

862
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:43,994
I went on.
I have,

863
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,470
I have elk Salami for you.
What was that one thing you made me that

864
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,400
one time.
Oh,

865
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,620
that was a smoked ham.
That was wild boar.

866
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,733
Wild pig shit.
Wild pig is so and wild pig is very 

867
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,930
sustainable.
Those little motherfuckers,

868
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:00,220
they breed like crazy.
You,

869
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,143
you literally have to shoot them.
They have a big problem with them right 

870
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,354
now in San Jose.
I was just reading this thing about San 

871
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,013
Jose.
San Jose is trying to figure out there 

872
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:09,934
they're hiring people to a set traps in 
people's yards because in the middle of 

873
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,123
the night these wild pigs come up,
but just fuck people's lawns up and at 

874
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,290
San Jose is like tech industry,
you know?

875
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,220
It's like,
I don't even know.

876
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:23,430
That was a thing up there.
While oh my God.

877
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,533
Well what's interesting is a lot of it 
came from that crazy asshole that made 

878
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,730
weedy illegal.
William Randolph hearst,

879
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,030
William Randolph hearst,
when he built the hearst castle.

880
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:36,100
Have you ever been to the hearst castle?
It's pretty sweet.

881
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,810
I never put the two together.
I was like,

882
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:38,260
Oh fuck.

883
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,011
I've been there.
Yeah,

884
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,660
that's is that.
Is the hearst castle,

885
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,900
the one that has like the stairways that
lead to a brick wall,

886
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,793
like you opened up the door and there's 
nothing there or is that another is a 

887
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:48,024
crazy lady I think.
I think I'm thinking of a different 

888
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:51,520
person,
but William Randolph hearst,

889
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,620
when he had the hearst castle built,
he released a bunch of wild boars,

890
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,483
Eurasian bores all over the backyard so 
we could just hunt them and shoot them 

891
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,383
because he was just crazy rich asshole 
and those motherfuckers populated the 

892
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:08,110
entire northern California region.
That's crazy.

893
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,200
Hunter s Thompson when he was young and 
he lived in big Sur.

894
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,100
He used to go hunt wild boars with a 
machine gun.

895
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,520
There's like a famous classic picture of
Hunter s Thompson holding a knife and an

896
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,783
AK 47 while there's a wild boar that's 
hanging from his back legs and he's 

897
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:27,490
cutting it open and about to cook.

898
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:31,420
And have you ever had pig's tail pig's 
tail?

899
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,020
That pig's feet?
Pig's feet?

900
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,540
I hate that fixed fee.
It's good.

901
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,760
Is it delicious?
Yeah.

902
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:38,740
I don't remember much about my,
my real dad,

903
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,000
but I do remember he loved pigs feet and
I ate it when I was a little kid.

904
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,190
Yeah.
You can buy at the store.

905
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,330
Yeah.
Pickle it takes his feet.

906
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,820
He's got to go to the bad neighborhood 
though.

907
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,773
No,
they have it.

908
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,740
My,
my girlfriend eats all that.

909
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,470
She gets.
She gets fish eyeballs.

910
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:54,080
Sheets,
fish.

911
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
Oh,
you're dating an Asian.

912
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,520
That's the winchester mystery house.
This is the.

913
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,550
That's the nowhere.
Where's that one at?

914
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,250
It said near San Jose.
Okay.

915
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,630
Yeah.
Same kind of area.

916
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,430
Yeah.
This house is a wacky house.

917
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,190
How'd you go to this house?
I was a little kid.

918
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,780
I thought it was a great.
Well,

919
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:13,990
I lived in San Francisco when I was 
little fruits are age seven to 11.

920
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,883
We lived in San Francisco and we took a 
tour of the hearst castle when I was 

921
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:18,700
little.
Remember it,

922
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,850
and we went to this mystery house too,
but there was like doorways to nowhere.

923
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,190
I love these old rich houses.
Like,

924
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,450
like I went to the gamble house in a 
procter and gamble.

925
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,670
It's a,
it's in Pasadena,

926
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,500
but that's where they filmed like back 
to the future.

927
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,790
What was that one with the fish?
With the seagull.

928
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,980
What the hell is that?
All right.

929
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,510
It's just somebody.
Oh,

930
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,830
someone's blog.
So what we're saying what but like these

931
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:43,664
houses back then,
the architecture there and proctor and 

932
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:47,830
gamble at the time he was like,
you know,

933
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,733
our billionaire.
So he would have these houses have so 

934
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:52,700
many unique.
That's it,

935
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:54,030
right?
Is that the hearst castle?

936
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:56,060
And Campbell had the gamble house.
Yeah.

937
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:56,894
And so like there's like all these,
like secret rooms and the architecture 

938
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:01,130
there is amazing.

939
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,810
That's a beautiful house.
Doc Brown.

940
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,520
That's duck.
Darren's the future future.

941
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,253
Really?
Yeah.

942
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,630
No Shit.
It's in Pasadena.

943
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,680
It's a cool.
In Pasadena that houses.

944
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,940
Yeah.
That's beautiful.

945
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,543
Yeah.
I love houses like that would structure 

946
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:15,254
like who that lawn to the architecture 
there is so amazing and just this 

947
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,290
amazing man.
Pasedena.

948
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,680
Whoa.
That's the inside of it.

949
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,580
And you can walk through there.
You got a three 60 tour.

950
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,040
This house is shit.
Like look through shit on the inside.

951
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,960
Is this like they have tours of it?
Yeah.

952
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah.
Me and my mom works as a ghost.

953
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,020
People go look at the coast.
They have different kinds of tours,

954
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,443
tours where you get to go to rooms that 
you can only go to if you go to this 

955
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,440
certain tour.
Uh,

956
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,810
that's fucking beautiful.
That's the same house.

957
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,980
Yeah.
Pasa.

958
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,823
Dina had this Frank Lloyd Wright House 
that was for sale for ever and I think 

959
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,584
it finally sold and there was another 
one that's like another Frank Lloyd 

960
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,203
Wright House,
I believe that was for sale in Los 

961
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Filez.

962
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,250
And I was like,
God damn,

963
00:42:58,251 --> 00:42:59,330
I don't want it.
That's the house.

964
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,750
Like I don't want to live in Los Filez 
with all the hipsters,

965
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,850
but I might live there just to be in 
this house.

966
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:09,680
Look at this fucking the Mallard House 
that places the Shit I love though.

967
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,160
Yeah.
The inside of that house was incredible.

968
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,680
Jamie,
go to the inside when you see,

969
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,550
um,
there was all this crazy patterns here.

970
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,020
See all the crazy patterns in the stone 
columns.

971
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,910
I mean,
it was just a gorgeous house.

972
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,730
Like it was literally like you're owning
whoever owns it.

973
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,080
You're owning a piece of historical art.
Like that one right down there.

974
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,560
Look at that.
That's insane.

975
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,621
I mean,
come on,

976
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:34,350
man.
That's,

977
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,880
that's like a museum or something.
There's a house in Pennsylvania,

978
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:38,714
Frank Lloyd Wright House.
I think it's in Pennsylvania where it's 

979
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:44,480
the same thing where it's just 
waterfalls and amazing things like this.

980
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:44,931
Like,
you know,

981
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:47,360
it's probably the dope house I've ever 
seen is the,

982
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,194
um,
Ferris Bueller's day off house when he 

983
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:53,870
drove the Ferrari of Seattle,
that houses in Seattle.

984
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,840
That looks like it right there though.
The Pennsylvania one because waterfall,

985
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,531
that looks like.
Oh,

986
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:58,400
look at that.
Click on that.

987
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,540
That's the one I'm talking about.
Chicago that's in Chicago.

988
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,693
I'd probably have to dodge bullets.
And the way the house was for sale not 

989
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,340
too long ago,
really.

990
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,140
I remember calling a fuck load of money.
How much the Ferris bueller house cost.

991
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,740
Look at that house.
God Damn.

992
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:18,080
That's gorgeous.
Awesome man.

993
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,680
Laura.
No,

994
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,580
that's Laurel highlands.
Pennsylvania therapists do.

995
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,660
There's nothing better than like living 
around trees.

996
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,250
Like there's something about like that 
image of that house with all those trees

997
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,084
in the background and all that green 
light that just makes you want to let 

998
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,020
you know what it reminds me of the crazy
billionaire.

999
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,350
And uh,
uh,

1000
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,970
ex Mokena.
Remember that guy?

1001
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,300
The guy lived in some crazy wooded.
Oh,

1002
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,620
I just rewatched it.
Sits there.

1003
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,543
It is.
Ferris Bueller's Day off house that 

1004
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,740
houses the shit.
But people would watch you.

1005
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,540
Fuck.
They'd be hide in the bushes.

1006
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,830
Binoculars.
I see.

1007
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,050
I just got a new movie coming out.
Ferris Bueller?

1008
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,140
Matthew Broderick.
Oh yeah.

1009
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,950
The x marketing guy has a good movie 
coming out.

1010
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,553
We watched the trailer off off air,
but I try to remember what it was right 

1011
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:06,294
now.
Yeah.

1012
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah.
At some sort of a science fiction movie,

1013
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:10,240
right?
Yeah.

1014
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,363
That's one of my.
If I had a top 20 all time favorite 

1015
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:15,700
movies,

1016
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,590

It's perfect.

1017
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,790
Still.

1018
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,560
That book?
The science fiction book.

1019
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,470
Annihilation.
Yeah.

1020
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,673
What is it about Jeff Vendor Mirror

1021
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:34,494
Portman's in it.

1022
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,760
Oh yeah,

1023
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,540
That they go to and like her husband 
died and their journey to find her some.

1025
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,710

Yeah.
Terrible.

1028
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,920
Caveman coffee.
Just coffee in general.

1029
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,650
If I drink water I'm fine.
If I drink coffee,

1030
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,660
I started flipping up and I have to 
clear my throat.

1031

You should get a little bubbles will get

1033
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,740
Do we have any of those back then?
The Soda?

1034
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:10,574
Yeah.
I don't know what flavor is and those 

1035
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,980
things are delicious.
During those months.

1036
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,240
Where do you find them though?
I can't find them anywhere.

00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,210
Amazon.

Yeah.

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,360
Some grocery stores,
but like the Soda Aisle,

1040
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,460
so big and taken over by the big ones.

1041
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,760
There's like one six pack and every 
grocery store and get lucky.

1042
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,030
I'm so burned out on the cry trying to 
do all the Zv a water.

1043
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,950
Yeah,
very similar.

1044
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,660
It's so.
Stevia is still fine,

1045
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,400
right?
Like there's nothing bad with Stevia.

1046
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,050
I always hear like,
what was the other one night?

1047
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,010
A aspartame.
Yeah.

1048
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,210
That's terrible pain.
The other wall.

1049
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,300
The clo.
The xylitol.

1050
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,111
Um,
yeah.

1051
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,940
What was the coconut one?
Fuck.

1052
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,260
What was that one anyways?
Most of them like monk fruit.

1053
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,330
Supposed to be really good.
Um,

1054
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,390
most of that stuff,
like the chemical stuff's dangerous,

1055
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:01,224
but the Stevia,
I think I'm pretty sure we should have 

1056
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,450
jamie.
Check as soon as Jamie comes back.

1057
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,910
I don't want to tell anybody job,
bro.

1058
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,021
You'd all.
Steve,

1059
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:09,854
do you want.
Do you remember that crazy guy that was 

1060
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:12,840
a snort and Stevia?
Yeah,

1061
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,230
that's his name.
Dan Quinn still alive,

1062
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,630
man.
That guy was crazy.

1063
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,570
He was a guy.
Yeah.

1064
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,493
Yeah.
I had some awesome videos of him snort 

1065
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:24,044
and Stevia talking about Stevia burns 
off calories and it gives you muscles 

1066
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,690
route here.
Yeah,

1067
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,750
we got root beer,
soda.

1068
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,840
This is zero calories and it's sweetened
with Stevia and it's like a lacroix with

1069
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,170
that tastes better.
Grapefruit citrus.

1070
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,620
People going to think this is some 
really fucking low level,

1071
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:42,454
sketchy commercial man.
If I wasn't wearing my me undies right 

1072
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:45,604
now.

1073
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,790
Well if you just go to stamps.com.
Oh my God.

1074
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:53,240
It tastes like root beer.
Yeah.

1075
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,480
Legit.
Okay.

1076
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,880
Here's the question.
Is there anything wrong with Stevia?

1077
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,480
We need to find out.
I feel like there was something recently

1078
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,370
that's.
Does Stevia kill you?

1079
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,433
My Dad still on the thing where if it's 
any kind of artificial sweetener and 

1080
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:11,780
your brain thinks it's real,
so it releases chemicals unnecessarily.

1081
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,240
That doesn't have any where to go.
So he says it's still bad for you.

1082
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,870
Any artificial sweeteners?
Right?

1083
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,890
So this isn't an artificial sweetener in
it.

1084
00:48:18,891 --> 00:48:22,150
I just know Stevia is with the plant.
That's why that was a little green leaf.

1085
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,180
That's what Stevie it looks like,
but isn't it your brain think like,

1086
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,140
hey,
this is sugar though.

1087
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:27,610
It tastes like sugar.
I don't know.

1088
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,410
Maybe your brain dust.
My sleeping,

1089
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,220
my brain smart enough to know my brain 
is like,

1090
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:34,870
Yo bro,
this is fake,

1091
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,090
bro.
Isn't fake sugar bro.

1092
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,583
Don't get crazy.
I had a real coke the other day by 

1093
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,250
accident.
Oh yeah.

1094
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,084
I went to a drive through,
was late at night and I was fucking 

1095
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:47,050
starving.
And uh,

1096
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,000
I've worked all day and I've worked out 
and I was just like,

1097
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,070
I just need to get a fucking burger king
or not.

1098
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:52,960
Burger King.
Wendy's went and got a,

1099
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,933
a baconator yeah.
And I asked for a diet coke and he 

1100
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:58,630
hooked me up with a regular coke.
Please do.

1101
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,220
That shit pisses me off.
But it's still good.

1102
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,620
It was so good.
I haven't had a regular coke and years.

1103
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,840
I treat myself once in a while.
Get a little Mexican coke.

1104
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,630
I went to in and out the other day.
I am not on board within an hour.

1105
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,770
I'm not gonna get shit on this.
But what's wrong with you?

1106
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,010
It it in and out.
Cigarettes killed your fucking teeth,

1107
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,930
but you got to Wendy's.
It's so much better.

1108
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,750
What if you have a group?
If you have a burger from in and out,

1109
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,584
in a burger from Wendy's,
we have Chinese tastes a million times 

1110
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,284
better.
You are.

1111
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:31,030
You definitely have fucked up.
There's a show called good mythical.

1112
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,710
What he's saying.
I don't even know what you're saying.

1113
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,573
There's a show.
You really think that Wendy's is better 

1114
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,360
than in and out a million times better 
than it.

1115
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,880
That's a million million.
I can't trust you with anything from now

1116
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:40,714
on.

1117
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,220
You're,
you're from California though.

1118
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,420
So you grew up on,
in and out,

1119
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,210
but most of your life is spent here in 
California.

1120
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,343
I just used it.
Columbus bias on Wendy's though from 

1121
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,120
where we were from,
doesn't mean it's better.

1122
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:52,963
True from California.
You all getting to know I would love to 

1123
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:56,880
take five guys,
uh,

1124
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,783
all the burger places that we know of 
and have a taste test with blind taste 

1125
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:02,184
tests.
And you tell me which one's the best 

1126
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:08,310
night out will be nowhere close to the 
guys with Bacon and Jalapenos would.

1127
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,110
But fuck all the rest of them.
I just said it.

1128
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,830
Five guys is good.
I liked it.

1129
00:50:13,831 --> 00:50:17,770
I don't like the fries as much as I see.
You got a problem with your face.

1130
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,723
Fat Burger's really way up there and 
many of them to come to compare their 

1131
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,403
taste wise.
It's just one like a mile away from 

1132
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:25,841
here.
I don't know.

1133
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:29,120
But I mean there's just not tons of them
all around the world and country.

1134
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,680
Pretty good.
They're pretty good.

1135
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:32,990
Really good.
They give you frozen meat.

1136
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,853
I think it's frozen meat that they cook,
but I don't think that's that big of a 

1137
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:37,161
deal.
I'll tell you what,

1138
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:39,250
man,
that whole frozen versus

1139
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,133
this is fresh argument.
I think the real thing is like when you 

1140
00:50:42,091 --> 00:50:42,924
cook it,
you got to cook it like right there and 

1141
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:45,234
then you know like right,
like the problem with a lot of these 

1142
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:47,390
fast food

1143
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,800
places that didn't have that fucking 
thing.

1144
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:49,634
Cook way in advance.
They just nuke them and then hand them 

1145
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,390
to your microphone.
Burger King says flame broiled,

1146
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:54,890
but you know what they do?
They flame broil it.

1147
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,753
Then they put it in a pan with all this 
beef juice and they just let sit it in 

1148
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,200
this pan,
like kind of like a caterer,

1149
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,150
like when you go to catering where they 
just pull it out.

1150
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,840
It's discussing,
uh,

1151
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,770
the grossest burger you'll ever have in 
your life is Carl's Jr.

1152
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:12,770
Grassfed burger at some time.
But you'll throw it out your window made

1153
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,600
me sick.
How disGusting it was.

1154
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:15,643
Establishing lawsuits.
I know a lot of people are big fans of 

1155
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,640
water burger when we talk about in and 
out,

1156
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,503
like where they have it.
I think like Texas is a big place where 

1157
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,870
I went to burger,
but they're all Texas doubt.

1158
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:26,600
They've got a fucking big belt buckle 
and cow horns on their front.

1159
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:27,434
Cadillac had a burger,
delicious fucking mind by the spicy 

1160
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:32,980
ketchup from amazon.
that's the best ever have.

1161
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,870
But you buy water,
burger,

1162
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:36,831
burger,
spicy,

1163
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,940
ketchup.
Amazon,

1164
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,220
I'll buy you say it's fucking the best 
catch up in the rod of burgers.

1165
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:43,910
Good.

1166
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,980
maybe be wrong.
I wouldn't say no if I was hungry,

1167
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,800
But it cannot fuck with five guys are in
and out.

1168
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,980
Let's do a taste test,
so.

1169
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:51,910
Okay.
What's wrong with steve?

1170
00:51:51,911 --> 00:51:52,760
You?
What is it?

1171
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,530
Stevie is short for stevia.
Reb bod deanna,

1172
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,573
a plant from the chrysanthemum family,
which grows in parts of Brazil and 

1173
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:05,410
Paraguay.
The compound that makes the stevia sugar

1174
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:07,730
is extracted from the leaves.
It's used in the uae,

1175
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,200
east asia,
Russia,

1176
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:09,511
blah,
blah,

1177
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:09,771
blah,
blah,

1178
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:10,604
blah.
And it's about 200 to 300 times sweeter 

1179
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:14,060
than sugar.
Whoa.

1180
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,100
When did the fda approve it?
In 19 nineties,

1181
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:21,020
fda rejected stevia as a food ingredient
after research linked it to reproductive

1182
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:24,710
problems and possible genetic mutations 
in rats.

1183
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,021
Well,
not a rat.

1184
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:29,360
So,
uh,

1185
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:30,194
in 2008,
the fda approved a specific formula of 

1186
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,470
pure stevia rebar.
The said,

1187
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,360
I would say that owes side a pure via.

1188
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,840
And truvia both contain the reb,
a version of stevia,

1189
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,793
which is fda approved.
The fda recommended daily dose is no 

1190
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,100
more than one point three milligrams per
kilogram of body weight.

1191
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,113
For healthy adults,
you'd have to have at least 29 truvia 

1192
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,010
packets a day to exceed that.
What do the experts say if you're stevia

1193
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,530
isn't made from reb a,
like for example,

1194
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,573
the whole leaf extract that's sold at 
natural food markets and labeled as a 

1195
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:17,270
dietary supplement,
hasn't been vetted for safety by the fda

1196
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,613
for truvia and pure via.
The fda concluded with reasonable 

1197
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:26,130
certainty that renee is not harmful 
under its intended of use

1198
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,460
based on studies it looked at concerning
reproductive blood pressure and toxicity

1199
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:32,454
effects.
AltHough scientific studies in 1960 and 

1200
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:35,754
19 eighties found that stevia derived 
products decreased fertility and female 

1201
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:45,261
rats feed at the church full of loads 
and potentially lead to mutations.

1202
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,863
The fda concluded that those problems 
didn't apply to a based on additional 

1203
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,274
research that's one paid off the problem
with those fucking I don't trust any 

1204
00:53:56,731 --> 00:54:01,230
studies from back in the day anymore.
After that sugar study got exposed where

1205
00:54:01,231 --> 00:54:04,830
you found out from the New York times,
did this whole expo say on how the sugar

1206
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:09,540
industry bribed all these scientists to 
say that sugar is not bad for you,

1207
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,530
it's a saturated fat,
and they,

1208
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,533
although they,
they pushed all the blame on heart 

1209
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,280
attacks and heart disease,
saturated fat.

1210
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,960
So it's hilarious.
So this,

1211
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,823
uh,
I can't tell what they're pretty much 

1212
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:27,231
saying is like the whole foods,
the pure extracted stevia plants are not

1213
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:30,400
good for you or they're saying it's not 
fda have to,

1214
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,200
hasn't been vetted.

1215
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,840
That's thE stuff that we put in coffee.
That was also a four year old article.

1216
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:34,560
I was like,
oh,

1217
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,420
they're jones.com.
Which seemed like a good place,

1218
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:37,254
but it was mother jones is a good place 
if you have stinky feet and you're like 

1219
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,470
wearing birkenstocks and uh,
you have wouldn't beads.

1220
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,850
Mother jones is a good magazine,
but they're super left wing hippie.

1221
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't know if they're right though.
They might be right.

1222
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,640
Makes sense.
Yeah.

1223
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,990
I was just looking for some fda results 
on that.

1224
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,840
I mean,
there's no biological free rides.

1225
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,550
If you talked to the doctors to say,
look,

1226
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,730
there's something probably going on,
you know,

1227
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:05,040
like I used to think that advil was 
fine.

1228
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,530
I think that advil,
there's no,

1229
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,383
no problem with advil until dr rhonda.
Patrick explained to me about strokes 

1230
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,094
and fucking the heart attacks and all 
kinds of crazy shit that you can get 

1231
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:15,480
from consuming advil,
advil,

1232
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:16,650
the thing that you're supposed to take 
though,

1233
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:17,940
if you're having a heart attack.

1234
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,310
No,
not to ask for aspIrin.

1235
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,080
Aspirin and supposedly prevents heart 
attacks,

1236
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:27,620
but I wonder why like do you think it's.
Is it something in the aspirin?

1237
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,910
If I remember correctly,
she probably googled.

1238
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,100
I think it comes from the bark of a 
tree.

1239
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,533
I think actual aspirin is an extraction 
like a plant extraction and somehow or 

1240
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:39,864
another aspirin,
because it does reduce inflammation is 

1241
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:45,510
supposed to be good for people that have
heart problems.

1242
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,613
Aspirin blocks an enzyme called cyclo,
oxy jennay's that makes your body less 

1243
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:56,010
likely to produce chemicals that can 
cause inflammation.

1244
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,643
It helps prevent blood clots.
That's important because they clog the 

1245
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,940
arteries and blink bring blood to the 
heart muscles in the brain,

1246
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,010
which increases your risk of heart 
attack and stroke,

1247
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,113
so a aspirin blocks that enzyme and 
makes you less likely to have heart 

1248
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,180
attacks and stroke.
That's pretty bad ass,

1249
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,660
but what is aspirin from?
where does aspirin come from?

1250
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,140
Is aspirin safe to take a vitamin every 
day?

1251
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,620
Actually encourage you to take aspirin,
but you know what else can be done

1252
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,130
that could probably mimic the effects 
like when you talk to people that really

1253
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:30,304
understand like health ailments.
One of the big things they all seem to 

1254
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:35,194
bring up is inflammation.
Like inflammation is like one of the 

1255
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,620
number one sources of malaise.
How do you say that?

1256
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:46,621
Malaise disease,
a massive issues.

1257
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,780
Health health issues that people have,
inflammation,

1258
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,020
inflammation,
they think is a huge factor in cancer.

1259
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,300
Huge factor in heart attacks,
strokes,

1260
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:58,120
everything.
An inflammation is just fucking bad.

1261
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,880
Like anytime you're eating inflammatory 
foods,

1262
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,433
that's the big problem with sugar.
That's the big problem with refined 

1263
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:05,764
carbohydrates is that they produce 
inflammation in people like a lot of 

1264
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:10,690
people that have like joint problems and
shit,

1265
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:14,200
they go on a low carbohydrate diet and 
other joint problems go away.

1266
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,630
Like if you have pain,
your ankles and shit.

1267
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,733
While a lot of people have found that 
that just changing your diet makes that 

1268
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:23,150
go away because a lot of that 
inflammation is just the.

1269
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,290
Your body just not responding very well 
to your diet.

1270
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,123
Yeah.

1271
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,270
But that's different people.
So what does it say?

1272
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,400
Anything about it being from a tree.
Oh,

1273
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:32,830
I made it up.
It seems like it's.

1274
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,220
I,
I agree with you.

1275
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:37,940
I've heard that before.
there's something that sounds familiar,

1276
00:57:37,941 --> 00:57:39,260
but I don't know if it was aspirin or 
not.

1277
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,270
Well,
what does it say it's comes from?

1278
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,610
I think it's just a chemical compound.
I think acid tilak acid,

1279
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,633
but I think it's.
What is aspirin extracted from the 

1280
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:48,964
plant?
Googled album because I think aspirin 

1281
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:55,100
was around way before they figured out 
how to make like pharmaceutical drugs.

1282
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,073
I think that shit's been around forever.
There was a dude that was a friend of 

1283
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:04,490
mine who was a really funny comedian who
would a willow bark,

1284
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,730
willow,
barnes z,

1285
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,913
how to make aspects from a willow tree 
bitch contained the willow bark of a 

1286
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:16,241
white willow tree contains the salus in,
which is the chemical known as the sat,

1287
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,110
a satanic whatever.
It sounds like.

1288
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,180
Witchcraft doesn't sound like 
witchcraft.

1289
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:24,140
Park of a tree in the middle of the 
night,

1290
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,550
unless you'll bring it to me and I will 
cut and dry it up.

1291
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:30,560
I'll put it in a written.
It's a willow tree.

1292
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,900
Willow tree.
The same as a weeping willow.

1293
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,400
Huh?
Weeping willow.

1294
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:41,540
Willow's the one that's like sex has 
like Those fuzzy things on it.

1295
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,880
Maybe felt like I had a willow tree and 
go,

1296
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,620
ooh,
yeah,

1297
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,670
that's a pretty tree.
It's a nice treat.

1298
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,480
Whoa.
What's that one?

1299
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:55,940
It's frosted and how to make aspirin 
from a willow tree.

1300
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:57,920
Let's find out how to do it.
What do you got to do?

1301
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:00,883
Let's make our own aspirin.
It's make toothpicks out of a willow 

1302
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:07,870
tree that prevent heart attacks to now 
you're talking.

1303
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,100
I wonder if that's real and if you could
do that.

1304
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,940
Probably.
Huh?

1305
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,773
Why not,
right.

1306
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,420
Always sucking on a toothpick instead of
smoking a cigarette.

1307
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:16,400
Yes.
Yes.

1308
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,320
So that's what you want to do,
right?

1309
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:22,070
You want to quit smoking?
Quit smoking is my number one thing.

1310
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,920
Lose weight as my number two.
What's number three?

1311
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,050
Grow your dick.
Uh,

1312
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:31,610
get rid of the damn rat at my house.
I feel like I'm diseased right now.

1313
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,920
We played the video a couple of weeks 
ago.

1314
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,710
Of what?
Of your.

1315
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:37,040
Your rat?
We showed dreaming of your ra.

1316
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,910
Did we play with the screaming one that 
found the link late to like later.

1317
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,744
And we lived on.
Brian caught a rat in a trap and set up 

1318
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,230
cameras.
I can't tell you what happened.

1319
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:49,640
The second part,
what happened?

1320
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,653
So there's two rats were killed.
One the second one with the video with 

1321
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:56,600
the screaming one escaped for a week.
We didn't see it.

1322
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:57,434
All my cameras.
I have like all these night vision 

1323
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:58,760
cameras.
I'm like,

1324
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,700
well it must have ran away.
Uh,

1325
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,080
so I took all my traps,
putting them underneath the sink.

1326
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:03,914
What am I traps was a electrocute 
electric one when they walk in and they 

1327
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:08,420
get electrocuted.

1328
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,540
So I put that in underneath this thing.
Anyways,

1329
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,970
cut to three months later.
It smelled like death in my kitchen.

1330
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,500
You've smelled death before and you're 
like,

1331
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:16,490
oh,
what the fuck is that?

1332
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,863
Sure enough,
I opened it up and I see this flashing 

1333
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:22,370
red light is the rat had gone into the 
electricity thing.

1334
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,570
Electrocuted himself,
had been there for three months,

1335
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,420
went in there after after a must have.
He must have been injured in my,

1336
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,530
underneath my sink.
He might have been injured.

1337
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,110
It's the same rat.
Yeah.

1338
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,860
Yeah,
because I had so many cameras that I,

1339
01:00:37,861 --> 01:00:41,060
I could tell there was one bigger,
the pregnant one that we killed first.

1340
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,133
Then there was the father or the husband
and like it was like two different 

1341
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:47,000
sizes.
One was like,

1342
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,400
you know,
the crazy big one was smaller,

1343
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,390
but uh,
so I look and I see this rat tail coming

1344
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,400
out and it smelled like death right when
I opened up the thing.

1345
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,523
Of course,
luckily I'm dating an asian who eats 

1346
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,970
fish eyeballs.
So I was like,

1347
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,110
no,
get that outta here.

1348
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,130
So he made her do it.
No,

1349
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,270
she doesn't care.
She does.

1350
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:07,000
She,
she has no emotion about death fishing.

1351
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:12,380
And so she takes it out and she puts it 
in the trashcan.

1352
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,273
Like I just told her to throw the whole 
thing away and we're not going to reuse 

1353
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:15,584
that electricity thing and it fell out 
into the trashcan and bust open and all 

1354
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,800
these maggots just come out like,
oh,

1355
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,530
hundreds of maggots.
Like a burst open.

1356
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,570
Like the skin just couldn't take it 
anymore.

1357
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,580
She'd take pictures.
No,

1358
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,130
I did.
I think she did.

1359
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,010
I was freaking out.
She definitely take pictures of it now.

1360
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:35,980
The rats back.
New grad.

1361
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,650
I guarantee you you probably had a ton 
of rats living in your house.

1362
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:40,743
Well,
what it is,

1363
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:41,783
we figured we got the exterminator out 
and we have one of those crawl spaces 

1364
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,310
underneath my house and the whole house 
has been,

1365
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,413
you know,
gritted up so there's no rats can get 

1366
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:49,604
inside.

1367
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,503
So how they're getting in was confusing.
Everyone found out her stupid ass 

1368
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:54,620
neighbor.
He's like,

1369
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:57,560
oh yeah,
rat chewed through my screen in the back

1370
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:01,910
of my house the other a couple months 
ago and he has a cat,

1371
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,030
so they've been coming in his house,
going in his kitchen,

1372
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,790
going underneath the house,
going out into my house.

1373
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:08,624
So he just,
because he didn't tell us that he has a 

1374
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,980
big hole in his back fucking screen.
Yeah,

1375
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:16,040
but it's back screen.
The rats are coming out of his house.

1376
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,350
It's coming in his house through this,
this whole.

1377
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,160
And then they go in his kitchen

1378
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,610
and underneath they can go underneath 
the house by goIng under the pipes under

1379
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:26,280
his kitchen.
I guarantee you there's rats everywhere.

1380
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,970
Like you can't blame this guy.
You live in an area.

1381
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,100
There's Backyards knows horses 
everywhere.

1382
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,230
They're everywhere.
You know what?

1383
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:36,660
There's a fuck load of rats.
That goddamn comedy store.

1384
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,190
Yeah.
I saw three last night.

1385
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,680
Every time I go to that back smoking 
area,

1386
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:41,514
I look for rats and you'll see them 
scurrying across the top and I took 

1387
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:45,114
videos of them.
We were all hanging out in the back and 

1388
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:49,200
the parking lot area where it says 
mitsis comedy.

1389
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,253
Mitzi spot only.
It's fucking rats all over the place 

1390
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,250
over there.
I hate rats,

1391
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:54,640
man.
Do you have red?

1392
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,880
You don't have rats at your house.
You have like other crazy shit,

1393
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:57,714
right?
We have routes to grants is definitely 

1394
01:02:58,861 --> 01:02:59,621
raTs.
Yeah.

1395
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:01,530
We so trenches.
I caught a big trench.

1396
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,380
Look on my instagram.
I've never seen a tranche.

1397
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:09,410
The lead just walking around.
That's real big fucker in my house.

1398
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,600
I put my sneaker next to it so people 
can see how big it is.

1399
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,230
Big.
I just,

1400
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,920
I just put trenches are pretty.
Pretty mellow man.

1401
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,230
Like you scoop them up.
I put it in a box.

1402
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,360
I got to scoop them up in a shoe box.
Put them outside.

1403
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,110
They don't bite or anything or look at 
him.

1404
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:33,390
Oh my god though,
if I saw that coming out of my shoe,

1405
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,300
are you freaked out?
He didn't come out of my shoe.

1406
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,280
I put this shoe down next to him.
I know,

1407
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,114
but are you scared that anytime you put 
your shoe on there might be a tarantula 

1408
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,331
in it?
Trenches.

1409
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:46,500
Don'T scare me.
Black widows were much smaller than that

1410
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,750
and I see them all the time and they 
will fuck you up.

1411
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,930
Black widows are what's really scary.
Yeah.

1412
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,280
I have a lot at my house.

1413
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,440
Yeah,
that's a,

1414
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,870
that's a fucking big bug,
right?

1415
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,160
Would you ever eat that?
Yeah,

1416
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,510
they taste good.
Apparently the tastes like crabs.

1417
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,440
Well,
they're in the crab family.

1418
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,430
Yeah.
Yeah,

1419
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,110
that's what I've watched.
uh,

1420
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,220
I watched the television show where 
these people were living in the amazon,

1421
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:12,690
I believe,
and they were cooking.

1422
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,840
See if you could find it.
Amazon natives cooking giant spiders.

1423
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:19,440
I mean,
and they had them.

1424
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,130
You ever see how they do need to look it
up?

1425
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,920
I hosted a fear factor.
I could watch anything.

1426
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,800
I could literally watch people eat 
dicks.

1427
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,130
I know when they,
they.

1428
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:33,630
You ever seen those things that they 
make,

1429
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,493
it's almost like a,
a screen and they put a fish down and 

1430
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:40,410
then they put the screen on top of it 
and they bury it and they're.

1431
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,691
No,
no,

1432
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:42,210
no,
like you cook it over a fire,

1433
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,340
you know,
like not a screen.

1434
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,850
It's like a bunch of sticks and the fish
is in between the sticks,

1435
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,721
you know,
it just,

1436
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,870
it basically just holds the fish in 
place while they cook it over the fire.

1437
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,230
They did the same thing with these,
these giant fucking trenchless.

1438
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,290
They cut them open,
slip a,

1439
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,290
split them up and lay them down on this,
uh,

1440
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,740
this fire and just put the torrential is
out there to cook.

1441
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:05,574
Just like they would cook,
like a crab or a piece of fish or 

1442
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,360
something like that.
It looked good.

1443
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,260
I bet they taste good.
Fuck nasty.

1444
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,720
They're really bugs,
you know,

1445
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,610
like they call,
they called lobsters,

1446
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:19,930
bugs.
I think that's the thing.

1447
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:21,160
Like those,
those divers,

1448
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:22,990
they call them bugs.
oh.

1449
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:23,950
Oh,
they're gonna kill it.

1450
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:24,551
No.
Yeah.

1451
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,530
See here,
they get these fuckers.

1452
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,010
Is it popping or mouth?
Oh,

1453
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,350
they get really itchy because the hairs 
off of those bugs,

1454
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,540
they um,
they're not bugs really.

1455
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,170
They're arachnids.
But the hairs off the spiders.

1456
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,590
So they take it like little kids,
man.

1457
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,220
Oh,
they cook over the fire.

1458
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,110
But the thing is,
man,

1459
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,890
I think they taste good.
Somebody told me that aiden before.

1460
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:52,090
You know what,
it might've been less.

1461
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,100
I think less drought told me that adam,
that he ate them or girlfriend would eat

1462
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:59,920
that right away.
No problem or problem with chopsticks.

1463
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,480
Yep.
She put some of that,

1464
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:05,590
a duck sauce on it.
Look at these kids' minds ready,

1465
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:13,250
but it looks like crabs tastes a bit 
like crap.

1466
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,170
They're all excited.
Human planet.

1467
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,690
Bbc.
That's cool.

1468
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,750
But why are we afraid of is,
but we're not afraid of crab.

1469
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,013
Like you know what?
No one has a problem Cooking like you 

1470
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:31,240
ever see like an alaskan king crab 
alive.

1471
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:34,270
Their fucking legs are like this long.
Come in your house.

1472
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,180
That's a good point.
You don't have to put a sneaker next.

1473
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,980
I think it's a hair thing.
That's another good point.

1474
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,950
But roaches don't have hair and roaches 
freak you out.

1475
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,700
Ah yeah,
but that's a shell thing,

1476
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,130
huh?
Like if roaches were yellow.

1477
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,211
No,
that's what have you.

1478
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:53,280
Well listen,
I hate him.

1479
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,110
Roach roach on fear factor.
They taste like nothing.

1480
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,600
It was like nothing they scored in your 
mouth.

1481
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:00,250
That's kind of gross.
Like a gag,

1482
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:03,700
a little bit like scored it when I bit 
into it because it's so juicy,

1483
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,230
but the actual taste itself was very 
bland.

1484
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,093
What about those you guys pill bugs or 
those garden bugs that you guys used to 

1485
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,233
have on fear factor?
Those big green caterpillars that were 

1486
01:07:15,141 --> 01:07:16,490
just pop in your mouth.
Oh,

1487
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:20,530
I ate one of those tomato horn worm.
I ain't one of those.

1488
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,190
That wasn't so good.
What?

1489
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,150
What that tastes like that it seems that
strong still,

1490
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,060
but very mushy.
Like if I was really hungry,

1491
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,980
I eat the shit out of a plate of those.
Oh,

1492
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,690
those roaches.
Roaches.

1493
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:37,090
Because I was in Mexico last year and we
were in cancun.

1494
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,850
No cabo tomato.
Warm when I was fearful.

1495
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,003
Yeah.

1496
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,441
chewing up.
Oh god.

1497
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:49,274
Damn storm man.
This is when fear factor was costing is 

1498
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:53,180
man,
if I met this dude right now,

1499
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:54,014
today,

1500
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,650
if I saw that dude today,
I'd be like,

1501
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:00,970
nice to meet you.
Like I never.

1502
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:03,340
I don't remember meeting.
That's so great.

1503
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,750
memories such dong shit.
Wow.

1504
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:08,950
My memory's pretty good for like normal 
stuff,

1505
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,910
but I think I've seen too much.
All those people.

1506
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:15,560
I don't know who these people are.
This is where obviously met them.

1507
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,180
That dude is going to town though.
Look at him.

1508
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,650
This is when fear factor was amazing.
Ludicrous.

1509
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:22,700
Man.
Call me.

1510
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:23,563
I'll give you some tips here.
When did we talk about is like one of 

1511
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:26,750
those stones is like,
oh no,

1512
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,970
you're gonna get your cell phone wet 
time.

1513
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,490
Like,
no,

1514
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:35,060
no,
they're on a budget.

1515
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:40,090
Yeah.
Luda might've ate up that budget on that

1516
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,180
fast and the furious gig money.
Now he's stuck in that world with tyrese

1517
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,073
and how those guys,
when their franchise and we talk about 

1518
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:48,300
tyrese and rock.

1519
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh my god.
Did we talk about it yesterday?

1520
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,530
We mentioned it off on it.
We didn't,

1521
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,170
we didn't talk about it.
I have no idea.

1522
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:54,921
I was,
I was,

1523
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:57,170
uh,
on youtube looking at something else.

1524
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:58,360
I was looking at,
uh,

1525
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,413
some automobile thing and uh,
I saw the rock and then I saw the rock 

1526
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,810
dysentery,
reese and I was like,

1527
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:07,410
this is real.
And I went to.

1528
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,630
No,
it's real.

1529
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,553
They apparently,
tyrese talked a bunch of shit about the 

1530
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:14,630
rock and the rock did a review of 
[inaudible] album,

1531
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,640
but they're Also in a movie right now.
They gather.

1532
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,140
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't like them.

1533
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:18,974
Yeah.
The things coming up because the rock 

1534
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,480
made a deal to make a a spinoff sequel 
to the fast and furious franchise that's

1535
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:26,624
not bringing.
Involving anyone that's in the fridge 

1536
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,770
and they're mad.
Tyrese is like,

1537
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,604
you're splitting up the family,
which means nobody wants to go see a 

1538
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:34,580
goddamn tyree smoothly.

1539
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,760
That's the real problem.
Yeah.

1540
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,430
I'm on team rock.
Whatever he wants.

1541
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,950
I love the rock.
He's a sweetheart of a guy.

1542
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:41,250
If you meet him in person too.
Oh,

1543
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,190
you got to meet him.
Yeah,

1544
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,850
he's great at tate did a movie with him.
Jumanji.

1545
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:46,843
He's a fucking great guy.
Like legitimately great guy and he 

1546
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:52,520
inspires the shit out of me.
You know,

1547
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,980
a lot of people think that that meat 
heads stuff like in the gym,

1548
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:56,570
like push harder,
get it done.

1549
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,070
You know,
all work.

1550
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,710
All play all day.
You know,

1551
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:02,070
like all that.
I,

1552
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,060
I find him inspirational.
I don't care if it's,

1553
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,190
I don't care if it's simple stuff.
I think he's great.

1554
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,470
I love him.
It was pretty good.

1555
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,180
Yeah,
we got kimmy some volume.

1556
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,440
Am I just wrapped a phenomenal workout 
here in the iron paradise.

1557
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:16,020
Got after it.
Hardcore hardest workers in the room.

1558
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,033
It's how we do it.
The number one question that I'm asked 

1559
01:10:19,021 --> 01:10:21,360
everywhere I go around the world is 
always,

1560
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:22,194
how is it that I stay so motivated?
What are the motivating factors in my 

1561
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:27,570
life that keeps me in this psychological
space?

1562
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,060
Um,
number one will be gratitude.

1563
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:32,970
I try and find a way to be grateful for 
every single thing I have.

1564
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,010
Every single day.
Wins,

1565
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,390
losses,
loved ones,

1566
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:37,860
you name it.
My life wasn't always this way.

1567
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:38,694
It was much different many moons ago.
So these days I'm grateful to the bone 

1568
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,800
for everything.
The other thing is hunger.

1569
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,300
Uh,
you always hear people say,

1570
01:10:45,301 --> 01:10:46,134
well,
it's about being number one about being 

1571
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:48,540
at the top,
or how about this?

1572
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:49,374
Um,
you always got to find somebody out 

1573
01:10:49,981 --> 01:10:51,300
there is going to work harder.
Well,

1574
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:53,010
I don't know that that might be 
bullshit,

1575
01:10:53,011 --> 01:10:53,844
but I know no one is going to be 
hungrier than I am and I try and find a 

1576
01:10:57,781 --> 01:11:00,030
way to be grateful,
so I hope that helps.

1577
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,320
It's 2:00
in the morning.

1578
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:03,840
If you're watching this,
you better be doing something productive

1579
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:06,570
and not freaky shit.
While you could go do some freaky shit.

1580
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:07,853
Saturday night.

1581
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,640
Need a little editing,
but I liked the point inspirational,

1582
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,100
but he's.
But that.

1583
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,110
All that saying about gratitude,
that's real.

1584
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:16,983
That's legit.
And who fucking works harder than that 

1585
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:20,610
guy?
He's always on a new tv show.

1586
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,740
He's got 10 movies.
Juggling at the same time.

1587
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,940
Probably sleeps two hours a night.
Look at them.

1588
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,800
I could do without all these pictures of
people hopping in private jets though.

1589
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,240
I get it here.
Rich.

1590
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:34,110
That the private jet thing to me is,
is just,

1591
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,740
that's a weird form of selfie.
You know,

1592
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:41,940
like the private gym photos I get,
but the private jet photos.

1593
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,640
Who's the guy that that fake?
The private jet.

1594
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,870
Oh,
bow.

1595
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,120
Bow.
Bow.

1596
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,200
Wow.
That's amazing.

1597
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,940
Now isn't it like people pretending to 
little bow things.

1598
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:58,850
WhaT's funny is nowadays flooded,
it's someone on the plane busted him and

1599
01:11:58,851 --> 01:11:59,684
now,
and it's crazy because you could get a 

1600
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:01,650
private jet pretty easily.

1601
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,170
Now there's an app,
whatever that app is where you can rent.

1602
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,450
Like if you're going to san francisco,
you can,

1603
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,870
if you're with four people,
you can get like $200 plane tickets on a

1604
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:13,350
private jet really that you can print 
out private jets through an app.

1605
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:15,780
Now I think it's still pretty fucking 
expensive.

1606
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,710
It's not like,
I think it's called jet smarter jet.

1607
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,544
Set it the one here.
You can only just go to like san 

1608
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:24,840
francisco,
vegas and maybe like oakland,

1609
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:25,920
but it's cheap.
Cheap.

1610
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,440
It's super 200 bucks,
250 bucks,

1611
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,640
250 bucks to go to vegas on a private 
jet.

1612
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,350
And you could,
if you could rent out the whole jet,

1613
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,373
just your friends.
You got to reserve it in time and make 

1614
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:34,704
sure there's only after um,
after the vegas massacre tickets for 

1615
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:43,350
like 70 bucks you have to vegas.
Like how does that work?

1616
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:46,500
Does the airline just decide?
No one's going to vegas.

1617
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,130
We need to make it cheap and easy.
Right.

1618
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,200
Where do they go in cahoots with the 
casinos?

1619
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,400
Like I just happened fast.
I don't know.

1620
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,353
I wonder if they're in cahoots with the 
casinos Because here's one thing that I 

1621
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,350
noticed.
you can't get a late night flight out of

1622
01:12:58,351 --> 01:12:59,950
vegas.
Like,

1623
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:02,310
oh,
can we.

1624
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,360
You want to go home?
Well,

1625
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:06,750
I think that's because of noise order or
like same with burbank.

1626
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:09,630
you can't fly out or las vegas.
Noisy fan.

1627
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,060
Come on man.
what time did they stop running?

1628
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,953
10.
Probably you can leave la at one in the 

1629
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:15,450
morning,
right?

1630
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:19,950
You leave la anytime in the night so we 
would you feel weird staying at mandalay

1631
01:13:19,951 --> 01:13:22,550
Bay because I mean we used to stay at 
mandalay bay all the time.

1632
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,050
All the time.
I think I stayed in that room.

1633
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,123
I'm almost positive.
I stayed in that room probably half 

1634
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,470
because that was a corner suite.
It was always dope suite.

1635
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,720
I think the fertittas put me up in that 
room way back in the day.

1636
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,540
I'm almost positive.
I looked at that room.

1637
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:37,111
I'm like,
god,

1638
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:39,170
that seems like super familiar.
Yeah.

1639
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,160
Yeah.
I would stay there.

1640
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,980
I mean fuck,
it's one guy,

1641
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:45,510
one crazy guy,
now he's dead,

1642
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:51,050
But if you go online and read all the 
fucking rumors and all the theories,

1643
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:55,710
jamie's one of them.
I was looking at facts.

1644
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,520
I'm not going into the conspiracy stuff.
There's the chairman.

1645
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,373
He's kind of a truther.
He's a vegas truth or there's reporters 

1646
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,400
looking into it.
I don't need to do that job for them.

1647
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,010
They're looking into what do you think?
There's a second gunman.

1648
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,873
No,
third,

1649
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:06,743
fourth,
fourth.

1650
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,170
The team.
I'll just say this.

1651
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:11,740
Much of it.
It was happening.

1652
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:11,980
I was

1653
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,813
listening to the police scanner audio 
and I was just following along the 

1654
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,690
story.
The story changed and I had questions on

1655
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,010
why it changed.
Seems super normal.

1656
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,720
Sitting around listening to police get 
her audio.

1657
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,520
Oh,
you mean multiple shooters from multiple

1658
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:22,420
hotels.
I'm not,

1659
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:23,254
I just,
that's because he was shooting towards 

1660
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:27,040
multiple hotels and then shooting 
straight towards that,

1661
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,313
but no,
there was some reports of people 

1662
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:34,360
shooting people in a New York,
New York and.

1663
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,120
But here's the thing that you have to 
take into consideration.

1664
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:38,980
Whenever there's a mass shooting like 
that,

1665
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:39,933
there's chaos and one of this chaos.
You're going to get all sorts of bad 

1666
01:14:43,451 --> 01:14:44,284
information.
people just like they see things that's 

1667
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:47,134
not there.
No one knows where the shooters were 

1668
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:48,844
coming from.
People thought there were shooters in 

1669
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:50,254
the crowd.
I hAve friends that were actually there 

1670
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,040
at the thing that dodge bullets.

1671
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,700
One of the girls who works for the usc,
she was one of the ring card girl.

1672
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:00,940
She was actually there and she said she 
was running away.

1673
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:01,774
People were dropping right next to her 
like she's trying to run and people got 

1674
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:07,990
shot,
like literally like a movie balloon.

1675
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,420
People dropping and falling down right 
next to her.

1676
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,493
One of her friends blew out her acl 
because the guy got fucking shot in the 

1677
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:19,270
head and fell and landed on her sideways
and blew her knee out.

1678
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:22,570
Dan blitz blitz ariens or said they hit 
that woman next to him.

1679
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:23,950
Has her head blew up.
Yeah.

1680
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:24,784
He was running away making a video.
I just saw some girl got shot in the 

1681
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,680
fucking head.
He was right there at the concert.

1682
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:30,993
Fuck man.
I mean that guy plan that shit for a 

1683
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:35,100
long time.
I mean,

1684
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:39,760
I don't like to read too much into it,
but that whole family's fucking crazy.

1685
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:40,803
The father was a serial bank robber who 
used to do all sorts of charity work so 

1686
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:45,664
that people think you're a nice guy and 
then he'd do this charity work and you 

1687
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:49,121
know,
hey,

1688
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:52,810
it's just me.
Just nice mr fred and then mr fred would

1689
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:54,800
go rob fucking shitload of banks.
Yeah.

1690
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:58,660
He had mental health issues.
Two years they fucked up.

1691
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,480
The father was a nun who was a real 
sociopath.

1692
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,030
Uh,
and then the brother,

1693
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,223
the brother did like this rambling 30 
plus minute interview where they were 

1694
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:10,960
talking to him,
uh,

1695
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,530
after the murders and all he just kept 
talking about is what a great guy.

1696
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:17,350
His brother was and his brother was so 
smart and my,

1697
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:18,790
you know,
he was the type of guy,

1698
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,760
but if you wanted to just fly to Japan 
and have sushi.

1699
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,140
Yeah.
Or kill 50 fucking people.

1700
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:27,730
Like it's nothing like what are you 
talking about?

1701
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,563
Your brother is a fucking serial killer.
Your brother's a mass murderer or you 

1702
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,004
know,
you shouldn't be talking about what an 

1703
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:34,870
eccentric character,
you know,

1704
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:36,100
he wasn't like us,
you know,

1705
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:37,080
he would win,
win,

1706
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:41,590
win when the casinos and they comped him
everywhere and it's real weird.

1707
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:44,380
his brother talking is like a guy who's 
crazy,

1708
01:16:44,381 --> 01:16:46,990
who's trying to not seem crazy.
That's what it's like.

1709
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,850
It's like a guy who's trying to pretend 
like,

1710
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:50,560
hey,
I think just like you guys do.

1711
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:51,394
I mean,
I'm perplexed that fucking apple does 

1712
01:16:55,061 --> 01:16:55,894
not fall far from the tree.
When you got a dad that's a psycho like 

1713
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:01,480
that,
and he's raising kids like it's a.

1714
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:04,660
There's a high proBability that all 
those kids are fucking psychos to.

1715
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,300
This guy didn't do anything until he did
this.

1716
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,010
That's another thing that's fucked up.
It's not like this guy

1717
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,843
had this history of violence.
He had planned this out and apparently 

1718
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:14,324
gone to several music festivals and 
taking hotel rooms overlooking the 

1719
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:17,894
arena.
Probably plot it out in his head when 

1720
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:21,400
they found a note,
people would.

1721
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,800
The notes say with the note was 
ballistic calculations.

1722
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,980
He was doinG ballistic calculations like
drop a bullets,

1723
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:31,100
like you know you're shooting someone 
and you're,

1724
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:32,930
you know,
you're at a certain distance,

1725
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:37,931
like some hunters have like a sheet of 
paper that they put on their rifle sight

1726
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:42,530
and the rifle site it'll say like at 
this in a hold here,

1727
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:44,390
you know,
at 500 yards,

1728
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,720
turn,
turn to seven or six or whatever,

1729
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,830
whatever they've calibrated as this guy 
had those calculations written down on a

1730
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:54,590
piece of paper while he was gunning 
people down out the window,

1731
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:56,263
straight up psycho.
Just hard to believe that that's a real 

1732
01:17:59,031 --> 01:17:59,864
person and if you believe a people that 
are quote unquote experts in these sort 

1733
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:08,780
of Mass killings and these psychological
outbursts,

1734
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:10,893
they think that they come in clusters 
that like this happens and then someone 

1735
01:18:13,881 --> 01:18:16,700
decided that I want to be the next guy 
and then they do it somewhere else.

1736
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,470
So think about that

1737
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,343
or not.
The day of case stuff didn't come out 

1738
01:18:26,381 --> 01:18:26,771
yet,
right.

1739
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:29,730
That's supposed to dump.
Or clInton trump.

1740
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,180
Trump is,
I guess supporting it.

1741
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,250
He's gonna release it all.
Of course they try to kill him.

1742
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:34,084
Pardon?
The only thing they trying to kill 

1743
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:36,034
trump.
Do you think it's going to show 

1744
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:37,720
anything?
I don't know.

1745
01:18:37,721 --> 01:18:39,100
I think someone's trying to kill trump 
though.

1746
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,790
Do you think if you had to guess.
I just didn't anyone ever.

1747
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,890
Every president is probably always 
getting threatened,

1748
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:45,913
but not just like,
do you think there's ever been a like a 

1749
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,350
meeting where they got behind closed 
doors,

1750
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,510
like some shadow government type shit 
and they said,

1751
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,440
do we do this or what do,
how do you want to do this?

1752
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,300
I'm gonna do this.
What are we doing?

1753
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:01,400
We're gonna do this.
This guy's talking about the c,

1754
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,283
the he,
he.

1755
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,123
There was like a recent thing where he 
was blaming the fbI for something about 

1756
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:12,331
Russia saying the fbi was involved in 
suppressing inflammation and everybody's

1757
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:13,204
like,
do you understand that the president of 

1758
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:18,130
the United States is questioning the 
integrity of the intelligence community?

1759
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,930
Like how crazy that is.
He doesn't trust them or whatever.

1760
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:24,370
Doesn't trust the three letter,
but he loves to do that though.

1761
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:28,810
He loves to make everyone else seem 
untrustworthy.

1762
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,840
I mean that is his thing.
His thing is about fake news,

1763
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:34,150
the failing New York times,
fake news,

1764
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:34,984
cnn,
they did fake news that like word exist 

1765
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,950
two years ago and it's now like it's 
the,

1766
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,303
the.
You can't go a day without fucking 

1767
01:19:42,671 --> 01:19:43,504
hearing.
I do not remember the term fake news 

1768
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:49,000
now.
I remember right before clinton or trump

1769
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:49,923
became president.
I remember talking to my mom about how 

1770
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:54,780
horrible everything was and I remember 
going,

1771
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,860
the biggest problem I habits with this 
fake news,

1772
01:19:56,861 --> 01:20:00,100
and that was before fake news was talked
about on tv,

1773
01:20:00,101 --> 01:20:03,130
but I was talking about fake news on 
facebook.

1774
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,233
I was saying like,
my sister keeps on posting this 

1775
01:20:05,651 --> 01:20:09,060
bullshit's fake stuff that posting and I
was getting mad at my sister.

1776
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:09,894
It's like fake news.
I remember my mom lives at is a lot of 

1777
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:12,594
fake news and then literally like up two
months later everyone's talking about 

1778
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:17,430
the fake news was kind of obvious 
though.

1779
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:18,264
That was like when they said that I 
killed a mountain lion outside the ice 

1780
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,243
house.

1781
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,440
That was like fake news.
There was another one.

1782
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:27,750
There's someone said that I disarm 
somebody at the comedy store,

1783
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:30,930
a buddy of mine is a cop,
actually sent me a text saying,

1784
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:31,561
hey,
way to go.

1785
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:32,970
That's a tough situation to be in.
I was like,

1786
01:20:32,971 --> 01:20:34,170
what?
He's like,

1787
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:38,020
you disarm somebody at the commerce to 
argue disarming nobody,

1788
01:20:38,021 --> 01:20:39,360
but what the fuck you talking about?

1789
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:41,403
I guess thinking that through what 
happened next I would guess or I would 

1790
01:20:44,501 --> 01:20:45,334
say is that people started manipulating 
those websites to not be parody or 

1791
01:20:50,051 --> 01:20:53,650
satire even,
but they would make it look like a local

1792
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:56,050
news channel in some part of 
Pennsylvania,

1793
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:56,884
West Virginia and then make a really 
salacious clickbait story but have a 

1794
01:21:00,701 --> 01:21:03,250
bunch of google ads on there and I've 
seen those.

1795
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,660
Those got weaponized are apparentLy a 
little bit and I weapon.

1796
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:10,150
That's the word I would use because they
were being turned into bots.

1797
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:11,403
Those kinds of nets.
What spread the quote unquote like fake 

1798
01:21:13,121 --> 01:21:14,830
news of today

1799
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,700
that's being spread all over.
Well,

1800
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:21,701
I was reading a story thing was on dig 
about a russian troll farm like that.

1801
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:28,170
They have these businesses like these 
trOll farms are like their businesses.

1802
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,140
It's like this,
like do you work at t mobile?

1803
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:33,340
No,
I work at the troll farm.

1804
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:37,630
What a fun job.
That is so great.

1805
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,360
Well you are one of the original trials 
dude.

1806
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:41,770
Pepsi spice.
Oh yeah.

1807
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,530
We've brought it up many times.
Russian troll farm.

1808
01:21:44,531 --> 01:21:47,470
That weaponized facebook had american 
boots on the ground.

1809
01:21:47,471 --> 01:21:49,510
Okay.
That article makes me annoyed.

1810
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,490
Maya,
you're annoying me.

1811
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:54,190
Weaponized is annoying me.
Like how's it?

1812
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,140
What's.
Why is that term?

1813
01:21:56,141 --> 01:21:58,300
That's such a loaded term.
Weaponized.

1814
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,280
Still go to it.
Let's understand what she said.

1815
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:01,930
twitter,
ceo cher'S tweets.

1816
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:03,220
Hold on a second.
Is that jack?

1817
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,840
So I'm trying to get jack in here.
I'll be honest about conversations.

1818
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,123
Twitter,
ceo shared tweets from russian troll 

1819
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:13,420
farm according a account claiming to be 
a black woman.

1820
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,960
Oh,
that's so good.

1821
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,120
Oh,
that's so good.

1822
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,213
Rihanna collect.
So humanitarian award year from award 

1823
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:28,594
from harvard.
She kicked off women's history month 

1824
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:32,260
with a bang.
Reads one of the tweets.

1825
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,790
Dorsey shared from crystal one johnson 
in march,

1826
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:38,950
2016.
That's hilarious.

1827
01:22:38,951 --> 01:22:42,880
So this woman is tweeting all this shit 
pretending she's a black woman,

1828
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,863
but really it's.
It's an account made by the russian 

1829
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:49,270
internet research agency with links to 
the kremlin.

1830
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:52,300
That is wonderful.
I know crystal.

1831
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,100
One johnson.
Do you think they killed her account?

1832
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:55,630
Go to account.
See if it's legit.

1833
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,510
I hope it's still there.
Just to highlight it.

1834
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,900
CrYstal.

1835
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,430

Please be real.
Please be real.

1837
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,040
Tell me if you think it's real.
Brian.

1838
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,153
Yes.
Yes,

1839
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,920
yes.
Let's see.

1840
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,813
Let's see.
Go.

1841
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,180
Oh,
she's still up now.

1842
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:15,350
It's gone.
It's gone.

1843
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,540
It's suspended.
Dammit.

1844
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:19,470
God dammit.
Jack.

1845
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,400
That was what she used to look like.
I know that was somebody else's account.

1846
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:24,530
Hood to someone who saved it.
Oh,

1847
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:26,210
that's her tweets.
That's the account here.

1848
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,510
This is amazing.
Like you look,

1849
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:28,363
she has a.
Is a picture of a beautiful black girl 

1850
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:33,650
laughing.
You probably didn't learn this in school

1851
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,573
and then she has a pic.
Says amelia bassano is the lady who 

1852
01:23:37,551 --> 01:23:39,860
wrote all of shakespeare's plays because
she was black.

1853
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:40,694
They would not publish her work.
She died in poverty because she never 

1854
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:43,334
received a dime for work.
Shakespeare was illiterate and could 

1855
01:23:45,051 --> 01:23:46,190
barely write his own name.

1856
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,670
Why?
Because it's funny.

1857
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,990
Positive black.
Well,

1858
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,500
so people will share that look,
go,

1859
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,363
go back up to that tweet.
That doesn't show you how many people 

1860
01:23:58,311 --> 01:23:59,260
retweeted it.
Does it?

1861
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,040
If it got deleted So I can.
Oh,

1862
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,440
this is wonderful.
It's wonderful.

1863
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:05,540
I mean that's like,
so obviously not true.

1864
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,410
Like she's pretending that some black 
woman wrote all of shit.

1865
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,340
I mean,
isn't that like.

1866
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,700
Wouldn't that be like the ultimate thing
like the white man,

1867
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:17,330
the white male privilege of Shakespeare 
allowed him to steal?

1868
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:18,164
What is that?
And fake was actually an african 

1869
01:24:19,731 --> 01:24:22,250
american is no way is that real.
This is the real.

1870
01:24:22,251 --> 01:24:26,000
And frank believed that.
Then anna queesha,

1871
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:28,550
Frank Jackson,
I think it's a joke.

1872
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:33,170
She was a jew fRom africa.
The real land of the chosen people.

1873
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:35,060
All my god,
that is amazing.

1874
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,580
but that's going to trick someone who 
doesn't use the internet a lot.

1875
01:24:38,581 --> 01:24:39,770
You know,
white washed,

1876
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:41,240
fake.
No.

1877
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:42,074
She's like,
she's pretending to Be a crazy radical 

1878
01:24:44,841 --> 01:24:45,550
feminists.

1879
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:46,383
Someone else respondeD.
This was a response to that tweet by 

1880
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,113
some random.
Yeah.

1881
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,690
Oh,
delirium.

1882
01:24:50,691 --> 01:24:51,960
Swag.
Oh,

1883
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:52,794
well that guy's probably rushing to how 
many people that you contact on a daily 

1884
01:24:55,941 --> 01:24:58,490
basis or actually just russian trolls.
Half the internet.

1885
01:24:58,491 --> 01:25:00,830
I feel like I'm right.
Could be.

1886
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,200
Yeah,
but they're.

1887
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:03,950
What they're doing is very clever 
though.

1888
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,560
Like it seems legit.
It seems legit,

1889
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:10,870
right?
Like that seems like a crazy person.

1890
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:12,220
like I've,
I've seen many,

1891
01:25:12,221 --> 01:25:16,660
many crazy radical black activists on 
twitter that say things that are,

1892
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,720
aren't nearly as ridiculous as that or 
are the more ridiculous than that's less

1893
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:24,070
ridiculous than what they say.

1894
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:26,470
I mean,
this is one.

1895
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:27,723
If it's part of the problem,
I don't even know what's the right way 

1896
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:29,584
to word the phrase it,
but like this is going on all over the 

1897
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:32,494
internet and different forms and 
variations and it's being used and not 

1898
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:36,664
so like nefarious ways,
but it's being used for potentially 

1899
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:41,140
good.
I don't know what the good would be,

1900
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:44,440
but someone is probably figured out how 
to use these bots.

1901
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:48,880
Do you remember before retweeting was an
option on twitter?

1902
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,880
People would write our t and then they 
would write what you said.

1903
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:52,743
Yeah.
I used to enCourage people to write our 

1904
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,960
tea and just make up a bunch of shit 
that I said and then I would go,

1905
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,810
this is outrageous.
I never said this.

1906
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:02,644
How dare you?
And people would just say the most 

1907
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:05,084
ridiculous shit.
Like I love the taste of cox and they 

1908
01:26:06,821 --> 01:26:08,270
would.
And and you know,

1909
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,670
our ti,
joe rogan just finally coming out.

1910
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:11,860
I was like,
god damn it,

1911
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:16,070
but I just,
I don't remember when I did this,

1912
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:18,620
but it was like the early days of 
twitter because I was like,

1913
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,510
this is.
Got it.

1914
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,353
You could definitely do that.
And then people would believe that you 

1915
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,130
said a bunch of racist shit or a bunch 
of gay shit.

1916
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,500
We just opened that back up now.

1917
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,340
Didn't you go crazy?
I like it.

1918
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,720
This part of the,
what I like about the internet is like,

1919
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:38,350
did you read or did you listen rather to
the radiolab podcast on shilo lebouf now

1920
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:41,180
I didn't.
It's fucking great.

1921
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:43,490
I sent it to jamie.
It's fucking great.

1922
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:44,900
What is it called again?
Twitter.

1923
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:47,660
Truth trolls,
you have to find it because they took it

1924
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:48,860
down.
How do you take it down?

1925
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:49,694
I just got enough.
You had it already downloaded on your 

1926
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:54,260
phone because you've are auto download 
radiolab podcast,

1927
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:56,510
so when I went to go find it,
I had to go search for it.

1928
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:57,740
There was.
I sent you that link.

1929
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:58,603
They had taken it down the next day or 
something because people thought that 

1930
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:03,260
they were endorsing,
endorsing that.

1931
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,750
Trolling.
They should be endorsing it.

1932
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:06,670
It was awesome.
Yeah.

1933
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,260
What the four chan guys did was fucking 
amazing.

1934
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,213
This is what they did.

1935
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:12,620
Shilo lebouf,
so I say his name,

1936
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:14,810
but move whatever that fucking crazy 
assholes name.

1937
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,483
He was doing some weird art piece where 
we stood around with a bunch of other 

1938
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:23,810
people and so it was like he will not 
divide us.

1939
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,793
He will not divide us.
They would all say that and then all 

1940
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,220
these four chan people found out aBout 
it,

1941
01:27:28,221 --> 01:27:29,054
so they showed up and started yelling at
a bunch of fucking trump shit still 

1942
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,360
alive right now.
The camera's still do this.

1943
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:36,194
When all after that whole thing ended,
they ended up selling this to another 

1944
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:41,540
company or our people in.
They're handling all of it now,

1945
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,400
so his name's not attached to any.
Okay,

1946
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,740
so this.
He will not divide us thing.

1947
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:46,574
Right?
He would go to these places and say he 

1948
01:27:48,261 --> 01:27:49,580
will not divide us.
He will not divide us.

1949
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,563
And people would show up and they would 
show up with like keka stand shirts on 

1950
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:56,270
with pepe the frog.

1951
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:57,740
They would wear make America great 
again.

1952
01:27:57,741 --> 01:27:58,574
Hats on.
And they weren't even necessarily trump 

1953
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:00,854
supporters.
They were just people trying to have 

1954
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:02,361
fun.
Right?

1955
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:03,800
They're trying to fuck with people.
Right.

1956
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:04,993
So what they did was shiela above put up
a flag in the middle of nowhere that 

1957
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:12,554
said he will not divide us.
And then had a live stream where you 

1958
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:19,370
could go and look at the flag as it's 
waving in the breeze.

1959
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:22,010
Right?
They found the fucking flag.

1960
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,040
They found out where it was.
No way they found it was genius and it's

1961
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:25,874
all detailed in this radio lab.
The fact they took it down is actually 

1962
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:31,040
making me mad.
Why would they?

1963
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,010
Because what these guys did was awesome.
All right.

1964
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,480
First of all,
it was brilliant.

1965
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:36,463
They found social media Posts that 
showed that people had met sheil above 

1966
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,730
in some,
as I say his name,

1967
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,640
the above,
the above.

1968
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:47,000
They found out that they had met him in 
some weird place in Tennessee.

1969
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:48,920
So they triangulate where he would be.
Right.

1970
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,940
So then what they did was they went 
around,

1971
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:53,774
they had one of their members go around 
with a car and beep the horn so they 

1972
01:28:57,861 --> 01:29:01,560
could hear the horn on the camera and 
once they heard the horn on camera,

1973
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:02,040
then they knew

1974
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,050
he was there or then they knew that the 
fire was there.

1975
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:07,440
So Then they found out where it is by 
stars.

1976
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:08,483
They looked at the fucking stars and 
they figured out where the area is 

1977
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,133
because when it's nighttime,
you can see the stars on the live feed 

1978
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:16,530
and you figured out what constellation 
it was.

1979
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,340
They went to the fucking flag,
took it down,

1980
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,030
put a make America great again hat on,
and a pepe the frog thing up there,

1981
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,370
and the guy walks up to the camera and 
goes,

1982
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,580
fuck shiela.
Above,

1983
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,280
and that's the end of it.
So great.

1984
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:34,470
The fact of radio lab took that down.
That's depressing.

1985
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,820
Why did they do that?
Then?

1986
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,730
Understanding what's happening here.
Here's a.

1987
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:42,180
Here's how they did it.
So like when he was moving around,

1988
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,970
they found the log cabin he was in and 
they're like,

1989
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,390
let's look for rental cabins that 
matched the wood pattern.

1990
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,800
There are around 3000 rental caverns in 
lappin lapland.

1991
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,320
We just need to match the wood patterns.
Easy enough.

1992
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,250
Then you just spend time doing it,
but shit,

1993
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,440
your animals.
I fucking love this.

1994
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:07,340
I don't understand why they were mad.
Here's the others did it too,

1995
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:08,810
but.
But this one,

1996
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:09,643
I understand.
I don't understand why radio lab would 

1997
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:11,920
take that down.
Why don't you google that?

1998
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,830
Why did radio lab take down the twitter 
truth or trolls?

1999
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,690
Troll trolls,
trolls.

2000
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:21,180
Whatever the fuck.
It was so rare you listen to radio.

2001
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:23,190
I haven't ever listened to radio lab.
What is it?

2002
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,313
It's an amazing podcast.
It's like a news or it's one of my 

2003
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:29,120
favorite podcasts.
They have all kinds of crazy shit on the

2004
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:29,963
mean.
They have stuff on all sorts of 

2005
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:31,674
different inch.
Oh,

2006
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:35,780
radio lab removes its truth trolls 
episode from podcast feed.

2007
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,240
This was.

2008
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,073
I was trying to find the actual because 
it say why they posted the reason why 

2009
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:45,600
this isn't second what,
but it's saying that they removed it,

2010
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:46,930
right?
That was someone reading the article.

2011
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,053
Obviously they removed it.
Editorial radiolab is decided to take 

2012
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:53,760
down this episode.
Some listeners called us out saying that

2013
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,580
in telling the capture the flag story 
and the way that we did,

2014
01:30:56,790 --> 01:31:01,710
we essentially condone some pretty 
despicable ideology and behavior.

2015
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,960
Oh,
come on.

2016
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,550
To all the listeners who felt that way 
and everyone else,

2017
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:12,120
please know that we hear you and that we
take these criticisms to heart.

2018
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:16,320
I feel awful that the things we said 
could be interpreted that way.

2019
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,183
That's on us.
It was certainly not our intention and 

2020
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:22,440
we apologize.
Come on folks.

2021
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:25,290
You guys are missing the humor of this.
These,

2022
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,153
these aren't despicable people.
They are saying things that are 

2023
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:29,754
ridiculous because it's funny,
like there's a lot of people that say a 

2024
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:36,360
lot of fucked up shit online.

2025
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,493
Do they actually mean this stuff or are 
they saying it because they are 

2026
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:41,454
anonymous and because it's fun to say 
fucked up things online that you're not 

2027
01:31:44,821 --> 01:31:47,430
supposed to say?
I would say the latter.

2028
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:48,683
I don't.
I think there's a bunch of people that 

2029
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:51,270
are really legitimately fucked up 
online.

2030
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,313
There's a bunch of other people that 
think it's fun because they're stuck at 

2031
01:31:54,421 --> 01:31:55,254
some goddamn soul sucking job and some 
fucking cubicle somewhere and they have 

2032
01:31:59,111 --> 01:31:59,944
access to the internet and so they go on
message boards and they fuck around and 

2033
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:06,470
they troll this asshole shiela above is 
a dumb dumb,

2034
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:07,240
right?
He's.

2035
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,073
He's a fucking plagiarist.
I mean this guy has been busted for 

2036
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:13,330
plagiarizing like giant chunks of other 
people's work.

2037
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:14,860
Right?
Like what did he get busted for?

2038
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:15,900
Plagiarizing.
He's,

2039
01:32:15,901 --> 01:32:16,734
he's,
he's in jail every couple of weeks for 

2040
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:21,960
being an asshole and being drunk and 
silly fool.

2041
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:27,070
I think that that gig,
being a fucking movie star is insane.

2042
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:31,060
I think it's insanely pressure filled.
It's way harder than what we do in terms

2043
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:31,894
of like dealing with all the people that
like you and managing all the 

2044
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:39,460
relationships and brief history of 
shiela above copying the work of others.

2045
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:41,650
Yeah.
It's like a ton of shit.

2046
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:42,993
What does it say?
He plagiarized and apology to alec 

2047
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:49,510
baldwin in 2013,
roughly quit.

2048
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,373
What would have been his first broadway 
show orphans due to creative 

2049
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:52,984
differences.
That is he couldn't get along with alec 

2050
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:55,390
baldwin.
According to reports,

2051
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,643
the decided the best way to explain his 
departure would be to tweet out a photo 

2052
01:32:59,351 --> 01:33:03,130
of his email apology to the cast and 
baldwin by name.

2053
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:03,964
Unfortunately,
parts of the pros sample a man owns up 

2054
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:07,601
dot,
dot,

2055
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:08,950
dot,
ellipsis.

2056
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:10,003
A man grasps his mistakes was ripped off
verbatim from a 2009 esquire article 

2057
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:16,510
titled.

2058
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:17,343
What is a man?
People including the articles author 

2059
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,310
noticed.
Hm?

2060
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,920
Barf.
Yeah.

2061
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:28,470
That's not that bad,
but it is plagiarized a bunch of shit.

2062
01:33:28,471 --> 01:33:31,840
He plagiarize his directorial debut,
his short film,

2063
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:32,703
howard can tour.com
premiered in 2012 cannes film festival 

2064
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:39,130
until it was posted online.
December 16th,

2065
01:33:39,131 --> 01:33:39,964
2013.
That viewers began to notice that the 

2066
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:45,070
film is almost an exact adaptation of a 
graphic novel.

2067
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:49,030
That's what the one by daniel close,
best known for ghost world,

2068
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:50,980
close told,
budge buzzfeed,

2069
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:54,220
which bought much of this story to 
public light,

2070
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,440
brought much,
much of the story to public light.

2071
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,800
The first ever heard of the film was the
morning when someone sent me a link.

2072
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,663
I've never spoken or met mr leboeuf have
never seen even one of his films that I 

2073
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:09,700
can recall and I was shocked to say the 
least when I saw that he took the script

2074
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:10,953
and even many of the visUAls from a vEry
personal story I did six or seven years 

2075
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:16,630
ago and pass it off as his own work.

2076
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,400
Yeah.
Wow.

2077
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:21,460
I actually can't imagine what was going 
through his mind.

2078
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,593
He then apologize for plagiarism by 
plagiarizing a yahoo answers post from 

2079
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:28,250
four years ago.
God,

2080
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,003
hE says,
copying is in particulArly creative 

2081
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,850
work,
being inspired by someone else's idea to

2082
01:34:33,851 --> 01:34:37,060
produce something new and different is 
creative work.

2083
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,440
Uh huh.
Well,

2084
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:44,410
that's not totally copying what he said 
fRom the,

2085
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:45,610
uh,
whose answers,

2086
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:47,800
but it's pretty god damn clothes,
whatever.

2087
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:48,663
He's obviously got mental issues and 
whether they're real or whether he's 

2088
01:34:52,391 --> 01:34:53,224
trolling or whether he,
whether he's having a psychological 

2089
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:57,980
meltdown because of all the pressure of 
being an

2090
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,130
actor,
there's a shitload of pressure and being

2091
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:06,050
in transformers,
it's so gross.

2092
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,330
Some of them are great.
Don't get me wrong.

2093
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,193
I've met a lot of cool actors a lot,
but I would say 10 percent of them are 

2094
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:13,980
useless.
That's a,

2095
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,310
that's a big number.
That's a big number.

2096
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:20,690
I would say three percent of comedians 
are useless.

2097
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,700
My being generous with the open 
microsoft.

2098
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:27,740
Microsoft professionals.
Yeah.

2099
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,270
Three percent,
three percent,

2100
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:32,060
maybe five,
30 percent of just loopy,

2101
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:36,260
but at the comedy store is even less 
like paid regulars at the comedy store.

2102
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:37,963
I would sAy it's less than one percent.
That's totally different because when 

2103
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:41,504
you're including all comedians near,
you're talking about like the cruise 

2104
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,490
ship comedians,
the comedy store,

2105
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:49,120
comedian or I mean a comedy class.
Comedians,

2106
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,420
blabbers,
flappers,

2107
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:52,340
the whole establishment.
Yeah.

2108
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,233
The whole,
the whole broad spectrum of humans to 

2109
01:35:55,701 --> 01:35:56,870
tell jokes on stage.

2110
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:00,620
I ran into a buddy of mine.
He used to work on fear factor and uh,

2111
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,290
he's now doing standup in burlington,
Vermont.

2112
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,390
he didn't start until he was in his 
forties.

2113
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,181
Wow.
Yeah,

2114
01:36:06,181 --> 01:36:09,560
I just said had a fucking dream.
I've got a dream.

2115
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:10,394
I've got a dream.
And he just decided to start doing 

2116
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:17,390
standup comedy in his forties.
Dean delray started at really young.

2117
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,910
Really?
I think it is 38 or something like that.

2118
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,870
I want to say dean was in his forties as
well because deans in his fifties now,

2119
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:26,030
I don't think he's been doing comedy for
10 years.

2120
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:27,223
No,
he hasn't.

2121
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:30,120
started open mikes with him or like 
seven years ago.

2122
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:31,850
Man.
He's pretty fucking funny now,

2123
01:36:31,851 --> 01:36:32,840
man.
I'll tell you what.

2124
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:34,550
Dean had a set the other night at the 
improv.

2125
01:36:34,551 --> 01:36:37,520
He made me laugh hard.
He had some funny jokes.

2126
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,060
I don't Want to say what the joke the 
bit about,

2127
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,600
but it was about people don't wear 
condoms.

2128
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,433
It Was fucking really well written.
he goes on stage more than anyone I 

2129
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:47,264
know.
He actually writes down each time he 

2130
01:36:48,441 --> 01:36:49,274
goes onstage,
if he doesn't go up two or three times 

2131
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:53,270
at night,
he Freaks out like he has.

2132
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,700
He Doesn't dAte.
He doesn't have any relationships.

2133
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,960
He just does stand up 100 percent.
oh,

2134
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,470
what's that about his date?
I don't know man.

2135
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,900
That seems like not a good time.
That's he's.

2136
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,470
He,
he.

2137
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:06,380
Every time I asked him about it,
he's always just because I don't want it

2138
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:08,820
to interrupt my comedy.
He's so focused on comedy.

2139
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:10,620
Was data comedian.
Oh,

2140
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,743
it's probably a bad idea.
It doesn't always go back and look at 

2141
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:17,360
tom and christine and natasha.
Zero is good one.

2142
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:19,850
She,
she just fucking swings.

2143
01:37:19,851 --> 01:37:23,360
Monkey bars from one comedian to relax.
I think she's pregnant now.

2144
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,590
No way.
Yeah,

2145
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,360
she was awesome.
It was a joke.

2146
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:28,790
She was on the side.
Phalen and choke.

2147
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:29,743
I don't think so.
I think she actually is moshe kasher 

2148
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,070
fruit fertile.
Yeah.

2149
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,370
Yeah.
He's got.

2150
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:36,740
He's got.
He's got that.

2151
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,250
He's got that good juice.
Juice.

2152
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,510
Juice.
Juice.

2153
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:44,240
Yeah.
He good did.

2154
01:37:44,241 --> 01:37:45,410
That would be great.
Parents.

2155
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:46,244
They're fucking smarter.
Shit reveals the worst parts of being 

2156
01:37:48,261 --> 01:37:49,670
pregnant in 2017.
Oh,

2157
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,650
she is pregnant.
Wow.

2158
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,250
It's.
Here's a nice little belly gun.

2159
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,123
That's interesting because she was kind 
of cranky last time I saw her at the 

2160
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:56,070
comedy store.

2161
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,630
That makes sense.

2162
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:59,510
She didn't look pregnant though because 
you had so many things on it.

2163
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:00,271
Yeah.
Well,

2164
01:38:00,271 --> 01:38:01,950
she's a.
She's well dressed.

2165
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,940
She's.
That's interesting there.

2166
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:09,390
If you had to pick like the funniest 
comedian couples,

2167
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,253
their top three.
It's like a rich vos and bonding 

2168
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,753
mcfarland right up there.
I think I got to give the fucking title 

2169
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,213
to the mommies.
I give the title of the tom and 

2170
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:19,680
christina.
Absolutely.

2171
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,960
I think they're number one as far as 
funniest couple,

2172
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:25,350
but moshe and natasha right up there.
They're both legit.

2173
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:30,060
Real top flight standups and they 
actually get along somehow.

2174
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:32,400
So the water champs,
I don't know if tom and christina,

2175
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,083
they have a champion.
They have like real competition with 

2176
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:40,170
each other to see who's the water.
Having a person at the personality champ

2177
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:44,100
content amongst themselves.
Well,

2178
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:49,101
tom is in the throes of our yoga 
challenge and he's lost a shitload away.

2179
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:52,680
Christina was just ranting about it,
like how great he looks.

2180
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,240
He looks awesome,
dude.

2181
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,210
He fucking guy.
When we did that weight loss challenge,

2182
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:59,910
he was like,
what was it like 40 something pounds and

2183
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:02,100
then just ran with it.
Never let up.

2184
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:02,963
Never.
Never went back to his old ways of 

2185
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:06,000
eating and just stayed.
Fit.

2186
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,440
Worked out constantly.
Yeah,

2187
01:39:08,441 --> 01:39:11,040
and he looks great.
There was a picture of him the other day

2188
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:12,840
that somebody put up on instagram and I 
was like,

2189
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:13,890
jesus christ,
like,

2190
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:15,630
look at him.
He's skinny.

2191
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:18,160
He's got to go get all new pictures 
again because yeah,

2192
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,753
it doesn't look the same.
Well that was bert was talking about 

2193
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:22,770
that,
like his mostly stories.

2194
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:23,604
Photo.
He's got this big old moon face and now 

2195
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:30,430
you look at it and he's a.
He's all fucking thin and sexy.

2196
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,480
We to wrap this up,
dude,

2197
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:37,330
I gotta I gotta abbreviate this one and 
get this out of here quicker than most

2198
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:39,000
can I recommend a show for you,
please.

2199
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:42,420
There's a show that I can't get enough.
It's called good mythical morning.

2200
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,450
Have you ever watched this,
jamie?

2201
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,960
Uh,
so It's these two guys.

2202
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:48,200
And it's really interesting how they 
filmed it because it's,

2203
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,180
it's for all the kids love it and adults
love it.

2204
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,350
And,
and,

2205
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:53,203
uh,
there these two guys and every day they 

2206
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:58,440
do this show and it's only like maybe 15
minutes long,

2207
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,543
but everyday it's something diFferent.
Like we're going to taste test 10 

2208
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:02,784
hamburgers anD we're going to figure out
which one it is or we're going to see 

2209
01:40:05,221 --> 01:40:06,054
if,
uh,

2210
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,210
we're,
we're gonnA play this game where one,

2211
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,030
uh,
one thing is a cow eyeballs.

2212
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:12,864
And the other thing is gummy cow 
eyeballs and whoever loses has to eat 

2213
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:17,270
the cow eyeballs.
And it's like they,

2214
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:20,850
they take parts of fear factor,
they take parts of just like interesting

2215
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:21,120
things.

2216
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,953
Like we're going to see a taste expired 
food from 40 years ago and they're 

2217
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:28,460
constantly eating stuff every day.
Like I'm gonna die.

2218
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:30,030
Uh,
it'S really great.

2219
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:32,280
I highly recommend.
It's called good mythical morning.

2220
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:36,520
They also have a podcast called a ear 
biscuits linker.

2221
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,940
The guy's name is pretty hot ones.
I did a,

2222
01:40:40,941 --> 01:40:42,910
a form of hot ones.
It was a,

2223
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,303
one of his officers when the in between 
seasons like me and him went to the 

2224
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:49,380
hottest,
a chicken place in los angeles,

2225
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:53,020
chicken place in raise and it's nasty.
It's,

2226
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,810
oh,
it's the most amazing chicken every.

2227
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,960
Where's it at?
Helen ray.

2228
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:00,680
When ray and ray's downtown raise.
You should,

2229
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:03,230
that's the episode.
Uh,

2230
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:06,760
but how enraged it's nashville hot 
chicken.

2231
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:08,710
And so they have like the hottest 
chicken,

2232
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,960
uh,
and they also have chicken that's not on

2233
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:11,794
the menu.
So we ate the three hottest chicken and 

2234
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,460
one that's not on the menu.

2235
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,190
Me and him wasn't it on the menu because
it's too hot.

2236
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,640
You had to sign papers.
Like it's,

2237
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,450
it's,
you're not supposed to eat it.

2238
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:24,850
Like what happens?
Well,

2239
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:25,684
you should watch the episode,
but pretty much leave me with a 

2240
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,860
cliffhanger.
But after we did it,

2241
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:32,710
he said,
shaun says that was hotter than anything

2242
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:35,740
we've ever done on hot ones.
And me,

2243
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,900
he left immediately went to his hotel 
room,

2244
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:41,260
me and him.
I went to my house a 45 minutes.

2245
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,160
I'm just crawling,
like,

2246
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:43,570
laying there,
like crying.

2247
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:44,680
I fall asleep.
I wake up,

2248
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:45,514
I'm shooting blood like it's 24 hours of
hell and be an incident like I wrote 

2249
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:51,190
sean,
like,

2250
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,720
are you in the same boat?
And he's like,

2251
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:54,140
yeah,
I'm dying to like,

2252
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,170
is it that bad?
It was that bad.

2253
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:57,004
So if you go to hell and raise,
I recommend getting into mild or medium 

2254
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:01,990
hot,
but do not get the hottest and don't ask

2255
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:05,710
for the hidden menu item hot because 
it's like horrible.

2256
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:08,140
Unless you want to ruin your life.
But then when it was over,

2257
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:09,940
did you feel good?
Sort of like a near death experience?

2258
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:11,380
No,
I felt like I was who listened?

2259
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,960
Who hallucinating?
Hallucinating jesus christ.

2260
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:14,943
I mean I was eating paper towels at 
parts just because it's a comedy or it 

2261
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:19,840
was too high.
Do you try milk?

2262
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:20,801
No.
Uh,

2263
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,020
we had ice cream afterwards that we 
should supposed to help,

2264
01:42:23,021 --> 01:42:23,530
right?
Yeah.

2265
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:25,850
Ice cream kind of helps.
Uh,

2266
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,550
but getting the oil like that.
My,

2267
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:31,190
my idea was get the oil out of my mouth 
because it was uh,

2268
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,770
my,
my lips were getting.

2269
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:35,260
And what is the pepper that they use?
Like carolina?

2270
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:38,520
Rhea was carolina rita ghost pepper.
It had a bunch of them in there.

2271
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:40,690
A christ.
So you ate like ghost peppers?

2272
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,310
Yeah.
And I had all,

2273
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:45,630
if it's horrible dude,
a chip now you can buy.

2274
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:46,463
I think it's for 99.
It's one chip that's supposedly the 

2275
01:42:48,581 --> 01:42:50,200
hottest chip you can eat.
And it's got,

2276
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,930
I think it's made with like two or three
of those ghost peppers or some shit like

2277
01:42:52,931 --> 01:42:54,370
that.
A chip one chip.

2278
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,583
What's wrong with people?
One of the funniest episodes of good 

2279
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:00,010
mythical morning is watch them eat the 
hottest pepper in the road.

2280
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,300
And you'll see what I'm talking about 
there.

2281
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:02,134
It's scott will be back tomorrow with

by like almost a marathon length,

2284
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:15,160
right?
Didn't she beat them?

2285
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:19,300
I think she was 20 plus miles ahead of 
the second place,

2286
01:43:19,301 --> 01:43:20,140

Wow.
