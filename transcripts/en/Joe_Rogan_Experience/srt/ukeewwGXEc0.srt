1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,350
I'll be all right.

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,260
I'm the book's called
the disaster diaries,

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,860
how I learned to stop worrying
and love the apocalypse and uh,

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,750
it's really fucking interesting stuff man.

6
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,411
And you went,

7
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,880
you went really deep with this.

8
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,090
You covered so many aspects of the whole
idea of survival and the whole idea of

9
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:23,481
like really chaos situations
and controlling your
adrenaline and relaxing and

10
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,931
how most people really have no idea
that like when the shit hits the fan,

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,150
most people are just literally
going to like shut off.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,630
Yeah.

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,520
They're going to shit
their pants and shut off.

14
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,130
And that is a much more
common reaction than not.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,183
Totally.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,500
Yeah.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,720
So interesting to see that.

18
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,554
Like,

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,280
you know,

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,110
a lot of people don't
know what they don't know.

21
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:45,651
You know what I mean?

22
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:46,100
And that's,

23
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,761
that was kind of.

24
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:48,290
So one of the major,

25
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:48,680
you know,

26
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,100
sort of things I took from
this book was what stress does,

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,731
you know,

28
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:55,640
you and I know you've been in the fight
game for a long time and I've written

29
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,240
about the fighter's mind and
stuff and I was shocked at how,

30
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,650
you know,

31
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,860
the Cooper's color code wasn't
talked about in the fight game.

32
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:04,431
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:04,851
Which you know,

34
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,930
it's a shooting thing.

35
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Explain the Cooper school,

36
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,480
consumed the book,

37
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,380
the Cooper's color code,

38
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,730
which anybody who does any
shooting will know about but,

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,950
but it's basically Jeff Cooper was a
very well known farms instructor in the

40
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:20,951
sixties and he came up with this color
code about your sort of alertness level

41
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,430
and you know,

42
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:22,761
white,

43
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:27,440
you're at home kind of off or listening
to music or watching TV and then yellow

44
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,310
you're on the street and
a orange or you know,

45
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,040
you sort of seeing maybe possible
danger and then read you're fighting.

46
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,590
And that was how he sort of quantified it.

47
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,630
And then the Marine Corps
later come up with black,

48
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,980
which was the catastrophic
failure of your mind basically.

49
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,120
Like the total breakdown.

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,030
And it was just so interesting to sort of,

51
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,601
you know,

52
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:51,110
I've been hearing about this anecdotally
and I'd seen it with fighters,

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,710
um,

54
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,921
you know,

55
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,030
guys freezing,

56
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,920
just doing dumb shit over and over again,

57
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:56,270
you know,

58
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,931
it's not working,

59
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:59,480
but they can't stop and they're
getting punched in the face.

60
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,320
So that's definitely
not helping them here.

61
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,643
But you know,

62
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
the fact that,

63
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:03,831
I mean,

64
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,510
I'm sure some of these
trainers knew about it,

65
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,830
but nobody had mentioned,

66
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,350
you know,

67
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,350
there's this huge raft of data
and research that's been done on,

68
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:13,990
on,

69
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,800
on stress and what it does to your body.

70
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:15,930
And,

71
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,221
and,

72
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:16,581
uh,

73
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,010
it wasn't really being
utilized in the fight game,

74
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,350
but you had Kimbo in fucking side control.

75
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,370
You work to get it.

76
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:23,821
You got it.

77
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,990
You were in a dominant position.

78
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,670
He was tired and they

79
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,510
could you back up bitches.

80
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,870
We did a video interview,

81
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,540
you know,

82
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,610
everyone's on the other line.

83
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,440
I've just finished training.

84
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:41,441
So I'm on the phone and one no one was
asking me any questions and I thought,

85
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:41,871
yeah,

86
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm just the Guy Kimball to be so.

87
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:44,960
And then the,

88
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,300
someone asked a question,

89
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,430
they said this is how he
was holding the phone,

90
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,140
the Asco,

91
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,600
each of the questions that I,

92
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:53,480
I just,

93
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:53,700
uh,

94
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:53,920
I,

95
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,210
I did emphasis there just in
case you couldn't visualize it.

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
And they said to him,

97
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,010
what would you do with James Thompson one?

98
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,730
And he said,

99
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,630
I'd hung myself.

100
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,923
And I thought,

101
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,880
wow,

102
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
that's the dumbest motherfucker
in the history of MMA productions.

103
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,161
The,

104
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,350
the idea that you have one guy,

105
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,790
that's the most important thing,

106
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:14,930
right?

107
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,450
Banked everything on him winning.

108
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,690
So stupid eggs,

109
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,233
buses.

110
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,820
If you kicked that guy's ass,

111
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,290
it would have been awesome if they
left you in side control a little bit.

112
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,980
An awesome.

113
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,050
Just like it was awesome
for him when he won,

114
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,580
it would have been awesome for you.

115
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,920
Then you know,

116
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,010
you gotta let the Guy who's
supposed to win win win.

117
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,290
There's a lot of fights where the
referee errs on the side of caution and

118
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,250
protects the fighter.

119
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,990
And in a case like yours,

120
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,270
you feel like you were denied
an opportunity because of that,

121
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:43,610
right?

122
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,443
Yeah.

123
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,030
Well,

124
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,500
what I was saying before,

125
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,850
so I started fumbling,

126
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,240
but the guy I was backstage and it
just happened and I'm Gary Shaw.

127
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,210
Some fucking.

128
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,070
Yeah.

129
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,940
Carla though.

130
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,530
They call them scholar.

131
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,370
What seems like a nice guy with a fucking.

132
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,870
What was the dollar sign?

133
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,630
Fucking.

134
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,190
Yeah.

135
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,690
It was a chain of dark side chain.

136
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,960
A Scala.

137
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah.

138
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,393
It's clever.

139
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:10,880
Yeah.

140
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,290
Well he grew up with the rich dad and he,

141
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,410
you know,

142
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,880
it's an interesting way to live your life,

143
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,070
but he came up to me and he said,

144
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,110
you've got to go to the hospital.

145
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,700
You've got to the hospital now.

146
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,320
I know you got to go to the hospital.

147
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,210
Yeah.

148
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,760
Okay.

149
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
I turned to him and I said,

150
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
yeah,

151
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,303
I said Y'all,

152
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,780
but it turned away or you know,

153
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,050
because there was a lot going on.

154
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,253
So he didn't hear me.

155
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,780
Then he turned back and went,

156
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,770
you have to go to the hospital
now I'm taking you now and I'm,

157
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,610
you really want me to go
to the hospital right?

158
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,503
Too much.

159
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,810
So then I went to the press conference
instead and as I walked into the patch

160
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,663
conference,

161
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,593
go shoulders going,

162
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,140
we've just have to take James
Thompson to the hospital,

163
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,113
the

164
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,513
breathing,

165
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,520
someone caught into it and I was
drinking a drink and I think some say,

166
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,354
Oh,

167
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,150
here's the legit issue for real.

168
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,900
A woman like Jodie foster can come out
of the closet and still play someone's

169
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,734
wife.

170
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
No problem.

171
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,690
No one has a problem with it.

172
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,370
If Tom Cruise,

173
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,900
and I'm not saying Tom Cruise's gay,

174
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,050
but if Tom Cruise was gay and he
came out of the closet and um,

175
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,170
then wanted to do a movie where he
was making out with the chairs over,

176
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,004
it's over.

177
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,450
That's,

178
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,320
that's reality.

179
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,790
I mean,

180
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,000
I,

181
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,850
I believe,

182
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,260
I mean,

183
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,920
I shouldn't say it's reality because I'm
basing it on my own personal feelings

184
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,010
of how it would go down.

185
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,300
It might go down differently,

186
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:39,301
but I think that the people
that do polling for politicians
and stuff like that,

187
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,444
I mean,

188
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,580
you'd be amazed at how
irrational voters are.

189
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:42,810
How,

190
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,300
how,

191
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,350
how finding out.

192
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,070
One little thing about somebody's
past can really sway an election.

193
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,810
So people are very,

194
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,200
you know,

195
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,921
for the most part,

196
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,540
people are pretty conservative
in their ideologies.

197
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,680
It doesn't seem to be an issue
when you're women that are out.

198
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,770
It's like we don't really have that
much of a problem with us is not.

199
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,770
There's no like there's going to trace
trace and I really think it's Ah,

200
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,300
you're bumping muffs and you're
making out a neediness to cock

201
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,560
nude.

202
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,393
Yeah.

203
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,260
So there's also the stigma
of disease and all that.

204
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,340
So that comes with it too,

205
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,670
right?

206
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,503
With the gay side,

207
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,990
what if they're just in
a jerking off each other?

208
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,170
It's completely different.

209
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,980
That's staring each other in the eye.

210
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:25,510
They look away.

211
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,343
I'll look it away.

212
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you worried about
for a second as a goof?

213
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,930
I'm gonna jerk it off.

214
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,190
I've been shaving around my dick because
they say it makes my dick look bigger,

215
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,090
but I'm not convinced.

216
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,170
Can you give me an opinion?

217
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,710
I want you to be objective here.

218
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,630
Let me give it a look.

219
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,501
I'd give it a look.

220
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,820
I don't think it looks good.

221
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,190
That looks a lot bigger.

222
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm telling you it doesn't look.

223
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,810
Can I be honest with you?

224
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,530
It doesn't even live there.

225
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,580
You can choke you with this.

226
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,660
You look like you should
have a hole right now.

227
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,740
I'm just suck it and it
wouldn't even feel bad.

228
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,090
It would just go all
the way in your mouth.

229
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,261
I mean,

230
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,920
I bet would even try to right now.

231
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,470
But when they to go out,

232
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,541
you mean you don't know?

233
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,374
You could feel it.

234
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,940
We need to try.

235
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,830
You need to do another
Mikey and Tony in the base.

236
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,200
What was the characters names to remember?

237
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,411
I'm Mikey.

238
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,250
One of them was Mikey.

239
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,440
It was the mom.

240
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,991
Who is Kelly?

241
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:12,520
Kirsten.

242
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,790
She was great when

243
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,260
I was involved in boxing.

244
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,420
Some of the best fights I
ever saw were in the gym.

245
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:19,254
Oh yeah.

246
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,580
Oh hell yeah.

247
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,060
One day.

248
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,180
One day I saw a

249
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,840
livingstone bramble and Roger Mayweather.

250
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,950
Oh,

251
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,910
fucking go at it.

252
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,980
A fucking gym in Vegas.

253
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,700
Yeah,

254
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,533
another time.

255
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,290
Wow.

256
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,160
One of the gems because.

257
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,360
Because we all worked together.

258
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,920
I worked with mayweather.

259
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,971
I worked with Nick,

260
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:39,804
one kick,

261
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,770
'em floyd when floyd was first coming.

262
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,260
I mean,

263
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,300
we all work together in these gems,

264
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,440
you know,

265
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,380
and uh,

266
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,070
one time there was this dude,

267
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:50,781
he was a heavyweight,

268
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:54,330
his name is tracy and him and Roger
May with her fucking got into it.

269
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,840
He was,

270
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,190
tracy was a young heavyweight,

271
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,540
24 year old kid,

272
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:02,190
heavyweight and Roger was
fucking 1:47 in his forties.

273
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,980
She's like,

274
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,860
what you say motherfuckers is done at
the fucking gate into a back and forth.

275
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:08,131
I go,

276
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:08,964
Oh shit,

277
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,720
here we go.

278
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,690
And they got into the fucking
ring and started fighting in.

279
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,790
Uh,

280
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,110
yeah,

281
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,830
they started fucking fighting and at
the end of the round when the bell went

282
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:17,460
off,

283
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,820
Tracy tried to stop and Roger
fucking lit him up and he goes,

284
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,730
no rounds,

285
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,730
motherfucker no rounds.

286
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,250
So they just kept fighting straight
fucking through until fucking tracy quit.

287
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,520
Oh my God.

288
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,110
Roger fucking whooped his ass
and he fucking quit forties.

289
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:34,350
Yeah.

290
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,800
And then,

291
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,730
and then when he quit,

292
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,230
roger hit them another eight,

293
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,300
nine times after he fucking quit.

294
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,220
And he was basically like,

295
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:46,050
don't ever fucking mouth off to me in
this gym at 1:47 pound 40 year olds.

296
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,210
But Roger May Black Mamba.

297
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,730
Yup.

298
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:48,990
You know,

299
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,280
a lot of people don't know Roger.

300
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,031
You know a lot of people.

301
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,110
Everybody knows floyd.

302
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:52,944
But Roger,

303
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,480
his uncle in his time
was a bad motherfucker.

304
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,340
He had a piston right hand,

305
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,820
he had a nasty jab and he would
fucking slam that right hand in.

306
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,370
He was a bad dude for many a year.

307
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,850
I've seen some crazy shit
happen in fucking boxing gyms,

308
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,360
man.

309
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,193
Crazy shit.

310
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,753
That's incredible.

311
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,250
Cool.
