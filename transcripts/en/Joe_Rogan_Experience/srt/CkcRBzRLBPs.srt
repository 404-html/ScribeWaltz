1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,900
Oh look at this fucking photograph.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,930
There is a lion that is hugging a bear
and the lion has a tear rolling down his

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,120
face and the bear has a tear
rolling down his face and it says,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,860
Ban,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,950
Ban the bear hunt.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,420
They are all cecil.

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,360
Save New Jersey barriers.com.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,613
Oh my God.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
First makes me want to
punch somebody in the face.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,330
What kind of fucking crazy person living,

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,340
living some weird bubble
made this billboard and spent
actual human money on it.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,270
Yeah,

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,830
I dunno.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,330
This fantasy land if they haven't seen.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,870
Okay.

17
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,450
They have a giant problem
with bears in New Jersey.

18
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,051
And this is,

19
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,360
this is this facts behind this.

20
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:40,781
First of all,

21
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:45,160
a student from rutgers was fucking killed
by a bear right outside of rutgers.

22
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,251
He,

23
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:48,970
that photograph student took this photo
of a bear just before it killed them.

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,140
Um,

25
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,000
I was talking to a guy who is,

26
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,660
who knows rangers out there and
they're telling people not to hike.

27
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,450
They have so many Goddamn
bear in New Jersey.

28
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,770
And why do they have so many bear?

29
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,140
Because they didn't have a hunt for them.

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,370
So these God damn things,

31
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:05,800
they got overpopulated
and they have now they're,

32
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,560
they're entering into residential
neighborhoods and these,

33
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,330
look at this fucking video.

34
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,850
Bear fight far rockaway,

35
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:13,631
New Jersey,

36
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,610
August 14th of 2014.

37
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,680
These bears are duking it out.

38
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:21,250
These are big black bears
like seven foot bears,

39
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,470
400 plus pound bears,

40
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:26,380
and they are going to war
in this guy's front lawn.

41
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,060
These are huge.

42
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,960
I mean if you were an Alberta and
you saw one of these bears coming in,

43
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,370
you'd be like,

44
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,203
Ooh,

45
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,460
that's a trophy bear.

46
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,720
That's a giant bear.

47
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
That's hundreds of pounds
of meat for the grill.

48
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,790
And these bears are in this guy's lawn.

49
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,830
I mean this isn't a,

50
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,150
this isn't some crazy rural,

51
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,043
you know,

52
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,240
Akins living in the middle of the nowhere.

53
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,670
No,

54
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,500
this jersey,

55
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,430
this thing just knocked over a lamp
post and now it's colliding with these

56
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,870
garbage pails.

57
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,853
Watch this.

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
They come.

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,800
They're fighting over
territory by the way.

60
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,600
That's created by garbage.

61
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,220
That's what the territory is.

62
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,210
They attack people's
garbage and these two bears,

63
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,130
they bite each other and
then they do get out.

64
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:09,340
Look at the size of these
bears know these are huge,

65
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,820
right?

66
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,653
Well that's,

67
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,613
that's why.

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,190
Okay,

69
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,780
so maybe there was before there's
houses that was perfect bear habitat,

70
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:17,261
but guess what?

71
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,160
There's houses now.

72
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,520
So that means we have to control
the bare numbers that's hunting.

73
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:21,731
Well,

74
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,020
here's another part of the problem.

75
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,450
These bears weren't here 30 years ago.

76
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,770
These bears are overpopulating and moving
into these neighborhoods and they're

77
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:33,220
doing it because they know that people
live there and it's a steady supply of

78
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:33,640
food.

79
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,450
So the cancer thing,

80
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,300
and I get there probably
is linked to cancer,

81
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,120
but they've pulled back on
the red meat in general.

82
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,290
They're not sure about it,

83
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,611
but the thing is,

84
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:47,410
and I think the study is skewed
because you talk about cancer and Ph.

85
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,363
Okay?

86
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:48,940
You know,

87
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,550
grass fed beef has a neutral Ph,

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,721
corn fed,

89
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,560
grain fed beef,

90
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:58,561
that Ph goes up and we know that
cancer thrives in an acidic environment

91
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,101
environment.

92
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,460
You know,

93
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,031
and you know,

94
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:06,031
there's other things that the cows that
have a high acid guts basically is what

95
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,330
it is.

96
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,070
They're more prone to acidosis,

97
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,520
which,

98
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,990
which needs more medication.

99
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,920
You need antibiotics.

100
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,790
Um,

101
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,330
and it's also a prime harbor for Ecolab.

102
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,583
The uh,

103
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:17,971
I'll,

104
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:18,101
I'll,

105
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,210
I'll find a stat for you,

106
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,100
but the Akola it's,

107
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,510
I think it was 6 million,

108
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,470
300,000 milligrams per.

109
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,361
I'll look that up.

110
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,890
I'll chime back in and you guys talk.

111
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,180
I,

112
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,013
that's an important.

113
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,690
Yeah,

114
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,501
go ahead and look that up.

115
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:32,970
But um,

116
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,290
it's a very important point
I think you're making about,

117
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:35,950
um,

118
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,980
about how these animals
that are unhealthy,

119
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,200
it's kind of unhealthy to
eat an unhealthy animal.

120
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,250
That seems logical.

121
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,060
Ah,

122
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,970
so this is now we're talking
cells per gram of meat.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,231
Okay.

124
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:46,601
Okay.

125
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,440
So in your grain fed the count of Ecolab,

126
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,160
the grain fed and the count will be coli,

127
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,410
6 million,

128
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,530
300,000 cells per gram
in the grass fed 20,000.

129
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,221
Oh,

130
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,720
Holy Shit.

131
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,963
Yeah.

132
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,270
Why is nobody doing this?

133
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,950
Why is nobody just leave it here?

134
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,150
Just hit them a little bit.

135
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,230
Do look away.

136
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Because most times when you look away
they think a book just flat hand on the

137
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,140
center of the chest and just
shoved it over the chest.

138
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah,

139
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,640
that makes sense.

140
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,540
That does make sense.

141
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,690
But when I work with a
punch as well with the.

142
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:21,971
Yeah,

143
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,380
but you have more space with
a poem on this distance.

144
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,140
This is much shorter than this.

145
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,940
This is like an extra 15 percent,

146
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,620
which will make a lot of difference.

147
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,700
That's that distance.

148
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,730
That's a very good point.

149
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,880
Like another five or six inches at least.

150
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,870
Listen,

151
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,730
that's why I never understood.

152
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,200
Nobody's throwing palm strikes.

153
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,550
Now that left Hook,

154
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:42,761
right?

155
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,630
Straight combination,

156
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:43,811
right?

157
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,470
In boxing,

158
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,860
right.

159
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,850
It's a dump combination.

160
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,780
If you really think about it,

161
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,950
if there's a short left hook.

162
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,510
I'm way too close with my straight punch.

163
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,231
It has no power.

164
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,190
I can't stretch my arm,

165
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,150
but if I do a palm strike
and then a straight punch,

166
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,430
now I got space for my straight punch.

167
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,323
It's much harder.

168
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,310
So why is nobody doing that?

169
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,851
Now?

170
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,070
I do closed lines.

171
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,190
I posted a thing on facebook like
a year ago when I hit a bag with a

172
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,083
clothesline.

173
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,900
Dude,

174
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,580
I don't think people can imitate me.

175
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,990
My weight with a kick like that,

176
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,123
they can kick.

177
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,761
And then I said,

178
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:12,971
okay,

179
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:13,910
now I show a clothesline.

180
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,490
Is she the back folding or out?

181
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,220
My whole arm is the courageous
thing you can block with.

182
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,720
Tim had tried to block whatever you want.

183
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,861
If I closed line,

184
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:21,790
you have you stand still.

185
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,780
It goes straight through everything.

186
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,830
I guarantee you and knock you out.

187
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,611
Why is that?

188
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,810
Why is it close on so path?

189
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,300
It is so powerful because
you can really lock it up.

190
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,130
Don't stretch your arm because if
you miss time and you hit your,

191
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,220
you got to hyperextend,

192
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,900
but you can drag your whole body weight
in there because you like it and your

193
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,580
legs are planted on the ground.

194
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,260
Yeah,

195
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,290
you're getting all that hip torque and
it is such a powerful strike and also

196
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,810
with the clinch when even
when they stand like this,

197
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,890
if I do this,

198
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,240
it loops around to defense and it hits
the back of their head still the legal

199
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:52,640
part,

200
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,080
right?

201
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,490
Because it's outside the Mohawk.

202
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,031
Well,

203
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,260
he's in the back of the head.

204
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,930
Standing never seems to get like in
boxing they get penalized for punching the

205
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,620
back of the head.

206
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,850
People say no rabbit punches,

207
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,620
but when you think about a head kick,

208
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,820
a lot of head kicks,

209
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,980
especially the ones that
go over the shoulder there,

210
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,750
there the back of the head and it's,

211
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,600
and it's legal and that's why they're
effective and that's why it was so

212
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,220
effective with me with,

213
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:13,520
uh,

214
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,910
with,

215
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,630
with pancreas,

216
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,890
I hid behind the ear.

217
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,780
If you look at Mike Tyson's fights,

218
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,261
you know,

219
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,310
I don't know how he did it,

220
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:19,911
but he did it.

221
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,410
He was always the shorter guy.

222
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,720
But if you see him hooking somebody,

223
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,130
he hits almost the back of the head.

224
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,020
He just got very short hooks.

225
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,153
Now the body,

226
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,870
it's ready for impact from the front,

227
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,471
from the side,

228
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,281
because you're used to it.

229
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:31,461
Well,

230
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,630
if you can see the punch coming,

231
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,920
the behind,

232
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,821
I always tell people,

233
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,720
just do it with the palm.

234
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,650
Just do this to the back of
your head and see what happens.

235
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,710
Like just me doing this.

236
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,544
It's all ready to go.

237
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,200
You're not ready for that.

238
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,410
So you can already imagine if you
go hit as hard as you can be here.

239
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,070
It's a sweet,

240
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,600
the sweet bunch.

241
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,201
Again,

242
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,740
understand nobody's doing it the
head that much more dangerous.

243
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,310
Oh,

244
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,910
do this,

245
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,361
do this.

246
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:56,740
But I mean,

247
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,170
is it that much more digital
than just behind the ear?

248
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,213
Just do that.

249
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,060
Oh yeah.

250
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
Right.

251
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,800
And I was down here do and sound like

252
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,440
would do platform where cry would
demonstrate how to do stuff for other

253
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,460
hairdressers and people.

254
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,630
And I went to a,

255
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,453
uh,

256
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,740
not the viper room,

257
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,460
one of those clubs and this pretty
woman comes up to me and says,

258
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,240
uh,

259
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,560
are you a musician?

260
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,010
And I'm like,

261
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,280
yeah,

262
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,870
but I'm kind of about to say,

263
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,390
but I live in Canada and uh,

264
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,900
you know,

265
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,301
and she goes,

266
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:27,451
well,

267
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:30,600
my husband's putting together
a band and you got to meet him.

268
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,250
His name is Andy Mccoy and Eddie Mccoy
wouldn't mean much to a lot of people.

269
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,850
But to somebody who was really into
like motley crue and stuff like that,

270
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,080
he was in a band called Hanoi rocks
that was kind of started that movement.

271
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:43,350
I'm like,

272
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,711
Whoa,

273
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,071
shit,

274
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm going to be famous.

275
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,100
I'm going to be rich and famous.

276
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,050
Not knowing that although metal edge
told me that this guy was a big deal,

277
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,610
he was just to get a musician,

278
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,020
but I had to a 20 year old from Winnipeg,

279
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:55,770
so oh my God,

280
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm going to be in a huge fucking band.

281
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,250
So I go and I meet them.

282
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:02,730
We go to his house in
Woodland Hills and I actually,

283
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:03,451
I've been here four times.

284
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,970
There was that time that I flew home
to Winnipeg and they flew me back down

285
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
because they were going to
get me singing in their band.

286
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,820
I'm like 20 years old.

287
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,020
This guy is like famous to me.

288
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:10,650
Right.

289
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,850
So I get down there and that
shit is not all that organized.

290
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,661
You know what I mean?

291
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,460
Like something's not
making a lot of sense.

292
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
And then around day two I figured out,

293
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:19,501
okay,

294
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,330
it's because everyone's on heroin.

295
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,920
And it started.

296
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,150
We had smoked some pot,

297
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,290
which in Winnipeg,

298
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,580
in Manitoba we called that dope,

299
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,480
you want to smoke some dope?

300
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,810
So like,

301
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,290
sure.

302
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:28,890
It was like,

303
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,370
so it goes,

304
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,100
do you do dope?

305
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,281
I'm like,

306
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:30,441
yeah,

307
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,100
I just smoked it with
you like 20 minutes ago.

308
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,520
No,

309
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,353
like,

310
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,830
and then before I knew it he had injected
me with heroin conversation sorta

311
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:38,640
happened.

312
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,810
I was trying to be a,

313
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,890
not super uncool but like not saying yes
I want to do heroin and then four days

314
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:50,271
went by like literally just shooting
up for days and then I just about ms.my

315
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:57,030
plane home and so I had a girl and a and
a home and a job and all those kinds of

316
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,920
things that I'm kind of looking at like
the plane ticket and I know it's like

317
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,261
okay,

318
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,260
if I get a cab in the next
two hours I'll get the plane,

319
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,370
I'll get home and whatever.

320
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,181
And he's like,

321
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:06,690
well just,

322
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:06,931
you know,

323
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,160
and you're not even thinking.

324
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:11,850
It's like barely even there and
somewhere along the line I was just like,

325
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,601
don't worry about it.

326
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,110
Just fine.

327
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,880
You don't have to go get on the plane.

328
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,950
I probably got $100 to my name and if I
didn't get on that play and not have no

329
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,520
job,

330
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,353
no girl,

331
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,890
I'd be a heroin addict with no money in
woodland hills with a guy who's doesn't

332
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:26,641
have his shit together.

333
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,070
I think in the years since
he's got his shit together,

334
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,510
I haven't seen him since then and uh,

335
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,180
I've made myself go and I was sick for
two or three days and I realized like

336
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,240
literally that second in time if I don't
convince myself to get on that plane,

337
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,620
my whole life is fucking ruined.

338
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,470
Whoa.

339
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,760
Yeah.
