00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,110
Hello Freak bitches.
What a week young Jim Norton has had

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,610
what a week.
Guess what a week.

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:13,260
Sirius satellite radio has had what a
week censorship has had,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,260
what a week Anthony Kumina has had,
what a week.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:21,090
All the people online that loved the
bitch and Piss and Moan and complain and

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,790
get very excited when something fucked
up goes down.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,380
Well,
something fucked up.

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:27,660
Went down when,
if you're listening to this,

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,490
if it's sometime in the future because
these recordings will be saved forever.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,720
This is today's date is July 17th.
Two thousand and 14.

11
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:40,350
Approximately a week ago.
Anthony Kumina was taken photographs.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,830
Anthony of the opiod Anthony Show,
which our pal Jim Norton is also a part

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,831
of was he was downtown in New York,
taking some photographs and from there

14
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,840
on it's a bunch of,
you know,

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,140
what,
what he says and what I'm sure the woman

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,660
who beat the shit out of them would have
a different story,

17
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,520
but he was taking some photographs.

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,090
One of one of the photographs was of
this,

19
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,020
uh,
what are those things called when you,

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,590
uh,
those things we scaffold staffing.

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,610
Scaffolding,
who's walking through the scaffolding,

22
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,010
a woman was coming towards him.
It looked like he was just taking a

23
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,100
bunch of cool photos of New York.
There's a bunch of them that he put up

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,600
on his instagram.
Anyway,

25
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:19,080
this woman got upset that he was taking
a photo of her,

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,280
probably thought that he was perving,
got mad at them,

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,130
violence ensued.
She hit him and he went on twitter and

28
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:31,131
went on this rant about violence,
about the black community and their

29
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:35,070
propensity for violence about this woman
calling her an animal,

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,240
which she did,
and a serious fire them and which left a

31
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,690
fucking huge hole in my entertainment
world.

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,300
The opiod,
anthony shows my all time favorite radio

33
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,940
show.
I listened to it all the time and now

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,230
all of a sudden it is no more.

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,050
Yeah,
it's a,

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,170
you know,
it's a huge hole to no one panicked like

37
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,990
may cause opie and Anthony both have.
Fuck you money.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,390
Jim Norton doesn't so selfishly
thinking,

39
00:01:59,391 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm like,
well,

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,210
there goes everything because the show's
done.

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,700
You are always going to be great because
you're a funny comment and they can

42
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,800
always work and you never have to worry
about that.

43
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,100
But um,
it is a crazy thing,

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,130
uh,
that,

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,200
you know,
all of a sudden like that for things

46
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,880
that he said on the show 100 times.
I think when I started,

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,110
I think what happened was he tweeted,
like he told,

48
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,800
I talked to him multiple times since
then he was walking and people don't

49
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,230
believe that he was actually taken
legitimate New York photos.

50
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,610
That was one of the points of
contention.

51
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,850
People like he was being creepy,
but he really wasn't like anthony has

52
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:37,851
had this giant Hubble like camera in the
studio everyday for probably six months

53
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,850
now he's getting into photography.
It's what he's been doing.

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,390
So that was not unusual at all to hear.
He was out and about taking photos.

55
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:48,840
That's legit.
And I guess this woman got angry and I,

56
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,060
I talked to him and he said that she
just said something like,

57
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,680
you know,
this white boys taking my picture,

58
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,580
you wiped by the or whatever.

59
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,580
She said she clocked him and he kept
defending himself as he's putting his

60
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,340
arms.
She is going,

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,740
don't touch me like,
you know,

62
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,830
that thing like that a woman might do to
prevent you from hitting her.

63
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,370
Like you could see how frightening that
would be because then people think

64
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,370
you're beating on this woman.
So he's putting his hand up and,

65
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,960
you know,
I know well enough to know he's not

66
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,490
going to just punch a woman in the
phase.

67
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,090
So she's doing that and I think a few
black guys came round and they didn't do

68
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,140
anything to amp,
but there were like,

69
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,130
you know,
don't touch her.

70
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,570
So,
um,

71
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,400
you know,
and who has always armed and he's

72
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,010
licensed to carry,
didn't hit her.

73
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,490
It didn't pull out his pistol and uh,
went home and I guess was really upset

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,080
and went out on,
like you said,

75
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,620
a twitter rampage.
And um,

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,000
I knew it was bad the next morning when
I saw it because my ex girlfriend called

77
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,250
me and she's like,
what happened with Anthony got beat up

78
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,100
by a woman?
And I don't know.

79
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,660
So I looked and I saw the tweets.
I'm like,

80
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,060
Oh,
I actually texted him about one.

81
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,180
I don't think I've ever done that
before.

82
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,740
There was one that I texted her around
like,

83
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,580
it was you.
All right,

84
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,414
man,
does it?

85
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,111
He's like,
yeah,

86
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm fine.
I'm Coco was scary.

87
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,540
Wow.
Um,

88
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,463
yeah.
The,

89
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,470
the thing about Andy is he's developed
this sort of style of communicating on

90
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:12,030
the show where he goes on these long,
hilarious,

91
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,090
entertaining profanity filled rants and
there's one thing about hearing it,

92
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,930
but there's another thing of like seeing
it in a text form is just not the same.

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,130
It looks things don't look good in
print.

94
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,950
Certain things.
And I think what happened was,

95
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
is in the middle of like when you have
either contextual conversation,

96
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,140
it's like you have people,
there's inflection,

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,910
there's another guy next to you go,
well,

98
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,840
hey,
what do you mean by that?

99
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,030
And then you're clarifying it or it's
just,

100
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:44,020
it's a different energy when you're
tweeting and you're that mad.

101
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,300
Like I think like any type of an
assault,

102
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,790
even if it's a woman hitting you and
it's not life threatening,

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,970
it's still like an hour later you're
like,

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,010
what the fuck?
Just happened like I think it just

105
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,720
freaked him out and she hit him a couple
times,

106
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,270
five times or so,
and she sent me a picture of his face

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,610
and he had like a little.
You could see that he had been struck,

108
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:05,290
you mean it wasn't making it up and so
he went on and when I looked at the flow

109
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,080
of things like I know anthony and I know
what he's saying.

110
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
He was not calling all black people
animals.

111
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:13,270
He wasn't because he's never said that
he's talking about a behavior of this

112
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,560
woman and I think that what happened was
he was so mad and when you're tweeting

113
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,440
that aggressively and you've just,
you're fucking dealing with this in your

114
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:24,520
head that sometimes things come out
jumbled and muddied and like if you know

115
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,560
what he's saying,
people who don't know him or reading

116
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,790
this score,
what does he mean?

117
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,400
He's saying that there's violence in
black people and their animals,

118
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,380
like people are putting these pieces of
a puzzle together and they're making a

119
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,310
picture and it was like,
it just.

120
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,980
I know him well enough to know that in a
conversation.

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,900
If someone said,
are you trying to say black people or

122
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,471
animals,
he would go,

123
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,101
no,
not at all.

124
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,530
It's a behavioral based to,
you know what I mean?

125
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,450
Because you said that about white people
too.

126
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,510
So I mean it was just one of those
things where once it was in print,

127
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,570
it's even in context,
we lie as a country like,

128
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,350
you know,
like when cancel cancelcolbert came out

129
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,130
the,
the

130
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,850
activist knew the context that he was
making those Asian jokes and didn't give

131
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,590
a fuck.
She still wanted to sink them.

132
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,120
She's like,
no,

133
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,731
no,
I get it.

134
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,564
He was trying to,
you know,

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,360
show the difference between the same
thing between this and native Americans

136
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,250
and how ridiculous it is,
but I don't care.

137
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,670
So we've gotten to a point now where we,
we don't even pretend to not understand

138
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:16,340
the context anymore.
We admit that we understand the context

139
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:21,341
of we go after people anyway.
So something like this is bound to a to

140
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,270
sink you because it can be taken both
ways unless you actually sit there and

141
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,360
talk to the guy and each tweet has to
come out like a film.

142
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,650
Each tweet has to be a beginning,
middle and end with no explanation

143
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,850
needed around it in order to to be
survivable.

144
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,913
Right.
Makes Sense.

145
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,401
Well,
you know,

146
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:42,500
want the big,
big key to what you said that it could

147
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,700
sink you.
Well,

148
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,270
it only syncs you if you work for a
company and in my opinion that's

149
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,840
unnecessary and in this day and age it's
unnecessary.

150
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,280
And I think you guys,
and I think Anthony for sure would be

151
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,840
far better off with a podcast.
Anybody can get a podcast and put it on

152
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,330
their phone.
Now everybody's phone has a little Jack

153
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,970
that sticks into your car and you play
your phone through your car.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,650
Everybody has that now.
I mean,

155
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:10,520
it's not an uncommon thing.
It's more common to have that Jack than

156
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:13,460
it is to have satellite radio.
Most people have to get a satellite

157
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,220
radio thing installed in their car.
Most people already have that.

158
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,420
Jack,
you know,

159
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
it's just,
it's so God damn easy and I get.

160
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:22,220
I bet you could get all the same
sponsors.

161
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,520
I bet you could get all the same
sponsors and you would have no middleman

162
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,670
and you don't look at the studio.
It's not,

163
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,480
it doesn't take much to put something
together.

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,830
You know,
a little bit of time,

165
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,180
little bit of effort.
You know,

166
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,940
you gotta know someone who's an engineer
and knows someone who knows how to put

167
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,100
this stuff together and set up the
microphones.

168
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,740
But other than that,
what's the difference between this and

169
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,300
satellite radio?
I'll tell you what,

170
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,400
the differences.
Nobody can fucking fire you.

171
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,860
You can go on some con rampage,
that fucking animal and no one,

172
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,850
you know,
people might say,

173
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm not downloading your podcasts
anymore,

174
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,010
but at least you have the opportunity to
communicate,

175
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,280
to explain yourself.
And if the people decide that they don't

176
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:02,390
like your character based on one thing
that you said or one rant that you went

177
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,710
on,
that is their decision,

178
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,630
but it's not the decision of a company.

179
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,100
And when things get,
you know,

180
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,020
companies are squirrely,
man,

181
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,370
they have fucking shareholders and
stocks and they have responsibilities

182
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:18,290
and all you need is a few slash that
start webpages and you know,

183
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,950
fire anthony and Anthony can.
We were going after those sponsors,

184
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,900
we're going to let them know we're
boycotting,

185
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:26,930
but mostly just noise,
mostly nonsense.

186
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,950
Mostly just soft targets.
But all you need is a few of those in up

187
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,980
a fucking accompany will panic.
They do.

188
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,820
What happens is,
you know,

189
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,620
it's a billion dollar company,
so you get guys like Scott and Jim who

190
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,850
runs it,
who,

191
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,410
you know,
they're just the fourth of July weekend

192
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:46,250
was coming and then all of a sudden
they're getting phone calls from the New

193
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,300
York Post and the Washington Post and
all the press obviously has a narrative

194
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,090
and they did a shit job.
But the Washington Post I thought was

195
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,500
the worst defender with the way they
covered it because the woman wrote

196
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,130
things that was just

197
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,380
really.
It was revolting to read what she wrote.

198
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,690
She was talking about Anthony saying
that these guys came around and she was

199
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,770
saying like,
oh,

200
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,710
well I guess if a bunch of African
American or how was.

201
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,670
She said,
a bunch of gentlemen want to defend

202
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,220
someone from defaming,
an African American woman.

203
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,810
It's okay.
Like that's what was happening.

204
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,640
She wasn't acknowledging that Anthony
was being hit.

205
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,340
She acted like these guys had read his
twitter feed and not like it.

206
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:21,240
It was just like she read the twitter
feed in the future.

207
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,910
It was repulsive on this.
A woman who looks like the fucking fake

208
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,300
deaf interpreter from Mandela's funeral
meeting on Anthony.

209
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,790
But uh,
it's a meme,

210
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,470
a meme.
He's rules,

211
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,820
but the company,
these guys just getting,

212
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,190
all of a sudden they're just there.
They're harming.

213
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,230
They're getting phone calls in the
office the day before vacation.

214
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,780
So what are your comments?
And they probably weren't even that

215
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,820
familiar with it until they're getting
calls from the paper and they're like,

216
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:45,780
well,
what do we do with this?

217
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,930
And then this is what the press does and
this is why you got to hate that.

218
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,790
Because I think Sirius was going to try
to write it out,

219
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,310
that's my opinion,
because they knew a holiday weekend was

220
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,910
coming and uh,
this is purely a guess because no one

221
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,850
was saying anything and then all of a
sudden the press starts going,

222
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,100
we have not had a comment from Sirius
satellite radio.

223
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,680
So we're assuming that they agree with
Mr [inaudible] opinions.

224
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,360
They do this sneaky shit to push you
into defending yourself.

225
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,820
So now the company with shareholders,
like you said,

226
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:12,331
it has to go,
well,

227
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,170
how do we tell people that we don't
agree with?

228
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,210
So it's not like the presses the made
them do it,

229
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,280
but the press understands how to corner
you into giving a statement,

230
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,040
a definitive statement because they know
that you're not used to this.

231
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,090
They know that these guys come into work
in management positions are not used to

232
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,000
getting phone calls going.
How do you feel about this statement and

233
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,110
that statement,
you know,

234
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,710
it was really,
it was a very frustrating thing when I

235
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,530
saw what the press did with that.
That to me has always been my biggest

236
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,460
complaint is with always will press
this.

237
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:42,680
There's

238
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,270
no nuance to the way they report on
certain things like this because

239
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,860
there's.
There's nuance to this,

240
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,780
especially if you look into it and
character,

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,550
if you in context where either if you
understand that guy and you look at him,

242
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,670
look,
there is a problem with violence in the

243
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:02,420
black community to pretend there's not a
problem with violence in the black

244
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:06,410
community is to pretend that there
aren't insane amounts of murders going

245
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:11,030
on in Chicago to pretend that there's
not issues with the amount of black

246
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:13,760
people that are in jail.
That percentage of the population now

247
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,840
are those economic problems.
Are those problems related to

248
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,300
upbringing?
Are those pro?

249
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,330
Yes.
Education?

250
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,380
Yes,
absolutely.

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,200
There's a lot of fucking disparity.
There's a lot of problems with poverty.

252
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,680
There's a lot of problems with the
structure of our culture itself and that

253
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:29,990
you could attribute a lot of those
problems to racism,

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,680
to racism in the way that funds are
allocated.

255
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,820
The way that you know,
the attention that society puts on

256
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,100
impoverished communities,
absolutely institutionalized,

257
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,950
yes.
But to pretend that it's not a problem

258
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,890
is ridiculous.
It's fucking ridiculous.

259
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,940
So when he's taking a picture of some
chick and she starts punching him,

260
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,100
I think he's allowed to talk about the
problem with violence,

261
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,670
with that community,
with the community that this person is

262
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,960
from.
That's beating him up.

263
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,940
Did he do it the right way?
No,

264
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,070
absolutely not.
Did he do it in a way that could be

265
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,100
misconstrued or construed or interpreted
as racist?

266
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,690
Absolutely did.
Yeah.

267
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,680
He did.
He fucked up.

268
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,140
He did it the wrong way.
He probably shouldn't have done it on

269
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:12,730
twitter.
He published it and made a video.

270
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,950
It probably should've made a video
explaining,

271
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,030
showing what happened to him and
explaining what goes on.

272
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,180
Explaining this 140 fucking characters
things is a big part of the problem.

273
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,801
Do it.
Absolutely.

274
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,710
That's exactly what it was.
Because Anthony is so good at,

275
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,780
uh,
clarify whatever you talk about race or

276
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,090
a million other things,
whether it's religion,

277
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,780
it,
it's so hard to make your point without

278
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,900
stepping in shit.
And then having to go off on 50 a

279
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,853
digression,
they go,

280
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,601
no,
that's not what I meant,

281
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,570
or no,
that's not what I meant like in.

282
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,530
That's the worst part of the disgusting
stuff is that people jumping on this

283
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,470
side.
What are you saying that all people do?

284
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,330
All black.
No,

285
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm not.
So in order to be able to,

286
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,860
to get your point across,
you have to walk a narrow.

287
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,020
You almost have to close people's
argument doors like a get smart episode

288
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,930
as you're walking this way,
your point gets through.

289
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,380
And Anthony is a genius at doing that,
a genius at it because we've debated

290
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,750
race so many times,
uh,

291
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:11,530
on,
on the show at him and Patrice,

292
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,890
we'd go back and forth and,
and Patrice loved Anthony because he

293
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,460
said Anthony is an adorable racist.
You know,

294
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
Patrice was so funny when he never knew,
never was upset by Anthony's opinions

295
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,900
because Anthony would listen to him and
they would go back and forth.

296
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,140
Half The Times Patrice was right and
half the time anthony was right.

297
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,860
But on twitter,
I think like in that emotion when you're

298
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:30,910
saying x,
Y,

299
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:31,910
and Z,
he,

300
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,610
I don't think he did as good a job as he
should have done of closing those doors

301
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,820
behind him,
almost like sealing off things that

302
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:43,990
people can get to you on because he was
so upset because he had had a physical

303
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,730
assault.
And I know it sounds like I'm talking in

304
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,510
circles and just defending my friend,
but I've been with him for 10 years all

305
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,230
in this medium of totally uncensored.
And I'm telling you,

306
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,390
I know him well enough to know that he's
like,

307
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:58,780
he's got weird things where he'll talk
about race and people misinterpret them

308
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:02,080
and I've talked to him privately and the
guy does not hate black people and I

309
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,180
know that that's just all his friends
defending him.

310
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,700
But I'm telling you that he does not
because I know him well.

311
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,980
And then to hear people going,
he hates black people.

312
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:13,981
It's like he's not afraid of being
misconstrued or interpreted as racist.

313
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:19,390
He's not afraid of it by saying what he
really believes is his opinion about

314
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,780
certain aspects of a group.
Whatever race,

315
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:23,381
uh,
gender,

316
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:26,200
whatever it is,
he's not afraid of speaking his mind

317
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,420
about things because he's got them.
Fuck you money.

318
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,880
That's a big part of it.
And he's got 150,000 guns.

319
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,870
Those are the two things.
And you know,

320
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,300
a big part of it that drove me fucking
crazy is people are not,

321
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,480
they're not taking into account the
reaction that someone has when they get

322
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,730
assaulted.
Because when you get hit by someone,

323
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,290
some fucking stranger that you don't
know,

324
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,890
hits you as.
Especially when you've got a garden,

325
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,890
you've got a fucking bullet

326
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,800
gun,
you've got a thing inside you that has

327
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,560
explosions,
you press a trigger,

328
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,030
explosions propel bullets and they end
lives instantly.

329
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:06,020
And Anthony's an expert with one and he
has it on him at all times and he's

330
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,110
getting hit and he's like,
what the fuck?

331
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,930
And so he gets on my fucking animal con
bitch,

332
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,300
fuck you this back.
You know,

333
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,960
it's getting hit is a very disturbing
thing.

334
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,100
It's,
I mean,

335
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:22,730
there's one thing to get hit and it's
getting hit in a sparring session is

336
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,550
infuriating with people.
You know,

337
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,310
I've seen people go fucking crazy
because they get choked out in a Jujitsu

338
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,040
session,
getting punched his way more traumatic,

339
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,480
getting punched by a stranger multiple
times for taking a fucking photograph.

340
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,420
I don't know what the exchange was
between the two of them.

341
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,890
I don't know if,
if he was saying something that was

342
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:44,170
infuriating,
I don't know.

343
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,380
I wasn't there.
You know,

344
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm not gonna pretend that was there,
but man,

345
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,750
you've got to take into account the
reaction that people have when you hit

346
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,520
them and it to me,
and again,

347
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:57,290
I hate to keep going back to the press,
but they didn't focus on the fact that

348
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,600
he like,
he handled himself properly in that

349
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,370
because I know I would have.
I don't know if I would have pulled the

350
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,260
gun in that moment,
but I'm a panicky pete,

351
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,720
that I would have just what other guys
were coming over.

352
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:09,530
I would have at least brandished it and
he acted physically responsible,

353
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,670
like as a,
as a,

354
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,660
as a fucking guy with a pistol on him
because people get shot all the time for

355
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,330
dumb arguments and dumb things.
He,

356
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,660
he handled himself absolutely right and
lost his cool.

357
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,080
Once he got home and people didn't take
the press,

358
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:24,980
didn't take that into account.

359
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,310
They harped on the fact that he didn't
get a police report and I wished he had.

360
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,270
Now,
in hindsight,

361
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,760
because they're all going,
Mr Colby did I get a police report,

362
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,160
but here's the deal.
Had he gotten a police report,

363
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,620
they would have just ignored it.
They wouldn't have said,

364
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,120
well,
at least he got a police report.

365
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,070
They would have glanced over the fact
and then said,

366
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,390
yeah,
well I can get a police report.

367
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
So they were just using that as a reason
to kind of ignore the fact that he got

368
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,020
hit.
They're like,

369
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,800
we didn't see a police report.
All the press harped on the fact that he

370
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,350
didn't get a police report,
but answer response was,

371
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:52,340
look man,
you know,

372
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,950
I know enough to know that me getting
hit by some lady in Times Square is not

373
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,720
a fucking priority for NYP ed.
Who's worried about terrorists.

374
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,280
Yeah.
Especially if he's fine.

375
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,760
I think there's a real issue also with
with the press,

376
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,190
with a lot of people in the press,
I'll clarify that.

377
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,600
What they're trying to do is they're
trying to close those getsmart doors as

378
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,210
they write a piece as well and as
they're writing a piece,

379
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,310
they are also trying to placate all the
people that are going to be up in arms

380
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,160
about their opinions.
If they could possibly be supporting a

381
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,660
racist,
if they could possibly be taking your

382
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,060
side,
agreeing with him,

383
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:29,990
seeing his point of view,
they can be misinterpreted or they could

384
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,740
be interpreted as being racist as well,
so they have to worry about that as

385
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,320
well.
Especially if you're with a liberal rag.

386
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,270
You know,
if you have a very liberal newspaper

387
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,580
that you work for and they have a clear
agenda,

388
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,530
which a lot of them do.
The Washington Times does,

389
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,510
right.
I'll watch the Washington Post rose.

390
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,070
There's a lot of them that have a
liberal slant and if you are reporting

391
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,980
for them,
you know,

392
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:53,520
and it's something like this that's very
controversial and something where

393
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,020
there's.
There's a bunch of things that

394
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,590
automatically have like a knee jerk
reaction to them and this is one of them

395
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,340
knee jerk reaction to what's conceived
as racist perceived as race.

396
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,230
Yes.
And another thing that they do that's

397
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:08,790
even,
that's even more enraging is what people

398
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:13,080
who write for the press now have to do
is not just reporting what happened.

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,370
It's how do I editorialize under the
guise of being impartial.

400
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,230
And they do that a lot too and that I
don't like either.

401
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,400
It's like that to me is the worst crime
they commit actually if the

402
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,810
editorializing as they're going along.
Like it's legitimate.

403
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:31,050
Like uh,
like NBC and I'm on a Zimmerman Fan.

404
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,650
Either aunt was a big supporter.
Zimmerman,

405
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,980
I thought Zimmerman should have went to
jail for something.

406
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,140
I didn't know what legally I have no
ground to stand on,

407
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,420
but I kind of thought he was a con.
But uh,

408
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,520
but,
but not a guy who was out to commit a

409
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,350
murder either.
I thought there was a line in between,

410
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,750
but whatever,
like NBC edited that tape,

411
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,340
like,
ah,

412
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,610
can't do that.
There's no reason to do that unless

413
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,400
you're pushing something,
but they're doing it under the guise of

414
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:56,040
being impartial and I'm sure they've
done it plenty of times to vilify

415
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,160
blacks.
I'm not saying they have it.

416
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,590
He lost that lawsuit,
you know?

417
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,720
I know he did on.
It's crazy.

418
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,300
It's absolutely nuts.
I don't know why the news has such a

419
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:06,660
different level of what they can get
away with and what they can do because

420
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,120
they're seen as doing a public service.
In my opinion though,

421
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,090
I think they lost it because everybody
was hating that guy and they just didn't

422
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,280
want him to win something on top of
this.

423
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,770
The fact that he still has his freedom.
The kid lost his life.

424
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,510
Right?
I think he's us.

425
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,850
I think he's a sucky fucking security
guard.

426
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:21,684
That's what I think.
Yeah.

427
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,560
I think if you're going to look at that
guy and find fault and what he did,

428
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,830
it's how did he handle the situation and
what a more confident,

429
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,630
competent person have handled it the
same way.

430
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,760
Like here's a perfect example.
My friend,

431
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:34,260
big John Mccarthy who was a cop.

432
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,630
I guarantee you,
you know the referee.

433
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,641
Oh yeah,
yeah,

434
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,490
yeah.
You referenced caught.

435
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,310
That guy was a cop for a long time,
but great guy.

436
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,700
But he knows how to handle shit.
If,

437
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,620
if big John Mccarthy saw that kid
walking in the neighborhood,

438
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,210
he probably would've said,
how you doing man?

439
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,360
Everything cool.
You know,

440
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,050
had a conversation with them.
Everything would've been fine.

441
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,680
Like even if the kid got up in arms or
got mouthy with him,

442
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,140
he would have probably calmed him down,
you know,

443
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,450
without having to get into some physical
altercation.

444
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,270
Not only that,
the kid wouldn't have been able to mount

445
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,760
them and bash his fucking head off the
ground because he's physically

446
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,603
incompetent.
Right?

447
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,850
If you're going to fucking could patrol
a neighborhood,

448
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,040
you can't do it just with a gun.
Can't be.

449
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,580
You can't have the only.
The last resort is your only resort.

450
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,430
You key can't physically defend himself.
He's out of shape.

451
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:21,570
He's soft and doughy and he's not
physically able to hold that guy off,

452
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,930
but yet he's put himself in this
position where he's like a security.

453
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,650
He's the force of the truth of the law.
You can't do that,

454
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:31,050
you know you're not.
You're not qualified for that job.

455
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,390
He's just not.
So when that kids on top of them

456
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,330
bouncing his fucking head off the curb,
look,

457
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,140
I don't see any way out for him other
than using a weapon right when that kid

458
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:43,920
is beating the shit out of him,
but he should have never gotten to that

459
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,130
position.
He shouldn't have.

460
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,470
It should have never escalated to that.
You tell me.

461
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,550
The only way to people can communicate
like that is it comes into violence.

462
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,390
No,
it,

463
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,850
it's how do you deal with it?
How do you communicate?

464
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,420
How did you address this person?
What did you say when he talked back to

465
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,620
you?
What did you say?

466
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,540
What was.
What were the exchange of words?

467
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,673
You know,
when those,

468
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,630
those things.
There's a big difference between.

469
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,640
There's a video that we played the other
day.

470
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,030
What was the.
Do you even lift bro?

471
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,370
You ever see that guy?
The Russian guy?

472
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,263
Is He Russian?

473
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,590
There's even a worse one.
There's practice.

474
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,570
The Pakistani kids though in New York
where the Bronx,

475
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,460
the police chief and Bronx,
New York was like,

476
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,560
stop doing it.
You're going to get killed.

477
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,960
That like these two kids that just go on
youtube and they go up to people in

478
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,050
horrible neighborhoods and are like,
hey man,

479
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,560
you got a problem while he's holding a
calculator and he's just trying to be

480
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,420
funny,
but these guys are just bashing their

481
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,720
heads in and stuff and so the bronx
chief police or something like that

482
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,171
said,
look,

483
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,090
stop it,
but yet these videos more pop.

484
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,630
My point is if you watch those videos,
the guy,

485
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,150
he comes up to people that like look
like your workout and goes,

486
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,740
do you even lift bro?
Look how small you are,

487
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,890
and some people handle it.
Great.

488
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,930
Some people go like,
man,

489
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,670
I don't even don't pull it up.
We don't need to see it.

490
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,990
Some people go,
yeah,

491
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,550
I mean I don't even lift.
You know,

492
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,730
I guess I'm small and then they laugh
and they walk away and some people like

493
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:04,750
threatened them.
Like it depends entirely on how do

494
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:08,950
people interact with each other.
And I think that's what we don't know

495
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,220
about the anthony situation.
That's what we don't know about the

496
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:15,790
Zimmerman situation.
It's not just about what went down,

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,900
it's about how did it all play out,
how could it have been avoided?

498
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,160
There's little subtleties in language
like when Jonah Hill is apologizing

499
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:24,200
recently,
um,

500
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,920
and he's,
he's obviously not a homophobe.

501
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,270
We just got mad and said,
suck my Dick,

502
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,860
faggot.
It was a stupid thing in a moment.

503
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,330
And he's said the tonight show.
And again,

504
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,670
he's just apologizing.
I don't think he never had to deal with

505
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,260
something like this.
And he said something.

506
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:35,790
He goes back,
the intent doesn't matter,

507
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,140
it's the word,
the words.

508
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,491
And it was like,
again,

509
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,490
I know you're on the spot in that moment
and I'm not going to crucify the guy,

510
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,460
but I wish I was there.
So I could just appear on the seat next

511
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,660
to him.
Like in that woody Allen scene,

512
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,800
when the guy walks out to correct a guy
online and go,

513
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,140
no,
the intent is everything.

514
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,920
Because if the words matter the next
time somebody said the fucking giants

515
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,230
killed the jets,
while we better call the police.

516
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,333
Oh,
that's right.

517
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,380
It's the intent.
We understand every,

518
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:01,950
every,
every single interaction or phrase has

519
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:03,240
an intent behind it,
which,

520
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,090
which doesn't always come through in the
written word.

521
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:07,260
It's just,
it's an inflection.

522
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,640
Something that you and I had a
conversation about with the Tracy Morgan

523
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:15,641
situation with people pretending that
what he was saying when he was on stage,

524
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,540
you know,
that he was going to stab a sign of

525
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,410
like his whole act is filled with him
saying ridiculous shit.

526
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,890
Yeah.
This is not a statement.

527
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,170
It's not an affidavit.
He's making court.

528
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,300
You're,
you're taking it out of context because

529
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,890
it's the soft target.
If you do that,

530
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,750
yes,
I'm going to stab my son because he's

531
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:34,430
gay as a statement of fact,
or at the,

532
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:37,900
at the end of a political rally is a
pretty awful thing to say,

533
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,290
but if you've opened up with I'm going
to get you pregnant and I'm going to

534
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,620
mold shit and make a hat out of it.
It's kind of hard to take any one

535
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,670
statement go,
well that's the serious one,

536
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,610
but that's again,
that's that purposely ignoring context

537
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,230
or even when you can't ignore it,
saying,

538
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,330
yeah,
we understand the context.

539
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,800
We don't fucking care.
It's just soft targets.

540
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,560
People find soft targets and those
targets.

541
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,200
Look if they're all ganging up on
anthony too.

542
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,630
That's the other thing.
I'm not saying Boo Hoo Anthony.

543
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,220
Let's pay attention to what's really
going on.

544
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,820
If you're writing an article out of the
blue for no reason about Jim Norton,

545
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,200
you,
you're the only guy.

546
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:12,560
I think Jim Norton is a despicable
person and you write this article,

547
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,410
you have the option to respond to that
and you can go,

548
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:16,580
Whoa,
who are you,

549
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,430
Mr. reporter Dick Wad.
Let's take a look at you,

550
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,680
and then other people can take a look at
him too,

551
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,800
but when everybody's piling on,
it's a free for all.

552
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,400
It's a free ride and then you're there
flailing wildly.

553
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,130
All the Louis Louis ck actually raised a
really good point about that.

554
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:32,180
When something has happened,
he goes,

555
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,110
you know,
you have to remember to.

556
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:36,860
Everybody's not googling you like
everyone is not googling Joe Rogan or

557
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:41,390
Jim Norton or Anthony Cool,
like so you're seeing a every result

558
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,610
about yourself and it appears
overwhelming,

559
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,810
but the reality is like people may be
reading news day or the post or the

560
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,480
Gawker or vice or whatever they're
reading,

561
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,830
but they're not reading every single
article on Anthony Kumiai or on Jim

562
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,500
Norton,
so that's where the overwhelming thing

563
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,370
is sometimes misleading because people
are all reading little snippets of it,

564
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,160
but when the company is getting calls
from again,

565
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:07,970
five or six different outlets to them it
feels overwhelming and like,

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,320
what the fuck do we do with this?

567
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,880
Because this wasn't on the air.
So I think that's where,

568
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,640
and again,
they haven't discussed this with me,

569
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,490
I'm.
I'm purely speculating because to them,

570
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:17,990
if it was on the air,
I'm guessing they would have said,

571
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,480
well that's what he does on the air.
But they're not looking at it like,

572
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,040
well,
he was reacting to being hit.

573
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,360
I think they just were like,
oh,

574
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,610
okay.
We got a fire.

575
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,270
I think that's why they.
They kind of just reacted very quickly.

576
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,310
I think they fuck themselves.
I really do.

577
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,310
They fuck themselves because they were
supposed to be the place where it was

578
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,530
free speech.
This is the wild place,

579
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,620
but where the fibrous w was the virus
channel member now with Sirius Xm talk.

580
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,570
That's it.
Sirius xm talk.

581
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,620
We have to rename it but we don't know
what would they have?

582
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,200
They have to.
They're not asking for my input.

583
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,670
I don't want my name on the show like I
want.

584
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,790
I want to be on the show,
but I don't,

585
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,830
I don't want to be open.
And Jimmy,

586
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:54,890
I don't people to feel like I'm jumping
into Anthony's seat because I'm not.

587
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,390
If they call the OPI show a much more
happy with that because that's what it

588
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,370
was before he met Anthony Columbia.
I would call it.

589
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,810
We Miss Anthony.
Uh,

590
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,700
yeah.
That would be kind of a or Tony will

591
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,280
call it Tony so they don't know who
we're talking to.

592
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,900
Bring where's Tony be sneaky.
But it is a horrible.

593
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,900
And it's like people get mad at me and
opiod and say we don't.

594
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,110
And I tried to say like,
we didn't mad at you for what?

595
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,941
Because the,
they,

596
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:22,040
they people think that we're like a
bunch of teenagers hanging out and like

597
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:25,100
you guys should walk and support and
it's like,

598
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:28,130
first of all,
you dumb mother fuckers that say that

599
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,120
Anthony I've talked to,
he wouldn't walk and he told me you got

600
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,360
to make your money like,
and it's all a and B,

601
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm under contract.

602
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,750
I can't just walk.
I have three more months in the

603
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:41,450
contract.
And opie tried to clear this up on the

604
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:42,620
air.
Like if we just walk out,

605
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,530
if they fire us and we just walk and say
a bunch of more subs leave because they

606
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,161
realize like,
wow,

607
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,310
the show really is gone.
Then all of a sudden serious wants to

608
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,130
take action on us for breach.
It's a whole fucking legal.

609
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,580
People just don't get that part of it.
And they think that we're fucking

610
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,211
anthony.
You know,

611
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:59,130
who doesn't think we're fucking Anthony
Anthony?

612
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,580
He knows we're not fucking.
Only an idiot thinks you're fucking

613
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,090
anthony,
but there's always going to be idiots

614
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,910
with opinions office.
And I'm fine with that when people say

615
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:06,451
like,
dude,

616
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,690
I love you and ob,
but I got to cancel because I'm staying

617
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,430
with Anthony.
I don't get mad at those people.

618
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,550
Or if people like I'm going to keep
serious and I'm also going to listen to

619
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,840
ant.
I don't bog.

620
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,510
I'm fine with that too because I get the
emotion,

621
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,870
like whatever they got to do to support
and is cool with me,

622
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,050
I want them to stay because my,
in my ideal world,

623
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,140
they listen to me and opie and then they
fucking listen to Anthony.

624
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:29,850
There's no competition.
I'm not going to.

625
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,380
We're not like here you don't mention
Anthony.

626
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,150
You don't want to fucking show comes
out.

627
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,070
I'm going to,
I'm going to tweet it because I want him

628
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,990
to succeed because he's one of my
closest friends.

629
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,300
It's gonna succeed.
It's going to.

630
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:40,170
If you,
you know,

631
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,004
just.

632
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,460
He's an entertaining guy.
He's an interesting guy in the platform

633
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:49,461
of the Internet is so free and easy and
he's already got a full professional

634
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,740
setup at his house.
Yeah.

635
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,050
People don't know if you've never seen.
One of the main reasons I started this

636
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:58,170
podcast is because of live from the
compound,

637
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,110
because he said a fucking greenscreen in
his house,

638
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,670
a professional studio,
and he was playing images behind him of

639
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:08,760
like the city of La.
He had a green screen,

640
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:13,761
I mean a beautiful green screen like
professional broadcast quality cameras,

641
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,420
like the whole deal.
I was like,

642
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:19,770
that's amazing and that slowly but
surely led to what you're seeing right

643
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:23,190
here.
Like him doing that while he was already

644
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,940
on Sirius and Sirius tried to stop them
from doing that.

645
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,310
They got it.
They gave him a hard time about that.

646
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,293
Yeah.
Yeah.

647
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,460
That was it.
I think that was a contractual issue too

648
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,091
where they're like,
look,

649
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,780
this is the medium you're on.
But eventually they're like,

650
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,000
they're of like,
let them do it and they're like,

651
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,260
what do you think is going to go down
September when your contract is up

652
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,680
October fourth?
I don't know.

653
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,930
I mean like I love the Gig,
I love performing,

654
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,150
but you love the Gig.
The same with Anthony not being there.

655
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,001
Of course not.
No,

656
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:50,350
no.
I mean,

657
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,170
I mean the idea of performing either
alone or with other people.

658
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,680
I want this thing to work because I want
my own thing.

659
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,850
Like I've done so many things being the
vice thing,

660
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,840
Jim Norton show,
I want to have my own thing too,

661
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,630
because you feel like a more complete
performer when you're not always with

662
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:08,560
Opie and Anthony or Colin Quinn or Louis
Ck or Amy Schumer's put me on her show.

663
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,830
Like I don't always want to be on
somebody else's thing.

664
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,120
Right.
Um,

665
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,450
so I love the idea of performing on the
radio.

666
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,900
I love doing it with Opi.
I love doing it with opie and anthony

667
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:22,150
more because now let's say the same
thing of opiod left.

668
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,320
Like I honestly do love being a part of
that radio show.

669
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,400
Being without anthony is difficult and
it will be with say the same thing.

670
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:34,840
It's just like,
it's hard to realize how much space a

671
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,410
person fills in your life until they're
not there.

672
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,311
Like,
I mean,

673
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,980
we all know Anthony's a comic gene.
That's easy to say,

674
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,830
but it's like the little moments,
like when there's that chair,

675
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,810
I mean I'm,
I'm close.

676
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,060
I said closer to um,
to anthony that I do to you everyday,

677
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,370
five days a week for 10 years and that
was just gone and it's really hard to

678
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:58,480
get used to that empty seat whether he's
saying something funny or whether he's

679
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:02,410
just doing a stupid Iraq joke or a
little aside or just pipe.

680
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,600
It's like this whole fucking vacuum of
this,

681
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,330
this great powerful brain that used to
be,

682
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,470
you know,
a foot away from it.

683
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,150
Yeah.
Or just talking about things.

684
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,790
He's a fascinating guy.
He's got a lot of information in his

685
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,370
head.
He can talk about anything for any

686
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:17,530
length of time,
anything he could be.

687
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:20,260
And we've said that,
like I've said this before,

688
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,400
Patrice said that anthony can access
funny faster than anybody he'd ever

689
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,670
known.
Like he just had the ability to access

690
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,500
being funny immediately on any subject.
Like if you talking like,

691
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,910
you know,
he was a tin knocker.

692
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:38,260
He had put in air conditioning vents and
he can walk you through that in a

693
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:42,550
fascinating way.
And be funny about it and be captivating

694
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,810
with it.
Me,

695
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,910
I just die telling a story.
I lose people in me.

696
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,900
It's a joke I've done,
but I meant the sincerity of it that if

697
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:56,560
I was on nine slash 11 on the,
if I made it out of the first tower,

698
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,420
I would lose people halfway through the
story.

699
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,770
Like I just have no ability to go from
the beginning to the middle to the end

700
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,670
and keep people locked in.
Did you guys have a meeting with serious

701
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,560
after this?
No.

702
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,260
No,
opiates.

703
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,380
We talked to Scott.
I talked to Scott on the phone and he

704
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:11,681
goes,
look,

705
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:14,350
we're going to try to move forward with
you and open and see how it happens.

706
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,780
He goes,
worked through it organically on the

707
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,030
air.
They didn't tell us how to do it.

708
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,910
They didn't say don't bad mouth the
company don't.

709
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,800
He said worked through it organically on
the air and what we'll see what happens.

710
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,610
So I mean see what happens if they
completely closed the idea of anthony

711
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,170
ever coming back.
I don't think so.

712
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:29,930
Um,
and,

713
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,800
and they've given me no indication.
So I'm careful how I say that because I

714
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,100
don't want the fans getting like I'm
putting false hope out there,

715
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,290
but I'm just being truthful is it
doesn't feel final to me and maybe

716
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:46,000
that's my own denial or my own lack of
willingness to admit that this thing

717
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:46,834
could be over.

718
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,230
Like it was really sad,
man.

719
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,790
I last I saw,
I don't think I went to his fucking

720
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,120
fourth of July party and I was very
depressed driving home.

721
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,090
Like I know I'm going to be okay
financially and I know like,

722
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:56,320
Hey,
there's other show could take off.

723
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,340
Hey,
you got stand up.

724
00:31:57,341 --> 00:32:00,160
Hey you got.
But just the idea that this thing you

725
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:03,850
love to do,
like this chapter is closed.

726
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,380
Like just fucking depresses me.
Depresses me to listen to it.

727
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:13,381
I can imagine if it was me every day,
day in day out being a part of it.

728
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,970
Every time I did it,
I loved it.

729
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,010
I mean I had a great time doing your
show.

730
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,470
So my favorite radio show of all time,
without a doubt.

731
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,470
It's a real conversation.
You have real moments and the laugh

732
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:27,280
somebody played for me recently are,
they sent me a link to Jim Norton's

733
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,240
laugh compilation.

734
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
There's just times where people have
made me laugh on the show and I listened

735
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:34,330
to part one and two because the point is
not me laughing.

736
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:37,750
It's the things.
And in most of those laughs I've come

737
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:41,720
from anthony more than any gas or
anybody and some of the things that he

738
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:46,190
did a thing recently or years ago that I
heard two days ago where we were talking

739
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:49,190
about people who have shot themselves in
the head and survived.

740
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,960
And Anthony did the voice of the guy who
survived and he just wanted an

741
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,270
immediate.
He became the guy who had shot himself

742
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,480
in the fucking head in survivors talking
about how he just has a more positive

743
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:07,481
outlook and I'm howling listening to it
in the clip and I'm listening to it.

744
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:08,180
Uh,
uh,

745
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,013
like,
you know,

746
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,600
two days ago.
And I'm laughing all over again.

747
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,280
I'm like,
I forgot that bit ever existed,

748
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:16,040
but God is cocksucker made me fucking
laugh.

749
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,930
And I'm not talking about him like he's
dead.

750
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,200
But I mean that's how valuable a thing
he is.

751
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,330
Like I said,
I can't listen to two radio.

752
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,730
They made a big mistake.
I think they made a bigger stake for

753
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:26,820
them for a

754
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,780
couple reasons.
One,

755
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:31,350
I think they made a big mistake because
I think it's going to open the door more

756
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:35,280
to the Internet because people are going
to look at that as the only last

757
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,720
remaining true free speech option
because that's what it is.

758
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,830
Look,
you can.

759
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,770
You could say you don't like this
podcast.

760
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,010
You can decide that I'm offensive.
You can do it,

761
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,750
but you can't stop it.
I mean you might,

762
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,480
even though the host might say,
we don't want to host you anymore,

763
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,880
I'll find another host.
Those sponsors might say,

764
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,140
we don't want to be your sponsor
anymore.

765
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,960
Well guess what I'll do with no sponsor.
We did it with no sponsors for years.

766
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,200
This is the only real option where
you're your own producer,

767
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:05,880
your own director,
your own.

768
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,520
You're the whole thing.
You're the performer.

769
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:12,270
You're the whole thing.
That's where it's sad because just like

770
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:15,480
a standup is entirely responsible for
your act.

771
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,660
You put on stage,
if you had some producer hovering over

772
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:20,430
your fucking shoulder every time you
wrote a bit,

773
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,980
every time you were thinking about
putting together a set list,

774
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,230
every time you are going up and doing a
show,

775
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,320
they would review it afterwards.
That would be gross.

776
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,570
That would take all the fun out of being
a comic.

777
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,980
Yeah,
it would be awful.

778
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:34,470
I mean that's why I'm a bad collaborator
because you're so used to having

779
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,540
absolute and ultimate control of things.
So you're a perfect example.

780
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,740
Think about you and you as a successful
performer and personality.

781
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,990
Who the fuck would have ever thought you
could have made a mainstream career out

782
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:53,991
of talking about your love of trannies,
talking about shit and Piss and shit and

783
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:56,520
in each other's mouths and peeing on
people.

784
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,640
Monster rain.
Just look at the honest things that

785
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,640
you've tackled because you're honest
because you're funny.

786
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,460
If you had to vet that through somebody
else,

787
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:09,960
if you had to have that filter through
some sort of a mainstream producer,

788
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,500
it would've never happened.
Never work.

789
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,210
You're absolutely right.
I mean,

790
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:18,910
that's why you're right though.
The Internet is the last place where at

791
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,360
least for now,
who the fuck knows what happens with

792
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,800
that,
but all that stuff you did,

793
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:25,050
you did on serious,
serious at a different approach.

794
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:26,230
When they first came out,
they.

795
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,600
They've slowly but surely clamped down
from that Condoleeza Rice incident.

796
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,070
That's where it was like,
Ooh,

797
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,910
you could get in trouble for something
that someone says on a radio show that

798
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,040
isn't even like

799
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,530
a guest.
I mean,

800
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,520
isn't even one of the hosts,
right?

801
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:45,030
He was at your show could get canceled,
a homeless guy and they were going to

802
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,930
fire us.
That Eric Logan sailor that was accent.

803
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,730
It wasn't sure it was,
and this is how.

804
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,350
What happened?
The fucking the NAB National Association

805
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,690
of broadcasters.
Somebody on that side I think was what

806
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,460
was pushing it.
Could the story went on?

807
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,040
Drudge and Breitbart,
will this hurt the merger?

808
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,280
And again,
the guys who ran the this,

809
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,530
when they're about to merge,
will this injure the merger?

810
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,960
And Man,
it was a billion dollars at stake and

811
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:10,050
then it wasn't going to hurt the merger,
but they fucking panicked.

812
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,390
And these are all different people that
are in charge now.

813
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,380
Uh,
but they're like,

814
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,880
well,
uh,

815
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,350
and they don't know how to deal with
stuff.

816
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:19,290
So they get the phone call.
The Guy Nate I think was running at the

817
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,220
tower cupid's Arrow.

818
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,670
What do you think of this thing?
They said a homeless guy said he wants

819
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:26,430
to rape Condoleezza Rice.
And like he,

820
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,350
he's worried about a billion dollar
merger and I'm not defending them

821
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:36,351
suspending us.
But I try to put myself in there like,

822
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,970
and this is a guy I mentioned,
Louis because he's a good,

823
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:44,030
he's a good nonemotional reactor to
things and he'll look at things and go,

824
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,430
well they're just trying to do this.
And like Louis will give you a very

825
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:50,430
logical reason as to why something's
happening.

826
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,541
And it's like,
yeah,

827
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,490
I wish I would've seen that.
I get too angry and emotional and you're

828
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,111
like,
fuck that.

829
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,520
And they're say.
And then I'll go like,

830
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,200
okay,
that's a billion dollar company.

831
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,710
They're not used to this.
And they hear this guy wants to fucking

832
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,060
first lady raped Bush or George Bush and
they're laughing about merger.

833
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:07,810
Might be threatened to fuck,
get rid of him.

834
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,770
And he just panics.
Isn't it fascinating though that you're

835
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,050
talking about a billion dollar company?
Okay.

836
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,500
Sirius xm billion dollar company.
Okay.

837
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,330
What exactly are they selling?
What they're selling is content.

838
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,090
Who delivers that content?
Guys like opie and Anthony,

839
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,780
guys like Jim Norton.
They're selling your ability to be

840
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,640
entertaining.
Other than that,

841
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,050
it's just music.
How you,

842
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,950
how do you have a billion dollar company
that's just selling music?

843
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,970
Well,
I don't.

844
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,970
That's where my argument would be to.
It looked the talk thing is the last,

845
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,460
like the last thing you guys have,
and this is for any evil terrestrial

846
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:47,610
radio to the last thing.
You have his original talk content and

847
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:50,490
their point back would be,
well that's a great thing that we have,

848
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,850
but we also have,
um,

849
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,660
whether it's a celebrity,
people doing shit or we have sports that

850
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:59,550
you can't get across.
Let's say we have the MBA,

851
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:01,620
we have a major league baseball game.
I'm just saying that's what they would

852
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:02,050
say.
Yeah,

853
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,540
but nobody's paying for that.
Let's be honest.

854
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,910
They're paying for stern.
They're paying for Opie and Anthony.

855
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,103
I hope so,
man.

856
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,670
Especially since spotify and Pandora,
they used to be.

857
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:13,850
I like Sirius Radio because they had the
thirties to forties to fifties,

858
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,200
whatever and all the different radio
stations.

859
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,470
Nowadays you just put spotify put
anything you want and as you know.

860
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,480
Yeah,
I mean I.

861
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,710
I get almost all my shit from itunes.
I don't ever listen to music in my car

862
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:25,420
anymore unless it's coming off with my
phone.

863
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,690
I just just,
I don't need to.

864
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,730
You don't need to anymore.
You don't need them anymore.

865
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,830
And the last thing that's exciting is
things like stern and things like

866
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,800
opie and anthony where you can have a
guy who is just freewheeling,

867
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,940
same whatever he wants,
doesn't have to worry about language

868
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,740
restrictions.
Does it have to worry about anything?

869
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,180
And the fact that he can get fired for
saying the same things that he's always

870
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:53,680
said on his show to saying them in a
text message that they're so ignorant

871
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:57,160
that they can't recognize that this is.
You're taking it out of context.

872
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,680
You're taking it from a guy who just
recently been assaulted.

873
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,380
You're taking it from a guy,
probably had a couple of drinks in him

874
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,990
when he said it and he shouldn't have
done it.

875
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,070
He fucked up.
He definitely shouldn't have gone on

876
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:09,130
that twitter rampage.
He should have said it on a video

877
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,570
and you know what podcast or on the show
up on the shelf on the show.

878
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:16,090
It would have been perfect.
It would've been a great episode.

879
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,050
Oh,
that would been fun.

880
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,640
And,
and Keith Robinson pointed out,

881
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:22,870
he's like the teasing.
We could've given him a that teasing

882
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:25,510
beautiful but it.
But I don't know if that's something

883
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:28,210
that will ever change.
Like they may at one point,

884
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,000
we do kind of understand that maybe
he's,

885
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,950
you know,
he's a valuable asset to the like,

886
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:33,491
you know,
again,

887
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:35,170
I don't,
I don't know why I don't get that

888
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,600
feeling because they haven't said to me
we'll bring him back.

889
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,030
They really haven't and I never want to
give fans.

890
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:43,560
I'm not trying to keep fans from who it
literally is just a feeling,

891
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,360
a gut feeling.
He didn't drop any bombs.

892
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:49,960
He didn't go on this and I've talked to
him enough to know what his intent was

893
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,200
and maybe I'm just naive dummy in me,
but I keep thinking,

894
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:54,340
man,
he should come back,

895
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,580
he can come back.
Just give it some time and I just keep

896
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,650
hoping for that.
I think he

897
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,440
can come back.
I think if they gave it some time,

898
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:03,800
he definitely can come back in the
context of what he said wasn't that bad.

899
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,160
You know?
I wouldn't have been happy if it was my

900
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:09,410
company and I had shareholders and all
that jazz,

901
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:11,960
but I obviously I would never be that
guy anyway.

902
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:14,960
I would never be a fucking head of a big
company.

903
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:18,560
I'm just not built for it,
but you got to recognize the

904
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:21,770
entertainment quality,
you know the entertainment aspect of

905
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:23,930
that guy,
the entertainment possibilities of

906
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,340
keeping the show together.
It's his.

907
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,020
Without that all,
you have a stern,

908
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,660
you know,
obviously you guys are still together

909
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:34,661
and they'll still be a great show,
but it's not the same show and you leave

910
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:37,130
open the door for anthony starting his
own thing,

911
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:39,110
some wildly successful thing on the
Internet,

912
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,290
which also look,
if someone comes along and they put

913
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:44,720
together some sort of an advertising
budget and they say,

914
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:46,780
hey listen,
we would like to do the top.

915
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,970
We'd like to host the opiod.
Anthony podcasts on the Internet will

916
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:52,730
take x percentage of the.
The advertisers.

917
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,490
We've already got it lined up.
We have a big launch.

918
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:56,990
We're going to do it around
thanksgiving.

919
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,480
Someone's going to fuck a Turkey.
Live on the air,

920
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,231
you know,
whatever.

921
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,580
You know what I'm saying?
You start,

922
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,920
you start doing.
You come up with some idea to do

923
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:07,070
something completely free and wild on
the Internet.

924
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:09,740
A big advertising push,
buy billboards,

925
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,240
Time Square,
you know,

926
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:13,430
fuck serious.
We're doing it on the Internet,

927
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,300
you know ONA is back and it's free.
Downloaded online.

928
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,160
You don't need to pay for a subscription
anymore.

929
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,260
Anybody can get it on your phone.
I mean you could do it.

930
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,094
The way we do it,
we're,

931
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,470
we're available on were were available
online as an MP.

932
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:28,460
Three were available from itunes.
We're available on Stitcher,

933
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,220
on Youtube,
on Ustream,

934
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,063
on Vimeo.

935
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,900
If you just did something like that,
it would be.

936
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,060
Yeah,
maybe you're right,

937
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,490
man.
Who we have thought about it and again,

938
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:40,070
we're up in October fourth,
we don't know.

939
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,390
We honestly don't know what we do from
here.

940
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,900
Like again,
opiod,

941
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I are doing the shell,
bringing guests in and just performing

942
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,000
and it's like we both feel the fucking
last go through.

943
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,670
Vice do it all through vice.
There'll be a wonderful promotion

944
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:59,690
vehicle to for guys to do.
Opie and Anthony Live through vice.

945
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,930
They'll set you up with a studio.
Do it all online,

946
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,690
do the show as a video online and
through the show.

947
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,570
Have it available as a podcast.
Free downloads.

948
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,810
They provide you with advertisers.
Wouldn't be hard to do.

949
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,180
Shane could hook that up in five
seconds.

950
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,130
They can make one phone call and it
would be.

951
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,160
The wheels would be in motion.
I would,

952
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,003
I would,
uh,

953
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,040
I would love to do that.
And that's a guy that you,

954
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,750
you know,
like she could get really crazy and

955
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,830
everyone's going to be fine.
