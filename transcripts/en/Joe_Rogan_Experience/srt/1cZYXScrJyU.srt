1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,530
One fucking kids today,
fucking kids today.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,560
Fucking kids.
Hasn't.

3
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,090
Everybody said that from the beginning 
of the time.

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,580
I Bet k people were saying that shit.
You know,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,810
it's just,
it is what it is,

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,570
right?
Every new group comes up,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,850
they try to reestablish themselves a 
smarter,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,550
you know,
this new group coming up,

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,720
they're going to change the rules.
I don't know what's so wrong with how we

10
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,150
turned out,
you know?

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,170
I mean like not from a like I mean 
every.

12
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,240
I think every generation is better than 
the next in terms of how things.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,550
This is the best times I've ever been 
for most people.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,403
Right.
But I'm saying from like a how we 

15
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,380
handled things,
perspective things seem.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm like a fine human being.
You seem like a fine,

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,120
like most human beings are fine and we 
were raised quite,

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,333
I don't wanna say differently but a 
little better in my perspective than 

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,280
what's happening now.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,113
Like what,
what does being corrected is strange to 

21
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,840
me.
To people that don't know the story.

22
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,110
Let's fill them in on your story and how
we got together.

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,540
So you're doing a Gig.
You're at Columbia,

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,920
so a few months ago,
uh,

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,863
I got this group called Asian American 
Alliance at Columbia University hit me 

26
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,040
up saying,
hey,

27
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,050
you know,
we're big fans of your work.

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,943
Um,
I was the first Indian ever write for 

29
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,654
snl and so they were like,
that was a story in the Asian American 

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,733
Indian community.
And so they hit me up in like may or 

31
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:36,781
June,
like,

32
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:37,311
hey,
come,

33
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,930
we have the show in November.
It's called culture shock.

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,560
It's a big like fashion culture kind 
event.

35
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,530
And I've done like tons of these before,
you know,

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,423
because my sister and I,
we both went down or you bought my 

37
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,824
sister.
I'm like help put on these kinds of 

38
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,034
shows.
So I would attend them and like I've 

39
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,090
seen them ever since high school because
I went to high school in Parsippany,

40
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,924
New Jersey,
which is like a hyper diverse kind of 

41
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,490
place at least with like Asians and 
Indian people.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,073
And like I went to a few in high school,
I got laid after one of them when I was 

43
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,700
in high school.
So they had like a,

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,193
I lost my virginity.
So like it was like they held a special 

45
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,850
place in my heart and so like I went 
thinking,

46
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,460
okay,
this is going to be fun and,

47
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,480
and they know who they're getting in 
that,

48
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,363
you know,
the email said that we're fans of your 

49
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,360
work,
like we want you to come do the show.

50
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,270
It's about like representing Asian 
identities and all that.

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,670
I'm like dope.
And that's,

52
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,050
I get there at like 7:30
and I walk in and I'm like okay,

53
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,080
I know all these kids.
I mean there are like 20 or something.

54
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,610
But like I know that I grew up with 
these kids,

55
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,444
you know,
like Abigail's and critiques or 

56
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:37,974
whatever.
Like I know these guys and immediately 

57
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,790
my comic hat turns on.

58
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,950
I'm like okay,
the show itself,

59
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,784
the energy is dope.
But the show like acoustically I'm 

60
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,660
looking okay,
there's a high ceiling,

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,890
the lighting shit,
it's not set up for like a comedy event,

62
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,250
but I still think okay,
this is gonna go well eight,

63
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,450
38,
45.

64
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,284
I get on stage and I'm like I do some 
Columbia stuff because I went to 

65
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
Columbia for like a summer program.
I started making fun of the kids a bit 

66
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,293
and say,
do I have to give like a trigger 

67
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,280
warning?
Almost like joking,

68
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
like,
do I have to give a trigger warning 

69
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,970
because I know,
you know,

70
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,520
that's a thing.
And I say like,

71
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,390
be careful some of this might be sexist,
some of this might be racist,

72
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,110
uh,
you know,

73
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,980
just buckle up and one girl booze.
And I'm like,

74
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,910
they're booing already.
It's like two minutes in.

75
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,750
And I'm like,
well look,

76
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,170
this is the.

77
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,990
I literally said I just listened to the 
set but on the way here.

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,370
And I said,
uh,

79
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,020
well buckle up,
you know,

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,790
cause this is the real world or 
whatever.

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,140
And then I go into material and about.
And it's going,

82
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,540
well,
this is one story I want to dispel.

83
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,170
Like,
uh,

84
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,010
I will fully own a bomb if I'm bombing.
I know I'm bombing.

85
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,050
I will tell you that bombed before a 
billion times.

86
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,780
I'm doing fine.
Sixty,

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,030
70 percent of the set,
17 minutes in.

88
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,390
I tell the joke where I say I'm 
effectively.

89
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't think being gay is a choice,
which is,

90
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,700
I don't think it is at all.
Uh,

91
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,723
but this is how you know,
because there's gay black people and no 

92
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,620
one's going to choose to be gay if 
they're already black.

93
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,480
Right?
No one's doubling down on hardship.

94
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,561
That's fun,
Joe.

95
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,240
Thank you.

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,170
No one.
No one's a funny joke.

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,033
Thank you.
No one like no black dude ever wakes up 

98
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,771
and thinks,
you know what?

99
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,710
This black shit to wheezy.
I'm going to put on a Madonna Halter top

100
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,410
and some Jordans and tell an Indian dude
how to live his life.

101
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,270
That's not a choice.
That's new born that way.

102
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,170
And that it bombs like this.
Silence.

103
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,063
Really complete silence.
And then I say you're exactly who I 

104
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,310
expected to be as a crowd.
And then I say,

105
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,830
uh,
I'm the only person that chooses.

106
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:40,360
This is also what wasn't printed.
That the offensive part to me.

107
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,194
What I think is offensive.
The next part where I say the only 

108
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:46,390
person that chooses whether or not to be
gay in a daily basis is mike pence.

109
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,430
Right?
We can all agree that like,

110
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,264
I don't know if he's getting that,
but no man hates homosexuals that much 

111
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,474
if he himself is not a homosexual,
he chooses not to be gay everyday and 

112
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,710
that gets some laughs and applause.

113
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,461
And I'm like,
okay,

114
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,990
cool.
And then,

115
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,640
uh,
get back into it.

116
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm rolling for about another two or 
three minutes.

117
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,903
Um,
I started talking to some do a joke 

118
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:09,430
about how my dad landed in Newark when 
he immigrated to America.

119
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,264
Some girls from Newark,
she interrupts as todd talking for like 

120
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,890
two minutes and that goes terribly.
It's just like I'm trying to,

121
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,873
I've gone fishing with her,
just trying to see if I can get back 

122
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,580
into it.
She interrupting,

123
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,763
I say I heckling or is she,
I say I say a joke where I send my dad 

124
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,510
left,
landed in Newark back when he landed,

125
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,040
it was called brick city because if you 
hit,

126
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,840
if you looked at someone wrong,
they'd hit you with a brick.

127
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,420
Right.
Find kind of throwaway line.

128
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,130
This girl goes,
that's not true.

129
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,930
I'm like,
well,

130
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,220
yeah.
I'm like,

131
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,050
obviously I'm just kidding.

132
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,390
Uh,
but like I know where she's,

133
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,253
what she's trying to do,
I'm just trying to talk to her and I'm 

134
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,850
going to talk about like trying to get 
back into material.

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,393
Um,
and that's like probably a minute 20 or 

136
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,810
something and then added my corner of my
left eye.

137
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:58,430
I see the three girls that invited me to
do the show initially in May or June,

138
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,100
like gather and like that's kind of 
strange.

139
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:01,934
I still talk to this girl for like 
another 30 seconds and then as I'm 

140
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:04,994
concluding my talking to her because I 
realized that's not going to go 

141
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,294
anywhere.
They come on stage with microphones in 

142
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,240
like one trench coat and they're just 
like,

143
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,703
I feel like it's time.
It's literally to say there's been a 

144
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,230
change.
Thank you.

145
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,610
To Mesh has been a change in program.
Um,

146
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,503
you know,
we've received from comments from 

147
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,000
members,
um,

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,913
you know,
uh,

149
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,320
we think that's enough.

150
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,280
How long had you been on stage for a 20 
something minutes at this point.

151
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,790
And it was one joke that did it.
So I go,

152
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,690
I'm like,
I'm first,

153
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,520
I'm like,
I'm,

154
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,870
I'm not even mad at this point.
I'm just like in shock.

155
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,704
I'm like,
this is like guy episode of impractical 

156
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,601
jokers.
Islam just like,

157
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,680
what is,
what are you talking about?

158
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,681
I have to have 45 minutes left gum 
slated to do an hour and like really?

159
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,070
Really?
And they say yeah,

160
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,580
there's been comments like people are 
upset or offended and I'm like,

161
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,280
I feel like we're having a good time and
have some of the crowd cheers.

162
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,773
And then I'm like,
why do I gotta go and one of the girls 

163
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:56,684
goes,
the tech has to leave and I look at the 

164
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,470
tech has,
this is all on youtube.

165
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,330
Like someone put the Youtube video out 
of this particular part and I go,

166
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,850
they better be leaving because I could 
see,

167
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,110
I could see the tech people.

168
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,250
I'm looking at him like,
you gotTa Bounce Dude and tech people,

169
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,340
meaning the people that are coordinating
the electronics,

170
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,140
the tech cast to show exactly whoever's 
running need tech.

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,820
I'm fucking pyrolosis microphones on.
What do you mean the tech has to go?

172
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Tech people have to coming up with lies.
Yeah,

173
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,743
I mean I understand why she lied because
she's trying to save face and not try 

174
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,590
it.
I guess not to embarrass me or whatever,

175
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,424
but I'm like,
I'm not going to believe that shit that 

176
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,980
all three you came out,
they'd be like,

177
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,990
the tech has.
And then I go,

178
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,913
um,
is it because the tech has to leave or 

179
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
because I'm saying some things that made
people uncomfortable and one of the 

180
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,980
other girls goes,
uh,

181
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,823
there's,
we think there's a distinction between 

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,670
being uncomfortable and being 
disrespectful.

183
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,940
And I'm like,
don't use your big words.

184
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,760
But,
but in my brain I'm like,

185
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,623
what?
Why?

186
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,270
What are you talking about?
Like,

187
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,350
I don't think I've been disrespectful at
all.

188
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,590
Then there are some people who are like,
what the fuck is going on?

189
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,270
Majority of people are like,
what the fuck is going on?

190
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,463
And,
but like there's a pocket of the crowd 

191
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,230
were the three,
uh,

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,060
Asian American alliance leaders and like
the rest of the crew was like waiting.

193
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:20,894
And I think some of them cheer when 
they'll make the distinction between 

194
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,040
disrespectful being uncomfortable.
I'm like,

195
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
what do you hadn't been disrespectful in
the slightest?

196
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,990
What are you talking about?
And then one girl goes,

197
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,660
we think you're not entitled to be 
making some of the jokes you're making.

198
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,900
And I'm like,
I'm like my,

199
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,880
my trigger words entitled,
you know,

200
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,460
like I'm,
I'm thinking at this point,

201
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm like,
I'm too almost in shock,

202
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,920
deer in headlights,
kind of like even processed anger.

203
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,753
I'm just like,
now I'm just trying to assess what 

204
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,540
they're specifically saying.
Like which joke specifically.

205
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,000
And they're like,
we think that gay and black joke,

206
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm a is particularly offensive or 
whatever.

207
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,800
And I'm like,
and then at this point I'm like,

208
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,980
instead of explaining that the joke is 
quite progressive,

209
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,533
I'm like,
I literally got that job from an 

210
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,490
audience member at stand up New York in 
like 2011.

211
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,324
Like I remember the conversation 
distinctly because it was such like one 

212
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,870
of these sort of,
oh shit,

213
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,530
that's a good bit moment.
Right?

214
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,830
And I tell them that and they were like,
you're talking to a guy in the crowd.

215
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,410
So I was onstage and I used to live in 
Hell's kitchen.

216
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,283
I'm in New York and I'm in like the,
there's like a gay black constituency 

217
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,090
that would always make fun of me when I 
was leaving my apartment,

218
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,060
but like,
like ribbing me,

219
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:31,540
you know what I mean?

220
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,030
Right.
And so like I'm,

221
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,500
I'm trying to talk about that on stage 
at stand up New York during like a check

222
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,353
spot or whatever and I'm talking to the 
crowd and then there's was a gay black 

223
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,694
guy that like heckled me and I started 
talking to him and then at some point 

224
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm like,
this is how,

225
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,040
you know,
being gay can be a choice.

226
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,730
Right?
And He's,

227
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,750
he starts dying and we have like a good 
rapport.

228
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,610
And I'm like,
oh perfect,

229
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:52,640
this is a great bit.
I just got it.

230
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,470
And so I tell them that and they're 
like,

231
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:55,981
no,
you know,

232
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,660
there's been a change for you,
like you have to go.

233
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,460
And I'm like,
effectively,

234
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,150
I'm like,
you're wrong for doing what you're doing

235
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:03,984
right now.
I'm,

236
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,843
I'm,
I'm,

237
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,723
I'm a generation older than you guys.
I know comedy better than anybody in 

238
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:09,660
this room for.

239
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,490
That's for God damn sure.
And I know disrespect and I,

240
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,403
I've been through a lot of shit,
like I know that what I'm saying right 

241
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:16,554
now hasn't been offensive in the 
slightest and I say you can't isolate 

242
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,110
yourself from the real world.
Like what are you going to do when,

243
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,290
when some real bad shit happens in the 
world,

244
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,120
like if someone actually does something 
that's offensive,

245
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,970
you can't handle things this way.
If you silence someone that's not,

246
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,750
that's not progress or whatever.
And then they asked me if I have closing

247
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:41,751
remarks,
you have closing remarks as prepared.

248
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:42,684
So those are hard to come up with 
closing remarks out of nowhere on the 

249
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:45,990
spot.
I tried to save it.

250
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,710
I tried to save it with a bit,
you know,

251
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,490
and it fucking bonds.
I'm like hi.

252
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,990
And just unlike still talking and then 
they cut my mic and I'm like,

253
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,660
really?

254
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm like,
really?

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,520
Really?
You cut my uh,

256
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,510
and then I'm like,
alright,

257
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,980
thank you.
Well put the mic down and bounce.

258
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,723
And then they try to,
they won't even let me talk to them 

259
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,050
backstage like one one members,
we got to escort you out.

260
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,410
I'm like,
you guys caught me,

261
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,770
I'm six foot one Indian dude.
Like I don't need escort from you.

262
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,170
Tiny person.
Like I'll be fine.

263
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm not here to fight anybody even 
though I was,

264
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,494
this is just not the movie the escorting
you out because they want to kick you 

265
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,490
out or are they worried about your 
safety?

266
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:26,940
Like,
no,

267
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,010
they want to escort me out because they 
want to take me out.

268
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,491
Right,
right,

269
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:30,324
right.
And so I go to where I have a camera 

270
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:34,164
crew there because I'm trying to film 
every hour that I do and I go to them 

271
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,740
and I'm like,
what the what?

272
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,980
Just if you watched the youtube clip,
I'm like onstage,

273
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,630
like,
look at them.

274
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,720
I go to them,
I'm like,

275
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,300
and then some of the members from the 
alliance try to,

276
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,070
uh,
talk to me.

277
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,410
I'm like,
we're so sorry that that happened.

278
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,530
Like,
you know,

279
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,780
that's not all of us are.
We don't know what just happened.

280
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,043
And I'm in my head,
I'm like thinking so much for the 

281
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,130
alliance part of this whole thing,
right?

282
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,020
Like I thought we were saying people on 
Flesh,

283
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,854
if we come from the same place.
So there's no other jokes they found 

284
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,400
offensive.
That was the only one.

285
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,960
That's what they said.
There's,

286
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,853
there's,
there's like two or three things that 

287
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,314
said like,
um,

288
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,690
articles which I made the mistake of 
just reading everything.

289
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,524
Like don't ever do that now fucking just
what I read everything and I like this 

290
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,300
two or three articles that say like I 
was badgering,

291
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,260
uh,
two people in the crowd and there's like

292
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,103
one girl who like maybe two or three 
minutes and like I talked to her for 

293
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:28,780
crowd work.

294
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,613
Like I asked where she's from,
but she's doing whatever and that she 

295
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,680
grew up,
she gets up,

296
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,140
like she stands in,
like shows herself off to the crowd.

297
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:38,020
I make fun of her for a little bit.
And then this other girl,

298
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,450
the one,
the newer chick that is like,

299
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,063
we get personal because she reveals her 
father is not in her life with the 

300
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,480
conversation just gets awkward.
It's not.

301
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,190
She revealed that her father is not in 
her.

302
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,113
I'm like,
she was,

303
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,510
I'm talking about.
I'm talking to her like a,

304
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,040
um,
I was like,

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,660
what is,
what do your parents do or whatever,

306
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
and she's like,
oh.

307
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,420
She's like,
I don't know what my dad does.

308
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,283
Like,
what do you mean?

309
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,921
He's like,
oh,

310
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,730
I don't know him.
I'm like,

311
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,460
Oh,
you,

312
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,220
you don't,
he's not in your life or whatever.

313
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,090
He doesn't.
And she was like,

314
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,630
yeah.

315
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,740
I was like,
okay,

316
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:09,220
I can sense that she's uncomfortable now
to the point where I asked her,

317
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,210
I was like,
are you uncomfortable?

318
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:10,931
And she said,
no.

319
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,351
I'm like,
okay,

320
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,000
cool,
because I can make this worse.

321
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,070
And then like,
but I won't,

322
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,750
you seem like a nice person.
That's when they came out.

323
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,550
But the people are apologizing to me and
I'm like,

324
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,310
I'm now on mad now.
I'm like,

325
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,380
once I leave the stage,
I'm now I'm livid.

326
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,170
But um,
I know myself well enough to be like,

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,033
I'm not going to talk to anybody if I'm 
angry because I'll just say some wild 

328
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,214
shit.
Like I don't.

329
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,800
I felt I have bill bird Philadelphia at 
a whole thing.

330
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,663
You know what I mean?
This just went off on all these people 

331
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,550
for like 10 minutes,
but what the fuck is wrong with that?

332
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,830
But I just went,
I was like,

333
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,120
I gotta go,
like I'm,

334
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:43,954
I'm out and took my crew and we just,
we just walked straight out of this 

335
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:51,781
fucking giant hall and,
and then like I'm waiting for my car and

336
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,150
people from the show or like,
like apologizing,

337
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,760
not just audience members know yet.

338
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,900
We're so sorry that was fucked up.
That shouldn't have happened.

339
00:13:58,901 --> 00:13:59,830
You were doing great.
Whatever.

340
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,150
And then like,
uh,

341
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,720
I get in my uber to my next show after 
this I have to do another hour,

342
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,290
another show.
And where are you going next?

343
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,180
Ucb East in lower east side from 
Columbia to lower.

344
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,030
It's like a 30,
40 minute ride and we hop in the car and

345
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,960
like,
I'm like,

346
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,160
first of text,
my agent,

347
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm like,
this just happened.

348
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,150
And he's like,
do not say shit until you get paid.

349
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:26,530
I'm like,
that's probably the right move.

350
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,933
Uh,
because I'm about to just fucking 

351
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,720
instagram something.
Like that's a real agent.

352
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,180
These tech,
it was just,

353
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,770
do not say shit until you get paid.
I'm like,

354
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:39,604
you're right man.
And I'm just like in my head like mad 

355
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,640
listening to like drake,
just like a guy lead enemies.

356
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,803
Just like fucking everything that I 
think is wrong that we hear as a 

357
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,640
narrative of like kids have solved all 
this kind of shit is playing.

358
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,191
I'm like,
yes,

359
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,024
that's what it is like.
And I'm thankful that my crew was there 

360
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,234
because I'm to,
I'm venting to them because if they 

361
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,600
weren't there I'd be on some other shit.
And.

362
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,920
But as I'm checking my instagram because
I'm like,

363
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,610
this is definitely going to be a fucking
story on instagram at the very least.

364
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,820
I'm like,
people are deeming me from the show.

365
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,201
Like,
Yo,

366
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,340
we're so sorry that that happened.
That's so fucked up.

367
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,620
People that email me the same shit.
I'm like,

368
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,463
was anybody saying fuck you?
You shouldn't have been there in the 

369
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:21,560
first place.
No,

370
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,640
no one said that to me at a one girl who
was the suite may have uh,

371
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,200
uh,
uh,

372
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,034
one of the organizers,
dme and just like yelled at me 

373
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,930
basically.

374
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,763
I just,
I've ever,

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
I wrote to her,
thank you for your support,

376
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,281
like,
you know,

377
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:39,281
just like that she say she said on the 
finding do my dms just blew up a is this

378
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,730
twitter,
instagram,

379
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,653
instagram,
and she was my instagram's not a like a 

380
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,440
wet from my phone,
but she was effective from your phone.

381
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,820
I check it in the morning and I deleted 
an APP,

382
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,290
check it at night and then I deleted it 
again.

383
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,153
Real.
I just fucking hate saw when I was at 

384
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,420
snl I worked on update.
Um,

385
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,313
and so like I was constantly on my phone
or on twitter on is just like checking 

386
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,521
news,
reading shit.

387
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,250
And like,
it,

388
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,140
it annoyed the shit out of me.
I hate the news.

389
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,120
Lo and behold,
I am the news now for a bit,

390
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,130
but like I fucking,
I hate the news.

391
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:13,964
It's all bullshit.

392
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,163
And like being in this cycle has 
confirmed my belief that it's all 

393
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:21,080
fucking nonsense,
but she effectively says,

394
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,440
uh,
I hope you learned your lesson of um,

395
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,930
a respecting what you were hired to do 
and respecting strong young women.

396
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,790
Uh,
check your fucking ego.

397
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,390
And I was just saying I was,
I was like,

398
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,550
it took all of me not just be like,
just a visceral hate because I'm like,

399
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,230
I'm good with what,
I'm not good a lot of things,

400
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,064
but I can,
I can eviscerate somebody's in the 

401
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,280
instagram DM.
Um,

402
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,173
and so I didn't,
I didn't say Shit to her besides thank 

403
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,334
you for support,
but I have all these people are 

404
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,130
messaging me like,
Yo,

405
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,840
we're so sorry that fucking happened.
And like,

406
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,160
I'm like,
all right,

407
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,713
I'm not totally fucked with all these 
kids and I go to this show at ucb east 

408
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,603
and like I'm taping the hours an hour so
I can't even process of what just 

409
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:06,344
happened because my instinct is just 
talk about this immediately but I can't 

410
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,630
because I have to tape this hour.

411
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,010
And so I get off stage and the hour goes
well.

412
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,083
And as I'm leaving ucb east three kids 
that were at the show at Columbia had 

413
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,264
come down from Columbia and followed me 
to ucb east and they came up to me and 

414
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,070
apologize in person.
They're like,

415
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,120
we're so sorry.
That happened.

416
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:29,954
Like we loved your set,
like we don't know what the fuck is 

417
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,990
going on.
And that took me,

418
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,720
that gave me like a beat to be like,
alright,

419
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,820
you know,
like maybe,

420
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,450
maybe everyone isn't this way.
Maybe it's just the people that have the

421
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,284
fucking bull horn that get to just say 
whatever the fuck they want and silence 

422
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,480
people that are like the minority,
but they're like the,

423
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,053
the vocal minority.
Whereas like all these people that are 

424
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:54,900
like actually on my squad are not as 
vocal as they can be.

425
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,750
They're more like quiet and apologize 
and person.

426
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,840
And so the next day,
um,

427
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,340
I,
I don't think anything about it,

428
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,280
but like the Columbia newspaper hits me 
up.

429
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,530
Like I got off,
I leave Columbia at 9:30,

430
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,690
the Colombian newspaper hits me up at 
10.

431
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,620
Oh,
5:00

432
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,431
PM.
Like,

433
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,270
Hey,
do you have any comment?

434
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,860
Like,
comment,

435
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,020
I'm hungry it,
how's that for a comment?

436
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:16,854
Like,
well,

437
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,713
I'm not going to talk to you right now.
Let me fucking process what's going on 

438
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,530
the next day.
I'm still thinking about it,

439
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,470
but I'm going down to open for Aziz in 
Atlantic city.

440
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,873
And uh,
open for him and I'm telling this story 

441
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,223
and he,
he immediately hits on the fact that 

442
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,710
it's crazy that these kids came up to 
you and apologize and I'm like,

443
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,600
I didn't even think about how insane 
that is because I'm still mad,

444
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,760
but I'm thinking I'm talking to these 
kids,

445
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:45,594
like I'm talking to disease and just 
like that is kind of crazy because it's 

446
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:52,170
so easy to buy into the shit that 
everyone's a fucking soft motherfucker.

447
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,813
And then I think about it some more and 
that I think about like all the gigs 

448
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,000
I've done college wise before,
like in the past year I've been lucky to

449
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:03,570
know I did like Texas.
I did a school in Alaska,

450
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,250
a school in Ohio to school in Maryland 
and I said much more offensive shit like

451
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:12,960
anti trump shit in the fucking red list 
of states and it's all been fine,

452
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,153
you know,
like I've never been kicked off stage 

453
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,590
before.
And so to me,

454
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,424
like this Columbia incident,
even the students there seemed like the 

455
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,070
exception rather than the rule you'll

456
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,650
have,
like everyone's a soft person,

457
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,300
you know what I mean?
Does that make sense?

458
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,313
It does make sense,
but what I think is is young kids in 

459
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,530
particular that are in a position of 
power,

460
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:36,730
right?
They're running something.

461
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,020
They have this idea of how people should
behave that they want in their head,

462
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,110
and when you don't fit that mold,
then they just decided to be outraged.

463
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah.
That's what happened here.

464
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,470
You look at the context of what you 
said.

465
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,450
First of all,
you're a comedian,

466
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,790
right?
You're obviously a guy would jokes about

467
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,331
shit.
Right?

468
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:56,164
So that's not a.
you're not saying anything negative 

469
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:02,590
about black people or gay people.
You're essentially admitting that it's a

470
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:04,240
hardship.
I mean,

471
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,643
we all agreed that black people 
experience racism and gay people 

472
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,710
experience homophobia.
Everybody agrees that.

473
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,603
Yeah.
So that makes perfect sense and it's 

474
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,510
funny.
Thank you man.

475
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:14,850
It's,
it's,

476
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,920
it's stupid.
What they're doing is stupid.

477
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,240
It's like,
but that's normal,

478
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,021
man.
Dude,

479
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:20,854
that's been going on forever.
I stopped doing colleges a long time 

480
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,270
ago,
like the early two thousands.

481
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,040
I did a college in Florida and I 
remember thinking these,

482
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,570
they don't know enough,
like this is not fun.

483
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,580
The only reason why I would do this for 
money,

484
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:36,850
because college is paid a lot of money,
but they don't know enough there.

485
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,310
I mean they should if they,
if they're 18 year old kids and then get

486
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:44,230
into a club that has an 18 year old,
a limit where you can get in at 18,

487
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,980
they should do that and then there'll be
with other 30 olds and

488
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,130
people with life experience.
I don't want to.

489
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,510
I don't want to perform at the whim of 
children and that's what these are.

490
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:00,580
These are children who are engaging in 
recreational outrage.

491
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,870
They're deciding to be outraged.
Yeah,

492
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:03,730
that's it.
You know,

493
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,490
it felt like with,
with them particularly,

494
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,790
it felt like,
like I grew up fine.

495
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,080
I grew,
I didn't grow up rich,

496
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:11,914
but my parents had some money for a bit 
before things went north or average 

497
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:15,484
middle class people.
But like to me it's like I've been 

498
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:23,230
through some life and so I know when 
people who haven't been through life get

499
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,064
upset about shit,
it's always like the thing with Texas 

500
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,574
and Ohio and Alaska is like,
these are like the kids of blue collar 

501
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,044
people,
the people who have been through some 

502
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,660
shit and maybe not even just blue 
collar,

503
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,570
but people who have been through some 
kind of life where life experience,

504
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,920
where they know that things aren't just 
like words can hurt,

505
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,110
but for the most part they're fine.

506
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,500
It's like when like your fucking dad 
loses his job.

507
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,280
Well,
it's also,

508
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,870
it's the intent of what you're trying to
do.

509
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,010
Yeah.
Like what are you trying to do?

510
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:51,844
You're trying to get laughs.
You're telling jokes and trying to get 

511
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,330
laughs.
That's what you're hired to do.

512
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,193
Yeah.
They take the context of people forget 

513
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,080
that comedian is a job that like I'm 
here.

514
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,230
Like it's not who I am as a human being 
necessarily.

515
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,110
I'm,
I will over funny first.

516
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,910
Oh yeah.
Funny over everything.

517
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,903
Oh,
well you're a fucking New York City 

518
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,540
comedian.
You have to write.

519
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,790
It's just the only way it works.
It's so,

520
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,340
it's so crazy what people,
I think,

521
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't know if kids have changed or 
whatever.

522
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:21,370
No,
no,

523
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,203
they haven't changed.
They just think that this is the thing 

524
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,334
to do.
Now.

525
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,353
Look,
when I was in,

526
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,360
when I was doing college is way back in 
the day.

527
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,830
I was in my twenties.
I did a college in Connecticut and right

528
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,770
after I did their college I,
I was talking to the kids.

529
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,730
I would do,
I would do my set and then uh,

530
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,490
I would like open up for q and a.
yeah,

531
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,520
fuck's going on my throat.
But it was um,

532
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,240
I was probably 24,
25,

533
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:53,500
maybe,
maybe 25 at the oldest.

534
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,330
So I was just a couple of years older 
than them.

535
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,603
And so it was fun for me to talk to them
about what life is like when you 

536
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,560
actually have to pay your own bills and 
you're out,

537
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,140
you're out free in.
Some guy goes,

538
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,160
uh,
you know,

539
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,073
you got like,
I was doing the question thing and some 

540
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,970
guy goes,
uh,

541
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,070
I go,
you know,

542
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,170
I,
I lift his hand to tell a joke.

543
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,890
I go tell a joke and I go to Jews,
walk into a bar,

544
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,173
they buy it.

545
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,520
It's an old fucking street joke.
Yeah.

546
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,960
Street joke after the show,
you know,

547
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,620
the show goes great.
I'd say thank you.

548
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,560
I really appreciate you guys coming out.
It was really a lot of fun.

549
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,423
Thank you.
Goodnight.

550
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,383
So afterwards I would always hang around
and say hi to people and there was no 

551
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,640
picture taken back then because you have
to have an actual camera.

552
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,380
They had a fucking castle.
It was a long time,

553
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,660
long time ago.
I'm 51,

554
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:43,750
so this is a 90,
91,

555
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,200
92,
somewhere around that.

556
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,173
So this one guy comes up to me,
goes the joke he said about Jewish 

557
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,420
people's very offensive.
I thought he was joking,

558
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,770
I go,
are you serious?

559
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,843
And he was very offensive and he's 
nervous and shit and like has a hard 

560
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,880
time looking me in the eye.
And I go,

561
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:02,820
dude,
I go,

562
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,070
think about what the joke says.

563
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,203
It's about Jewish people being really 
good at business will walk into a bar 

564
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,800
that decided to buy it.
It's such a,

565
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,634
it's nothing offensive about it at all.
Like you know what's crazy is like it's 

566
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:14,664
like people now and maybe forever have 
always heard shit and they immediately 

567
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:22,400
think this means if I'm thinking 
something bad about this,

568
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,400
that means that someone is saying 
thinking bad about it.

569
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,263
They decided this is a taboo subject.
Even if you're not even say anything 

570
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:29,804
negative about it,
like say if you do a joke about 

571
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:34,740
interracial relationships,
the best kind integration where I should

572
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,920
just say it.
If you just do a joke about that,

573
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,933
there are people that are going to put 
red flags up instantly and look to 

574
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:45,500
misinterpret anything that you say on 
purpose because they don't want.

575
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,140
They don't want that thought in their 
head.

576
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,690
They don't want the thought of know 
like,

577
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,880
this guy's looking for antisemitism and 
that joke to just walk into a bar.

578
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,050
They buy it.
There's none there.

579
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,003
You could look all day long.
It's a joke about Jewish folks by and 

580
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,750
stuff.
It just does nothing.

581
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,750
Positive stereotypes.
It's like a big Dick,

582
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:06,584
black guy,
Joe.

583
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,810
It's not negative.
There's nothing negative about it.

584
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:09,644
Nobody gets upset that you think they 
have a big Dick unless they have a 

585
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,580
little thing.
It's a lot of lead time.

586
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,020
It's.
It's young people that also flexing,

587
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,003
right?
They're free from the control of their 

588
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:20,714
parents and I find them you dealing with
that more in like rich or upper middle 

589
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:27,854
class families because I think they're 
more hands on with their kids and more 

590
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:36,161
controlling and those kids get free.
They want to exert their own freedom and

591
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:37,154
when they get free of their parents,
they want to establish that they're 

592
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,690
different and that they have their own 
mind,

593
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:42,524
their own,
and then we're part of the new 

594
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:43,850
generation.

595
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,220
The new generation is not going to 
tolerate racism.

596
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,233
CIS Hetero activity and they just decide
that they're going to fucking put their 

597
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:51,734
foot down,
but it's a pattern that repeats itself 

598
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,283
over and over and over again.
It's just today they have social media 

599
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,930
and this is the difference.
The difference is they feel like they're

600
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,764
empowered because they get online and 
other morons that are the same age as 

601
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:05,780
them.
Confirm with them.

602
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,720
You can just confirm any belief that you
want.

603
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:13,610
Like that's another lesson I've gotten 
from this is just like confirmation bias

604
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,460
is like the wildest shit ever you can 
find.

605
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,410
You can be like,
there's one lady who wrote some shit.

606
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,900
I'm anti gay,
anti black and other areas.

607
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,240
I'm like in the comments,
yes,

608
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,770
this is clearly.
This is clearly what he was saying.

609
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm like,
what that you took that from my set.

610
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,370
Me.
I don't think there's a solution here.

611
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,593
Yeah.
I've looked at this heart for a long 

612
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,570
time now.
We need safe spaces for comedians.

613
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,820
There's no solution because you're 
dealing with immature people in terms of

614
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,950
like the literally the development of 
their frontal lobe.

615
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,660
They're not fully formed yet.
How much do you think of it is like,

616
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,713
I put it in my op Ed that I wrote,
but it's like I was thinking about like 

617
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,703
how much of it now is a function of the 
fact that like we immediately get 

618
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,850
whatever we want in our hands.
You know what I mean?

619
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,684
Like the instant gratification.
So it was like instant kind of thought 

620
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:05,730
process where there's no real thinking 
that occurs.

621
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,620
It's more just like,
this comes into my brain.

622
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,240
I hear gay black,
this has to be,

623
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,940
this is wrong.
It's coming out for sure.

624
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,110
I mean if you say gay black on stage 
today in a really liberal,

625
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,790
very progressive environment,
you get this thing you.

626
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,673
But you have to say something like pro 
super pro gay and super pro black and 

627
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:25,704
it,
it doesn't even have to be a joke like 

628
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,054
it.
You're better off just going for that 

629
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,271
applause.
Break,

630
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,600
move,
comedian.

631
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,453
I mean he just want rose.
People want their comedians to be their 

632
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,740
leaders.
That's what,

633
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,830
that's what it feels like.
It is wild laugh know people.

634
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,530
When I say people,
I mean like this next group of,

635
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,060
uh,
of comedy,

636
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,983
like kids are talking about the people 
that were shot because the comedians 

637
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:53,490
that are going to be their leaders 
aren't even gonna be funny.

638
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,770
They're going to fucking die to starve 
to death.

639
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,690
You get once you get out in the real 
world.

640
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,940
Fuck man.
If you're not funny,

641
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,510
you're fucked.

642
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,040
Yeah.
Nothing but like,

643
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:02,874
it's like,
like if I went up there and I said 

644
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,650
Asians other shit and fuck Whitey,
this,

645
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,220
I would've,
I would've been.

646
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,240
I would've been out on the fucking 
chairs.

647
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,610
They were there and carried me out like 
this mother fucker.

648
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,810
You know what I mean?
But like,

649
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,350
that's the thing I think like people 
want,

650
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,680
like,
I'm not a hero man.

651
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,690
I'm just trying to be heard.
You know what?

652
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:22,590
Your comic.
Yeah.

653
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,850
I'm trying to be funny.
Yes.

654
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:25,440
That's all it is.
This is uh,

655
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,453
I,
I really believed that this is just a 

656
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:31,140
symptom of growing up and you're just 
giving these people the power to express

657
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:33,630
themselves where there's,
there's no mature,

658
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,120
wiser person that's around them.
It says,

659
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:36,954
hold on,
let's look at the context of what he's 

660
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,350
doing,
examined what he's doing,

661
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,184
and then you're going to apologize to 
him because this is clearly a fucking 

662
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:43,500
joke.

663
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,410
You hired a guy to tell jokes.
He tells jokes and you say,

664
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,244
not that show.
This specific thing is strange because 

665
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,720
they're were like,
everyone's like,

666
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:56,721
he did not respect what the event was.
Unlike like what?

667
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,520
I mean.
I'm not this.

668
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,380
I'm not your mascot here right now.
I'm.

669
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,223
I'm just not a pep rally dog.
I'm here to tell jokes when you weren't 

670
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:10,050
hired to do a speech about this event.
I'm here to direct my fucking act.

671
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,750
I don't think they understand how long 
it takes to write an act.

672
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,490
That's the.
That's another conversation though.

673
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,710
Comedy is fucking hard work.
I'm going to just go up there and just,

674
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,280
you know,
we're all out.

675
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:25,920
Last night I've ranted to you.
You were at the Improv as well,

676
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:26,680
right?
Yeah.

677
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,930
I.
We're grinding fucking shit up there.

678
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,210
Try a new beds.
It's tough and recording things.

679
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,740
Listening to them,
we're like,

680
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:35,521
oh,
this didn't work,

681
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:36,680
but now I got to restructure.
Now.

682
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,570
Now I'm going to go back and try to 
figure out how I can make this gay black

683
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,840
joke.
Obviously gay,

684
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,790
but now everybody knows.
Everyone knows who you are.

685
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:49,120
Now going to go to the gay black,
gay,

686
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,590
black people are going to start cheering
for it.

687
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,450
Black Gay,
gay,

688
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,920
black friend.
My friend started a Hashtag challenge,

689
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,754
which I hope no one picks up as the 
nemos challenge where if I'm on stage 

690
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:01,684
somewhere,
you just come on stage and rip the mic 

691
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,593
on.

692
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,510
You just fucked up.
Don't do that.

693
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,970
Please.
You shouldn't have said that on this.

694
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,000
Good luck.
Luck in the next six months.

695
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,510
I really don't think this is a big deal.
I just think this is is.

696
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,980
There's a reason why all these different
comedians had been saying.

697
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,220
John Malaney said this recently and I 
really love John Malaney,

698
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,410
but I completely disagree with them.
He said,

699
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,300
the reason why Comedians don't do 
colleges,

700
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:31,180
it's nothing to do with political 
correctness has to do with the money.

701
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,620
That is not true.
No,

702
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,520
he says that because his act is really 
good and really clean.

703
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,880
Essentially do his act anywhere.
It's an excellent act,

704
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,870
I mean,
and,

705
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,060
but there's other guys like that,
like Brian Regan,

706
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,400
he's got an excellent act.
He could do colleges anywhere and yeah,

707
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,253
like any,
anywhere they see the reason why they 

708
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,660
don't do colleges because the kids are 
too fucking sensitive.

709
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,523
That's 100 percent the reason.
Do you think that they don't make money 

710
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,004
at colleges?
You don't understand how much colleges 

711
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,410
pay?
They pay a lot of money.

712
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,810
It's not to a lot of.
I think to a lot of comics,

713
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,730
it's just not worth the hassle.
It's not worth,

714
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,630
you know,
like if,

715
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,240
if I didn't need the cash and I was like
a jerry,

716
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,500
you know,
if I was whatever,

717
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:12,334
like the two and a half weeks that have 
spent like reading the news and getting 

718
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,074
back and live answering emails and 
getting back into the shit of just like 

719
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,730
they said,
what if I didn't?

720
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,330
I would easily give that up.
But here's the flip side.

721
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,420
This is probably one of the best things 
that ever happened to you as a stand up.

722
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,770
Oh yeah.
That's what I was saying.

723
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,870
Gigantic national attention as the,
the,

724
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,440
the two things every comic has said it 
was one of the,

725
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,370
do you get paid and do is good press 
right?

726
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,140
You're fucking pricks.
But it's true.

727
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,130
It's good to feel the same way after 
time is sort of the wounds over.

728
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,993
Oh yeah.
Right now it's still raw and fresh and 

729
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,840
you're still angry.
I'm still getting shit from comics.

730
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,340
Like that's my,
that's been my whole.

731
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,140
That's been my favorite thing about all 
this is just comedians like talking shit

732
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,690
about like,
uh,

733
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,960
more than my friends post on facebook,
uh,

734
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,780
is uh,
I mean,

735
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,613
who among us hasn't wanted snatched the 
mic out of knee meshes hand pieces of 

736
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,180
shit.
Like,

737
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,480
let me live man.
Oh,

738
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,120
of course.
Of course.

739
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:16,570
The bomb hood around the world is my 
comic friends that come to the fuck.

740
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:18,520
You guys do.
Jeff Ross who set this up.

741
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,320
Jeff.
Jeff is the one who connected us,

742
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,270
but yeah,
shout out.

743
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,270
Shout out to Jeff Ross.
Jeff said something that I agree with so

744
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,133
wholeheartedly.

745
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,003
He said,
I'm almost a comedian before I'm an 

746
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,950
American.
And he said that on this,

747
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,460
right?
Yeah.

748
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,380
Yeah.
And I'm like,

749
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:33,640
yeah,
yeah.

750
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,710
It's like,
it's,

751
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,250
it's a rare person.
There's only two.

752
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,830
How many of us are there in the whole 
country?

753
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,260
Is there even a thousand?
Like real,

754
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,090
legitimate working ones?
I don't know,

755
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,710
man.
How many headliners is there?

756
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:47,180
500.
Zero.

757
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:49,880
Like legit five.
How many would you pay to see?

758
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:54,470
Is it a hundred,
100 dudes in the country?

759
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,930
Maybe in the world?
Let me be honest.

760
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,950
I might pay to see two dudes outside of 
the country internationally.

761
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,330
Fine.
Lovely people.

762
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,970
Good luck with that.
This shit's America.

763
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:08,800
It's,
it's,

764
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,430
I guess,
uh,

765
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,900
I mean,
I agree with Jeff wholeheartedly.

766
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,870
I guess like,
we're,

767
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,140
it's also like what he said about,
uh,

768
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,130
the incident,
you see a comment from a,

769
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,050
even if they're like in England or South
Africa and you see it,

770
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:20,690
you,
you immediately have that kinship.

771
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,320
You're like,
yes,

772
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,153
you're a comedian.
It's like you ever watch a community in 

773
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,750
when,
when Chris and uh,

774
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,490
uh,
Jerry do,

775
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,470
I've never watched it.
Oh,

776
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:28,101
it's great.
I mean,

777
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:28,940
I just liked,
I liked,

778
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,200
I liked some of the interviews that he 
does,

779
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,034
but Chris and Jerry have a moment where 
they're talking about going to a party 

780
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:39,440
and seeing each other and Chris comes up
to Jerry and just goes comedian,

781
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,890
but the only two people that know each 
other and it's like,

782
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,230
that's the kinship that I think you have
as a,

783
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,260
as a comic,
but I forget what we talked about.

784
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:48,990
How do we get on this?
Well,

785
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,660
we were just talking about guys giving 
you shit.

786
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,560
Oh yeah.
I mean that's,

787
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,423
that's the,
that's the best part is just like 

788
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:56,200
motherfuckers being like you bomb and 
mother.

789
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,170
Yeah,
I love it.

790
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,140
I love New York.

791
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,973
New York is special in that way.
With New York's extra mean because it's 

792
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:03,561
cold.
Oh,

793
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,180
it's fucking brutal.
That's what it is.

794
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,650
Like la out here,
people are,

795
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:08,420
first of all,
they're trying to get acting gigs,

796
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,254
so the kissing ass and they're being 
fake and then on top of that it's warm 

797
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,400
all the time.
Did you start in.

798
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,080
What'd you start?
I started in Boston,

799
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,120
Boston,
New York,

800
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,410
La,
but I've been to la.

801
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,333
I've been,
I mean if you want it to look at it on 

802
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,524
paper,
although I always considered myself a 

803
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:23,720
Boston comic.
Yeah.

804
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,650
I'm more of an La comic than anything.
I've been out here since 94.

805
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,870
Oh Shit.
I was thinking about the other day.

806
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:31,800
You're a 30 year guy.
Yeah,

807
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,693
30 years.
That's a long time and it's your life 

808
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,500
your whole life as a human.
You said you were on stage at college in

809
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,190
1990.

810
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,023
I was for crazy.
I think it was 92 now that I'm thinking 

811
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,120
[inaudible] 99.
Somewhere around nine to.

812
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,183
But either way it's a long ass time and 
the crazy thing is do you still keep 

813
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:52,784
learning?
Yeah,

814
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,673
like you still keep learning.
Like I'll still have a weird set and I 

815
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,130
go,
oh,

816
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,780
why did I do it that way?
Well,

817
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,623
I have this idea in my head.
Let me flip this around and it'll fuck 

818
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,410
the whole joke up.
Like,

819
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,200
why did I say rescue first?
I should have said that later.

820
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,353
God Damn it.
That goes back to how much work this 

821
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:15,920
shit is that you forget how much time 
you've got to invest.

822
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,030
I got two new babies right now,
not not real babies and real kids,

823
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,780
but I have two new comedy babies even 
better and I'm watering them.

824
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,070
Like right now.
They're like,

825
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,870
Ooh,
I've got to give them some light.

826
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,670
I got to make sure they get the right 
fertilizer.

827
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,280
Like right now I have two bits.
One bit.

828
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,114
That's one day out.
I did it yesterday for the first time 

829
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,230
I'd been working on it for a couple of 
weeks.

830
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:37,980
I knew there was some life to it and I

831
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,870
sat down.
I wrote it out and I said,

832
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,770
okay,
one want a free ball.

833
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,360
This shit last night.
What's her process?

834
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,400
I have over the last three or four 
years,

835
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,460
four years since I'm actually five.
Since I did my comedy central special in

836
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,754
2014.
I decided to change my process right 

837
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:57,924
before that because I decided that I 
needed to do more specials because I 

838
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,524
went from.
I did one in 2009 that I really liked 

839
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,890
that I did one in 2012 that I have asked
and then I said,

840
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:09,870
okay,
because I wasn't doing.

841
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,290
I wasn't at the store anymore and I 
wasn't doing weekly sets,

842
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,490
so then I realized,
okay,

843
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,250
there's a.
there's a very distinct process in terms

844
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:19,710
of the work that you have to do.
First of all,

845
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,800
you have to go up a lot,
like you have to go up at least three or

846
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,600
four times a week,
excuse me,

847
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,583
three or four days a week and I would 
like to go multiple times a night and I 

848
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:29,404
like to go to different environments,
not just the store or they like to do 

849
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,544
the Improv.

850
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,400
I like to do the Ice House,
I like to do different environments.

851
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,160
Then I have to write,
write,

852
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,143
like sit in front of a computer and 
write and I like to do it high and I 

853
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:44,820
like to do it sober.
I could to do it both ways.

854
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,713
Got It.
And George Carlin had an interesting 

855
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,114
method that I think I'm starting to 
adopt because I've been doing it a lot 

856
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,474
lately,
even though it's subconscious where I 

857
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,520
write out concepts sober and then I fire
up,

858
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,140
then our spark up a joint and then I go 
over it again when I'm high,

859
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,040
like the structure's already there and 
then I'll start putting the funny.

860
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,083
Then after the writing part,
there's a lot of going over it and 

861
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:11,724
thinking about it.
I try to give it a little life before 

862
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,860
bringing it to the stage.
Then when I bring to the stage,

863
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,240
I write it out on paper.

864
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,073
I have to write it out on paper because 
that's how remember where my bullet 

865
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:25,860
points are.
Then recording always and then review of

866
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:29,010
the recording.
Then rewriting after the review,

867
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:32,220
the recording,
this process is like this is my process.

868
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,240
When I do it that way I feel better.
I feel excited.

869
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,490
Like last night I came home,
I wrote till 2:30

870
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,160
in the morning.
I came home at 1230.

871
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:40,994
I wrote for two hours and by the time 
I'm like falling asleep in front of my 

872
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,810
laptop.
I shut the laptop,

873
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,620
I know I'm done,
but I feel good.

874
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,910
Yeah,
I'm getting it in.

875
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,630
I know it's happening.
Like this is all live shit working out.

876
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,471
Yeah,
and I go to bed.

877
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,880
I feel good.
I go to bed.

878
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:54,840
I'm like,
yes.

879
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,010
I'm like,
this is a live.

880
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:59,130
This bitch is alive when they wake up 
and it's the first thing you think about

881
00:37:59,131 --> 00:37:59,641
like,
oh yeah,

882
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:00,474
I got this.
I got this new beer that night and did 

883
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,180
it for the first time last night and it 
did well at the comedy store,

884
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:08,430
but then it crushed at the Improv and 
Ooh,

885
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,290
this motherfucker's alive.
But what was the bit.

886
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,800
The bit is about old people getting stds
and nursing homes.

887
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,850
Fuck yes.
That is a phenomena.

888
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,440
It's a new thing.
This new thing that's happening.

889
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,010
Exactly.
Blow your Dick around if you're 85 years

890
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:24,844
old.
Exactly.

891
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,150
No one needs condom doing.
Exactly.

892
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,043
Exactly.
Exactly.

893
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,320
So,
um,

894
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,333
but then there's this other bit of that 
I'm working on as well that's a little 

895
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:36,040
bit older about dude from

896
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,370
the missionary that got shot up by the 
arrows.

897
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,204
But the uncontacted tribes,
of course my people did that came from 

898
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:46,800
Africa and stepping in India and 
Ireland,

899
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,940
but they immigrated from Africa 60,000
years ago under contact at trump.

900
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,520
But the point being that the process for
me,

901
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,690
it's the most important thing.
I think all this stuff with.

902
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,270
It's really about.
It's about focus and attention,

903
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,310
focus and attention.
Thinking about that,

904
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,770
but the work in terms of breaking it 
down,

905
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,963
there's a.
there's a bunch of things that I think 

906
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,394
comedians don't do that they really 
should do and the number one thing is 

907
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,494
writing actual writing,
writing like sitting in front of a 

908
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:17,734
computer or a notebook and writing.
Most comedians like to just have a bit 

909
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,520
and they work it out on stage and they 
know how it worked and then they improve

910
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,354
it the next set,
and especially if you're doing like the 

911
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,083
New York City trip,
were you doing like the seller and then 

912
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:30,684
you do stand that you do an all these 
different sets all around town and 

913
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,460
you're doing little short 10 minute sets
here and they're like,

914
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,770
it's easy to just kind of keep working 
on it.

915
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
Just keep working on it,
but I think that it's critical to 

916
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:46,300
actually sit alone with the material and
just look at it,

917
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,373
look at it and try to go,
how can I make this quicker or what's a 

918
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:53,110
sneak your way to do this or what else 
is in this that I'm missing?

919
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:55,120
And I think the for me,
like I,

920
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,963
I right now,
like I just started doing up until 

921
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,810
probably like a year ago,
maybe eight months ago,

922
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,330
I was of the brain where I was like,
I'll write a note or write a bullet,

923
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,880
bullet,
bullet,

924
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,713
bullet point or whatever and I'll try 
and work it out and then I'll write 

925
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,660
something that I think is interesting as
a joke,

926
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,423
but like I saw no opening for disease or
working with a song like working with 

927
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:16,924
people that are like crushing it.
Their process is like fuck they're 

928
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,620
maniacs when the like you were just 
like,

929
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,660
yes,
I have a codified process.

930
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,130
This is exactly.
I'm going to do it.

931
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,740
This is what's worked for like 10,
15 years,

932
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,880
however long I've been doing it.
And once I saw like that process,

933
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:34,990
I'm like,
oh these motherfuckers,

934
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,913
I think I work hard,
but these guys work fucking crazy hard 

935
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:38,974
and it's like sort of emulate that 
process of like I got to set aside at 

936
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,064
least 20,
30 minutes a day where I'm like 

937
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,561
literally,
right.

938
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,240
Even if it's the same thing over and 
over,

939
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:47,350
I was just like,
okay,

940
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:49,540
how can I fix this,
this word doesn't need to be there.

941
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,374
Like,
and then I'll say it in my apartment to 

942
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,014
myself and I'll try to do like how I 
would do it on stage because it's like 

943
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,580
I'm my comedy,
I tried to be conversational,

944
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,690
at least make it seem conversational.
So it's like,

945
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,090
how can I seem relaxed while doing this?

946
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,660
But still emphasize the right word for 
that's the punchline or whatever it is.

947
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah.
And now that process like,

948
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,953
and it's all repetition now when you got
to repeat the process to make it a 

949
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:14,224
profit.
Otherwise this is the thing you did 

950
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,240
once.
And so now that's,

951
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,113
that's what I'm starting to do now.
Just physically fucking getting up and 

952
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,841
be like,
okay,

953
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,760
this I gotta write this bid out.
Even though it was a bit.

954
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:25,180
I've done a billion times but something 
in there that I got to figure out.

955
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,291
Yeah.
Um,

956
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,580
another thing to do that really works 
well to sort of get it in your head is a

957
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:35,581
cork board to have a big old bullets and
board and put index cards on none of the

958
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:36,464
titles of your bits.
And then I would put like index cards 

959
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:41,690
underneath it that are like the bullet 
points of that bit.

960
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,643
Kind of like a storyboard or maybe kind 
of step back and look at them and then 

961
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:49,190
try to see if they make sense in order.
Like maybe I should flip it around.

962
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:50,024
Maybe I should do the bit about the guy 
getting bit by the dog before I do the 

963
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,624
bit about the monkey,
the difference between being bit by a 

964
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,603
monkey and like maybe it's better to 
introduce this distrust of animals 

965
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,820
because in this way or you know,
who knows?

966
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,000
It's about attention though.
That's the thing.

967
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,510
It's attention and focus.
And these guys.

968
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:10,344
Have you seen that work really hard?
It's not a coincidence that those guys 

969
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:13,910
are killing it.
I mean,

970
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,613
there's something to it and there's also
the recognition when you do start 

971
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,023
killing it,
like,

972
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,170
oh shit,
this is rare.

973
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,680
Like I'm in a rare spot.
I'm filling up these gigantic places.

974
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,790
People coming out to see me.

975
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,340
I'm doing netflix specials.
You got to work harder now.

976
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,233
Yeah,
you gotta keep it up and you gotta keep 

977
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,900
it up and you got to realize that you 
are like,

978
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:34,810
Bill Burr said something once that I 
think was really,

979
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,100
really,
really like dead on the money.

980
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,000
He said,
I know what it's like to be disappointed

981
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,700
by someone that you go to see,
like you go to see a band.

982
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,343
He goes,
I remember going when I see a band when 

983
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,980
I was a kid and they half asset and you 
know,

984
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,250
like you feel fucked over.
He goes,

985
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:51,410
I don't ever want to do that to my fans.
I was like,

986
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,460
ah Ha.
Yeah.

987
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:53,294
That's it.
Like realize that you used to be a fan 

988
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,070
and I'll think of your fans as like 
what?

989
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,750
How you would experience you.
They don't want someone phoning it in,

990
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,040
you know,
that's their night,

991
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,640
right?

992
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,500
That is their night it came out to see 
someone they love and it's like,

993
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,590
you got to fucking earn that love 
almost.

994
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

995
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,113
And tickets are expensive and they had 
to work to get those tickets and a lot 

996
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,210
of people doing jobs they fucking hate.
And,

997
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:16,044
and cutting back on other things to have
enough money to go out and have a few 

998
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:19,580
drinks.
Yeah.

999
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,630
It's uh,
there's,

1000
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,463
there's a responsibility to it,
but there's also a lot of people that 

1001
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:24,614
try to skirt that responsibility because
of the pressure of that responsibility 

1002
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:28,820
is kind of overwhelming.
You think about it,

1003
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:29,654
it makes you nervous and you just start,
you fuck off and you have ass and I'll 

1004
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,200
be fine.
Yeah.

1005
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,110
But that's like college,
right?

1006
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:36,944
It's like cramming for tests.
It's like there's a lot of people that 

1007
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,554
study all year long and there's a lot of
people that half acid up until the last 

1008
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,840
minute and then they just try to shove 
it all in all at once.

1009
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,733
It's a weird kind of confidence that you
need or or delusional delusional 

1010
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,790
delusional competence where like,
I'll be fine fucking.

1011
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,530
And I admit I've done that a few times 
where I've just been like,

1012
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,450
fuck it,
I'll,

1013
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,360
I'll,
I'll work this out.

1014
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,194
It'll be straight.
But like the Times where I've like 

1015
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,053
fucking sat and been like,
this is the bit I gotta do I gotTa make 

1016
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,474
sure I hit it to the point where I'll 
just bring the notebook on stage and 

1017
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:05,240
just be like,
okay,

1018
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,740
I gotta make sure this,
this goes away.

1019
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:08,840
I wanted to go,
these are the old expression,

1020
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:09,674
how you do anything is how you do 
everything or how you do everything is 

1021
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:14,120
how you do anything.
And that's,

1022
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,043
there's something to that too.
There's something to like not allowing 

1023
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:21,990
yourself to think of yourself as someone
who's a fuckup yeah.

1024
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,230
Because as soon as you think of,
I'm just a fuck up.

1025
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,850
If you get that in your head man.
And that like the default setting almost

1026
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,560
where it's like that's easy to do with 
human are like,

1027
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,903
I think people are hardwired to work,
but it's also very easy to just not do 

1028
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:40,650
that and I believe that it'll be fine or
or five,

1029
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,543
fuck this up.
Like the pressure alleviator as you put 

1030
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,950
these expectations on yourself of 
success in the end,

1031
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:47,784
there's a lot of pressure involved in 
meeting those expectations and one of 

1032
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:53,400
the best pressure relievers is just 
fucking up.

1033
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,040
So you lower your own personal 
expectations.

1034
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,460
People drinking,
doing all that kind of shit.

1035
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,333
Just like sabotaging your life.
There's a lot of people that will 

1036
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,930
sabotage their life.
They start getting some success and then

1037
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,680
the panic overwhelms them and they'll 
just start taking pills or go,

1038
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,080
go fucking crazy.
I'm gonna,

1039
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,580
lose this.
I'm going to fuck it up.

1040
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,121
Anyway.
Yeah,

1041
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:13,770
I know.
That mentality is really normal.

1042
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,430
Yeah.
The psychological mind fuck that goes on

1043
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,264
when you're attempting to do anything,
whether it's standup comedy or I guess 

1044
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:24,170
it would probably be the same with 
almost any art form.

1045
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,433
You're especially open-ended art forum 
where you don't have a boss who's 

1046
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,830
telling you,
hey,

1047
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,510
you know,
mess,

1048
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,620
you got to get this fucking project in 
at 3:00

1049
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,263
if that's the.
That's the crazy thing is like you 

1050
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,143
forget.
Or like what people don't know is that 

1051
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:39,720
comedy is the most entrepreneurial 
endeavor.

1052
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:40,554
There is you fucking there and that's 
why everyone thinks they could do it 

1053
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,340
because there's no capital investment of
fuck it.

1054
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,240
It's all just mental investment in hard 
work and everybody thinks they can do it

1055
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,040
because they do most of it.
See,

1056
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,610
most of it is just talking.
Yeah.

1057
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,490
So like I could talk,
I could talk.

1058
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,413
How come I can't talk like I've made 
people have to do it and funny at the 

1059
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:01,141
office,
Dude,

1060
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,240
I'm funny all the time I'm going to do 
standup.

1061
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,403
Like how many people have you heard say,
I think I'm thinking about doing stand 

1062
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:08,220
up and you're like,
oh God.

1063
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,710
I'm like,
good luck man.

1064
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,480
You know?
Because some people I'm like,

1065
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,820
I know they have the work ethic to do 
whatever the fuck that.

1066
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:15,654
If like if my friends were super 
successful in most other endeavors like 

1067
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,434
that,
they do like finance or doctors or 

1068
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,370
whatever applied the same work ethic to 
comedy.

1069
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,920
They might be successful if they're 
funny,

1070
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,113
but a lot of people think they're funny 
and then just forget that fucking the 

1071
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,470
work part.
Whereas a like,

1072
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,250
Yo,
fuck,

1073
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,690
this is slave shit.
Ain't no one and there's no one whipping

1074
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:37,950
you.
The only one,

1075
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,910
no one but yourself.

1076
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,040
It's just you'll get the fucking work 
done.

1077
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,280
It's also you're the writer,
the producer,

1078
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,383
and you're the actor.
You're the person who does the whole 

1079
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:49,290
thing.
The marketing expert.

1080
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,670
You got to all the above.
Yeah.

1081
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:51,504
It's all fucking you.
It's a weird gig and you have to be a 

1082
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:54,864
self starter because if you're not the 
type of person that knows how to 

1083
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,220
motivate yourself and get out of bed and
get things done,

1084
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,740
you'll just fucking lay around until 
three in the afternoon.

1085
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:02,574
Then you go eat a sub and have a cup of 
coffee and then the man my sets in two 

1086
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:08,080
hours,
I think I'm gonna be taking a nap.

1087
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,483
You feel like you did something because 
you wrote some shit in your mole skin 

1088
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,110
foot right before you went up doing a 
lot of writing lately.

1089
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,990
One mole skin,
three years,

1090
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,840
fucking 10,
10 words on it.

1091
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,560
It's,
it's,

1092
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,510
uh,
there's no,

1093
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,393
there's no fucking structure to it 
either in terms of like there's 

1094
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,010
education that you can

1095
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,160
get other than self education you can't 
go to.

1096
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,110
If you want to learn how to play the 
cello,

1097
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,630
you could take lessons.
Someone will teach you how.

1098
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,240
I mean there's a real clear process 
between,

1099
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,070
you know,
being a symphony violinist know,

1100
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,550
like going to school,
getting an education in music,

1101
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,500
becoming a symphony violinists.
Just auditioning Asian.

1102
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,270
Yeah.
That helps a lot.

1103
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,380
That is the fence.
Get off the stage.

1104
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,800
He said something about an ethnicity.
It must be bad.

1105
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:01,563
I mean,
there's no real clear process to 

1106
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,930
becoming a standup comedian.
It just.

1107
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,010
Everybody's like,
what do you do?

1108
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,500
You go to an open mic,
figure it out.

1109
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,630
You're on your own.
Everybody just wants you to get it.

1110
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:16,130
Tell me how you go from doing comedy to 
becoming a writer for snl.

1111
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,270
Is there a shortcut,
like what's.

1112
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,390
Oh yeah,
call this number and say,

1113
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:22,190
Abracadabra,
this is Lauren's number.

1114
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,910
Yeah.
You tell it.

1115
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,280
You tell them one joke and if he laughs 
you hired.

1116
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,440
Is that then you're in?
Yeah.

1117
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,363
There's no.

1118
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,240
There's no way to teach someone how to 
be a comic either.

1119
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:33,223
That's the other thing,
like the way you do jokes is different 

1120
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:35,864
than the way he jamie would do jokes or 
different than the way you know fucking 

1121
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:40,334
Judas freelander would do jokes.
Everybody's different and there's no 

1122
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,240
one.
No one is right.

1123
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,630
Like if you went over to Judah 
freelander xact and went Nema and you're

1124
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:48,464
doing this shit all wrong.
You gotta he's gotTa have actual 

1125
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:52,070
punchlines,
right?

1126
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,840
You're just saying a bunch of shit.
That's not true.

1127
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,010
You've got to stop this.

1128
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,540
It's very fucking good,
man.

1129
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,540
He's hilarious.
But his act is uniquely him.

1130
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,640
Kick it.
Never teach anybody how to do that.

1131
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,050
No.
Like that act.

1132
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,500
He had a figure that act out on his own 
and he's developed a so well.

1133
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,550
Yeah,
I mean that's the thing.

1134
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,780
Yeah.
I think like with comedy,

1135
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:15,250
the heart,
the crazy shit is,

1136
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,960
is that everyone thinks they could do in
the sense that like,

1137
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,370
oh,
I could tell a joke and I could show.

1138
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,233
A lot of people can tell a joke.
My mom could tell a joke my that 

1139
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,480
everyone can tell a joke because it's 
written in Shit,

1140
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:29,314
but it's so hard to cultivate who you 
are because that's you're also doing 

1141
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:35,170
that.
You're like trying to figure out,

1142
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,004
okay,
I've got a bunch of fucking insane shit 

1143
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:41,050
and my brain and this is how I think it.
I got to figure out how I'm going to say

1144
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:43,120
it.
That's not necessarily how everyone else

1145
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:43,954
would say it,
but it's just how I feel about it and 

1146
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,510
I'm going to say it that way.

1147
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,750
Take into account the economy of words.
You want to sneak it up on people.

1148
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,620
You want to get the idea into their head
before they figured it out on their own,

1149
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,720
so like boom,
like it pops.

1150
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,370
I'm like,
you gotta you want.

1151
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,320
It's like a little race,
like the.

1152
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,193
You have to figure out a way to 
introduce it in a way that's unique and 

1153
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:07,424
captivating and entertaining,
but also quick enough to get into their 

1154
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:12,410
brain before they figured out where 
you're going.

1155
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,440
Because the worst thing is when you see 
guy on stage and you're like,

1156
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,460
oh,
I know where this is going,

1157
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,950
and then he gets there and then a few 
people go,

1158
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:20,060
ha ha,
ha ha.

1159
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,323
What took so long?
I was there yesterday dog I saw coming 

1160
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:28,250
from the moment you.
Unless they can say

1161
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,870
it and you see it coming and it still 
hits you because it's so good.

1162
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,723
It's so stupid.
That's just really good writing and the 

1163
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,040
good delivery in a good idea,
you know,

1164
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:37,874
but it's also on the other hand,
I mean we're talking about how hard it 

1165
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,804
is.
It's also the most fun shit of all time 

1166
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:44,950
when it works.
Oh yeah,

1167
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,340
pops off when you had to have a new bit 
and you have that pause right before you

1168
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:54,020
deliver and you like.
And I told him that's not real.

1169
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,010
And then ever goes,
oh,

1170
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,220
I got to hear the beginning of this.
You know what?

1171
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,054
I mean,
it's like you hit these punchlines and 

1172
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:02,744
the whole audience laughs and roars and 
they're having a good time and it's one 

1173
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,260
of the greatest feelings in life.
It's because,

1174
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,030
because you,
you know,

1175
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:14,030
but you don't know until it comes out of
your mouth and then you're like,

1176
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,730
oh,
well,

1177
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:18,820
it's also,
you're making people feel good.

1178
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,660
Like there's something about looking 
out.

1179
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,220
You know,
you go to the Improv last night,

1180
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,940
190 people in that room and you're 
looking out into the audience at all.

1181
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:30,260
These people are having a great time 
laughing and having so much fun.

1182
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,810
I got all your numbers.
You know what I mean?

1183
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,010
Got Feeling.
I know what.

1184
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,853
You know why you're laughing at this.
I know why you're not laughing at 

1185
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:42,710
something.
I know who you are.

1186
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,883
A little aspect of who you are because 
you're laughing at this bit and what 

1187
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:48,740
you've been through and you're giving 
them a good feeling.

1188
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,350
You've given them a good thing.
It's a good exchange.

1189
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,230
Like they came to see you like they sat 
down.

1190
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,213
They're less willing to let you talk in 
front of a microphone raised above them 

1191
00:51:58,911 --> 00:51:59,930
on a stage.
Right?

1192
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:04,931
This is a very unique arrangement in 
human beings that this person like,

1193
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:07,460
please welcome Jamie Vernon.

1194
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,180
He goes up on the stage,
gets up the hey everybody and the like.

1195
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,970
This is it.
It's an exchange.

1196
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:15,140
It's a unique contract where you're 
like,

1197
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,974
okay,
I'm going to give this person who has a 

1198
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:21,290
microphone 10 minutes of my time,
my precious time,

1199
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,223
and in that 10 minutes you've got to 
make me feel better about my life that 

1200
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,910
has nothing or escape my life,
or whatever it is.

1201
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:29,930
People say,
well,

1202
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,890
you're making them feel like when I go 
to see a comic and they they kill.

1203
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:36,470
Let's say David tells goes onstage and 
he's killing.

1204
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,900
I'm feeling better because of his 
laughs,

1205
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,500
because of his jokes.
When he's.

1206
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,100
He's cracking jokes about things.
I'm like,

1207
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,773
I got feel good.
It gets in your body like he's giving 

1208
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:52,310
you a little drug.
Were drug dealers.

1209
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,570
Look,
if you could get a drug,

1210
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:54,404
if you could go to the 7:11
and it was an over the counter thing 

1211
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,310
while you saying 7:11
convenience store,

1212
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,280
that is time.
That could have been a big phone pa.

1213
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,570
I'm offended.
Okay.

1214
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,230
Store 24.
I'll go back to Boston.

1215
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,960
But if you could buy something over the 
counter and it was a laughter drug,

1216
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,990
we could just take a pill and everything
would be hilarious and funny.

1217
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,850
God,
everybody would take that.

1218
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,180
So greatest feeling ever.
You.

1219
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,070
You laugh at something and you think 
it's a really funny and not that happens

1220
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,903
to you.
There's no negative side effects to 

1221
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,580
enhance your girl might be mad at you if
you have it.

1222
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,560
Something as opposed to what are you 
going to do?

1223
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,920
Yeah.
That's funny.

1224
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,540
When you see girls getting upset at guys
laughing my face because you could like,

1225
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,613
like even last night you could,
you could see their couples and you 

1226
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:43,974
tell.
I told a joke and I could see what girl 

1227
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:47,334
is looking at.
What guy versus what guys just like 

1228
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,560
laughing it up.
I have a fiance now,

1229
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,394
but we got engaged like three or four 
weeks ago and I do this bit about or 

1230
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:56,244
where I'm just like,
I'm a one night she got mad at me 

1231
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,880
because I closed the door too loud 
because she was sleeping and I was drunk

1232
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:03,714
and I came home.
I just accidentally closed the door and 

1233
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:07,920
I was like,
that's how you like the bit is I say,

1234
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,930
you know,
there's two ways to close the door.

1235
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:10,763
As Amanda's a regulator,
just close it like you've been taught 

1236
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,380
your whole life.
And then there's another way.

1237
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,420
If you live with your girlfriend,
you come home like she's sleeping,

1238
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:16,254
you gotta turn the Doorknob,
push it into the frame and then release 

1239
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,490
it so it doesn't make a noise or a 
relationship.

1240
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:25,491
My end and you see guys and girls going,
who told you that's how you got to do.

1241
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,383
I'm just like,
that to me is like the best where it's 

1242
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:32,364
like I know everything that these 
motherfuckers are going through in this 

1243
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:38,340
fucking moment and the and like they're 
gonna go home and talk about.

1244
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,383
See,
I told you that the doors shit was too 

1245
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,514
loud.

1246
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,700
That's the fucking.
That's my favorite part of doing any bit

1247
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,280
where it's like you could see a couple 
of just react to some shit.

1248
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,263
Well,
I feel sorry for people that don't have 

1249
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,290
a job where they can be creative.
I really do.

1250
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,260
I think whatever you're doing,
whatever it is,

1251
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,470
if you're a person who enjoys creating 
things,

1252
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,603
it's one of the most rewarding feelings 
of building something that wasn't there 

1253
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,530
before and then all of a sudden it's 
there and you made it.

1254
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,610
It's like there's,
it's very hard like completing a,

1255
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:15,390
an act like if you have,
you started set.

1256
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,820
Have you recorded anything yet?
Like a special.

1257
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:18,111
No,
no,

1258
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:18,480
no.
I,

1259
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,760
I did a spot on seth meyers in like July
of last year,

1260
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,930
my first arms.
Oh,

1261
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:26,000
okay.
On TV.

1262
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,180
How was,
that was a weird.

1263
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,913
No,
I mean it seems like a nice guy as a 

1264
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,120
man.

1265
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,040
I love seth.
I mean I,

1266
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,350
I met him before because at updates,
so he came upstairs and like hang out.

1267
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,360
Would it come hang out with us?
Um,

1268
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,160
the show itself was great.
You know,

1269
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,740
the process with,
with uh,

1270
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,653
the booker there,
it was very simple because they're like 

1271
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,990
big fans of comedy,
like seth is obviously a fan of comedy,

1272
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:47,790
but the lady that books a show is also a
big fan of comedy.

1273
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:52,230
So I was a bit nervous just because it 
was like my first time going on in front

1274
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:53,790
of millions of people,
whatever.

1275
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,560
People watched that.
Then I was just like,

1276
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,783
I got to make sure that my writing and 
my jokes come off as fucking strong as 

1277
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,760
possible and it went great.
You know,

1278
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:06,130
there's obviously some people trolls 
like talking shit on Youtube,

1279
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:09,260
but for the most part everyone's like,
man,

1280
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,350
it's fucking,
it's so tough not to.

1281
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,880
It's so tough.
Smart.

1282
00:56:14,881 --> 00:56:15,714
With the thing that you're doing with 
the instagram where you deleted every 

1283
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,790
day and then I can download.
I got it.

1284
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,693
I got to check,
like if anyone's hit me up for a Gig or 

1285
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,040
some shit,
but otherwise

1286
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,180
I'm just like,
I fucking hate all men.

1287
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,080
That's what I do.
I just don't.

1288
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,490
I mean you just develop habits,
you know,

1289
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,550
like,
but the problem is it's an itchy thing.

1290
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,960
Like you start,
you get itchy.

1291
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,133
It was check real quick.
Just take those times and just go over 

1292
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:39,514
your notes.
When you get itchy and you want to look 

1293
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,140
at your phone.
Like who?

1294
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,290
Who said this?
Someone said it.

1295
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,160
Someone said it really recently.
Oh God,

1296
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:50,050
I don't want to.
I want to fuck it up.

1297
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:55,051
Somebody said this in a tweet.
A wanna say it was Ted Alexandro.

1298
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,230
No,
mark normand was mark Norman.

1299
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,160
He,
he,

1300
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,320
he went up after I did A.
I did this.

1301
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,330
I did a talk about Columbia at one night
at the cellar and he went up after me.

1302
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,263
Immediately goes,
I don't know why the right knee mashed 

1303
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:11,980
up now.

1304
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,900
He's been bombing for years.
He's a shit.

1305
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,420
They crushed level.
The normans funny,

1306
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,650
but he's a man.
But he,

1307
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:24,610
uh,
he did a joke about how checking twitter

1308
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,710
is like opening up an empty refrigerator
and hoping that there's something new in

1309
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:32,200
there and they never asked.
He just go,

1310
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,430
fuck it.
Let me check it again.

1311
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,490
There's nothing in there.
It's like that same feeling.

1312
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,800
I botched his joke.
Ruined it,

1313
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:40,060
but I got it.
But that's,

1314
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,460
yeah,
that is really what it is.

1315
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,303
It's this weird compulsion,
this instantaneous gratification thing 

1316
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:50,710
that you're getting off of some weird 
dopamine hit by,

1317
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:55,090
by touching that device and getting 
information to pop up.

1318
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,040
But it's not satisfying.
There's nothing there.

1319
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,260
Nothing that you've ever been on a 
safari,

1320
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,490
a safari in Africa.
You mean you got to go.

1321
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,413
I went in April,
I spent all my money is gone on 

1322
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:07,720
engagement.

1323
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,553
Bringing fucking as,
as supplies is expensive and I don't 

1324
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,790
mean to sound.
Were you in one of those open air jeep?

1325
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,503
It's like,
that's when up until like April I went 

1326
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:20,140
in April.
I was just like,

1327
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,140
like addicted to my phone but like using
it too much,

1328
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:26,290
more or less.
But in Botswana where we went,

1329
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,450
obviously there's no server,
say anything.

1330
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,293
I'm just like fuck this shit.
And like the week even though just a 

1331
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,020
week of not being on this thing,
I was just like,

1332
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,380
I feel so much better.
You are,

1333
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,120
you,
you can think.

1334
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,043
Yeah.
And like the whole time you're in an 

1335
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:40,414
open air car and just like out,
like when was the last time you drove 

1336
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:50,041
for like an hour and there was nothing 
but like noise or like animals and shit.

1337
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,843
You know what I mean?
There's nothing but this like you the 

1338
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:54,250
air and just like hanging out.

1339
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,320
Just thinking shit.
Yeah.

1340
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:01,620
I hunt in every year.
I do three or four trips were like for a

1341
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,170
week basically lost in the woods.
Disconnected.

1342
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,240
It's the best.
It's the fucking.

1343
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,240
It's what's interesting.
Even in the hunting world,

1344
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,343
a lot of people like instagramming while
they're hunting and they're doing 

1345
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,300
instastories while they're out there in 
the forest.

1346
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,793
It's good when there's no connection 
when there's no service and no 

1347
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,560
connection,
it's good.

1348
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,423
You can just leave this shit away.
I broke my phone when I was in Hawaii 

1349
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,890
and I was there a Ozon Lanai,
which is a kind of a remote island.

1350
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:32,080
It's hard to get things there.
And so I,

1351
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,340
I just kept dropping my iphone.
I dropped,

1352
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:35,243
dropped that shit like 10 times and I 
dropped it and it just started making 

1353
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,410
phone calls.
I got,

1354
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,750
hold it up,
it would just open up my context.

1355
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:43,730
I will watch this and I was showing my 
wife,

1356
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:44,564
it just starts calling people like and I
hang up and starts calling another 

1357
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:48,860
person,
calling another person.

1358
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,030
Hang on.
I just broke it.

1359
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:52,690
It was just Jack.
And so I uh,

1360
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,103
I had to order a new one and then it got
to a point where wouldn't let me input 

1361
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,960
my code and it wouldn't recognize my 
face.

1362
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,070
It was like,
it was dead.

1363
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,570
It was like,
it was just fried.

1364
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,393
It took three days to get one.
So for three days I had no phone and it 

1365
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:10,310
was crazy.
It was crazy.

1366
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,020
I felt better,
I felt better.

1367
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,910
I was walking around,
but then I was like,

1368
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,050
well,
I can't wait to get my phone.

1369
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,760
Why I feel good without it.
Everyone knew around people you love the

1370
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:21,790
people you need to reach.
Like it's like,

1371
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,753
yeah,
what?

1372
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,520
You're not missing anything from Google.
Not Missing anything,

1373
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,340
but you feel like you are.
Check twitter,

1374
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,040
instagram,
instagram is,

1375
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,800
we're addicted to it to a point where 
it's like,

1376
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,620
it feels like cigarettes in the fifties 
where it's like no one.

1377
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,870
Here it is mark dorm and social media is
like,

1378
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:40,640
look in the fridge over and over,
you know,

1379
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,474
there's nothing good,
but you check it so many times that 

1380
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:45,230
eventually you start consuming things 
you don't even like.

1381
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,400
Yeah.
Even better.

1382
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,100
There we go.
Start bleeding.

1383
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:53,130
Tweet leftover 2,630
likes son is going to go up a lot now.

1384
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,930
Yeah,
probably.

1385
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,720
But um,
yeah,

1386
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,550
it's uh,
it's in my real fear is that this is one

1387
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,384
stage of a complete connection to 
electronics and to each other that's 

1388
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:08,803
unhealthy and unproductive and 
unavoidable because I don't think we're 

1389
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:13,004
gonna end with social media,
like twitter and instagram where it's 

1390
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:18,530
like you can just press a button,
get it.

1391
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,530
It's going to be completely connected to
your brain.

1392
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,500
Yeah.
We're going to have that fairly soon.

1393
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:25,334
I've,
I feel like within the next 10 years 

1394
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,373
that's going to be a normal thing that 
you can just pull up information 

1395
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,230
instantaneously.

1396
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,063
It's almost like the phone,
the watch thing feels almost like 

1397
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,220
wearing a digital watch.
No,

1398
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,063
this is a regular watch,
isn't my dad's Rato from like 1980 

1399
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:42,200
something.
They make such cool digital watches now.

1400
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:45,410
A lot of them look like that.
Look cool now.

1401
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,520
Yeah,
but that's.

1402
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:47,960
I think the next step is like,
oh,

1403
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:49,230
I can just do this.
I don't even got to.

1404
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,670
What's the prompt you.
It's like you can't reach in your pocket

1405
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,620
to check your shit.
Just got an iphone,

1406
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,660
watch whatever the fuck they call that 
thing.

1407
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:59,450
I watch and I wore it twice.
I was like,

1408
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:01,160
what am I doing with this thing?
I don't even like.

1409
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:02,330
It buzzes.
Oh,

1410
01:02:02,331 --> 01:02:02,841
okay,
cool.

1411
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:03,674
This person texted me.
You still got to fucking go on this 

1412
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:06,170
thing to say,
yeah,

1413
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,350
I'm not this enough.
Phone is enough.

1414
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,813
I mean,
the only thing that's good for is your 

1415
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:12,340
heart rate.

1416
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,180
It monitors your heart rate when you 
run.

1417
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,890
It's good for that.
It's called the race thing.

1418
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,773
Watching it.
It also logs the amount of time and 

1419
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:23,520
miles that you put in and your.
Your heart rate variability and all that

1420
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:25,650
stuff.
This is some good aspects to it in terms

1421
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,080
of a fitness tracker,
but other than that it's like,

1422
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,390
to what end,
what are you doing?

1423
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,760
What's going on?
But I don't run.

1424
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:35,550
So for me,
when Elan was on the podcast,

1425
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,384
he was talking to me about his neuro 
link thing that he's going to be coming 

1426
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:40,530
out with.
He said back then,

1427
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,690
and this was,
what was that three months ago?

1428
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,833
Somewhere around three months ago.
He said that they were going to be 

1429
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:49,500
coming out with it within four to six 
months.

1430
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,070
So that's any day now.
So I don't know what the fuck this is,

1431
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:57,540
but he said essentially it's gonna.
It's gonna open up the bandwidth between

1432
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,374
you and information that's going to 
radically change the way human beings 

1433
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:01,500
information.
Uh,

1434
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,950
it,
the way human beings access information.

1435
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,570
It's like a internet thing.
Wouldn't tell me why.

1436
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:11,940
That's all he would tell blink neurolink
yeah,

1437
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:12,870
because it's on,
you know,

1438
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:13,704
we were on air when he was saying it,
but I oddly trust him to be a 

1439
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,600
phenomenal,
a net positive for the universe.

1440
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,770
Oh,
100 percent.

1441
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:23,604
You know,
it was like Zuckerberg and like other 

1442
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:30,050
times net doesn't net negative for like 
they are the reasons.

1443
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,953
They are a lot of the reasons why 
society has gone the way it has because 

1444
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,710
you can confirm whatever the fuck.

1445
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,730
But Elan,
I'm like,

1446
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,163
yeah man,
why not fucking build a car that you 

1447
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:43,030
don't need any gasoline for?
Why not fucking send shit to this space?

1448
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,750
Yeah.
I think he's a net positive for us.

1449
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,660
I am 100 percent convinced he's a net 
positive.

1450
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,580
I think he's a legitimate genius and I 
don't think there's a lot of them.

1451
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,770
Yeah,
I think Mark Zuckerberg is a smart guy.

1452
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:56,970
He was very ambitious.
I think there's a big difference.

1453
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:57,913
Yeah,
and Zuckerberg quote that I read 

1454
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:03,900
recently that what's good for the world 
is not necessarily good for facebook.

1455
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:04,770
I'm like,
that's it.

1456
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,820
Shut it down.
He said that he burned it to the ground.

1457
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,800
That's all out.
Pull out,

1458
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,320
pull out.
He's let the fuck.

1459
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:14,300
Did you just say,
well,

1460
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,050
how much money do you have?
Jesus,

1461
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,750
first of all,
don't you have like $18,000,000,000?

1462
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,040
How much more do you need?

1463
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,873
Bitch,
you sitting over here talking about 

1464
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:26,250
what's good for facebook is not 
necessarily good for the good.

1465
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,000
You got all the good for 18 fucking 
hundred lifetimes.

1466
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,160
Jesus Christ.
He said that,

1467
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:36,180
that's exactly that.
My favorite Zuckerberg joke,

1468
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,790
uh,
we,

1469
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,033
we were at update and this was when 
Zuckerberg is a being grilled by 

1470
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:48,261
Congress and when he's sipping wine to 
like this and Chris rock comes by and he

1471
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:49,824
goes,
uh,

1472
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,750
you know what I didn't like about that 
trial.

1473
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:52,943
There's nothing worse than watching 
someone being grilled by Congress when 

1474
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:56,934
there's no stakes.
Nothing happens to mark Zuckerberg if 

1475
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,840
even if the shit goes worse for him,
nothing happens to that guy.

1476
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,990
Right?
That's my face.

1477
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:05,863
Like I'm just like,
you never think about it that way where 

1478
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:09,840
nothing happens to him.
If,

1479
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,240
if even if facebook blows up,
well,

1480
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:17,070
here's what could happen.
If facebook intentionally concluded,

1481
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,250
if there was some

1482
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
sort of proof that they received some 
financial compensation to lean one way 

1483
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,150
or the other.
Is that,

1484
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,590
is that was percolating right now?
No,

1485
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:30,424
but it could be.
This is what they were searching for 

1486
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,630
when they're searching for is what we're
trying to find out.

1487
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,523
How is it that these Russian bots are 
able to disseminate propaganda so 

1488
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:43,870
readily and so easily and so 
efficiently?

1489
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,000
What are you doing?
Stop that.

1490
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,750
How has all this stuff propagated?
Like where's this coming from?

1491
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,643
Yeah,
and the people that were asking were 

1492
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,230
techno ignorant and that was part of the
problem with Congress,

1493
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,520
so it was like a Google makes the iphone
right?

1494
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,823
Going to ask him to Google and say,
how come my niece has got bad words on 

1495
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:08,620
her iphone and someone has to tell them.
Google doesn't make the iphone the whole

1496
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:12,970
place roars.
Like when you go to Congress to laugh,

1497
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:15,310
like everybody's laughing at what a 
fucking idiot you are.

1498
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,240
These are the people that are asking the
question.

1499
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,970
That's terrifying.
Exactly.

1500
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:22,360
You need.
You need people from like ars Technica.

1501
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,190
You need people from like,
you know,

1502
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:29,230
a scene that you need people from.
You need fucking techno guys.

1503
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,363
People,
men and women who really understand 

1504
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:34,780
technology should be throwing those 
questions around Asians.

1505
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,420
Yeah,
and people with autism.

1506
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,703
You need people that really,
truly understand what the complications 

1507
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,060
are,
what,

1508
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:48,820
what the ramifications are and what they
could have done to prevent these things.

1509
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,893
I think that what happened with facebook
and what's happening with twitter and a 

1510
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,810
lot of these other things is no one 
anticipated the impact culturally.

1511
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:56,663
They were going to have the.
I was talking about this the other day 

1512
01:06:58,661 --> 01:06:59,494
about a with Sam j like maybe a few 
months ago about like how it's the 

1513
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:08,650
democratization of information and how 
easy it is to pretend like you know what

1514
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:09,370
you're talking about.

1515
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,130
That's like the majority of the problem,
like facebook,

1516
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:15,370
twitter,
all this shit because it used to be all.

1517
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:18,190
You need an infrastructure to spread 
news.

1518
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:22,060
You needed a fucking truck factory.
Now you don't even need pants.

1519
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:22,923
You could just fuck it.
Just got to put like a weird fucking 

1520
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:27,970
eagle on your website and it's like this
is the fucking news.

1521
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:28,804
Now.
Don't even have to have a website that 

1522
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,840
have a popular twitter account.
That's.

1523
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,723
There's a lot of people out there that 
have popular twitter accounts and when 

1524
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:37,250
you go to the twitter account,
and I.

1525
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,580
There's quite a few people that I 
followed that I don't follow.

1526
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,593
What that means is I bookmark their page
so that they don't even know that I 

1527
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:45,550
follow them because they're fucking 
insane.

1528
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,713
I don't want them sending me DDMS and 
I'll go and read their stuff and they 

1529
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,380
are on there all day.

1530
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:53,830
Yeah,
man,

1531
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:54,663
all day.
They're doing battle against the good 

1532
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:58,120
and the bad.
The dark forces in the light,

1533
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:03,450
they're just fucking going after it and 
they develop these sort of a news portal

1534
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:07,390
pages and you don't even know who the 
fuck these people are.

1535
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:08,224
You don't know anything about them but 
their page or it's all battling and I 

1536
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:14,760
know I follow people that are like 
hardcore right wing people that had just

1537
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,790
battling the lab.
They're hilarious.

1538
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,713
It's so silly.
And then I follow people that are hard 

1539
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,980
core lefties that are battling the 
right.

1540
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:22,993
Everyone's a Nazi and everyone's all 
right like you're outright for it 

1541
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,850
doesn't matter if you support every 
fucking single liberal principle.

1542
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:32,570
There is no

1543
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:33,403
the Oh the craziest shit about this.
This whole Columbia shit is that I was 

1544
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:43,031
featured on Breitbart.
They finally like a brown dude.

1545
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,910
I'm like,
I cannot be like,

1546
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:48,830
I got emails from people at Fox News 
like,

1547
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:49,664
Hey,
do you want to come on to show that 

1548
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:51,910
Dinesh D'souza Guy?
Right?

1549
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,900
Yeah,
they're fucking.

1550
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:53,983
I hate that guy.
I was about to say something bad guys 

1551
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,270
can't stand that motherfucker.
Well,

1552
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,104
he's the only brown guy that made it 
through him and him and fucking Bobby 

1553
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,213
Jindal like they're trying.
They're trying to turn me into this 

1554
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:06,051
motherfucker.
I'm like,

1555
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:08,930
I'm not coming on your fucking TV shows 
so you can use me as your.

1556
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:14,350
So everything's gone a muck and PC.
I've wished free speech was under attack

1557
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:16,130
because like,
some people need to shut the fuck up.

1558
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,040
You know what I mean?
Like this.

1559
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,460
There's too much shit.
Everyone has a podcast show me,

1560
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,160
you don't deserve to speak a lot of 
times.

1561
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,680
Fucking crazy.
Tell everybody get to,

1562
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,920
to get a podcast.
But now I stopped because,

1563
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:31,850
uh,
first of all,

1564
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:34,130
I don't think,
I don't think you can anymore.

1565
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,993
I think over the last few years it's 
getting so saturated that it's almost 

1566
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,240
impossible to break through.
On top of that.

1567
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:43,550
It's like some people,
I don't want to.

1568
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,384
Shit,
you don't need a everyone's opinion 

1569
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,143
about it like you.
You shouldn't have to fucking work to 

1570
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:50,684
develop,
to have the right to have an opinion 

1571
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,990
about some things.
Well you should.

1572
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,250
You definitely should have a good 
opinion.

1573
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,760
It should be something.
Well thought out nuance.

1574
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,760
There's no nuance anymore either.
It's because because everything's got to

1575
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:06,380
be black and white.
Especially with a lot.

1576
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,920
This younger generation was like,
if something's not black and white,

1577
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,920
it goes fucking arrive for them because 
they want it to be black and white,

1578
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,230
so they'll create a false narrative 
where it is black or white.

1579
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:15,540
Yes.

1580
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,373
That's the one thing that you see a lot 
today where people pretend that someone 

1581
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,460
is something and they,
they,

1582
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:24,300
they do this reductionist thing where 
they boil it down to one thing,

1583
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,493
you know,
he went on stage and said anti gay anti 

1584
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:32,880
black jokes at Columbia.
This guy's a piece of shit.

1585
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,860
All right.
Fucking doorway.

1586
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:38,610
He's a portal,
like an Indian portal to the outright.

1587
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,910
That's who you think I am as a magic 
carpet to the outright.

1588
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,980
Hey Man,
I wish I could.

1589
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,410
I wish I could just be offended all the 
time.

1590
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,740
You can seal very hard to hurt my 
feelings.

1591
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,130
Like your comment.
Yeah.

1592
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,880
It's like it's just so crazy.
I find me a comic.

1593
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,830
It's easy to hurt their feelings and 
they fucking suck.

1594
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,120
They suck.
You have to.

1595
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,840
It's fucking but was saying is like with
this right.

1596
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,913
Shit.
It was like everyone wants to put 

1597
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:07,670
somebody in and their own agenda.
This reduction is shit.

1598
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:08,504
I just like,
this is how I feel about it and look at 

1599
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:13,800
the points that make me seem smart.
Incorrect about this.

1600
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,160
Yeah,

1601
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,993
and they're trying to do that online in 
front of everybody instead of like this 

1602
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:21,270
internal examination of their actual 
feelings and how they really think about

1603
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:24,180
things and whether or not they make 
sense or whether or not it's objective.

1604
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,463
Instead of that they're broadcasting 
this and this sort of weird way that's 

1605
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,760
at least partially intentionally 
deceptive.

1606
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,420
Like the acknowledgement that there's 
some.

1607
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,180
That there is nuance,
there is no,

1608
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,110
life is fucking complicated and ideas 
are complicated.

1609
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:46,330
Especially ideas in terms of when 
you're.

1610
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:51,690
When you're talking about this cultural 
sort of battle that's going on right now

1611
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,003
between the you,
they're attacking people who are like 

1612
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,063
clearly very left wing,
but for not being left wing enough and 

1613
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,490
they're running out of target.

1614
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:07,540
I will bother me.
Someone hit me up saying,

1615
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:08,763
you haven't spoke out against the white 
supremacists and people that are 

1616
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,680
harassing,
uh,

1617
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:13,813
this group and these,
this blogger that's going off like Wah 

1618
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,220
Wah.
I'm like far as like,

1619
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,040
of course I didn't do not support any 
white supremacists.

1620
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,850
Anybody fucking going after these kids 
for whatever reason.

1621
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,210
What seeds are they talking about?
The Asian American alliance,

1622
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,850
like the Asian American lions posted 
some shit on facebook and like,

1623
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:31,684
all of these fucking crazy people have 
apparently been like talking shit to 

1624
01:12:33,911 --> 01:12:34,744
them.
And I'm like,

1625
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,680
that's.
I don't subcon I condemn that action.

1626
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,023
But second of all,
does my mere existence not testified to 

1627
01:12:44,321 --> 01:12:45,820
the fact that I'm not,
I'm not.

1628
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:50,800
Pro is my name.
Nicholas Patterson.

1629
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:54,910
Fucking Nimesh Patel is the most Indian 
motherfucking name I could think of.

1630
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,990
Like like,
I'm going to call up someone at the KKK,

1631
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:01,750
but hey guys,
thank you.

1632
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,800
That is hilarious that you have not 
denounced white supremacists.

1633
01:13:05,801 --> 01:13:09,440
So by your,
your Dave decided that you haven't acted

1634
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,380
enough.
Sometimes there'll be a story online and

1635
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:13,214
I will get a tweet with someone.
Say Your silence about this story is 

1636
01:13:15,861 --> 01:13:17,240
deafening.
I was like,

1637
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:19,250
what?
Fucking starting broad.

1638
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,370
I didn't pay attention to half the shit.
I can't,

1639
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:22,803
but I cannot.
Like someone had to tell me that that 

1640
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:27,020
was happening before I was like,
oh,

1641
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:29,010
okay,
that's fucking whack out.

1642
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,670
I'll respond some way.

1643
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,643
Also,
I want to think about things before I 

1644
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:33,450
respond.
Yeah.

1645
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,910
You know,
when the Louis ck thing went down,

1646
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,833
I got a lot of angry tweets into one of 
them from a fucking journalists that 

1647
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:41,574
I've done stories with.
I've done interviews with this guy 

1648
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,034
before and he was talking shit about 
comedians that have not denounced Louis 

1649
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,251
C k.
and I'm like,

1650
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:51,390
hey man,
I just like,

1651
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:54,840
you don't know what really happened.
I don't know the whole story.

1652
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,360
I know what he said and I know what she 
said.

1653
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,530
And,
uh,

1654
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,860
the whole thing seems to me like a big 
old cluster fuck even.

1655
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,440
Okay,
let's,

1656
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,660
let's put it this way.
Like,

1657
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:04,943
like you can denounce his actions.
If he said he did all this shit that he 

1658
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:10,850
mess.
Ew,

1659
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,190
that's gross.

1660
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,083
Yeah.
I think what he did was incorrect and 

1661
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:16,450
wrong.
But the fact that like,

1662
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:19,950
you should denounce that you should not 
be working again.

1663
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,823
I'm like,
you forget I'm also a comic and be 

1664
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,733
murderers.
Make parole dog like the fucking you 

1665
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:28,270
got.
Where does it end?

1666
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:29,104
Almost there's,
there's some things that you should be 

1667
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,144
way more upset about.
How about a hastert the guy who's the 

1668
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:38,431
speaker of the house who went to jail 
for fucking kids and he molested a bunch

1669
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,320
of kids and he only got 15 months.
What?

1670
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,640
Yeah.
That's.

1671
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,170
I didn't even know that.
That's crazy.

1672
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:45,043
Exactly that.
So meanwhile everybody is ranting and 

1673
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:47,730
railing about Louis C,
k.

1674
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,680
not that this diminishes what Lucy Kay 
did,

1675
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:51,763
but I'm saying there's some real horrors
in the world and to choose to 

1676
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,760
concentrate on the comedian who asked 
women,

1677
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,170
can I jerk off in front of you?

1678
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,970
They said yes,
and he did it.

1679
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:06,330
He didn't hold anybody in a room against
their will or force them to watch him or

1680
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:11,740
what he did was just gross and he 
stopped doing it like more than 10 years

1681
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,630
ago.
It's not good,

1682
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:14,763
but the fact that someone would think 
that I need to make a statement about 

1683
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:17,651
it,
like bitch,

1684
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:19,060
I don't need to make a statement about 
anything.

1685
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,200
I don't need to talk about anything.
I don't want to talk to him about like,

1686
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,720
who are you?
It's so quick.

1687
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,240
We automatically,
when I say we,

1688
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:33,130
I mean people at large sort of assume 
the worst about a person immediately.

1689
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,710
I think it's also this social media 
thing.

1690
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,280
Yeah.
It's,

1691
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,113
I don't think they really assume that.
I think they just have this opportunity 

1692
01:15:40,211 --> 01:15:41,044
to express themselves in a way that 
they're going to get a reaction out of 

1693
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:43,900
you and this is the way to do it.

1694
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,011
I also,
you know,

1695
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:45,844
what's crazy is that like I,
we've been harping on this younger 

1696
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:50,314
generation,
but I've said some shit at like seller 

1697
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:53,134
and Vu,
like very anti trump shit and people 

1698
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:58,240
have been like,
when I view the sellers,

1699
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,160
one of the other clubs,
I said,

1700
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,930
um,
I forgot what I said about trump.

1701
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:04,960
I basically fat shaming because I think 
he's a fat piece of shit,

1702
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:05,794
but like I said,
more articulate in joke form and some 

1703
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:11,770
guy got up and I was like,
fuck this,

1704
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,260
and it just bounced.
And I'm like,

1705
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,393
that's what you're mad about.
You not mad about the fact that he is 

1706
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:19,414
that,
that your president is a billionaire 

1707
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:24,220
that doesn't use his money to just hire 
a personal trainer once in a while.

1708
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,083
Like adderall.
Mcdonald's diet is not the way you want 

1709
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:30,490
your fucking president to be living in 
his life more or less.

1710
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,520
And this person just got up and bounce 
them because it's heated.

1711
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,320
And I talked to him after I was like,
what?

1712
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,820
What do you,
what are you mad about?

1713
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,700
So I think it's just as he say,
he was like,

1714
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:43,240
I don't like the words that you were 
using is very crude from Nebraska,

1715
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,083
Florida.

1716
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,123
Look Man,
I'm not gonna like the words you were 

1717
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:53,320
using it at the comedy cellar.
Vulgar on like on like dog.

1718
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,440
Like come on man.
You're like,

1719
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,450
that's what I'm saying.
I feel like it's fixed.

1720
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,333
Like just have a safe space for comics 
were like where there's a sign that the 

1721
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:04,720
seller and I was a swim at your own 
risk.

1722
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,810
You coming down like weird.
You're here to see us.

1723
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:11,930
I'm not here to fucking song.
Sing a dance for you guys.

1724
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:13,910
You guys are here.
This is an exchange.

1725
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:14,744
This is an exchange.
This is an agreement that all you have 

1726
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:18,500
to do is not laugh or laugh.

1727
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,860
Well,
it's also the people that are going down

1728
01:17:21,861 --> 01:17:25,640
to see that stuff that like it expect 
you to do that kind of comedy.

1729
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,880
They expect you to go hard.
Right?

1730
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:28,813
That's what it's about.
If I go there and everybody's pulling 

1731
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,184
back,
all of a sudden I'm at the tonight show 

1732
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,910
and all of a sudden I'm at a Jimmy 
Fallon monologue.

1733
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:35,391
Like,
well,

1734
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:37,100
well,
well that's someone that came here for.

1735
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,293
I came here to have a couple of drinks 
and here's some crazy shift from greer 

1736
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:41,690
barnes.
You know what I mean?

1737
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,550
This,
I want to hear some real standup.

1738
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:47,390
I don't want to hear this stupid shit.
And you know,

1739
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,733
people that can't handle some offensive 
stuff that you shouldn't be at a comedy 

1740
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:55,670
club.
This is where people go to say offensive

1741
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,730
stuff that's like you don't want dirt in
your hands and you're in a garden.

1742
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,610
Like this is stupid.
What?

1743
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,830
Like manage some expectations.
Yeah.

1744
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,110
It was just was like,
hey,

1745
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:05,270
but people politically,
man,

1746
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,104
when you get into their,
you know their team and you're shitting 

1747
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:10,190
on their team,
he's probably Republican.

1748
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,770
Of course he has brain damage.
He's living in Florida.

1749
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,970
Water's tough.
Everything's.

1750
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:21,030
To me it's like this,
like politically like people are,

1751
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,910
are so like that's part of their 
personality.

1752
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:29,911
Almost were like having.
I have done a lot of political comedy,

1753
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,980
you know,
and to me it's like when you do that,

1754
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,260
you're almost talking to them as,
as if their politics are their person,

1755
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:38,980
like,
like,

1756
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,560
and that's the kind of crazy thing.
Like I don't,

1757
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,130
my politics are not necessarily who I am
as a human being.

1758
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:45,964
Like I can,
I'm pretty liberal when it comes to 

1759
01:18:48,431 --> 01:18:49,264
social issues but might be fairly 
conservative when it comes to financial 

1760
01:18:52,631 --> 01:18:54,220
issues and fiscal issues and I'm just 
like,

1761
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,553
don't take what,
who I voted for it to be who I am as a 

1762
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:00,094
human being.
There's no one has that nuance anymore 

1763
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:02,884
about anything.

1764
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,790
Yeah,
it's an identity issue.

1765
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:09,870
People find whatever team it is,
whether it's progressive or conservative

1766
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:14,110
and they just decide this is my identity
and they cloak themselves in it and then

1767
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:14,944
they defend it and some,
someone that someone like yourself was 

1768
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:18,034
saying jokes that are contrary to that.
I am talking shit about their 

1769
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,524
quarterback.
Quarterback is about to get fucking pop 

1770
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:31,980
to Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ every day.

1771
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,150
It's like he's still there,
Huh?

1772
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:34,200
I've

1773
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,380
never fucking last two weeks.
I've never like,

1774
01:19:37,381 --> 01:19:38,214
wanted more like trump to say something 
wild just so people would stop fucking 

1775
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,930
just stopped seeing emails and fucking 
new Google alerts about Nimesh Patel,

1776
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:46,764
whatever.
Just like,

1777
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,870
look,
this guy's crazy,

1778
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:50,730
man.
Well you shouldn't be googling your name

1779
01:19:50,731 --> 01:19:51,564
first of all.
Definitely shouldn't be reading that 

1780
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,800
stuff.
Deleted the Google alerts.

1781
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:56,240
I deleted all that shit.
Yo.

1782
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,510
It was crazy.
My mom,

1783
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,433
once my,
once my mom didn't even tell my parents 

1784
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,620
that that should happen.
Uh,

1785
01:20:01,621 --> 01:20:02,454
what they heard my dad works at a liquor
store and someone came with a copy of 

1786
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:10,770
the post and be like,
on the second page is me.

1787
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,080
It's like that's your son.
Right?

1788
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,710
And then the post say they talking shit 
about,

1789
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:17,490
you know,
they were,

1790
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:21,520
they were like,
can you believe these fucking kids?

1791
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,880
Good.
And then went in here and then,

1792
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:25,050
uh,
and then,

1793
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,333
and then I was like,
it was still dead because up until that 

1794
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:28,674
point everyone is sort of like,
it's more just like the pushing the 

1795
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:35,670
narrative that everyone's kind of soft 
Thursday morning,

1796
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,170
uh,
like four days,

1797
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,033
five days after it happened,
I got a text from Lenny Marcus at like 

1798
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:41,970
8:00
in the morning saying,

1799
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,800
hey man,
you're trending on Yahoo.

1800
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,300
I'm like,
I'm trending,

1801
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:46,873
trending.
I'm number one on Yahoo News Thursday 

1802
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,060
morning.
And I'm like.

1803
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,180
And then like that day my mom texted me 
just say,

1804
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,150
Hey,
what happened at Columbia?

1805
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,360
I said,
I didn't get in.

1806
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,223
That was the only thing I said.
And then she calls me and she's like 

1807
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:02,610
telling me like,
what did you do as your career?

1808
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:03,300
Okay.
I'm like,

1809
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,400
I'm fine.
His kids,

1810
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,130
they didn't like the joke I said.
And like I didn't really,

1811
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:09,964
I didn't tell them is it's sold that 
even for them to get stand up has been 

1812
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,240
such an uphill battle for parents.
Yeah.

1813
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:17,220
Just to be like,
what are you doing up until like for the

1814
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:18,054
two years I was unemployed and like 
living at home and go into the city 

1815
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:24,450
every night because I'm from Jersey,
so I'll go to the city every night to do

1816
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:25,284
stand up.
They're like,

1817
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,600
what the fuck is,
what are you doing with your life?

1818
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,630
Right.
And so even up until then it come see me

1819
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:32,760
until like seven,
seven years in.

1820
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,110
That's good.
Yeah.

1821
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:35,880
That's good.
You get your legs under you?

1822
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,950
Yeah.
That brought him to the seller was dope.

1823
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,813
You know,
parents came to see me like a year in 

1824
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,553
they shit.
But you can't do that dog still doing 

1825
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:50,040
open mics,
man.

1826
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,030
Joe,
we're going to fix your room up again.

1827
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,210
Changed.
What are you doing?

1828
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,400
Cleaning the basement out.
It's not gonna work.

1829
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,800
But.
So when my mom saw it,

1830
01:21:58,801 --> 01:22:00,450
she called me and she's like,
what happened?

1831
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:01,410
I'm like,
my career is going to be.

1832
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,510
Don't worry about any of that.
Kind of better than ever.

1833
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,860
Boots,
mom.

1834
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,600
Yeah.
This is,

1835
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,433
this is,
this will be a positive thing that 

1836
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:08,574
happens is I'm going through some shit 
now just from like fucking my own 

1837
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,000
hoisted by my own petard situation,
like reading the news and all this shit,

1838
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:18,820
but this will be a positive thing and 
like I didn't expect them to sign it.

1839
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,880
They got it in that.
I was like,

1840
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,980
that's the end of that was just like the
facts of what happened.

1841
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:25,110
Well,
you've got some things on your side.

1842
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:28,130
You've got like tangible success point 
was like,

1843
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,003
oh,
it seems like it's got some momentum 

1844
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:30,710
there.
Yeah,

1845
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:31,290
yeah,
yeah.

1846
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,123
It's gonna be hard to stop that train 
with anything other than a real 

1847
01:22:33,811 --> 01:22:34,860
catastrophe.
Oh yeah.

1848
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:36,450
I mean the,
they also know that I haven't.

1849
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:38,163
It's also very apparent in every article
that was printed or whatever that most 

1850
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:47,040
people are on my side so to speak,
and I'm a hundred percent confident.

1851
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:51,150
I did nothing wrong from a human as a 
human being or a comic,

1852
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:51,984
you know,
like maybe reading the room would have 

1853
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:56,760
been a thing I did,
but I was like,

1854
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,230
I was like,
I know these people.

1855
01:22:58,231 --> 01:22:59,860
These are my fucking brethren,
like I,

1856
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,993
I like,
I fucking took calculus with you people 

1857
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,113
I know,
I know the kind of Shit that me and my 

1858
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,353
Asian friends and my Indian friends 
we'll talk when we were in fucking 

1859
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,100
school like this.
This is fucking light work.

1860
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:12,880
Right?
Right.

1861
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,010
And so,
so maybe that.

1862
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:16,060
But even then I'm like,
no,

1863
01:23:16,061 --> 01:23:16,894
fuck that.
I'm not going to fucking think about 

1864
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:21,130
that going awry.
You know what I mean?

1865
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,540
But yeah,
it was,

1866
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,820
it was crazy.
Yeah.

1867
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:26,303
Well it's,
it's an educational experience and net 

1868
01:23:28,231 --> 01:23:29,064
positive overall without a doubt.
And it also gives us an opportunity to 

1869
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:34,320
make fun of these kids,
which I think they need.

1870
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,860
They need to realize that the world 
thinks they're fools in the eye.

1871
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:41,700
And I really believed that all.
I've read several articles on your case,

1872
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:46,790
your situation rather your case caught a
case like a comedy me to,

1873
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:50,940
you know,
all the articles that I've read were all

1874
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:54,640
essentially positive and they were all,
you know,

1875
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,230
mocking these fucking little children.

1876
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,263
I want to,
I want to say for the record that eyes 

1877
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,960
on the record,
I still think that it was,

1878
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:06,260
I still think that it's the minority of 
that group,

1879
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:08,660
especially at Columbia for sure.
Sure.

1880
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,910
You know,
like it's just that they happen to like.

1881
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,763
Because the majority of the kids were 
like amped and like had a good time and 

1882
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:15,100
even if

1883
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,020
that can happen though word,
some majority,

1884
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,913
a majority can like you in a minority 
can stand up and then the majority 

1885
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:21,870
doesn't do anything about it.
Yes,

1886
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,680
go,
that shit hurt my feelings.

1887
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:24,751
No,
no,

1888
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:25,584
no.
Those kids,

1889
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,490
those kids saying like,
let them stay,

1890
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:29,510
let them stay.
But it wasn't like a chorus which is,

1891
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,820
I would have hoped,
but I'm,

1892
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,840
you know,
they're a little fucking babies and they

1893
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:35,674
need to hear it.
They need to hit it a little babies 

1894
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:38,650
because that's how you grow up.
You know,

1895
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:39,484
you,
you do something ridiculous and that 

1896
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:42,100
people criticize you and then you 
realize,

1897
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,690
oh,
I'm kind of ridiculous.

1898
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,063
Let me just check myself.
Than it hurts your feelings and you 

1899
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:49,330
fight it off for a little bit.
You try to pretend you battle it,

1900
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,343
but overall over the course of time 
you're going to absorb that information 

1901
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:58,030
and hopefully those kids are going to 
grow and mature.

1902
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,200
I mean I have friends that were like 
completely progressive,

1903
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:03,093
Weirdo,
crazy off the charts like activists 10 

1904
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:12,450
years ago and now they're like way,
way mellow and they've just like,

1905
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,323
what was wrong with me?
I was virtue signaling I was trying too 

1906
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:16,564
hard and they realized like the,
a lot of what they were doing was just 

1907
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,624
wasting energy and it was just,
just a lot of angst and a lot of just 

1908
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:26,140
trying to,
trying to affect change in order to make

1909
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:28,600
themselves feel better,
you know what I mean?

1910
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,740
Trying to push buttons in order to 
validate their existence.

1911
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:34,810
That's what a lot of that,
that specific.

1912
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:37,740
I felt like it was like it was either 
like a note.

1913
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:41,550
We have an opportunity to assert our 
sort of rightness,

1914
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,013
however wrong it is here and this is,
we're going to take a stand and this is 

1915
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:48,680
who we are.
You know,

1916
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,340
just just chill.
Yeah,

1917
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,190
chill the fuck out.
What the fuck?

1918
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:54,030
Yeah,
it's,

1919
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:54,863
there's a lot of foolishness,
but this is the world we live in and I 

1920
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:57,714
think there's a big part of that 
accentuated by the fact that we have a 

1921
01:26:00,571 --> 01:26:02,310
maniac for president.
Yo.

1922
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,070
Yeah,
water is because

1923
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,490
they feel like that eval needs to be 
combated at every turn because we didn't

1924
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,593
before and we let this guy get into 
office and now here he is and the 

1925
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:14,480
Mueller probe and all this fucking 
craziness.

1926
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:17,720
When Obama was president,
she felt a lot cooler.

1927
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,130
Now it's like trump is president.
Everyone was like,

1928
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,060
oh shit,
man.

1929
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:23,894
Bunker down.
Now we realize all you have to do is be 

1930
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:27,860
popular and you can be president.
Like that's insane.

1931
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,750
Yeah.
I used to be.

1932
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,643
You had to be qualified.
We used to think that you understood 

1933
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,120
national policy,
foreign policy,

1934
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:35,954
you understood defense.
You understood exactly what's going on 

1935
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:40,370
with the economy.
Basic English.

1936
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:40,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

1937
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:44,240
That guy doesn't know shit.
He's just trying to make buddy.

1938
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:47,540
And wouldn't you love to be a fly on the
wall?

1939
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,403
I would.
Cause what we're getting all the crazy 

1940
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:51,950
is him when he knows cameras are on him.

1941
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,933
Oh yeah.
I would love to see what he's like 

1942
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,633
alone,
like what I would love to see him like 

1943
01:26:58,311 --> 01:26:59,144
watch Fox News.
I like to like sit in our cheeseburger 

1944
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,980
just fucking crazy.
He's a crazy person.

1945
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,020
It's really weird,
man.

1946
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:06,873
It's,
it's unnerving and that's what I think 

1947
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:13,830
like what a lot of what we're seeing on,
especially with this particular thing is

1948
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:14,984
the thing where it's like you don't have
control in any other facet of your life 

1949
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,273
necessarily,
so you're going to try to exert it in a 

1950
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,124
way that you think is positive when in 
fact you're doing the opposite of what 

1951
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:26,830
you,
your,

1952
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,450
your liberal sensibilities are.
Yeah.

1953
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:30,643
I think it's also a trend and I think 
that political correctness and it comes 

1954
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:38,570
in waves and it existed.
It was pretty,

1955
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:40,890
pretty strong in the eighties.
You know,

1956
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,803
political correctness was washing over 
people in the eighties and destroy rap 

1957
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:48,260
and shit coming back and it'll go away 
again.

1958
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:51,590
People get sick of it and it'd be 
ridiculous and people will rebel against

1959
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,663
political correctness in it,
but I think overall the culture is 

1960
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:59,210
trying to adjust,
is trying to self adjust.

1961
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,253
We're trying to the the actual culture,
the as a whole is trying to eliminate 

1962
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,700
racism and eliminate sexism and 
eliminate bias,

1963
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,310
which are good noble goals.
They're good noble goals,

1964
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:11,503
but along the ways you have these polar 
extremes of people that are doing it 

1965
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:16,070
wrong.
Poor execution,

1966
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:20,510
terrible execution level understanding 
and it's also strange to me,

1967
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:25,511
it's like what utopia are you trying to 
create by silencing stuff?

1968
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:28,730
Because just because you do that,
just because you say,

1969
01:28:28,731 --> 01:28:29,564
oh,
you can't say racist shit doesn't mean 

1970
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:31,873
it goes away.
Or you can't say sexual shit doesn't 

1971
01:28:33,171 --> 01:28:34,004
mean it's a.
that's more like you're treating the 

1972
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:38,830
symptom and not the disease.
Right.

1973
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,750
But in their defense,
jogging my very specific platform.

1974
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:43,130
Right.
This is a stage.

1975
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:45,530
If you had actually said something 
actually racist,

1976
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,813
then it would make sense that hey,
we don't want anybody telling racists 

1977
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:50,380
100 percent.
Right?

1978
01:28:50,381 --> 01:28:51,270
Yeah.
So they.

1979
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:54,020
But they wanted it to be racist.
Yeah.

1980
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:54,854
That's the thing.
It's like you just fucking take a 

1981
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:57,224
minute,
take a second to relax and once I get 

1982
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:02,100
it,
is that what utopia

1983
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:05,100
have you read about that's ever been 
real?

1984
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:07,680
Like every book we read in high school,
College,

1985
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:09,420
brave new world,
Lord of the flies,

1986
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:13,860
19 eight or animal farm like the giver,
we were in fucking middle school.

1987
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,900
That's all a utopia but this fuck that 
fucking killing babies and you know,

1988
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,933
goes south.
It's all a fucking false utopia kind of 

1989
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:23,250
situation.
There's,

1990
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,560
there is hate speech in the world.
One hundred percent.

1991
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:27,630
You know you don't want it on your 
platform,

1992
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,670
but you've got to decide what is hate 
speech,

1993
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:32,220
when is it really hate speech and when 
is it just ignorance.

1994
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,353
And sometimes the best way to combat bad
speech is to let that speech play out 

1995
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:42,180
and let good speech overwhelm it with 
logic and reason and a better argument.

1996
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,020
That's really what freedom of speech is 
supposed to be all about.

1997
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,310
That we work all this out.

1998
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:51,320
As soon as you start censoring voices 
and telling people that you're not going

1999
01:29:51,321 --> 01:29:53,670
to allow them to talk,
boy you,

2000
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,690
you,
you start,

2001
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,613
you create this atmosphere where you can
start to choose what you're going to 

2002
01:29:59,571 --> 01:30:00,404
allow through and when you're not going 
to allow through and then you're going 

2003
01:30:01,741 --> 01:30:04,530
to start censoring things that are far 
more subtle.

2004
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,820
You're going to start censoring things 
that they don't seem reasonable,

2005
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,910
but you've decided that it's already 
okay to sensor,

2006
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:15,480
so you've censored this person nagging 
to sensor the next worst thing.

2007
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:16,723
You're going to go down the line until 
it's just people that disagree with you 

2008
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:19,771
and then you're like,
oh,

2009
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:22,380
well my world is perfect now,
when in fact,

2010
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:25,150
it's actually just a bunch of people 
that are talking shit about you.

2011
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,993
You just don't happen to know about it.
Are you familiar with what's going on 

2012
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:31,070
with Patrion with A.

2013
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,053
No.
There's a bunch of podcast pay for him 

2014
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,630
or you can pay for shit with Patriana.
Well,

2015
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:38,310
yeah,
you can pay for things,

2016
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:40,020
but it's not necessarily just for 
podcast,

2017
01:30:40,021 --> 01:30:42,510
but people do use it for podcasts,
but they use it for many things.

2018
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,710
But there's this guy,
his name is Carl Benjamin,

2019
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:49,860
and he goes by the name of Sargon are 
our cod,

2020
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,993
and he considers himself a,
would you call a classic British 

2021
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:57,090
liberal,
which is more leans,

2022
01:30:57,091 --> 01:31:00,000
more conservative than our idea of what 
a liberal is,

2023
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,760
but essentially it's more of a liberal 
libertarian.

2024
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:03,630
Toward what,
how would you,

2025
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:07,020
how would you describe a classic British
liberal?

2026
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:07,854
Like what would be the definitely google
that first of the name would be Carl 

2027
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,031
Benjamin.
I mean,

2028
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:13,510
that's a strong name.
Well,

2029
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,570
Sargon of a cod.
His,

2030
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:16,230
his,
uh,

2031
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:20,110
his screen name and he has a youtube 
channel and uh,

2032
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,400
he said something on a podcast,
not even his own.

2033
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,920
He was a guest on another channel and he
said something about white supremacist.

2034
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:32,874
He was talking about these white 
supremacists that are acting up and 

2035
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:37,500
doing all these horrible things.
And he said,

2036
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,920
and this is,
it's a poorly formed thought.

2037
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:46,190
But what he said essentially said was,
you guys are being niggers almost.

2038
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:48,900
You act like white niggers.
This is his word.

2039
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,580
Jesus said,
this is what he's saying.

2040
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,090
You're acting like a bunch of niggers.
Just so you know,

2041
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:54,924
you act like white niggers.
I'm sorry if you heard that word and so 

2042
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:58,020
finding you right now ladies and 
gentlemen,

2043
01:31:58,021 --> 01:31:58,854
I'm just reading a set exactly how you 
described black people acting is the 

2044
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:03,910
impression I get dealing with the.
All right.

2045
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,253
I'm really,
I'm just not in the mood to deal with 

2046
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,640
this kind of disrespect.
So that's a very fun,

2047
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:11,733
very.
It's a very poorly thought out way of 

2048
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,280
expressing himself.

2049
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:17,733
That's what I'm thinking.
I'm reading this and I think also 

2050
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:21,723
sometimes people like using that word to
shock and they think they can get away 

2051
01:32:25,031 --> 01:32:27,580
with it and you know when you're using 
it,

2052
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,230
what's this,
what's this?

2053
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:32,110
What's the context of this is it.
But it also said,

2054
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:32,944
here,
look,

2055
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,590
you carry on,
but you don't expect me to have a debate

2056
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:37,960
with one of your faggots.
Like why would I bother?

2057
01:32:37,961 --> 01:32:38,794
Okay.
Now that is more egregious because that 

2058
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,913
is.
I mean if you're just dealing with 

2059
01:32:44,771 --> 01:32:46,630
censoring words,
there's not.

2060
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:51,631
He's not using that saying you're acting
like the way you call gay people.

2061
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,750
He's not saying that.
He's like calling someone a gay slur.

2062
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:57,820
He's saying,
and again and again,

2063
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,910
so this was just what they had decided 
to use.

2064
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,830
Now I don't agree with any of these 
things.

2065
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:04,300
He said,
this is what I'm reading this.

2066
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,133
I'm like,
this is,

2067
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:10,950
these are poorly thought out arguments.
This is a poorly thought out sentence.

2068
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,630
It's not,
well,

2069
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,100
just stop scrolling there for a second.
Put that back up.

2070
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,170
It's not,
it's not well thought out.

2071
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,400
Not at all.
Not Good.

2072
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,193
So they've.
But this has nothing to do with his 

2073
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:26,590
patrion page isn't even having to do 
with his,

2074
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,263
his channel.
This is something he made this comment 

2075
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:35,350
as a part of a longer wide ranging 
interview with a youtuber name Michelle,

2076
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,960
Katelyn,
Katelyn,

2077
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:39,003
and you can watch the full interview on 
this says chatting with Sargon of a cod 

2078
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,510
about the liberalist community.
Um,

2079
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,550
so he,
you know,

2080
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:53,230
it was free flowing.
Many set a bunch of really stupid things

2081
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,093
that.
But what he was trying to say is that 

2082
01:33:57,011 --> 01:33:57,844
these people are behaving exactly the 
way they do when they try to say racist 

2083
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:07,900
things about black people.

2084
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:12,440
Essentially they're behaving exactly the
way they're describing.

2085
01:34:12,441 --> 01:34:15,160
Yeah.
Race in a racist way,

2086
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,253
it's just not well thought out.
I mean like this guy needs a class and 

2087
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:22,210
how to fucking be articulate.
I mean Jesus Christ,

2088
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:24,000
but that's,
that's what I'm getting from this.

2089
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,063
Patrion decided to remove him because of
that and there's many people that feel 

2090
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:33,910
like that's not exactly why they did it,
that they were looking for an excuse and

2091
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:37,840
it's really because his anti liberal 
bias.

2092
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,033
So they were.
A lot of people are disgusted by the 

2093
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:44,704
idea that Patrion is now censoring 
voices and the deciding who should or 

2094
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:50,884
should not be able to receive donations 
from their fans based on their own 

2095
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,250
personal political.

2096
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,143
So this is the argument now and it's a,
it's an interesting thing that's popped 

2097
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:06,560
up because people like Sam Harris who is
very left.

2098
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,630
I mean,
he gets accused of being all right,

2099
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:12,350
was kind of hilarious,
but he's very progressive and you know,

2100
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,243
he's a public intellectual and he's 
decided this is a moment where he is 

2101
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:22,841
going to pull his patriotic account down
because he doesn't like the way they are

2102
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,134
choosing to censor people and d platform
people based entirely on something that 

2103
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:31,814
has nothing to do with anything he's 
done on their platform and it's 

2104
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:36,730
something to do with something that was 
out there on,

2105
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,900
on another channel.
So it's one of those weird little battle

2106
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,030
ground situation.
But I do think like,

2107
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,040
uh,
the patrons a private enterprise,

2108
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:46,271
right?
Yeah.

2109
01:35:46,271 --> 01:35:49,730
So they can do whatever the fuck they 
want and essentially they can and did.

2110
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,053
So then people can decide that they 
don't want to deal with Patriot because 

2111
01:35:53,631 --> 01:35:56,750
Patriot doesn't support free speech,
free speech.

2112
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,213
The argument would go that free speech 
is not just supporting speech that you 

2113
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:04,064
agree with for true free speech is 
letting people express themselves right 

2114
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,440
now,
the way he expressed himself,

2115
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:13,220
they're not very good.
Clumsy,

2116
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:14,600
right?
Heavier.

2117
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:18,020
That's an understatement though.
Like your thoughts on it this year,

2118
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:19,970
you've never seen this before,
what are your thoughts on it?

2119
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:20,863
I'm like,
dude,

2120
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:25,220
I mean it's such a bad choice of words 
is such a way to just.

2121
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,880
If I'm,
if I'm person reading that,

2122
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,650
unlike my immediate,
my eye goes,

2123
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,240
you said what you can't.
Like,

2124
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:33,074
it's such an offensive word where you 
can't even go there immediately 

2125
01:36:35,901 --> 01:36:38,450
distracts from the point that you're 
trying to make.

2126
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,060
So it's a good way of putting it.
You know,

2127
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:40,933
it's,
it's such like a just needed you need 

2128
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:45,200
like I don't think that guy,
I don't know if he's racist or not,

2129
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:48,470
but like I don't think he is,
but your immediate reaction is like this

2130
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,350
guy,
you can't do that.

2131
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:51,943
You have,
you have fundamentally destroyed 

2132
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:57,860
whatever point you were trying to make 
because of your choice.

2133
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,290
It's like a,
you could be trying to save.

2134
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,800
I can't think of the analogy now,
but like it's,

2135
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,580
it's such a distracting choice of words.
Yeah.

2136
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:08,100
That's a great way of putting it,
you know?

2137
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,980
Yeah.
It's like if he could have said,

2138
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:12,290
and by the way,
like all conversations,

2139
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:13,640
including this one,
right,

2140
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:15,620
like I'm trying to formulate these 
opinions on the fly.

2141
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:16,480
So are you.
Yeah,

2142
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:17,653
that was what he was doing on the fly.
I don't think there's anything he 

2143
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:23,920
prepared.
So I think that damn dog,

2144
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,833
I mean that wasn't vetted.
He's gone over that with a fucking 

2145
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:31,130
highlighter.
That is the key points.

2146
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:33,320
And once I hit on had been a few 
websites.

2147
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:34,154
I don't know,
I was trying to look up the ones 

2148
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:36,290
exactly.
But I know for instance,

2149
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:37,190
on twitch,
uh,

2150
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,133
in the last year they've changed things 
on the terms of service that kind of 

2151
01:37:40,641 --> 01:37:42,800
what you do broadly,
yes.

2152
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:45,470
Affects what you do on anyone to catch 
the problem with that.

2153
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,333
What you just saying right now is the 
guy who's the CEO of Patriot actually 

2154
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,290
went on.
Dave Rubin's show,

2155
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:56,010
the Rubin report and said that they're 
only concerned with things that

2156
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,310
happen on Patrion is that,
that's what they focus on.

2157
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:05,030
Then they changed that after this 
because here's the problem,

2158
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:07,463
like I see their point with this,
this particular thing that this guy 

2159
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:13,494
said.
I see how they find that offensive and 

2160
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:16,764
if that becomes a thing that he does 
more than once and becomes a thing that 

2161
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:21,624
he uses that all the time and uses that 
kind of that kind of language in that 

2162
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:29,280
context a lot.
It's like,

2163
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:30,780
hmm,
this is not.

2164
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,660
It's clunky.
It's not.

2165
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,840
It's not a wise choice of words.
It's sloppy and it's kind of a lazy.

2166
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,810
Right,
and also it's kind of racist,

2167
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,033
but it's why is it racist was racist 
because what he's doing is attacking 

2168
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:52,440
people who are racists by saying,
and he could have done it this way,

2169
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,430
right?
He could have said,

2170
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:54,923
you people rally on about black people 
and call them this and you say they're 

2171
01:38:58,801 --> 01:38:59,634
doing that.

2172
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:03,690
This is what you do.
If you are exactly what you're.

2173
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:07,710
The only thing that's missing is that 
you don't have the right pigment to,

2174
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:10,230
to receive your own hate,
your own self hate,

2175
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:15,000
but you're doing the very things that 
you accuse that you in a racist way.

2176
01:39:15,001 --> 01:39:18,120
Cues black people doing.
It's stupid though,

2177
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:22,990
but it's to the way to combat that.
I don't you,

2178
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,533
when you start censoring people and 
taking away their ability to make a 

2179
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:28,764
living by expressing themselves,
I just don't think that's the way to go 

2180
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:34,740
because you're just going to receive 
backlash and that's,

2181
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:36,600
that's the thing.
It's one of those that's,

2182
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:37,783
that's one of those instances where it's
like you've set a trigger word that is 

2183
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:47,050
clearly a trigger word and and what you 
just said is the way he should have said

2184
01:39:47,391 --> 01:39:48,500
what he wanted to say.

2185
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,170
Right.
And in hindsight,

2186
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,970
if you gave them an opportunity like 
you've said,

2187
01:39:51,971 --> 01:39:54,070
Hey Carl,
here's a time machine.

2188
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:56,830
Go back right before you said that,
and say it again.

2189
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:57,110
What

2190
01:39:57,110 --> 01:40:01,820
I'll just say on Patriot on the,
like I'm reading their stance on it as a

2191
01:40:01,821 --> 01:40:03,500
website.
They don't host anything,

2192
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,820
so like to say that it's something 
that's happening.

2193
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:09,920
Do blogs like Jordan Peterson wrote a 
blog on Patrion,

2194
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,860
but that's what most of their content 
is,

2195
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:12,763
is links from other websites they have 
to take into account what you're 

2196
01:40:16,491 --> 01:40:18,020
creating as a creator

2197
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:23,030
anywhere almost.
This isn't even him as a creator though,

2198
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:25,580
this was him,
a guest on someone else's show,

2199
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,550
so this is not something that's his own 
content that he

2200
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:29,463
put out their stances that he 
collaborates with other creators and 

2201
01:40:31,631 --> 01:40:32,464
this.
This would be considered a 

2202
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:33,574
collaboration.

2203
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,370
Yeah,
that's a generator.

2204
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:39,510
I guess I see that point.
I do not think that it's a wise thing to

2205
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:40,620
censor him though.
Do you

2206
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:43,663
get that motherfucker,
a PR coach dog with Jesus Christ the 

2207
01:40:45,771 --> 01:40:47,690
very least.
Maybe this is the first dance,

2208
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:51,370
which I think they're saying it is a 
definitely a warning or maybe thing.

2209
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,660
Man,
here's the van.

2210
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:53,980
Temporary bandmates,
but

2211
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,000
here's the thing.
What he does is he's a.

2212
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,420
he's.
He's a commentator.

2213
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,583
He sees life and he talks about it and 
I've listened to a lot of his stuff and 

2214
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,380
it's very good.
He's a smart man.

2215
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:10,810
A lot of it's very good.
This is not very good.

2216
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:12,003
So the right way when it comes to these 
things is let the people who contribute 

2217
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:21,400
to his patron decide that they don't 
like what he's doing,

2218
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,320
so they're are no longer going to 
subscribe.

2219
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:24,303
That's the correct use of the platform.
The platform exists because people who 

2220
01:41:27,251 --> 01:41:31,060
are fans are able to contribute that.
I say to mash,

2221
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,073
I really liked what you do.
I'm going to send you a $100 every 

2222
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:36,280
month,
and if someone wants to do that,

2223
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:37,114
they can do that,
and there's a lot of people that do do 

2224
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:39,394
that.
When you say something that makes them 

2225
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:41,913
offended,
that makes them realize you're sloppy 

2226
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:46,330
with your words,
that makes him feel like you're a fool.

2227
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:47,231
I go,
you know what?

2228
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:50,930
I'm not sending that fucking guy money 
in the marketplace talking sense,

2229
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,813
and then they pull back.
If he lost 30 percent of his market 

2230
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:55,503
because of that,
and then a bunch of blogs are written 

2231
01:41:57,341 --> 01:42:00,700
about how stupid what he said was,
that's the correct response.

2232
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:02,860
Correct.
I think I don't think,

2233
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,233
but the problem with pulling out is then
guys like Sam Harris or pulling out and 

2234
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:11,740
they've lost somewhere around 20 percent
of all their patriotic counts because of

2235
01:42:11,741 --> 01:42:12,220
this.
Oh,

2236
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,860
she does.
There's been a backlash and by the way a

2237
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:15,694
backlash that's primarily coming from 
people who don't agree with what that 

2238
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:20,014
guy said,
but do agree that it's a very slippery 

2239
01:42:23,021 --> 01:42:23,854
slope to start censoring people.
That's a good moral stance to take like 

2240
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:28,373
a.
it's like Kinda like I forget which 

2241
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,020
political figures set as I do not agree 
with what you're saying,

2242
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:39,850
but I will defend fight to the to day,
ability to ability to say yes.

2243
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,713
I think that's important because the 
only way that ideas get worked out is 

2244
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:46,210
through discussion and as soon as you 
silence voices,

2245
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:50,290
then you no longer have that discussion.
Now to youtube credit,

2246
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,540
he still up on Youtube.
Okay.

2247
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:55,690
Because this was a talk that he had 
that's available on Youtube.

2248
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:56,703
You can listen to it on youtube.
He still has his youtube account and 

2249
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:01,450
he's still able to,
you know,

2250
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:02,300
the,
some.

2251
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,133
One of the things that we're seeing with
D platforming is it's sort of a 

2252
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:09,520
cascading effect.
So a dominoes twitter takes you down and

2253
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:13,270
then facebook takes you down with a guy,
a limbo,

2254
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:17,530
but some other right wing or that got 
like a said some shit.

2255
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:20,910
And then Gavin McInnes proud boys.
Got To tick them off of everything.

2256
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,870
Yeah,
he's off everything.

2257
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:22,601
Yeah.
Yeah.

2258
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:23,920
And that's,
that's that.

2259
01:43:23,921 --> 01:43:26,040
And with him it's even,
what was he?

2260
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,700
He's like a hate speech guy,
isn't he?

2261
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,040
He's like fucking inciting violence and 
whatever.

2262
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:35,160
He definitely did incite violence in 
that he wanted these proud boys to fight

2263
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,273
against Antifa and he felt like the 
Antifa people were thugs and that they 

2264
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:44,134
showed up a conservative events and they
threatened violence and then he wanted 

2265
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,614
the proud boys to fight them.
I actually had him on my podcast long 

2266
01:43:50,501 --> 01:43:51,334
before any.
This shit went down when I didn't even 

2267
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:55,370
know what the fuck the proud boys was 
and I was asking him.

2268
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,413
I knew him as the co founder of vice and
I know knew him as what I would 

2269
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:04,010
basically say is he.
He was essentially,

2270
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,080
who's a shit talker,
who's a provocateur.

2271
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,283
He was a clever provoca tour and it was 
kind of a funny guy like he came the 

2272
01:44:13,061 --> 01:44:15,950
last time he came on the show,
he was dressed like Michael Douglas from

2273
01:44:15,951 --> 01:44:16,784
falling down.

2274
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,390
He had the fucking briefcase and 
everything and the crazy tie and yeah,

2275
01:44:20,391 --> 01:44:22,280
I mean he's doing,
but he did it on purpose.

2276
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:24,860
He said he's dressing like Michael 
Douglas from falling down.

2277
01:44:24,861 --> 01:44:25,694
Like he's,
he's a guy who would trick people into 

2278
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:32,510
coming in and talking with him on his 
youtube channel and they thought that he

2279
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:35,300
was liberal or progressive and then he 
would,

2280
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,283
you know,
he would basically talked him into a 

2281
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:40,130
corner.
Barry Cohen,

2282
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,030
shit or leg,
you know,

2283
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:43,220
in a way.
Yeah.

2284
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:46,040
He was doing a lot of that and there was
some of it was very clever.

2285
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:46,963
I was doing on his youtube channel.
Then he got into this whole proud boys 

2286
01:44:49,281 --> 01:44:50,114
thing and we.
There's a video you can watch the 

2287
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:52,994
bizarre origins of the proud boys from a
podcast that I did with Anthony Kumina 

2288
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:01,400
from opiod Anthony,
and he explains how the proud boys.

2289
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:05,080
Initially we're just a joke.
It's a joke.

2290
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:06,053
It was literally a joke and they did it 
to make fun of a guy that was one of 

2291
01:45:09,701 --> 01:45:10,534
the.
Was one of their interns think so it 

2292
01:45:12,101 --> 01:45:12,670
sounds.
Yeah.

2293
01:45:12,670 --> 01:45:14,840
Yeah.
It's kind of a crazy story,

2294
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:15,683
man.
That shit took a real life of its own 

2295
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:19,920
and now they're fucking junior kkk.
Exactly.

2296
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,000
That's crazy.
They,

2297
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,073
they,
they all of a sudden it got away from 

2298
01:45:24,141 --> 01:45:27,800
him and they became an organization 
where you could just join,

2299
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,700
so all these people joined and then they
act as a proud boy and they were beating

2300
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:34,380
people up and all this other crazy shit 
and he doubles down.

2301
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,400
He got out,
he quit.

2302
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:38,293
He denounced his position that he 
realized that his life was falling 

2303
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:42,140
apart.
He was being labeled.

2304
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:43,790
As you know,
he.

2305
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,400
They falsely claimed the FBI labeled 
them as a hate crime,

2306
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:46,890
but they didn't.

2307
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,723
But the southern poverty law center did 
label them as a hate crime and several 

2308
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:54,010
other organizations as well,
but the southern poverty law center,

2309
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,900
they've had some pretty crazy shit that 
they've said as well.

2310
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:58,323
There a serious,
a liberal progressive organization that 

2311
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:04,490
occasionally oversteps the boundaries of
logic and reason they,

2312
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:05,703
but he.
What he did was start an organization 

2313
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:09,583
and I had a joke about about vegans.
My joke about vegans was the problem 

2314
01:46:14,181 --> 01:46:16,010
with vegans is a problem with any other 
group.

2315
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:17,413
If you get a group of 100 people,
what are the odds that one of them is 

2316
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:21,890
going to be a fucking idiot?
Well,

2317
01:46:21,891 --> 01:46:25,310
that's 100 percent right?
If we're being really charitable,

2318
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:30,260
one out of 100 is a fucking moron.
So if you get a group like vegans,

2319
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:31,094
which is anyone can join and you have,
there's 300 million people in this 

2320
01:46:36,531 --> 01:46:37,364
country,
that means there's 3 million fucking 

2321
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,533
idiots.

2322
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:42,883
That's generous and a lot of them are 
Vegan and the joke was that the problem 

2323
01:46:47,091 --> 01:46:47,924
is not the actual people with good 
ethics and morals don't want animals to 

2324
01:46:51,151 --> 01:46:54,300
suffer.
The problem is you let a bunch of people

2325
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:55,134
with no identity join your gang and then
they become a part of this plant based 

2326
01:46:58,021 --> 01:47:00,060
gang.
This is same thing with the proud boys.

2327
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,193
I think some of them probably went into 
it thinking it was a goof and they were 

2328
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:07,260
going to go there and they thought these
Antifa assholes,

2329
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,273
these 90 pound dork swinging bike locks 
at people and calling everybody a Nazi 

2330
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:15,290
and fascist and trying to shut down 
every single conservative speech.

2331
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,070
That was at a neat.
Any sort of university.

2332
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:20,290
These people were preposterous.
They were calling Ben Shapiro and Nazi.

2333
01:47:20,291 --> 01:47:22,980
He's a fucking Jewish man.
Wears a Yarmulke.

2334
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,083
I mean,
it's crazy to call him a Nazi is 

2335
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:26,910
completely insane.

2336
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:31,650
The alt right and the left almost.
Exactly.

2337
01:47:31,651 --> 01:47:32,484
And so their idea was to have something 
that would be there to balance out the 

2338
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:38,184
alt left and it got out of control and 
so he denounced it and he stepped away 

2339
01:47:42,481 --> 01:47:43,230
from it.
Pulled with,

2340
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,590
but it's too late.
He's,

2341
01:47:44,591 --> 01:47:47,370
he's now what you sped.
See you don't know him,

2342
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:50,820
but you said he's the hate speech guy.
You said he's that guy.

2343
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:51,390
He's that.
Hey,

2344
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,223
that's how everybody's going to see him.
So if you found out your sister was 

2345
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:57,000
dating and people like what you're 
dating,

2346
01:47:57,001 --> 01:47:59,280
the hate speech guy,
like that's who he is.

2347
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:00,041
And he's like,
no,

2348
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:00,151
no,
no,

2349
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:00,631
no,
no.

2350
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:03,150
It's not that.
It's like it got away from him.

2351
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,610
It just became this.
It wasn't him anymore.

2352
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,100
With all these people that joined it 
were actual racist.

2353
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,200
Too late.
It doesn't matter too late.

2354
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:12,270
There's no room for that in this world.
I'm out the game.

2355
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:12,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2356
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:16,780
So any.
All these other groups have.

2357
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:17,643
Once he started getting deep platformed,
these other groups got pressure to deep 

2358
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:23,610
platform him because they said,
hey,

2359
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,533
you keep the hate speech guy.
You're telling me that hate speech guys 

2360
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:28,380
on Youtube.
And they're like,

2361
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:29,191
fuck,
okay.

2362
01:48:29,191 --> 01:48:32,460
We got to take them off.
And so that this domino effect does seem

2363
01:48:32,461 --> 01:48:33,294
to take place.
So with this Sargon of a cod thing 

2364
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:36,084
though,
it doesn't seem to be taking place with 

2365
01:48:37,771 --> 01:48:40,170
him because people are examining what he
said.

2366
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:40,681
And they're saying,
well,

2367
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:45,570
this is a sloppy use of these words.
It's not wise what he did,

2368
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:46,613
but I do not think he's a racist.
And I don't think he was promoting 

2369
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:53,400
racism.
What he was doing was he was using words

2370
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,350
poorly.
Awfully.

2371
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,850
But yeah,
I mean that's what he's guilty of.

2372
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,020
Yeah,
the but that's the,

2373
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,990
I mean that's a,
that's a good sign.

2374
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:04,440
He's not being deep platform.
Then if like if people are taking a beat

2375
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:09,500
to realize like,
oh I don't hate gays and blacks.

2376
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:11,610
That's,
that's the point that the whole,

2377
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,473
this whole thing has been a lesson in 
patience and that's good to hear that 

2378
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:18,600
like this guy is being afforded some 
patients about,

2379
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:22,650
but in their defense he's already been 
kicked off twitter.

2380
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:26,040
He'd been kicked off of twitter before.
I don't know what for though.

2381
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,720
Do you know what he got kicked off 
twitter for?

2382
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:32,850
He got kicked off at twitter previously,
so he already had that scarlet mark,

2383
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,110
you know,
there was already.

2384
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:37,620
People are already looking at him.
I mean he's been inarticulate on twitter

2385
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:40,840
before.
No way get it on.

2386
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,403
I don't know what he had done it.
He had determined that he had harassed 

2387
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:46,710
somebody.
What's that?

2388
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,010
This could be a new account.

2389
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,650
I guess they seize on it right now.
Is it a new account?

2390
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,860
Might be how many followers you have?
13,000.

2391
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:55,233
Yeah.
It's probably knew you had a lot more 

2392
01:49:55,811 --> 01:49:57,580
than that.
He must have.

2393
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:00,080
I'm wondering,
you started a new account,

2394
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:02,830
her permanently banned account.
Let's see.

2395
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,350
Yeah,
he's permanently banned.

2396
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,970
April of 27.
Oh,

2397
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:09,460
so it's pretty old.
Funny.

2398
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,980
April of 2017 is millions of years ago 
now.

2399
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,400
The new cycle so fast.
It's too fast.

2400
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,171
It's weird,
right?

2401
01:50:16,171 --> 01:50:17,260
It's,
it's dude.

2402
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:18,094
I'm telling you.
When I was at the shows like a story 

2403
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:24,940
would be hot Monday morning and then 
Tuesday morning I was like,

2404
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,070
what happened?
No one gives a shit.

2405
01:50:27,071 --> 01:50:27,904
Dog gives a shit.
That's one of the more interesting 

2406
01:50:29,921 --> 01:50:31,910
things about this whole trump story with
the,

2407
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:32,763
especially the Mueller probe,
is that there's been so many of those 

2408
01:50:36,161 --> 01:50:36,994
quick stories that have just piled up.
Like you remember that family where the 

2409
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:46,141
son died in Iraq and he didn't mean to 
cut you off.

2410
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:50,080
He was.
He'd said something.

2411
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:55,081
He had marked somehow another mock the 
family and people like this guy and it'd

2412
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:59,380
be in a lot of people thought that was 
going to be the end of him and it's just

2413
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:02,740
like these things sort of pile of the 
Pakistani American.

2414
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:04,090
Yes,
yes.

2415
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,313
Yeah,
and there's been so many of those 

2416
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:09,600
stories that.
But accumulative,

2417
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,853
they are starting to pile,
it's just little much is little drops 

2418
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:17,050
that are coming in the lead.
He can.

2419
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,203
He's been able to sort of roll with 
those punches and just sort of slide 

2420
01:51:21,581 --> 01:51:24,190
them off kind of.
But this Mueller thing,

2421
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,053
what I really like about the Mula thing 
is that it's been a real slow build and 

2422
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:34,180
you get little hints of what's going on,
but it's been like the,

2423
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:35,143
you know,
where you're talking about this at the 

2424
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:36,310
show while I was there.

2425
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:40,720
It was just like FBI don't fucking.
They build a case.

2426
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:41,613
Yeah.
They take their fucking time and they 

2427
01:51:43,361 --> 01:51:46,240
got all the time and money in the world 
to build.

2428
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:48,910
And when they come they don't come like,
yeah,

2429
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,650
it's not like a,
they come a heavy the,

2430
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:52,933
the knocking on doors that come in a 
hundred deep and that's what it's going 

2431
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:56,860
to be.
Zero to six.

2432
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,330
A 100 like.
Yeah,

2433
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,193
like that.
And that's going to be interesting to 

2434
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:01,930
see what happened.
Especially Mueller.

2435
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,280
You look at that guy is I calculated 
assassin that isn't.

2436
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:09,370
He is taking his fucking time.
That's got to be killing trump.

2437
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:12,310
He doesn't take shit and that the beauty
of it Mueller,

2438
01:52:12,311 --> 01:52:13,660
that he,
you know,

2439
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,260
he's an independent guy.
Yeah.

2440
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,130
He don't take shit from nobody.
Well,

2441
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:22,120
the crazy thing was that trump was 
literally considering firing him.

2442
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,950
Yeah.
But everyone's like,

2443
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:25,470
someone was like,
hey man,

2444
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,160
you,
you cannot do that.

2445
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,180
That's why you can not do that.
That he fired comey.

2446
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:32,770
That's when I realized like,
wow,

2447
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:34,203
like this guy could just do that and he 
could just fire the head of the FBI 

2448
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:39,460
testing.
He's just going to do this.

2449
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:40,563
Can I get rid of the Attorney General?
That I think was supposed to be on my 

2450
01:52:43,691 --> 01:52:46,100
side but sessions.
But he finds out,

2451
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,380
oh no,
jeff is also.

2452
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,313
There's races as he is,
as a man of high ethical standards when 

2453
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:54,140
it comes to like,
I'm not gonna fucking dude.

2454
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,230
I'm,
I may hate minorities,

2455
01:52:57,231 --> 01:53:00,170
but I respect the law.
You know,

2456
01:53:00,171 --> 01:53:01,640
like that's,
that's jeff session.

2457
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:02,700
Did you find out

2458
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:03,533
what happened?
There wasn't a really good explanation 

2459
01:53:04,981 --> 01:53:05,814
of it.
It was just one of those things like he 

2460
01:53:06,991 --> 01:53:07,824
had a.
I think he even had a debate with baked 

2461
01:53:09,211 --> 01:53:13,660
Alaska and then the next day he was gone
with no real explanation of why he broke

2462
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:14,743
the prototypes.
I'm anti Sam and Shit Baked Alaska 

2463
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:23,030
Alaska guy.
He's the guy is a meme guy.

2464
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,193
It was just a meme guy,
but now he's essentially become this 

2465
01:53:26,601 --> 01:53:27,650
like really

2466
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,150
right wing,
uh,

2467
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:31,290
sort of,
uh,

2468
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:33,223
he's,
he's kind of in the info wars camp as 

2469
01:53:36,241 --> 01:53:37,074
well.
Right.

2470
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,160
But Baked Alaska is come up with some 
fucking hilarious memes.

2471
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:44,660
Memes are hilarious.
He had one with uh,

2472
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:47,940
Alex Jones has always had a bunch of 
them like that.

2473
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:51,450
I've been out the game for that,
like the meme game.

2474
01:53:51,451 --> 01:53:52,440
That's all of it.
Like,

2475
01:53:52,441 --> 01:53:53,910
um,
so I feel old,

2476
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,260
you know,
interestingly,

2477
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:58,560
what is it saying far right?
