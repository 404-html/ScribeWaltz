1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,720
Boom,
and we're live den.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,700
Yeah.
Leibow [inaudible] the man with the most

3
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:11,750
beautiful accent in the world.
It just thread the itunes reviews saying

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,033
it's kind of who we are really sending 
to these guy describing this horror 

5
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:15,854
story with the accent from it sound like
it's making your pizza while historian 

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,083
and therefore they don't know is I am 
making the pizza while I'm talking that 

7
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,880
here's what's happening.
Yeah.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,753
And if they could see you,
you look like a professor that was 

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,054
kidnapped by a biker gang for forced to 
Kim's in here with this red brotherhood 

10
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,184
jacket on this leather jacket from these
native Americans with this big red fist 

11
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,070
on it.
He's got a Bandana on you.

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,650
You're just,
you're missing a motorcycle.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,840
It's all you're missing,
right?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
That's uh,
that's the next.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,360
You could be in like some easy rider 
type movie,

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,370
right?
I could see it.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,130
It just carrying a shotgun til I dance.
So,

18
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,020
uh,
are you digging doing this podcast?

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,340
Are you kidding me?
On Fire?

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,110
Oh Man.
I'm loving it.

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,093
I'm having fun.
Well,

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,320
let's put it that way.
I love doing it.

23
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,730
It's a royal pain in the ass.
The research cause well your podcasts,

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,920
much like Dan Carlin's is very 
different.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,793
I always feel ashamed calling my podcast
a podcast cause it's just you sit down 

26
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,070
and talk,
but yours is like,

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,623
it's an audio lesson on history and in 
depth audio lesson on like very extreme 

28
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,850
aspects of history.
Yeah.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,713
It gets and you know that part I enjoy 
because the storytelling part is 

30
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:26,594
awesome.
You got a penis story and make it 

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,220
[inaudible] connected with pop culture.
Do something that's fun.

32
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,900
That's the part that I love is the month
prior to that of just brutal research.

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,763
Just call them been through boring 
historical book after boring historical 

34
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:42,290
books to find those little nuggets that 
are amazing.

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,040
Yeah.
And then spin it into a narrative that's

36
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,890
the power deck gets a lethal old 
sometimes where you're like,

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,940
man I do I really need to read 200 hours
of stuff for this one thing.

38
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,680
It's like that's a lot.
Yeah.

39
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,440
I can only imagine now when you do that,
when you're going over,

40
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:58,274
combing over all these different uh,
history books and all these different 

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,920
papers written on various times,
do you,

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,053
are you like extracting chunks and like 
putting them in Microsoft word and then 

43
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:10,940
going over it and then like how did you 
form it?

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,803
Well,
the question is kind of like do form it 

45
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:16,780
as a script or how much of it,
so everything is completely written out.

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,510
Not exactly because otherwise then it 
sound like it sound like yard guy.

47
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,090
You're getting a seeing and gets boring,
but it doesn't sound right.

48
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:23,924
I just take super extensive notes,
kind of like if you are to give a 

49
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,860
lecture that you have never given,
you're not gonna sit down and read it by

50
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:32,510
you are going to,
you know,

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,420
you have something to keep you on track 
to make sure it's like,

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,440
oh,
where am I going next?

53
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,040
Okay,
great.

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,873
There's nothing.
So it's a as detailed as possible 

55
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:46,850
without turning a team to a dry guy or 
he Denise Page type of stuff.

56
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,050
Yeah,
I mean history is such a fucking awesome

57
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:51,884
subject because people are crazy and 
throughout history people have done so 

58
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:59,860
many crazy things and it's just,
it's,

59
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,370
it's

60
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,490
such a great thing to know like when 
you,

61
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,324
if you only had today,
like if we only had our current era and 

62
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,260
we're looking around how fucking 
maniacal people are,

63
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,090
how crazy the world is.
We were like,

64
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,350
God,
how'd this happen?

65
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,400
How did we get here?
And then you just listen to your podcast

66
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,211
and you go,
oh,

67
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,060
this shit's been going on forever now.
Seriously.

68
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,490
This is the good tosh.
Yes,

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,880
exactly.
It is in case you are welcoming,

70
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,520
she's good times and yes,
there's much to complain about and yes,

71
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,350
there's much we can do better without a 
doubt,

72
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,410
ladies and gentlemen,
but this is as fucking good as it's ever

73
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,300
been by far.

74
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,443
The human psyche is a very weird place 
because there's so much amazing stuff 

75
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,500
that human beings don't are just so much
and vendors,

76
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,813
the amount of horror that can be 
unleashed throughout that has been 

77
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:52,130
unleashed throughout history by people 
against other people.

78
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,110
Is it just insane?

79
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah.
What is like when you go back and you,

80
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,360
you go over history,
what is the most confusing or disturbing

81
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,223
era?

82
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,343
He,
I to me is not so much at Bharti Kohler 

83
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,504
period because the same bathrooms and 
merge a lot of the times at different 

84
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,340
point in time,
ease is more,

85
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,500
it was moments,
you know,

86
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,334
when,
uh,

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,713
when mob mentality takes over because 
the reality is the average person is 

88
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,554
not,
I don't have the award of view where I 

89
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:23,430
think the average person is evil.
I don't think that,

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,660
I think the average person is weak,
which means that when a inequity nations

91
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:28,494
where everybody's pushing in one 
direction is very easy to jump on the 

92
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:31,674
bandwagon and in some cases then a very 
ordinary human being can do horrible 

93
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,044
actions.
You meet them for dinner and you think 

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,930
pleasant person good enough,
but you put them in the wrong context.

95
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,150
And devotee scene turns to shit I just 
did.

96
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:45,984
Um,
I just finished right now it is to 

97
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,620
perceive it is less,
probably the most disturbing.

98
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,190
I now I want to what podcast about 
flowers and puppies because this one was

99
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:54,024
heavy.
Man,

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,493
I need this [inaudible] kind of compare 
and contrast on the sand creek massacre 

101
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:00,384
of the Cheyenne in Colorado in the 1860s
and then me lie in Vietnam in 1968 and 

102
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,320
actually they split it because I had id 
the sand creek and they had,

103
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,131
um,
this guy,

104
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:14,630
Daryl Cooper was the martyrmade podcast 
is an amazing podcast or,

105
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,090
and he covered me lie and dining.
The third APP is,

106
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,490
or we're going to sit down and kind of 
chat about what does this all mean about

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,593
the human nature.
Why do the reason why that particular 

108
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,980
story in those two stories,
interest means because it's um,

109
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,963
too brutal massacre of civilians,
but in both cases that are solely or 

110
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,000
should refuse to participate or actually
try to stop it.

111
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,400
They're not the majority there and 
minority,

112
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,810
but they are there and they try.

113
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,900
So it's not just a story of people doing
ugly stuff.

114
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,734
It's like,
what is that make one guy when all 

115
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,330
their,
hey go shoot that three year old,

116
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,470
the one guy goes,
yes sir,

117
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,720
and does it and the next guy goes,
no,

118
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,130
that's not what we are.
Screw you.

119
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:53,964
I'm not doing that.
That's what interests me is like the 

120
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:56,904
individual element.
What make people in the exact same 

121
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,744
circumstances.
One person go down a really dark path 

122
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,820
than somebody else instead of having the
balls to say no,

123
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,683
that's not what I am.
That's not what we do with the native 

124
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,390
American masker.
What,

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,253
who was,
how many people were the ones that 

126
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,780
refused?
Cause you never hear about that.

127
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,643
Oh you hear about it's the horrific 
actions of the soldiers and which was 

128
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,270
the majority.
But there was also like,

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,540
there was this one guy,
um,

130
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,260
what's the guy who named Sila Sila soul.

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,580
He was told about the guy with balls of 
fire and cause the guy,

132
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,530
he and the capital of other officers or 
refuse to let the man and them,

133
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,400
cause they were divided in different 
companies.

134
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,234
So their companies,
they say no or not participating in 

135
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,240
this.
This is just straight up slow.

136
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,090
They're these guys that are not even a 
real targets.

137
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,460
These are a bunch of civilians.
So day or a fuse.

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,200
And then a silas sold testified against 
his commander at the inquiry and,

139
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,340
and he was promptly murder shortly after
noon.

140
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,270
So he's like,
it's a crazy story,

141
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,104
but still to this day that are people 
from the Cheyenne tribe who every year 

142
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,150
they have a ceremony for Silas soul 
because they say,

143
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:59,960
I need not being for him.
A lot more of us would have died on that

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,793
day.
And he did that really brave thing and 

145
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,220
paid the price for it.

146
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,470
So you know,
if you're looking for heroism,

147
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,453
you can do a lot worse.
Don't look at this guy story because 

148
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,330
that guy was seriously,
you know,

149
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,540
stand up for his conviction on their 
most extreme circumstances.

150
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,374
So it kind of top of,
I admire that dad had to be incredibly 

151
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:23,330
difficult to just imagine what those 
people were doing.

152
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,164
I mean,
when you hear some of the accounts of 

153
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,784
the slaughters of native Americans,
it's just terrifying that people can 

154
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,980
just look at someone and just decide,
that's not a person or that's not us.

155
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,710
This is the other.
They've got to be eliminated.

156
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,620
So we're just going to kill all these 
kids and kill all these women.

157
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,720
And it's happened all over the country.
I mean there's,

158
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,520
there's two things that happened to 
native Americans.

159
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,280
One,
the big one is disease.

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,870
Sure.
And wasn't on purpose.

161
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,704
There's this big myth that people put,
like they put smallpox and blankets and 

162
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,670
that's all bullshit,
right?

163
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,773
It's pretty much been proven that they 
didn't really understand bacteria or 

164
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,614
diseases.
There's one story that's a possible is 

165
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,064
not a proven thing during,
cause initially nobody understood 

166
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,634
bacteria and these or the first hand 
that plessy are completely 

167
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,383
unintentional.
There's one tale about the French and 

168
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:20,000
Indian war where during a break,
the Bdt Shar talking about it saying one

169
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,080
of the commander saying,
Hey,

170
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,930
maybe we should give them some blankets 
from the smallpox hospital.

171
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,410
You know,
while we do know that he suggested it,

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,260
we have no proof whatsoever that he was 
actually done.

173
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,293
So.
So that's probably how the rumor got 

174
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,260
started,
right.

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,093
Problem.
But in most cases would happen is just 

176
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,214
that the Europeans came over and just 
inadvertently introduced native 

177
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Americans diseases and 90% of them were 
wiped out.

178
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,950
Yeah.
That's a crazy number.

179
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:46,784
If you really stop to think about it,
it's going to see they're probably the 

180
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:53,570
most dramatic demographic disaster in 
human history because you know,

181
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:54,980
I've never,
before you had a,

182
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,160
where a whole

183
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,010
continent was not exposed to a series of
diseases.

184
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,540
And so of course there's no immunity the
first time they're exposed.

185
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,311
They,
you know,

186
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:03,144
you don't need to even have smallpox of 
Cannes needs on somebody and the next 

187
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
day,
half of the villages that,

188
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:07,704
you know,
yeah,

189
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,790
that's crazy.
It's just,

190
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
it's amazing that if,
uh,

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,000
a group of people just has not come in 
contact with something that other people

192
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,180
come in contact with all the time and 
just God with you got a cold,

193
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,010
you'd be fine.
Just have some chicken soup,

194
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,180
take a nap.
Meanwhile,

195
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:23,670
these people are just dead.
That's pretty sales them off.

196
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
That's probably why aliens don't show 
up.

197
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,334
It's like those motherfuckers are dirty.
If maybe show up these needle nose and 

198
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,680
we will,
our whole planet will die.

199
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,680
Or maybe the opposite.
They know they'll kill us.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,180
Maybe they have like some super advanced
diseases.

201
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,530
That's the other posts to be.
Yeah,

202
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,020
I guess it's just a immune system thing,
right?

203
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,820
If your immune system is not prepared 
for it.

204
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,103
So it is,
there's a great book by a guy named Dan 

205
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,890
Flores.
Um,

206
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,260
well he wrote two,
but one of them actually,

207
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,563
actually it was a paper that he wrote 
about the buffalo and he saying that 

208
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,813
it's really interesting because he 
compares the initial and counters that 

209
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,860
European settlers had and European 
travelers had,

210
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,783
um,
before the native Americans were wiped 

211
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:08,304
out.
And they talk about how many animals 

212
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,230
were on the planes and they make it a 
direct account of it.

213
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,990
And then after the Europeans had come 
in,

214
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,300
90% of the native Americans had been 
wiped out.

215
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,134
And that's when the buffalo population 
increased goes through the roof and 

216
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,540
you're seeing these gigantic packs of 
mill wouldn't be packed.

217
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,480
So it hurts,
I guess,

218
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,880
of millions and millions of Buffalo.

219
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,510
And he said that's directly attributed 
to the lack of predators,

220
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,643
which means lack of native Americans 
because they were preying on these 

221
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,460
buffalo,
of course.

222
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,510
Really interesting.
Yeah.

223
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:41,070
That guy,
you had him on the podcast ones,

224
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:41,850
right?
Yeah,

225
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,710
I get them on again.
I love that guy.

226
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,030
That was awesome.
Book,

227
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:45,864
Coyote America Dumbo.
That book changed the way I feel about 

228
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,944
coyotes.
Yep.

229
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,761
I used to be like,
fuck,

230
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,594
those little rats will run them over and
now I'm like those little wolves and 

231
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,250
they're pretty bad ass.
Yeah.

232
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,940
That was a great type.
Is that I enjoyed that one.

233
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,760
Yeah.
Did they're so gangster.

234
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,780
One just stared me down the other day.
I stopped my fucking car and uh,

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,471
just,
you know,

236
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,540
because he was in,
it was a kind of a,

237
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,890
not a lot of people in this area.
It was,

238
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,943
it was fairly late at night and he was 
on this road of someone just pull over 

239
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,794
and just see what this coyote does and 
he just fuck it stood like 30 feet from 

240
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,350
my car just staring at me,
just staring at me.

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,430
That's bad ass.
Right.

242
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,630
They're just like,
whatever,

243
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:22,640
dude,
what are you going to do?

244
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,543
I'm about to run into these woods.
You never get to see me again or I'll 

245
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,390
stick around.
Maybe if you fuck up,

246
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll eat you.
Right.

247
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,620
I'm just trying to figure out what to do
right here.

248
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,880
Those guys don't mess around.
That's crazy that they just can live and

249
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,040
be completely embedded in our society.
Like there we had a biologist,

250
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:41,874
what was the gentleman's name that we 
had from the Department of Parks and 

251
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,880
services?
See if we find this guy.

252
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,043
But um,
he's actually a biologist who tracks 

253
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,194
coyotes and uh,
he tracks them all over the state and 

254
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,463
even tracks mountain lions.
They tag them and put those collars on 

255
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,830
them and stuff.
Uh,

256
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,630
but he said that there's a pack of 
coyotes.

257
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,464
It lives in downtown La.
Then I believe it in the heat of 

258
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:05,644
everything,
they found some abandoned building and 

259
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,960
they dented up in this abandoned 
building and that's where they live.

260
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,050
Like how those guys that are resilient,
they thrive in anything.

261
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,790
They thrive.
Yeah.

262
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah.
You're like crazy animal stories.

263
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,820
So check this out about it.
[inaudible] there's,

264
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,810
my mom went for a walk with their dog 
and their dog is a big mean dog,

265
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,250
right?
So they are walking in,

266
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:26,084
they see ahead of them and he's lethal.
Garp early 10 years old with this tiny 

267
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:34,481
little five pound dog type of thing.
And there's a coyote maybe like 20 yards

268
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,470
behind there that's clearly stalking 
them.

269
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,304
And the garden didn't see it.
And he's obviously aiming for the five 

270
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,470
pounder and his just,
and so my mom yelled at,

271
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:42,981
they're like,
hey,

272
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:46,040
watch outs or the girl freaks out,
pick up the her dog.

273
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,320
And she figured if she saved coyote 
doesn't get a fuck,

274
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,163
she still stalking them down.
And so at that point my mom kind of let 

275
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:55,430
their dog ago and a dog chase the coyote
off and that was that.

276
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,680
But I was like,
man,

277
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,050
those guys are don't.
Yeah,

278
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,480
you don't want to leave leave.

279
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,870
You don't want to do little girls 
around.

280
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,803
I know.
It's like why a 10 year old is walking 

281
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,700
the doe by ourselves.
That's probably not the best idea.

282
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,563
They um,
there was an instance that happened a 

283
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,700
few years back where in 19 year old girl
was murdered,

284
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,380
not murdered,
killed,

285
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,520
partially eaten by coyotes.
Chi Health.

286
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,963
Yeah.
I think the bits and chunks out of her 

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,100
tore apart and she died in the hospital.
Pretty sure thought.

288
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,813
Yeah.
But there it was unusual circumstances 

289
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:31,664
and the one of the unusual circumstances
that the coyotes in this area are very 

290
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,070
limited in terms of what game is 
available.

291
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,353
So much so that they've been known to go
after Mousse that these little coyotes 

292
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:46,100
actually go after Moose and have 
successfully taken moose out.

293
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,330
Jesus.
Yeah.

294
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,270
So these are gangster coyote.
Next video,

295
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
look at that.
They don't look that big.

296
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,060
Yeah they're really big ones.

297
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,893
Like 50 pounds.
Yeah.

298
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,460
Yeah.
I watched a video the other day of a,

299
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,294
a mother Moose trying to uh,
stop these wolves from eating her cow 

300
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,130
and her calf.
I've seen that same style.

301
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:04,964
Terrific.
Yeah.

302
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,930
She's running around and stomping these 
wolves and they're circling her and then

303
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,764
they just grabbed the calf and drag it 
away and she's fighting off the other 

304
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,124
wolves and stomping him.
She stomped the shit out of a few of 

305
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:15,550
them.
Yeah.

306
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,440
She fucked a few of them up.
[inaudible] factual info.

307
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,110
Yeah.
Yeah,

308
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,461
yeah.
I saw that one.

309
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,800
That one's sucks cause there is Justin 
Brown,

310
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,930
that gentleman,
very nice guy.

311
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,120
We got to give us a lot of interesting 
insight as to like what happens in um,

312
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,950
you know like with biologists,
how they,

313
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,670
how they track these animals and what,
what some of the problems are.

314
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,631
But we,
we were,

315
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,464
were in such a unique place in southern 
California because there's such a 

316
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:45,980
massive population of people,
but there's all these predators that are

317
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,320
sort of like entangles.
Oh yeah.

318
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,760
And our system,
you know,

319
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,160
like hawks

320
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,570
everywhere.
Everywhere you look,

321
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:56,900
there's hawks swooping down snatch and 
doves and shit.

322
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,480
And My,
my daughter got a little dog.

323
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
I always felt a little dogs,
her nasty rats,

324
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,650
but I started liking these things.
So I'm like,

325
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,160
okay,
I,

326
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,810
I'm,
I'm changing my mind about it.

327
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,644
This is a cool dog,
but he's still like eight pounds or 

328
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,050
something.
So I'm like,

329
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,120
Hey,
you can't let him alone in the yard.

330
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,080
Not because there's probably not coyotes
in the yard,

331
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:15,914
but they're definitely hawks around.
There's definitely ours look like a big 

332
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:19,934
rabbit [inaudible] in three seconds.
You cannot leave him in the yard like 

333
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:26,030
that because yeah,
I mean that's how it is.

334
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,650
That's when you have trade outdoors 
around,

335
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,930
you need to keep your eyes open.
Yeah,

336
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:32,450
there's no getting around it.
There's no getting around it.

337
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,313
You know,
and when we look at how horrific the 

338
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,644
wild world is,
it's not a surprise that people who are 

339
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,020
just like recently civilized over the 
last,

340
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:45,410
you know,
like really realistically 10,000 years.

341
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,673
Everybody's like,
there's these really dark thing in 

342
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,510
people's minds where it's an opera on 
the table.

343
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,180
Most people are never going to pull the 
trigger and go down there.

344
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,350
But that's part of,
we are as a,

345
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,253
as human beings.
And I think that's why I enjoy doing 

346
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,020
these [inaudible] me lie because he's a 
story that's not trying to bash any side

347
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:06,854
is not like,
oh look at those bad Americans doing 

348
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,310
these massacres.
He's more,

349
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,413
they were horrible people there.
There were also great people belonging 

350
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,414
to the same side.
So he to me is not about one particular 

351
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:19,634
group of people that one nation or they 
want ethnic group or anything being the 

352
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,200
bad guys.
He's on an individual level.

353
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:28,540
What is the mix?
One guy go down this horror in desirable

354
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,920
directions and other people instead 
choosing,

355
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,150
you know,
cause that's what you've always done.

356
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,910
You're always choosing not to be that 
person.

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
You know?
That's what fascinates me.

358
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,770
You know,
it's just um,

359
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,050
there's a great book by Sebastian 
younger called tribe.

360
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,490
Have you read it?
You read that one,

361
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,320
wasn't it interesting when they talked 
to,

362
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,163
but when he talked about all of the 
people that were kidnapped by native 

363
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,010
Americans that chose to live with them.
Yep.

364
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,950
And then when they were taken back by 
the Americans,

365
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,230
by the settlers,
you know,

366
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,041
they were like,
fuck this,

367
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm going back.
I'm going back to the native Americans.

368
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:02,960
And they went and lived with them again,
but no one went the other way.

369
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,360
No.
Which is really crazy.

370
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,194
Something not flat.
They're in about the euro American 

371
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,180
culture of the time.
Yeah.

372
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,600
There's a great Benjamin Franklin call 
of time.

373
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm going to butcher it cause I don't 
even remember the beginning.

374
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,430
Something about no European West tasted 
savage life and then basically go on.

375
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,220
Can be or to come back to living our 
settlements or something like that.

376
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
Yeah.
And I'm like,

377
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,930
yeah,
that's see something about fun.

378
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,820
Yeah.
The way they're living their camping,

379
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,693
right?
There's a hunting and fishing every day 

380
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:31,784
and you go back and these assholes were 
wearing powdered wigs and banging a 

381
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,560
wooden mallet on a table for everybody 
to pay attention.

382
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,310
Fuck off SPEC.
That's hilarious.

383
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,060
But that's where you hear you.
That's what I beat about called charts,

384
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,894
right.
People spend time with that romanticize 

385
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,250
native college courses like Whoa,
they're old,

386
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,290
you know,
hug trees.

387
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,130
And in talking with the four recruiters 
of the forest and I'm like,

388
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,820
well yes and no.
There are like what you mentioned,

389
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,690
right?
If you are capture,

390
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:02,140
especially in the east when like French 
and Indian war or stuff like that,

391
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,350
I work going on,
if you are a capture by,

392
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,020
it would in an that raid one of two 
things happen.

393
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,153
The good one is that they like you,
then they decide to adopt you and then 

394
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,050
you end up replacing one of their dead 
family members.

395
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,260
So like if they lost a brother or a 
father,

396
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,910
then you become that person for that 
purpose thing that they did.

397
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,230
It's very weird.
But,

398
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,880
but the thing is the adoption process 
was so thorough that they love you,

399
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,714
like you're the real deal and you end up
feeling like you're part of this family 

400
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,034
and you know everything works out.
It's everything is great if they don't 

401
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:38,850
like you that they torture you to that 
of our three day period.

402
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,290
So it's like these are the same people,
right?

403
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,613
They can be the sweetest,
most also be women's or really messed 

404
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:47,370
up.
Same Culture,

405
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,204
same individuals.
Do you think that's just because people 

406
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:51,834
have evolved be dealing with tribal 
warfare and just we have to have that 

407
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:56,664
switch?

408
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,593
I think he's a,
because the thing that's interesting 

409
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,560
about natives is that it wasn't a racial
thing.

410
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,010
They adopted anybody,
right?

411
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,863
Didn't matter what skin color you will 
have that they did not have a barrier 

412
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,540
too.
But there is a big insider outsider,

413
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,090
you know,
if you are part of our tribe and you may

414
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,670
become part of our tribe,
race doesn't matter.

415
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,510
You can become part of our tribe,
but once you're part of our tribe,

416
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:20,570
er one of us.
But if you're not part of our tribe,

417
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,570
then you know the same rules do not 
apply to you.

418
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,360
You are whether you are an enemy,
you are.

419
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,370
And in that case that's when it gets 
ready a bit older.

420
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,820
Yeah.
Even with other native Americans,

421
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,654
that's the thing that people need to 
really get an like we especially people 

422
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,314
that only have a peripheral 
understanding of native American 

423
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:39,894
culture,
like the reason why sewer called sous 

424
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,430
cause that's a native American word for 
enemy.

425
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,800
Yup.
They call themselves Lakota people.

426
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,053
Exactly.
So all the other Indians were like fuck 

427
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,460
these crazy ass.
It takes you to over there the enemy.

428
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,180
Yeah,
totally.

429
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
They were just dominating.
Yeah.

430
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,233
It's a,
it's really fascinating when you 

431
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,093
consider that these people had these 
hunting grounds and they were trying to 

432
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:07,011
protect and one of the things that 
they've found is that there are areas or

433
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:07,884
wildlife thrived and the wildlife 
thrived in these like a gray area 

434
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,770
because like this one area would be,
you know,

435
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,280
one native American tribe and then there
are a hunting grounds.

436
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,890
Went to a specific specified distance.
Yup.

437
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,720
No,
obviously always in conflict,

438
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,450
but then pass,
that was another native American tribes.

439
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,493
But in the middle,
that's where you'd find all the fucking 

440
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,140
animals of course is they're like,
I get it.

441
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,453
Nobody haunts me.
Or they are worried about killing each 

442
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:36,210
other in New Hampshire zone.

443
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,790
So now I thought that's how it is that 
they figured that out.

444
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,673
Yeah.
It's like,

445
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,280
um,
have you been to yellowstone?

446
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,510
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

447
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,530
Right?
It's amazing.

448
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,770
One of the things that's really crazy is
if you go around the tourist center,

449
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,600
there's elk everywhere just lounging 
around.

450
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,920
They tell you don't get more than 20 
yards closer to a,

451
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,754
an a an alc.
Cause they will charge you occasionally 

452
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,870
and they like tired of people taking 
fucking self.

453
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,800
He's like,
hey man,

454
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,110
I did it.
I was out there.

455
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,220
I and I've seen elk in the wild.
Wild.

456
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,073
Yeah,
but they've figured out that wolves 

457
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:09,304
don't come to the tourist center.
So like I got an idea and then they 

458
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:15,040
realize these people are different than 
the people that hunt us.

459
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,323
Somehow or another,
they put it together like like one day 

460
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,940
it'll all could go wrong,
right.

461
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,580
Civilization could collapse and you just
go right to yellowstone,

462
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,443
go to that fucking tourist centers.
There's meet everywhere mold on the APP 

463
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,160
because you need hundreds of them on the
lawn at the tourist center.

464
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,420
It doesn't make any sense,
but I don't know what it is like what is

465
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,254
the intellectual process that allows a,
an elk to understand that these people 

466
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,713
are not going to try to eat me and that 
the wolves are not going to be around 

467
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,394
these people.
It barely took some really stupid 

468
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:51,244
dialogue to stick around people before 
they realize those are to go to us so 

469
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,230
that everybody was looking back at like 
Hawaii.

470
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,050
They didn't get killed over there.
They feed feeding and peanuts.

471
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.
But even though we can try to,

472
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,310
yeah.
Wonder what it was,

473
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,144
I don't know if we really know like the 
mechanism that allows them all as a 

474
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,790
group to go,
yeah,

475
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,260
you can just chill out around these 
people.

476
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,590
Just lie down.
Please lie down if you know us.

477
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,400
You're right.
It is fun.

478
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,590
It all the national parks you see the 
most study mode thereby.

479
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,970
It's hilarious.
And it's always,

480
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,920
it's a fascinating that,
no,

481
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,053
there's never been like a non warring 
successful group of humans because it 

482
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:32,021
only takes,
you know,

483
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:35,940
you can really be a pacifist around 
somebody who isn't because,

484
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,571
uh,
yeah,

485
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,860
you decide to go in.
It's mellow,

486
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:39,694
peaceful,
happy society and you get your ass 

487
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,064
kicked by.
There's a great story about the origins 

488
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:47,000
of not even before the United States,
like buddy teacher called onesie.

489
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,670
Well,
we'll be coming to the United States.

490
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,970
Everybody hears about the Plymouth Rock,
right?

491
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,980
There's the whole of the puritans.
They show up,

492
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,770
all of that.
What usually people don't hear.

493
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,450
Um,
there was wrestled,

494
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,310
played a little with this store in his 
book.

495
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,603
There was these other settlement called 
marymount that was just down the street 

496
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,640
from Plymouth,
but they were completely different.

497
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,490
Their interpretation of Christianity was
pretty much a,

498
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,720
but he Christiano agonies mix with a 
couple of Christian ideas.

499
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,930
They had the exact opposite approach of 
the puritans.

500
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:21,190
They were having drank and orgies with 
the native tribes.

501
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,340
They were,
yeah,

502
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,193
they were the equivalent of like the 
heat piece of the 16 hundreds just 

503
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,233
aching back having fun and deputies.
I started getting edgy because when new 

504
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:34,870
people would show up on the coast,
they would take a look at the puritans.

505
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,970
They would take a look at Mary Mount and
be like,

506
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah,
I'm going to marry mouth.

507
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,970
Right.
These guys are whipping themselves.

508
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,740
Life socks over there.
And so of course that was bad.

509
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,190
Even

510
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,023
some puritans were like,
see Johannine I'm gone for a couple of 

511
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,090
weeks.
And so the,

512
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:54,830
the hardcore guys decided,
well we can't have that.

513
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:55,664
So they got their guns showed up and 
close down Mary Mountain and that's the 

514
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,740
problem.
Like Ed,

515
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:01,574
the Marymount guys not be so them plays 
a heat piece and actually got their act 

516
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,650
together and trained with guns and 
stuff.

517
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,290
They would have been able to keep their 
community going.

518
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,850
We those values all you just,
you need that minimum of self defense.

519
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,520
So there was somebody else squash,
which is exactly what happened.

520
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,670
Was that the,
from the,

521
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,410
the name Loyola Marymount,
does it come from those people?

522
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,270
I dumped it because,
uh,

523
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,770
you know,
I have no idea.

524
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,610
So I'm going to lie,
but,

525
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,620
but you know,
cause you know,

526
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:29,454
like y'all,
like does it strike me exactly as a 

527
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,470
drunken largest with no,
not at all.

528
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,460
That's why I was confused.
Yeah.

529
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,670
Yeah.
I'd never heard of that before,

530
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,160
but it makes sense that there'd be 
someone that would deviate.

531
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,293
There's always someone who just looks at
the way everyone else is doing it and 

532
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,870
just says,
this is fucking not for me,

533
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:42,704
man.
Talk to him.

534
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,510
Yeah.
But it always goes bad.

535
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,360
Like there's never been a cult where,
uh,

536
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,320
you know,
they got together,

537
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,720
formed a commune and just really were 
cool to each other.

538
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,200
We,
I'm actually fascinated with exactly the

539
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,520
thing you said.
Why,

540
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,790
why can,
what's so damn hard about power?

541
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,330
It's the ones,
what it is.

542
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,770
One person in power,
the one person in a position of power is

543
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:08,771
almost always um,
abusive and they almost always used that

544
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:12,860
power to their own ego,
ego gratification and dominance.

545
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,170
They always fuck all the other guy's 
wives.

546
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,004
Yeah.
That's the old,

547
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,900
they all father a bunch of children.

548
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,880
They take everyone's money.
You know,

549
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,053
it's,
I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff 

550
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:27,200
because one of the things that you,
you see when you,

551
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,063
um,
if you become famous or if you do 

552
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,450
something that gets you a lot of 
notoriety is,

553
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,020
I know how I feel around certain famous 
people.

554
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,820
Like,
uh,

555
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,653
I really like,
I've talked about like first time I met 

556
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:41,030
Anthony Bordain who I respect a great 
deal.

557
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,760
I was like a little school kid.
I was like,

558
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,290
I was just such a Dork.
I was like,

559
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,610
dude,
I fucking love your show.

560
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,080
And I was like,
that slabs.

561
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,050
It was jenny.
And I love his writing too.

562
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,063
Yeah.
So it was genuinely excited to see him 

563
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,430
and meet him.
You know,

564
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,900
it's still to this day when I talked to 
him a little dorked out.

565
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,530
So when you know,
you take a person who's not,

566
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,210
and I'm used to being around 
celebrities,

567
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:06,920
I've been around a lot of them,
but when you take someone who's not used

568
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:07,754
to being around someone who is in this 
position of adoration and they don't 

569
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:15,710
know how to handle it and they just,
they just give in to whatever,

570
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,050
you know,
Beta tendencies that have,

571
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,300
and this Alpha just takes over.

572
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,220
There's a natural thing that human 
beings do in these small isolated groups

573
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:28,170
that don't get checked and it almost 
always is the,

574
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,820
the man who is in charge of it winds up 
abusing everybody.

575
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,673
Yup,
Yup,

576
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,680
Yup.
Which again,

577
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:36,490
it goes back to that pirate of human 
nature is what,

578
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,080
why do you have to go down that path?
You can have a great life,

579
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,290
you can enjoy,
be nice to people making,

580
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,170
you are in a position leadership.
You use

581
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,003
that to make sure the whole thing runs.
Mostly everybody's taking care of us 

582
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,910
that were pisses me off because you 
know,

583
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,620
that occurred to me is,
I mean,

584
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,120
I understand it and I don't understand 
it because I mean,

585
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:57,954
I get it.
I've seen it enough times that I know 

586
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,010
you are exactly 100% right,
but at the same time,

587
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,160
I really don't get it because you can 
still have a great life.

588
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,710
Nobody's denying you all the good things
that you want.

589
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,640
Just be a semi decent human.
It's not that hard.

590
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,560
Come on,
you would think it's not that hard,

591
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,690
but when there's no one checking you,
look,

592
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:16,524
you're in the Oregon Woods and you've 
got this fucking yogurt and everybody 

593
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:23,680
lives together and you just bang 
everybody give you all,

594
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,570
you're all their gold.
It's people for whatever reason,

595
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:31,500
when there's a person that is the king 
or a person that is like some,

596
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,780
you know,
cult leader or whatever your Messiah,

597
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:37,380
whatever you want to call them,
people just want that person to have the

598
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:37,830
answers.

599
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,360
They,
they gravitate towards that.

600
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,823
And I think that's better.
Sizely one of the thing that bugs me 

601
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:44,640
about,
um,

602
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,180
a lot of people who are willing to put 
themselves in that position of like,

603
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:52,080
I am your big leader.
To me there's a way to be a leader.

604
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,550
That's awesome.
That's great.

605
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,384
Sort of the Taoist approach where people
shouldn't even feel that you are a 

606
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,534
leader by yard,
like sub to the moving sings along to 

607
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:02,400
make sure everybody's taken care of.
That's a leader.

608
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,890
But that's not because it's not all 
bills.

609
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,143
Most people need the exactly what you 
say dates they need their father figure 

610
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:14,010
to laid out below to be very dogmatic 
and so tiny in there.

611
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,690
I know he told,
don't worry,

612
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:17,550
I have hold the answer.
He's is good,

613
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,740
this is bad.
And people love that.

614
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,574
They love that.
In dictators they love dating or 

615
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,850
religious cult leaders.

616
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,713
They love 18 inequity.
Seen that type of personality gathers a 

617
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,114
whole lot of full lawyers who need the 
somebody to look confident and sure of 

618
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:34,734
themselves.
It doesn't matter whether they are or 

619
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:37,260
they aren't.
If they put on a good show,

620
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,090
people with bite.
Yeah.

621
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:39,924
It seems like a pattern that just sort 
of gets established and human beings 

622
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,960
from being a child and having your 
parents don't touch that.

623
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,010
That's hot.
Come with me.

624
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,870
This is the way to go.
This is what you have to do.

625
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,270
This is how you put your shoes on.
Does it tie your shoe?

626
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,273
How you get to work this?
I do this to say do that and then you 

627
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,493
all of a sudden you don't have anybody 
telling you what to do anymore and then 

628
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,800
all along comes the cult leader.
Yep,

629
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,350
I've got the answers.
Guess what?

630
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,130
They're coming straight from.

631
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,470
God's a fuck your parents.
My parents didn't know shit but that,

632
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,490
but that's what's funny is that the same
people who grow it up would be like your

633
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,530
parents tell you a tie your shoes and 
you're like,

634
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:11,550
fuck you.
Right.

635
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,384
Suddenly somebody come along with the 
are 20 or 30 tie your shoe and you're 

636
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:15,631
like,
oh,

637
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,660
you are so wise and have me,
Lisa is the way at the time,

638
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:19,141
my shoe.
Oh,

639
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,400
great master.
Exactly.

640
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,040
There's just,
I don't know man.

641
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,800
It's just,
it was interesting.

642
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:28,770
I don't know if you have been following 
like where I'm Dan Carlin,

643
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,050
the stuff that he has been saying about 
his other show.

644
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:33,060
Common Sense.
I haven't listened to it lately.

645
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,890
Yeah,
he hasn't been releasing ips on lately.

646
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,830
That's probably why you haven't because 
he has kind of shut down with that.

647
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,750
It's not officially done,
but in thing is my approach,

648
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,840
meaning Dan talking,
my approach is to be calm.

649
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,673
What somewhat sub though?
Somewhat like play and not be overly 

650
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:55,240
dogmatic one way or another to think on 
my feet to mix mixings together and that

651
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,570
some scene that most people don't want 
in the current climate,

652
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,810
most people want the very black and 
white type of approach.

653
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,590
Now I disagree with Dan because I think 
that steel,

654
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,424
there is an enormous need for what he 
provides and I don't think that just 

655
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,344
giving up is the solution,
but I do get it because it really 

656
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,680
doesn't take much.
You know,

657
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:15,514
if you start screaming a very dogmatic,
either super leftist or super 

658
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:19,984
conservative approach,
you get out to magically a bunch of 

659
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:23,164
folders.
If you are thinking on your feet and 

660
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:26,970
just going,
hmm,

661
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,060
this thing,
yeah,

662
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,894
you're right,
but let's look at the other side and 

663
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,050
constantly,
I mean,

664
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,570
you know what any decent human being 
should do.

665
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:37,130
Just be an intellectually honest and 
thinking sinks.

666
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,010
People don't respond to that because 
it's not that easy or rather people do.

667
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:42,844
Some people respond,
but he's a number wise is a way a 

668
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:49,660
minority compared to what you get by 
being a black and white kind of guy.

669
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,290
Yeah.
People desire very clear resolutions and

670
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,590
very clear thinking in terms of like a 
enemy.

671
00:30:57,591 --> 00:30:58,424
Friends.
Yes,

672
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,290
this is a black and white issue.
There's,

673
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,573
but I think Dan,
that also just felt overwhelmed by the 

674
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:04,994
times.
It's like this just seems like 

675
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,910
everything's so fucked up.
I'd rather not even talk about it.

676
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,260
Just sit back and see what is really 
happening.

677
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,400
We were on the phone,

678
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,070
I swear I spend like an hour on the 
phone way you or whoever back and forth.

679
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:17,904
I was playing in bye bye.
That was played a remembered a second 

680
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,490
movie of Lord of the Rings where there's
for all the old [inaudible]

681
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,880
yeah,
I can't do this anymore.

682
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,470
And they're sab going,
oh,

683
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,770
come on.
You need to,

684
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,170
I think I,
I need to step up my game.

685
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:32,004
I'm a Shitty Sam because I was trying to
do that for that and it just kind of 

686
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:36,510
motivate him and I miss it.
I really failed.

687
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,344
So I respect where he's coming from.
He said that when he was on the show 

688
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,200
recently,
um,

689
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,083
he,
he was talking about that sort of same 

690
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:44,064
thing that he's kind of put that podcast
on hold long as he keeps doing his 

691
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:47,814
podcast.
Hardcore history is just so important I 

692
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:53,910
think.
I think him and you are providing,

693
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,773
you guys are providing uh,
an entertaining and interesting history 

694
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,230
lesson that really wasn't available 
before.

695
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,064
I mean before he could get a book on 
tape and if is really well written book 

696
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:07,290
and it was read by someone with like 
good dramatic flare.

697
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,560
It was exciting stuff but nobody really 
got into it.

698
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,850
I bet.
I bet the numbers,

699
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,983
if you consider the numbers of people 
that have listened to his podcast and 

700
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:19,500
your podcast in comparison to like 
before you guys were around,

701
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,723
there's probably a radically improved 
number of people that know a lot about 

702
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:25,434
history.
Yeah.

703
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,303
For particular things like the Mongols.
I never even thought about the Mongols 

704
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:30,504
until I listened to his podcast,
which apparently right now if you're in 

705
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:38,340
the La area in Simi Valley,
at the Ronald Reagan Museum,

706
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,970
the Reagan Museum or a library,
what is it?

707
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,450
There's a giant Genghis Khan exhibit 
Railey.

708
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,403
Yeah.
They have the bows and all the stuff 

709
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:51,830
they stole and the textiles and all the 
dif different things.

710
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:55,220
They warn their yurts that they slept in
all kinds of crazy shit.

711
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,310
Awesome.
Want to go?

712
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,313
Yeah.
I mean that stuff's over a thousand 

713
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,211
years old,
right?

714
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,044
Or close to it.

715
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,580
There was 1200 scouts.
Yeah,

716
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:02,250
exactly.
Yes.

717
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,220
So close to a thousand years old.
Yeah,

718
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,230
but oh,
there it is right there.

719
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,450
Yeah.
Check it out.

720
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,690
They had bows that required 160 pounds 
to pull back.

721
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,630
I know.
What the hell were these guys?

722
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,280
So we'll pull this 60 pound boy.
It's insane.

723
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:19,160
And they must have been animals.
There must've been so fucking strong.

724
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,840
Yeah,
you'll put 60 pounds and you're like,

725
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,430
holy hell,
this is heavy.

726
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,620
Hundred and 60 is insane.
Well,

727
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,610
I have a,
um,

728
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,630
up compound bow and the compound bow.
I don't have a regular,

729
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,980
like a recurve,
like these guys should.

730
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,130
I believe they invented the recurve too.
They didn't invent it.

731
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,430
They were around in the era when the 
recurve was invented,

732
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,220
which just by the design of the bow,
it pulls,

733
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,280
it's,
it gives you more power,

734
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:45,200
more energy gets released through the 
Arrow.

735
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,230
But w with a compound bow,
there's a big led off.

736
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,380
So it's only difficult.
So if you had a 60 pound bow,

737
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,214
it's only deaf,
it's only 60 pounds for like the first 

738
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:57,920
six inches of shell pulling it back.
Then as you completely pull back,

739
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:01,130
there's like an 85% led off.
So it's much easier to hold.

740
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:01,964
Right though.
They were pulling 160 the whole title 

741
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,470
the way,
and it was harder.

742
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,340
Yeah,
of course.

743
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,174
Yeah.
And they could aim a perfectly on 

744
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:12,580
horseback while the rally they knew full
gallop is like who,

745
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,670
I mean they apparently used to time the 
Arrow release while the horse was in the

746
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,271
air.
Yeah.

747
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,880
Cause then you don't have the unevenness
of faith.

748
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,530
You,
it doesn't guys weren't sakes.

749
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,443
It just that that ct has that Dan did on
the Mongols is one of the greatest of 

750
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,660
all time.
I urged me,

751
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,530
it's I think it causes a dollar an 
episode.

752
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,130
Just go through Itunes,
get it for a dollar or I don't know what

753
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:34,964
other,
um,

754
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,650
whatever it could be.
Do you have,

755
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,513
if you're cheap android,
but it's a dollar an episode and it's 

756
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:41,990
worth fucking hundreds of dollars.
It's amazing.

757
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:43,730
I've listened to it.
No bullshit.

758
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:44,564
At least six times.
Hit Up Heidi to stop bringing up Dan 

759
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,130
because by now people are accusing me of
like,

760
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,740
you know,
you like Dan probably a little more than

761
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,310
a little sexual man.
Sure.

762
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,110
The [inaudible] beautiful guy.
He's also nothing wrong with it.

763
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,953
I love Dan is one of my favorite humans.
Well listen to your podcast is fucking 

764
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,514
awesome to men and I really particularly
enjoyed your first one because you 

765
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:04,784
talked about that one store that you 
brought up on him freaked me the fuck 

766
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,294
out.
Right when the end of [inaudible] they 

767
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,094
uh,
they capture all the remnants of 

768
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,524
Spartacus army and [inaudible] fight 
every scene called one of them on the 

769
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:21,290
way between the Naples and Capitola,
but next to Naples,

770
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,480
Naples,
and Rome and every,

771
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:24,231
whatever,
30,

772
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,064
40 yards,
and there's a new guy crucified and 30 

773
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:27,644
yards down.
And neither one was kind of like lamp 

774
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,400
posts all the way between these two 
cities.

775
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,730
And how many miles is that?
That's like 120,

776
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:38,040
something like that.
Hundred and 20 miles of crucified

777
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,900
people.
Yeah.

778
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,300
Where you have at devry,
30 to 40 yards.

779
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,000
There's a new one and then another one 
and then another one.

780
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,010
And it's,
yeah,

781
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,844
that's a,
any kind of story since the last time 

782
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,110
you were on the podcast,
I went to Rome.

783
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,220
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

784
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,760
I saw that traveling the,
yeah.

785
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,830
Yeah,
dude,

786
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,363
it's,
that's one of those things where you 

787
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,240
just have to like,
no one talked to me for a second.

788
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,520
Let me try to process this.
You know,

789
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:04,780
like we had a great guide,
uh,

790
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,740
who is a professor who was a really,
it was really cool.

791
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,053
He guides people in the meantime and he 
was just so excited to talk to me 

792
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,620
because I was so into it.
Of course,

793
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,870
you know,
because most of the time,

794
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:16,704
you know,
people are just like barely curious 

795
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,560
about what he has to say.
But you know,

796
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,394
we,
we talked about the significance of the 

797
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,674
pineal gland and the pine cone and the 
in the Vatican and he know he takes you 

798
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:28,560
on a tour of all the different 
artifacts.

799
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,290
That's,
that's a trip that I feel like,

800
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,353
but just going there,
especially the Vatican going near the 

801
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:39,420
coliseum was big too.
But going to the Vatican and just seeing

802
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,254
all that artwork and getting an 
understanding of what those people were 

803
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,440
really up to four hundreds and hundreds 
of years,

804
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,513
just conquering the world for hundreds 
and hundreds of years and all this 

805
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,910
artwork.
Yeah.

806
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,900
Seeing it live in person.
Just sort of reset my perspective.

807
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,793
Yeah,
it's amazing.

808
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,610
It's a,
yeah.

809
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,443
Romy is a place that he hadn't never 
once in your lifetime you've got to do 

810
00:36:59,461 --> 00:36:59,881
it.
You know,

811
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,730
he's just a,
I don't know if you have been,

812
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,130
there's a place,
a sentence Santangelo's which is kind of

813
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:08,150
close to the Vatican and,
but if you go to the top of this castle,

814
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,013
you're basically,
you got to panoramic view will fold off 

815
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:13,330
at all from there.
It's so spectacular.

816
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,873
It's wild river.
You'll see all the buildings you'll see 

817
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,994
every single,
then you kind of like mech down and 

818
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:22,260
you're justin do we our walks and,
and uh,

819
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,340
why was I saying here?
Oh,

820
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,650
one thing that I swear over that I was 
blown away by,

821
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,731
you know,
desire,

822
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:31,410
it tastes kind of a joe was the painter.
Never that guy.

823
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,244
I love that guy because basically what 
happens with this dude is he was around 

824
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,950
in the,
what was the end of the 59 yeah.

825
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:38,784
I ended up the 59 [inaudible] 69 and 
kind of agile was straight up against 

826
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:43,734
there.
Like he was probably the best artist of 

827
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,314
the arl to me.
He's probably the best artist of all 

828
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:48,601
time.
He's like,

829
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:52,530
you look at his paintings and it's just 
insane what he could do with paint.

830
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,560
But then he had this life on the street,
asic as electoral gains there.

831
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,700
He would just get,
he at one point killed the guy in a duel

832
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,613
was wanted for barder.
Every time he would get close to power 

833
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,470
and the will be up.
That's kind of agile for you.

834
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:07,920
Okay.
Right.

835
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,540
They're raising that painting is,
and what year was this made around?

836
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,100
God,
look how good it is.

837
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,870
I know.
That is insane.

838
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:20,871
I mean that's,
that is so close to photographic and you

839
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:26,040
think that this is in the 16 hundreds 
and these people,

840
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,650
they couldn't even stand still for him.
I mean,

841
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,633
how do you think he did that?
Did he have a guy pretend that he's 

842
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,840
getting choked?
Did do this all from his mind?

843
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,180
No,
I think he was models.

844
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,980
There was actually one of the scandals 
is that he thinks in his models.

845
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Well of course,
but that was not this guy.

846
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:41,890
I'll do that.
Right.

847
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,800
That was part of the deal though,
that scandal power was the fact that,

848
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,653
you know,
the Church was commissioner in a lot of 

849
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,494
his work,
but he's clearly was not the most pious 

850
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,450
guy in their sense.
He's view of Christianity was a,

851
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,284
hey these guys where Jesus and his 
followers who were poor man from the 

852
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,990
street,
they were not the power Denali in purple

853
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:00,824
the roads.
So he used the small dose more than 

854
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:06,750
Lance for the Virgin Mary.
He was the hoop so that he was leaping.

855
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,160
Wait,
a church is like,

856
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,710
you're kind of dog.
He was a hooker for the Virgin Mary.

857
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,960
That's just not okay.
He would be like,

858
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,741
yeah,
don't worry.

859
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:16,240
Okay.
Next time and a gate.

860
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,700
He does.
They take eight CV,

861
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,490
get some of his paintings of the Virgin 
Mary's fine.

862
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,550
Some of them.
Yeah.

863
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,560
That's amazing.
It's hilarious.

864
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,580
There's one,
uh,

865
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,150
let me see if I remembered thought.

866
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,410
There's one where there's a naked baby 
Jesus,

867
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,244
which Mary squashing and snake a cif 
that pops up that what is great because 

868
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:35,900
uh,
you know,

869
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,733
they,
that was his big shot at making a big 

870
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,310
and a church was trying,
okay,

871
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,203
keep it together.
Be a good boy because they are the best 

872
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,660
painter there is,
but you are fucking crazy.

873
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,494
So please just tone it down.
And he turns seem these painting where 

874
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:52,510
the Virgin Mary as a just big cleavage 
showing you that I had to dress,

875
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,590
she'd maybe Jesus,
he's buck naked.

876
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,150
Squashing the snake.
Supposed to symbolize that they have all

877
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:59,830
that staff and they were like,
yeah,

878
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:04,060
that's not what we bet the one that's 
the Virgin Mary.

879
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,920
She looks like a freak.
I know.

880
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,250
Well she was he so love or hooker.
So yes,

881
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,830
that was part of the problem.
There are baby Jesus squash.

882
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:17,410
The snake was dick show and fix that.
That was the other thing that,

883
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:18,244
um,
this guy was explaining to me was a 

884
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,673
penis sizes of the Roman statues.
They were all small because big penises 

885
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:29,911
were supposed to mean stupid people and 
like aggressive animals that were just,

886
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,950
you know,
not a part of the civilized,

887
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:37,120
amazing culture that Rome represented.
So there was pride in the micro penis?

888
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:37,954
Yeah,
well it wasn't micro but it was 

889
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:42,010
definitely not,
that's not optimal.

890
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,371
Yeah,
it was like,

891
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,690
cause I was asking,
I was like,

892
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:47,524
what do you think that is?
We were trying to figure it out when we 

893
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,614
were talking about it before the 
professor gave me an answer and I was 

894
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,780
like,
maybe they just like had little riddicks

895
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,590
back then.
Like maybe it was just,

896
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,210
you know,
that was just how it went.

897
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,710
And he's like,
no,

898
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,603
it just,
I think they probably associated with 

899
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,240
big dicks with rape,
with like the,

900
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,083
the barbarians and the Moore's and all 
these people coming in and chopping 

901
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:11,410
people up and fucking the shit out of 
everybody and like,

902
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:11,621
no,
no,

903
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:12,520
no,
we don't want that.

904
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,953
They don't want that little tiny dicks 
like the sophisticated dicks Dick's and 

905
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
people who write poetry,
vandalism.

906
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,950
No,
they still a big dicks though.

907
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,230
They were there were clearly made by the
artist.

908
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,064
One thing they did do though in certain 
errors they covered the dicks with 

909
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,004
leaves and it wasn't initially what they
would do and they went back on a lot 

910
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,490
them and repurpose

911
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,323
them and put new leaves over dicks.
I think you know right now that are 

912
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:41,870
going to be about seven pank beds.
Boring the name from you,

913
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:46,160
like sophisticated the will be the name 
of new punk band coming out tomorrow.

914
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,900
Good bands.
Sophisticated dicks.

915
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,290
I like that name.
That's a good one.

916
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,960
Yeah,
it's a,

917
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,950
it's a weird thing that people have done
throughout history.

918
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:58,250
It's like sort of um,
trying to uh,

919
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,940
trying to control artistic expression 
and trying to have it represent the time

920
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,740
and so you don't necessarily get a full 
version of what was going on then,

921
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:13,670
but you do get a version of the 
suppression which gives you insight into

922
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,880
the full version of the times.
Definitely.

923
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,820
You know,
that they were covering,

924
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,800
covering Dick's with leaves and stuff,
so,

925
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,360
so strange.
And sometime they would have the pain 30

926
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,720
giving the Dat third version of the 
painting for public consumption.

927
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,150
But then the same guy will commission.
He was like,

928
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,500
okay,
give me a while for my tribe.

929
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,334
I call latch on.
And so that's where they would have all 

930
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,360
the way more explicit stuff.
Yeah.

931
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,081
They,
I mean,

932
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:36,914
they didn't have pornography back then,
so they must been beaten off the 

933
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:41,600
paintings and stuff.
Had to be,

934
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,071
yeah.
Yeah.

935
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:45,190
I mean it had to be thought of as being 
arousal inducing.

936
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,033
So much so that,
what was it during the Victorian era 

937
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:53,060
where they put legs of tables,
they would put dresses on them.

938
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,163
Yeah.
They would rapid the legs of the tables 

939
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:57,380
because you know,
they are legs each day.

940
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,040
Our Bayer,
they may give you ID.

941
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes.
Which I don't know about you man.

942
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:02,130
But you know,
look at the leg of that.

943
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,023
That really doesn't do wait for me.
So the something to it where people got 

944
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,720
so horny,
the table leg,

945
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,920
this skin,
uh,

946
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,010
but that's what your door,
you'll really have problems,

947
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:13,310
right.

948
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,800
When you look at the leg of a table and 
you got all excited,

949
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,634
he's like,
man,

950
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,040
yeah,
that's not good.

951
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,120
No,
you'll be whatever.

952
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,690
Revies each your life choice.
That's up until that point.

953
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,280
It's fascinating to see.
People must've agreed to that too.

954
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,900
What's up Jamie?
I just looked it up.

955
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:27,734
It says it,
that it originates from a satire that 

956
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,570
was written and people,
I guess took it as truth.

957
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,530
Oh,
so it's not real.

958
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,550
Yeah,
I supposedly not,

959
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,710
but they definitely did cover the legs.
They did.

960
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:37,544
But the reason why this exaggerated,
since he was poking fun at Americans 

961
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:43,010
that did something like that,
I'll come up to this point of the meat.

962
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,660
The meat is too cool.
That's prosperous farmhouse parlor in 19

963
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:50,810
hundreds and that isn't covered,
but this is 19 hundreds,

964
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,430
right?
This is,

965
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:55,310
um,
the Victorian era is when they did this.

966
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:56,930
Oh wait.
Okay.

967
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,070
1839 and Englishman wrote a satire of 
American tour.

968
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,270
He wrote the American propensity to use 
the word limb and place of leg though he

969
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,104
says the English two a two.
Then he says that he visited a boarding 

970
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:08,960
school,
young ladies,

971
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:09,441
New York Strip,
we,

972
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,140
sorry,
square piano forte with four limbs.

973
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,393
Their mistress of the establishment had 
dressed all these four limbs in modest 

974
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,580
trousers with frills at the bottom of 
them.

975
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,020
He's exaggerating or not subjects,
uh,

976
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,780
is exaggerating or not subject to 
speculation.

977
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:27,614
He certainly poking fun or whether 
whether Mur Mur Mur yet is exaggerating 

978
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:33,983
or not is subject to speculation.
He is certainly poking fun and 

979
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:37,704
Americans.
But I can attest that having page who 

980
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,014
dozens of books showing old black and 
white piano photos of Victorian tier is 

981
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:43,584
a saw not one example of a table piano 
or any other piece of furniture with 

982
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,560
skirts around the individual legs.

983
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,030
That's interesting.
Boom.

984
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,643
I liked the legends so much matter.
Hadn't you always heard that from 

985
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,963
professors?
I remember hearing that from a history 

986
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,890
professor.
I'm old off the,

987
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,650
you know,
between boring he story and a fun legend

988
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,890
or west side.
Yeah.

989
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:09,090
I would like to think that people were 
way more stupid than they were.

990
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,880
It makes me feel good about this error.
Exactly.

991
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,590
Yeah.
You'd be this,

992
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,463
um,
I mean you look at the dresses that 

993
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,480
people had to wear that when all the way
down to the ground.

994
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,493
I mean,
this is not really much different than 

995
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:24,060
what we see in the Middle East.
It's very simple.

996
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,980
I mean,
what we see in the Middle East,

997
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:26,814
they have to cover their face.
They had job and the whole deal and the 

998
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,870
headscarves,
and that's a little,

999
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,670
little more extreme,
but not much.

1000
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:33,820
Yeah.
I mean they,

1001
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,300
they wore shit that went all the way to 
the ground.

1002
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:39,030
If you showed any ankle,
you would lose their mind and said,

1003
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:39,610
hey,
call,

1004
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,240
why am I crazy?
Yeah.

1005
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,361
Well,
you know,

1006
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:44,430
repetition does it.
Yeah.

1007
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,970
I wonder if they were more 
hypersexualized than we are.

1008
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,013
I bet not.
I bet because of porn we're probably 

1009
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:51,930
more hypersexualized.
Right?

1010
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,823
There's,
I think different arguments there 

1011
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,910
because some people say the more 
[inaudible] stuff,

1012
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,600
the more than you're going to obsess 
with it.

1013
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:01,820
So that's all you think about all day.
[inaudible]

1014
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,050
he's less likely to obsess.
Then again,

1015
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,170
there are lots of people are so addicted
to Internet porn that,

1016
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:09,240
I don't know if that the idea works,
but you know,

1017
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,860
that's the,
well,

1018
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:12,840
Internet porn is the problem that 
Annette porn is,

1019
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:16,170
the availability is this.
You don't even have to go some way.

1020
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,243
At least back in the day when you had 
vhs tapes or dvds or something like 

1021
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:22,710
that,
you had to go to a store,

1022
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,753
you had to buy him.
He had to put them into the TV at a sit 

1023
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:26,170
back.
Yeah.

1024
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,230
Get the remote control.
Yeah.

1025
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:30,520
There's a process.
There was work involved.

1026
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,170
The miners have minor work,
right?

1027
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,550
Yes.
Now it's just far too easy as far.

1028
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,780
I mean,
how many people that work that have jobs

1029
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,180
go into the bathroom,
locked the door and beat off.

1030
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,450
That's a lot of people listening right 
now.

1031
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,480
Where do we did exactly that and that 
right now you're beaten off right now.

1032
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,030
Stop it.
Go back to work.

1033
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,770
Jesus.
He's watching.

1034
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,050
That's what I hear.
Yeah.

1035
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,913
Um,
it's just,

1036
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,770
it's interesting,
I guess if you have to think about it.

1037
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:03,300
Like they were trying to control those 
people and trying to control their urges

1038
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,060
because it was beneficial to society.
It was beneficial to society that,

1039
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:07,894
that these people needed to do their 
fair share and get to work and they 

1040
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,960
couldn't just be staring at legs all 
day.

1041
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,113
And,
and,

1042
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,980
you know,
engaging in an impure thoughts and,

1043
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:18,060
but you know,
that's the,

1044
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:20,310
that's the problem.
We tiny kind of probation.

1045
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,050
It's completely misunderstanding of the 
human mind works is you do not say no to

1046
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,360
seeing says you are not going to do 
this.

1047
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,160
Yup.
Guaranteeing that are to obsessed with

1048
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,970
this.
Right.

1049
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,800
It doesn't work.
There's um,

1050
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,160
how's that sad story that I heard once 
that I thought he was hilarious.

1051
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,910
I can't remember where I read it,
but like guy go to a zen masters saying,

1052
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:40,420
hey,
you know,

1053
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,510
you'll be called like peace and happy.
I want to be just like you.

1054
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:45,730
What do I need to do?
Zen Master says,

1055
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,740
okay,
just for the next 24 hours,

1056
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,083
don't think about monkeys,
guys like molten keys never floated 

1057
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:52,301
about monkeys.
Him.

1058
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:54,730
I was that gonna make me a light zen 
masters.

1059
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:55,564
Dot.
Shut up.

1060
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,610
Go Away.
Come back in 24 hours.

1061
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,890
Don't think about monkeys.
Kind of like,

1062
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,740
okay,
well be coming in a light and it's going

1063
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:04,390
to be a piece of cake because all I have
to do is not think about monkeys.

1064
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:08,320
And of course the next 24 hours become 
the most monkey field hours of his life.

1065
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,950
Cause that's the only kind of thing come
out right for it.

1066
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,260
Big The bore.
You make sense in get taboo,

1067
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,470
the board,
you'd guarantee that people are going to

1068
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:17,950
obsess with it.
Yeah,

1069
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,070
it's a like he didn't think like 
drinking at 21 in us.

1070
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,850
Right.
It was like growing up.

1071
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:28,990
I don't even know if there was an age in
Italy where you're supposed to not drink

1072
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,600
but is not that glamorous,
you know,

1073
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:32,434
is what your grandparents have for lunch
and you know you are maybe six year old 

1074
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:36,184
and you want to try a little wine and 
they give you a tiny bit saying if you 

1075
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,300
have a little more you got a headache.
So just got it.

1076
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,150
And then one day you do get a little 
more,

1077
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:44,740
you got a headache and you go,
oh shit,

1078
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:45,760
you're right.
Okay.

1079
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,890
And you kind of learn how to drink 
rather than being like wait God away.

1080
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,813
Cool.
Now we got all this booze and people 

1081
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,330
drink.
Throw up all over themselves is like,

1082
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,300
that hasn't got a hose.
Why are you doing?

1083
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,373
Yeah,
I think there's definitely a healthier 

1084
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,680
attitudes than Americans' attitudes 
about alcohol,

1085
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,740
but also like wine is a good way to 
start.

1086
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,833
Like he started off a kid with whiskey.
That's not the way to start as too 

1087
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,633
potent amount of my first times I ever 
got drunk was on Jack Daniels until 

1088
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:17,720
years for me to smell Jack Daniel's and 
not want to throw up.

1089
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,010
I'm sure he gets those triggers in your 
head.

1090
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,800
We smell it like Jaeger.
My,

1091
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,230
I used to smell yeager mine.
It's like,

1092
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,540
and just be like,
Yep.

1093
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,823
It's just think about just getting 
violently ill where your body's trying 

1094
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:34,000
to purge it from your system so you 
don't die yet.

1095
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,893
It's to,
to hide it from kids and tell them it's 

1096
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:38,530
that,
that it's taboo,

1097
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:40,690
but then you drank it and then they're 
like,

1098
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:44,290
I can't wait until these fucking people 
can't tell me what to do anymore to help

1099
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,530
get myself a nice cold glass of whiskey.

1100
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,583
Yeah,
I mean it's kind of like that goes over 

1101
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,430
to this to education in general.
You know when,

1102
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,510
if a parent has to come to the place 
where you say these are the rules,

1103
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:57,610
you live under my roof,
you need to pay them.

1104
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,920
That's like raising the white flag and 
that meeting,

1105
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,900
I've lost all that idea.
I lost control.

1106
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:02,734
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing 
cause it's like of course all the are 

1107
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:05,914
going to do is wait for you to turn 
around and do exactly the senior 

1108
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,540
prohibiting cause they are coming across
as a dictator.

1109
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,650
You're coming across as an asshole.
If instead you can teach somebody like,

1110
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:15,484
look man,
you can whatever you want the gold 

1111
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,404
leader is,
we want to make sure we both want to 

1112
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:21,280
make sure that you're happy and you're 
safe,

1113
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,073
simple enough.
So let's figure out a strategy to make 

1114
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:27,060
sure you can be happy and safe and we 
are on,

1115
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,980
I'm on board,

1116
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,813
whatever.
That's a lot easier for people to 

1117
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:31,574
respond to be like,
okay so you're not just a kill joy who 

1118
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:37,190
was trying to squash my life.
You are somebody who was concerned about

1119
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:39,620
me not ending up dead.
Fair enough.

1120
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,320
We couldn't work with that.
Yeah.

1121
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,100
Yeah.
But parents have to work.

1122
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,570
Yeah.
And then don't have any time.

1123
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,433
Exactly.
I don't have to tell you you're a 

1124
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,840
parent.
Right.

1125
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,390
You know,
like,

1126
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,790
just fucking listen to me.
Just shut up.

1127
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,010
I'm tonight busy writing my book over 
here.

1128
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,760
Fucking get my lectures ready.
And kids like,

1129
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,390
hey,
hey,

1130
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,480
what about whiskey?
Don't fucking touch that shit.

1131
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,270
Get out of that.
Get out of that liquor cabinet.

1132
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,380
Right.
Yeah.

1133
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:04,970
I remember when I was a kid,
I couldn't wait to drink.

1134
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,800
It has the course.
This is going to be fun.

1135
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,600
Of course.
Gotta be this taboo.

1136
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,710
Yup.
It's forbidden.

1137
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,630
Yep.
So,

1138
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,280
but that's the problem that we'd 
forbidden stuff.

1139
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,563
It never works well.
It's also a Italian food and wine seem 

1140
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:22,090
to go hand in hand and,
and it's,

1141
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,391
I think,
I mean,

1142
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:28,250
did they used to be what they drank 
because they were concerned with getting

1143
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,084
sick.
Right.

1144
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,270
And one of the best ways to not get sick
was to drink wine.

1145
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,343
Yeah.
Because,

1146
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,431
well,
yeah,

1147
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:36,740
the alcohol content would keep the water
from,

1148
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,690
I mean like if you just drink water all 
the time,

1149
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:42,470
especially if it's sitting still,
you could get some bad fucking water.

1150
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,060
Right?
You can get bad water from a lake.

1151
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:44,894
I mean,
how many,

1152
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,150
they didn't know Jack Shit about 
parasites back then.

1153
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:47,984
How many people got some terrible 
diseases from drinking puddle water and 

1154
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,471
shit?
You know,

1155
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:52,910
I'm sure a lot.
Oh yeah.

1156
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,440
He just find some water like,
oh,

1157
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:54,980
we're thirsty.

1158
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,813
Time to drink.
Or even at creek you drink in a creek 

1159
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,601
and you think like,
oh,

1160
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,300
this is a beautiful stream.
This is a clear water.

1161
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,134
Yeah.
But a beaver took a shit just a hundred 

1162
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,720
yards of so that you don't know about 
it.

1163
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,940
You get what's called beaver fever.
That's what you're for real.

1164
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,150
That's what they called Giardia.
They call it beaver fever.

1165
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,110
Yeah.
That can be good.

1166
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,063
Now it's terrible.
So they used to drink wine to prevent 

1167
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:22,700
what they would call traveler's disease 
because people would take these,

1168
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,190
those,
what are those things called?

1169
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,063
The leather things that they would carry
wine and I want to say flask but it's 

1170
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,200
not a flask.
One of those,

1171
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,680
those leather satchels,
they know what they're about.

1172
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,900
[inaudible] I thought they use 
philosopher dots but I'm not sure.

1173
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,953
It might be,
there's a term it's like a leather bag 

1174
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,380
and it had like a on the end like a cork
and they just drink from that and that's

1175
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:46,400
how they would hydrate.

1176
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,323
Yup.
People must have been just hammered all 

1177
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,610
day when you read the statistics of how 
much people used to drink.

1178
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,533
It's amazing that anything got article 
done cause it's just people where that 

1179
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:57,584
ain't good morning through night and 
they must have been horrific to each 

1180
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:01,664
other.
Then just just to imagine like a whole 

1181
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:09,200
civilization that is a drunken bar at 
1:00 AM angry drunk you.

1182
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,840
Yeah.
It's funny cause I never,

1183
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,890
I mean I've seen it enough that I get 
it.

1184
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:17,891
People get edgy and weird where when day
drink too much,

1185
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,853
but I never got it because to me it's 
like if I'm drunk he like that's when 

1186
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:23,030
I'm happy.
I want to tag people.

1187
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,030
Why would I be in a bad mood is awesome.
This for,

1188
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,200
you're a nice guy.
That's what it is.

1189
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:30,300
That comes out the,
yeah.

1190
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:31,780
If you're a fucking asshole,
you,

1191
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,450
she'll drop.
I see.

1192
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,690
Especially if you just barely keep in 
that ass hole under the surface,

1193
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:39,210
just barely just wondering science,
stab her,

1194
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,053
but in club them and steal their women.
And then you get a couple of drinks in 

1195
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,400
you and this,
this is alcohol.

1196
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:50,430
Alcohol is a great social lubricant.
It's great for releasing inhibitions and

1197
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,090
letting people communicate with each 
other more freely and have fun.

1198
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,540
But it's also,
it removes doubt and that's not good.

1199
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,503
I think town is critical.
Like doubt is one of the pieces of the 

1200
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,540
great puzzle,
right?

1201
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,374
The,
the great puzzle has many ingredients 

1202
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:12,510
and one of those ingredients is doubt 
and doubt is important.

1203
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:17,790
You should look at anything you're about
to contemplate and go think about this.

1204
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,150
Let me think what could go wrong when 
you get a couple of drinks.

1205
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,200
Fuck it.
Let's do it.

1206
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,750
Let's go.
And then next thing you know,

1207
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,200
you know you're on an Internet meme.
Hold my beer.

1208
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,260
Yeah,
exactly.

1209
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,094
We talked about that yesterday,
like some of the most more ridiculous 

1210
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:31,614
ones,
but there's so many of those out there 

1211
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,830
and almost all of them I have to do with
alcohol.

1212
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:35,680
Yeah,
no,

1213
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,330
you are totally right.
And I think what you saying about dove,

1214
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,870
there's a great Alan Watts,
the guy who polarizes an and that weighs

1215
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,740
in Mendota,
that stuff.

1216
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,100
He had these good eighth line,
he called it the wisdom of insecurity.

1217
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,270
These idl that I had to re careful.
There's a lease,

1218
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,104
don't dairy,
not being sure he'd dogmatic and which 

1219
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:55,494
doesn't mean the problem is then people 
take that concept to fire and that 

1220
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,980
donating to having no bowls and not 
being able to pick a standard.

1221
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,120
That's not a solution either.

1222
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,953
That's the other side of the problem.
But there's a sweet spot in between 

1223
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:11,070
where you can take stances,
but they are careful statuses.

1224
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,933
They are sent stances that are very 
willing to be change at the drop of a 

1225
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:17,370
dime if you show the good evidence to to
change them.

1226
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,350
You know?
He's,

1227
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,330
that to me is what the intellectual 
honesty looks like,

1228
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,381
you know?
Yeah,

1229
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:26,250
I agree.
I think it's good to be aware of all the

1230
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,084
possibilities.
I used to tell people that when I was a 

1231
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,143
teaching taekwondo,
like people that would compete if there 

1232
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:33,510
were really,
really nervous,

1233
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:34,344
I'd be like the really smart people are 
really nervous because you're aware of 

1234
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,710
all the possibilities of everything that
could go wrong.

1235
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,050
The people that aren't worried about it 
at all,

1236
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,050
they're usually dumb.
There's that,

1237
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,913
but also to me there are some people,
like I look at some of the people were 

1238
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,020
able to keep it together in this like 
kind of like Chuck [inaudible],

1239
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,220
right?

1240
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,200
Take a nap right before a fight kind of 
thing.

1241
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,110
I can't tell by looking at those guys 
and just be like,

1242
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,093
you'd have something.
I don't know what you know there's 

1243
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:03,000
something there that you are doing.
Confidence for sure.

1244
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,220
I mean chuck had been knocking people 
unconscious for many,

1245
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:08,760
many years and he knew exactly what to 
do and I think knew he was good at it.

1246
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:09,594
There's that for sure.
And I think there's the other side is 

1247
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:12,160
knowing that,
okay,

1248
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:12,994
if I have decided to do it,
fear is not going to help me now you 

1249
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,610
know that me to make decisions so 
earlier,

1250
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:19,950
but right now he's not going to help me.
So let's figure out,

1251
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,210
man.
It was hilarious.

1252
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,053
There's um,
my girlfriend fights mma professionally 

1253
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,390
and she notice that yeah,
she's wise man.

1254
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:30,400
Been paying attention to uh,
your escapades online.

1255
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,710
She's,
she's crazy.

1256
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,543
She's crazy.
She said she lita Lee at that chuck 

1257
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:36,694
Liddell mode where she,
she took a nap right before a fight and 

1258
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:39,874
you know,
like 45 minutes before you have to wake 

1259
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,600
her up going like,
hey roddy.

1260
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,200
And she's all like,
okay,

1261
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,940
ready to roll.
And I'm like,

1262
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,470
I would not sleep for a week prior.
How do you manage to keep it together?

1263
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,180
Kids do.
I used to do that.

1264
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:54,100
I used to sleep before fights.
It's good.

1265
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,180
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1266
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,023
But you,
you just can get yourself into a more 

1267
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:02,260
calm state.
It's so much better than I'm frantically

1268
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:05,250
running around and freaking out.
Threading plus is a,

1269
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,730
it's a,
it freaks out your opponents.

1270
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,470
I would sleep like right in the 
bleachers.

1271
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:09,723
I just go to sleep right there and 
everybody else would be nervous and 

1272
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:12,760
shit.
And you're sleeping.

1273
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:13,623
Exactly.
Do you look at them and then I'm 

1274
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,483
supposed to fight that guy.
The guy was leaping right before the 

1275
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:18,640
fight.
Hell No.

1276
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:22,180
Like the first to match studied.
I was nuts because you know,

1277
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:26,110
you're in the locker room and there's 
the guy sitting next to you goes out for

1278
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:27,460
his match.
Come right back.

1279
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,110
[inaudible]

1280
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,840
you get ready,
you're going next.

1281
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,780
And I'm dying,
right?

1282
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,960
I'm just seeking out to hell.
And she's all like la La la.

1283
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,820
Where'd you meet her gym?
Uh,

1284
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,723
no.
She literally live across the street 

1285
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:42,790
from me.
That's crazy.

1286
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,970
And it was funny because I used to say 
it,

1287
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,890
this is where the universe as a sense of
humor,

1288
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,470
because I used to say all the time,
like I'm kind of,

1289
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,030
I can get along with anybody but I don't
necessarily click with a lot of people.

1290
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:56,020
So my thing was like,
yeah,

1291
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:58,600
where do I find somebody?
I click with Laura across the street and

1292
00:57:58,601 --> 00:57:59,434
I said,
they're like pen pals and dies right at 

1293
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,640
what they have.
Like look at that.

1294
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,193
That's hilarious.
I know he was looking at the universe 

1295
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:08,050
going like,
okay,

1296
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,100
that's funny,
ha ha,

1297
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,113
but the this definitely like little 
things that almost like slap you in the 

1298
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:15,070
face with,
yeah,

1299
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,600
there's a whole system going on.

1300
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,520
Stupid.
It just pay attention.

1301
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,083
Like I know you make fun of Oprah,
but the secret might be real mother 

1302
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:25,240
fucker.
Oprah has got $3 billion.

1303
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:31,210
See it his way to do it all.
It seems completely preposterous,

1304
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,530
but yeah.
Intellectually I always want to say Nah.

1305
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,603
You know,
then things don't happen for a fucking 

1306
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,764
reason.
You decide they happen for a reason 

1307
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:40,720
afterwards.
Yeah,

1308
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,370
because it helps fit your sense of 
order.

1309
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,623
It's the funny thing is I completely 
agree with that and I also completely 

1310
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,180
agree with the fact that sometimes sinks
clicking away.

1311
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:50,080
Then you're like,
okay,

1312
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,170
you're a fucking wait to meet these is 
just to think about people all the time.

1313
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,033
Out of nowhere.
I'll get an email from him like out of 

1314
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:56,914
nowhere,
like I haven't talked to this guy in 10 

1315
00:58:57,791 --> 00:59:01,300
fucking years and then all of sudden I 
get an email or you know,

1316
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,460
you run into them somewhere,
like what?

1317
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,740
How is it possible I'm running into at 
the airport?

1318
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,560
Like this doesn't even make sense.
I know you reconnect.

1319
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,370
It's very strange.
Yeah,

1320
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,560
there those are the times when he really
humbles you and makes you think,

1321
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:15,394
okay,
the university such a weird place and 

1322
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:21,380
what I understand he's like,
but release 0.01% of what's out there.

1323
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,070
Yeah.

1324
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,903
We're connected in some other weird,
bizarre way that we haven't figured out 

1325
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:29,160
yet and maybe we'll never will.
Maybe we'll become symbiotics.

1326
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,283
Maybe it will become like completely 
ingrained technologically before we 

1327
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:36,350
figure out the biological connections 
that we share because I think there's,

1328
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,930
I think there's like the obvious senses 
that we all have,

1329
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,640
but I think there's some other stuff 
going on.

1330
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,260
When you think about someone and then 
boom,

1331
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,173
they're,
they're calling you on the phone like 

1332
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:45,080
that.
Dad,

1333
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:49,100
just to me is too coincidental 
sometimes.

1334
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,710
Sometimes it's random.
Sure.

1335
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,320
Like say if it's someone that you talk 
to all the time and then they call you,

1336
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:58,130
that's just coincidental.
But there's some times man,

1337
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,180
where you just,
you're talking about someone and also in

1338
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,140
the fucking phone rings and I go look at
this.

1339
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,340
This is crazy.
Yep.

1340
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,980
You haven't talked to them at four years
exact calling you right there.

1341
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,690
Exactly.
There's something to that.

1342
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,620
Yup.
And they,

1343
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:10,970
and you asked them like,
why did you call me?

1344
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,950
Just stop right now.
I'm not,

1345
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:14,420
I'm not saying like,
why are you calling me?

1346
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,870
I'm saying like what was going on?
Like what caused you to call me?

1347
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,800
I don't know.
Just had a weird feeling rod.

1348
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,960
Oh fuck man.
That's crazy though.

1349
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,960
If it's always the things.
Yeah,

1350
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,530
that's,
yeah.

1351
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,440
Then you could also tell when people are
creepy too,

1352
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:29,690
right?
You can tell when someone's a creep.

1353
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,610
Just like there's something,
the vibe that you'll pick up weird vibe.

1354
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:35,210
Like what is that like?
What's that?

1355
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,400
I really do think that there's something
that,

1356
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,910
you know,
verbal communication,

1357
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:41,780
when he's a vet,
he's mold way in which we communicate.

1358
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:43,470
There's so much more clear.
It's cause you know,

1359
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,760
there are times when you walk into a 
room and you will that I didn't know who

1360
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:48,220
you are going to like and what you're 
doing.

1361
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:53,460
You and the ones that you don't,
then you need to spend the next whatever

1362
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:56,960
long it takes you to find the reason why
you don't click that you will.

1363
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,810
I didn't know it.
There's that something there is going on

1364
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:00,644
and the smell and I thought,
I don't think most people could ask 

1365
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:04,520
their perception.
So they are like,

1366
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:04,971
no,
no.

1367
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:05,804
I need to find out the rationale,
the reason why would I have these 

1368
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,640
preconceptions I need.
To me,

1369
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:12,470
it's like if you feel it just partly 
good,

1370
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:13,340
the reason for it,
you know,

1371
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,203
if you have a strong feeling about it,
how would that I state rather than not 

1372
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,910
fuck yeah,
yeah.

1373
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,460
Trusted rather than not as a good way 
and you know,

1374
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,890
don't trust it.
Like that's definitely a witch.

1375
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:25,440
Yeah.
No,

1376
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,530
not that.
Do not burn.

1377
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:29,960
Knew it.
Do not burn your people at the stake.

1378
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,170
That's a bad idea.
You know,

1379
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:34,730
that was a weird time too.
Right.

1380
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,450
It's just amazing to me that,
um,

1381
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,593
the United States is such a recent sort 
of experiment in self government and 

1382
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:46,280
that no one has done anything like that 
since then.

1383
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,503
That's what's kind of really amazing to 
me when to stop and think about all the 

1384
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:55,310
wacky shit that's taking place in 
America over the last 300 plus years and

1385
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,620
then no one else has done that.
No one else has said,

1386
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,583
look,
we found the spot in Australia and the 

1387
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,250
Australian government is allowed us to 
carve off a big chunk and that's,

1388
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,510
let's call it,
you know,

1389
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,420
whatever.
Then Daniella land,

1390
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,950
I'm all for it.
That I swear I'll be a good leader.

1391
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:11,803
I,
well,

1392
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,700
it's going well.
Your wives maybe.

1393
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,573
It seems like what it's also amazing is 
that the United States has managed to 

1394
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:20,184
become the number one superpower in the 
world as a a group of all crazy 

1395
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:25,710
immigrants.

1396
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,510
That all moved into one spot.
Yup.

1397
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:28,943
Yeah.
Know the story of the United States is 

1398
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:31,044
fascinating because he had you don't,
and probably is never going to happen 

1399
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:36,390
again because you know,
that was the proud owner of a word I did

1400
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:37,410
not know about.
Oh,

1401
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:38,640
there's this other column,
you know,

1402
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,990
you'll find out.
It's a new,

1403
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,150
it's exciting.
It's 76 now.

1404
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:45,540
You'll know what's out there and then,
unless you go for space exploration,

1405
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:48,570
nothing like these will happen in the 
history of planet earth.

1406
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:51,300
It just,
the only way it can happen is a reset.

1407
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,193
A civilization reset.
Like there'd have to be like a bunch of 

1408
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,340
people die.
Like most people die.

1409
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,293
I Paul called libs.
Most people lose the knowledge of what 

1410
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:00,360
was going on before then.
Yeah,

1411
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:02,940
sure.
He'll can have a post Grad Manco kind of

1412
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,320
story.
Yeah.

1413
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,730
Yeah.
Post Graham Hancock,

1414
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:07,590
that's entirely possible.
Yeah,

1415
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,910
that's entirely possible.

1416
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,790
Although I did read something very 
recently that they think,

1417
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:13,730
um,
um,

1418
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,603
what was the,
a supervolcano that killed most people 

1419
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:20,214
on the planet 70,000 years ago.
They found one pocket of humans that 

1420
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:24,294
actually survived and thrived in Africa.
But they think that the entire 

1421
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:32,490
population of a human beings at that 
point in time,

1422
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,324
70,000 years ago,
the entire population in the world was 

1423
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:39,080
only around a hundred thousand people.
It's,

1424
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,960
yeah.
And then it dropped down to 10,000 wow.

1425
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,630
10,000 people because of the Super 
Volcano.

1426
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,670
So the super volcano blew.
It wiped out most life.

1427
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:55,560
It wiped out most people.
It plunged the earth into some sort of a

1428
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:58,140
nuclear winter.
I forgot where it was.

1429
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:00,750
I want to say it was Bali or Indonesia 
Toba.

1430
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,040
Where was that?
Indonesia.

1431
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:02,874
Indonesia Sumatra killed.
Literally 90% of the people and 10,000 

1432
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:10,434
were left.
So 70,000 years ago we were down at 

1433
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:15,990
10,000 humans,
which makes all the sinks about racism.

1434
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,820
So sealy,
cause that's a,

1435
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:18,654
that's a good show for Kevin Hart that 
even that's a light crowd for Kevin 

1436
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,200
Hart's.
Exactly how she got 10,000 people.

1437
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,373
Yeah.
It's like a fucking blink one 82 

1438
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,810
concert.
10,000 people,

1439
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,653
man,
that's nothing that you stop and think 

1440
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,130
about that.
It's insane.

1441
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,140
I've done 10,000 people in the night 
before in uh,

1442
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,540
Denver.
I did two shows.

1443
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:42,210
There are 5,000 each.
That's 10,000 people.

1444
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:47,211
That's the fucking entire population of 
earth and that now became 7 billion.

1445
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,120
70,000 years later.
It's nuts.

1446
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,790
We're so weird where it's such a weird 
animal.

1447
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,040
Like if you could study us without being
us,

1448
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,203
like if somehow I know that you could 
remove all of your cultural conceptions 

1449
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:02,004
and all the,
all the things that you've just sort of 

1450
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,823
accepted and you establish as fact as a 
human and just look at it completely 

1451
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,800
objective,
you'd be like,

1452
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:11,634
what are nutty animal?
This thing is what the fuck are we 

1453
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:16,164
doing?
Yeah.

1454
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,470
That's why

1455
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,470
it never gets old to study the human 
psyche.

1456
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:21,304
Like what makes people choose this?
Because that's the beauty of human 

1457
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,450
beings.
We have choices that,

1458
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:26,520
you know,
Eh,

1459
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,383
at Wolf is a wolf.
There are only so many things you can 

1460
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:31,750
choose as a wall for your,
you know?

1461
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:32,584
Yeah.
You could have a world that adopts one 

1462
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:34,630
strategy,
one another,

1463
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,670
but the range of choices is pretty 
limited.

1464
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:39,550
As humans,
we have this insane range of choices and

1465
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:40,384
he's fascinated to see what is the,
make some people going one direction in 

1466
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:47,530
a completely different one and it's fun.
It is fun.

1467
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:50,200
It,
and what's fascinating to me about human

1468
01:05:50,201 --> 01:05:54,700
beings of today is I've never seen a 
time where people were more interesting,

1469
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,910
more interested rather in other people 
doing what they want them to do,

1470
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,540
like other people thinking the way they 
want them to think,

1471
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,240
other people behaving the way they want 
the people want.

1472
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,073
It seems to me are more concerned with 
controlling people's expression and 

1473
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:17,290
thinking today than ever before and even
more so on the left.

1474
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,513
It seems like I'm seeing this 
interesting trend today where people 

1475
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:23,974
like,
it's almost like we don't like where 

1476
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:27,670
things are headed.
We don't like what's happening.

1477
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:28,504
We don't like who the president is.
So people are are being real adamant 

1478
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:36,010
about enforcing certain types of 
behavior and that in turn,

1479
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,023
just like we're talking about 
suppressing people from drinking 

1480
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,810
alcohol,
then in turn makes people rebel.

1481
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:45,370
Of course that's like there's more 
people that are leaning right today than

1482
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:50,350
ever before and I attribute it entirely 
to the people on the left piano to thing

1483
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:54,010
that's funny about it is that most human
beings,

1484
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,570
even if you've just,
we'll cut the United States,

1485
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:58,750
right?
Most people are not the extreme right or

1486
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,420
extreme left.
No Fair whelming majority or not,

1487
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,080
right.

1488
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,913
I think a lot of the staff is also a 
little bit media created in the sense 

1489
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:06,814
that he's like,
let's find a moss batshit crazy person 

1490
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,860
on that side to put the spotlight on 
them,

1491
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,680
which make everybody go like,
what the fuck?

1492
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,830
Why are those crazy people?
And that's how,

1493
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,900
it's kind of like if you were to peek,
you know,

1494
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:24,460
the Westboro Baptist Church and make it 
be a representative of Christianity.

1495
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,360
It's like it's not,
you're nobody.

1496
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,390
If you keeps putting the spotlight 
there,

1497
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:30,100
you'll create this perception with 
Korea,

1498
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:30,934
tobacco collage and it becomes this 
thing where like that sounded funny 

1499
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:38,410
thing that I was in the ltcm because I 
really don't like political correctness.

1500
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:40,900
I really don't like academia.
I really don't.

1501
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,763
You know,
there are 10,000 of these things where 

1502
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:43,300
I'm like,
yeah,

1503
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,133
that's,
I'm completely on board with not liking 

1504
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:49,630
some of these things.
But then there's another side where,

1505
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,464
you know,
I have been teaching a university since 

1506
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:53,254
2001 I don't think I've seen once a case
of the kind of political correctness 

1507
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:00,750
that I see in articles in media now,
lance,

1508
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,560
you know,
like I was doing the math.

1509
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:03,394
I had probably maybe 11,000 students in 
my classes over the course of these 

1510
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,593
years and I don't,
I haven't heard one person ever the fan 

1511
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:15,380
hardcore communism or make an argument.
Even among my colleagues,

1512
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:16,040
which I have

1513
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,450
issues for other reason.
That's never been one of the things.

1514
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:22,130
So I'm like,
I keep hearing about it.

1515
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:25,370
I read it on papers by why is that when 
I spend,

1516
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,290
you know,
that's how I make my living.

1517
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,770
I'm on college campuses all the time.
I hardly ever see it.

1518
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:33,080
And so I'm thinking,
I'm not saying that he's not through.

1519
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:33,914
Of course.
I mean,

1520
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,410
of course the stories are true.
There's no argument.

1521
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,640
But what I'm wondering is how much do 
they get blown out of proportion because

1522
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:44,120
you get clicks because it makes for an 
interesting narrative which dance.

1523
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:47,660
Some people also leave off kind of 
narrative and I'm like,

1524
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,153
how much is it something where you're 
putting the spotlight on a rare 

1525
01:08:52,531 --> 01:08:55,640
exception and make it the norm versus 
how much?

1526
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:58,940
It's a real thing because you know,
you would expect,

1527
01:08:58,941 --> 01:08:59,774
I mean I teach in south around 
California and some of the ones who 

1528
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:01,641
leave them,
you know,

1529
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:04,130
Santa Monica is one of the most liberal 
places around.

1530
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,220
If d seeing was as dominant as 
advertised,

1531
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,500
I should be running into it all the 
time.

1532
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:11,810
Right.
And I don't like that stuff.

1533
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:12,890
So I would be sensitive,
you know,

1534
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:15,440
I would be paying attention and yet I 
don't see it.

1535
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,520
So I'm like,
hmm,

1536
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,560
what's going on here?
That's interesting.

1537
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:19,603
Well,
I think the instances are more frequent 

1538
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:22,304
than ever before.
But I also think if you put it into 

1539
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:25,214
perspective and think about how many 
universities there are across the 

1540
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:28,874
country,
I mean there are hundreds and hundreds 

1541
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:32,144
of universities and if you have one 
incident that breaks out one month in 

1542
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:39,674
one place exactly.
And it was about one conservative 

1543
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,543
speaker that's going to give a lecture 
and everybody freaks out and goes crazy 

1544
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:50,000
and all the people with green hair 
fucking bang on the windows.

1545
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,463
It's a,
it becomes something that people were 

1546
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:56,150
worried about spreading.
And so I think that's one of the,

1547
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,940
one of the reasons,
cause like I'm sure you're familiar with

1548
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:01,610
the story from Evergreen University,
Evergreen state.

1549
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,340
Yup.
That was a fascinating story.

1550
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,730
And for people who are interested in it,
Google,

1551
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,340
uh,
Bret Weinstein and um,

1552
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,450
evergreen state college and you could 
listen to him on my podcast.

1553
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:17,060
I had him on right after it all went 
down.

1554
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,553
What had happened was there's a thing 
called the day of absence that had 

1555
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:20,954
traditionally been people of color would
stay home just so that people would 

1556
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:25,700
recognize that like,
oh,

1557
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:26,534
when they're not there,
we missed them and we missed their 

1558
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:28,514
contributions.
And they're an important part of our 

1559
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,464
community.
I think that's a little silly to stay 

1560
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,624
home and do that.
But I think it's not a bad thing for 

1561
01:10:36,411 --> 01:10:39,980
people to recognize that everybody plays
a part.

1562
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:40,814
And if these people feel marginalized,
give them a little extra juice and 

1563
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:43,714
that's fine.
But the real hardcore social justice 

1564
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:50,180
warriors decided that's not enough.
Instead what we want is all white people

1565
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:52,530
to stay home.
And like you can't do that.

1566
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:53,364
And of course is the,
now you're telling people to stay home 

1567
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:59,780
versus allowing people to stay home in 
which a case you missed them.

1568
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,943
This is the opposite.
You're telling these white people to 

1569
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:03,560
fuck off.
So Brett,

1570
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:06,650
who is like a fiercely progressive 
person,

1571
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,170
was telling people like,
you are making a mistake here.

1572
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,420
You're getting out of line.
This is not the way to do it.

1573
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,293
Right.
And then they went crazy and fucking 

1574
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:13,980
looking for him

1575
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,480
with baseball bats.
And they,

1576
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,061
you know,
they,

1577
01:11:16,061 --> 01:11:19,200
they,
they literally kidnapped classes.

1578
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:22,080
They held a teacher,
they held the principal,

1579
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,103
uh,
or the president of the school in this 

1580
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:26,880
room.
And even when he,

1581
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:27,714
they went to the bathroom,
they escorted him to the restroom and 

1582
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:31,650
then brought him back to the room and 
they wouldn't let people leave.

1583
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,530
The stories are amazing.
Not mean fed that stuff.

1584
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,770
He's complete batshit crazy line.
Right.

1585
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:38,940
That shit crazy.
We completely agree on that.

1586
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:42,210
It's like that is ridiculous.
That has no place anywhere.

1587
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,253
That's bullshit that you don't do.
Stuff like that is just same thing as 

1588
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:47,064
like,
you know to Jordan Peterson thing in 

1589
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:49,920
Toronto,
that policy wall,

1590
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:52,290
just stupid policy and he was right in 
our going against it.

1591
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:54,520
So I'm not arguing that those are that 
they are wrong.

1592
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,120
Now I know you're not know you're not 
there.

1593
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,043
Right.
My issue is from there to wire green 

1594
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:00,384
that dcs the super prevalent thing.
It's like from one story or one study 

1595
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:06,024
there to say instead,
you know there's a communist conspiracy 

1596
01:12:08,011 --> 01:12:09,240
to brainwash us all.
It's like,

1597
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,074
okay,
what we are starting from a completely 

1598
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:15,720
understandable prime and taking it like 
25 steps too far.

1599
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:16,650
Yeah,
I agree.

1600
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,813
I agree.
But I think that what's happening is 

1601
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:20,634
more of these unusual situations are 
occurring and so people were terrified 

1602
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:30,711
of this spreading like wildfire across 
the country because kids are very easily

1603
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,040
influenced,
you know,

1604
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,440
and there are also idealistic,
you know,

1605
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:35,580
they,
they wanna change the world.

1606
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,210
Maybe they grew up with a father was an 
asshole and a racist and like fuck this,

1607
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,100
no racism,
no fascism and they're calling everybody

1608
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:44,130
that Nazi and running down the street.
But that's,

1609
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,610
you have it as a question,
not as a something I'm sure of.

1610
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,770
But what I want that is our motto of 
daisies,

1611
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,693
media,
media fueled and now matches the real 

1612
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,300
[inaudible].
He yelled for sure.

1613
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,760
My question is how much is some,
well,

1614
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:00,594
there's most certainly media influences 
people in it influences people in a 

1615
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,254
bunch of different ways.
It shows that you can get attention for 

1616
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:09,654
doing certain things.
It shows that other people were in 

1617
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:12,024
support of maybe what you thought were 
your radical ideas and then you find 

1618
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:15,744
other radical people as well.
But I mean that's also the argument for 

1619
01:13:18,601 --> 01:13:20,610
not publishing the name of school 
shooters.

1620
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,430
Right?
It's because a lot of these people think

1621
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:26,220
that this is media fueled by people that
are seeking attention.

1622
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:27,054
And I,
I think they're probably right and 

1623
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:29,094
certain in a certain respect,
but it's also just a part of who we are 

1624
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:38,211
and I think it makes us really consider 
and taking the responsibility,

1625
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
what is significant about broadcasting 
ideas and how much influence these ideas

1626
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:48,090
have on people who absorb them.

1627
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,770
For sure.
Take them in for sure.

1628
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:53,070
I think my issue,
it's some of the seeing is that often it

1629
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:53,904
becomes a power thing.
It become Micah when your guys do that 

1630
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,680
and they showed those totalitarian 
sinks,

1631
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:01,350
then boo bath authoritarians.
When my guys,

1632
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:02,184
the way turn the other way in Bhutan is 
not true to me in fact is not a one 

1633
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:07,164
particular ideology or neither.
It kind of goes back to what you were 

1634
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:12,850
saying about human nature in general,
totalitarianism.

1635
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:13,923
You know,
this idea that you want to control what 

1636
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:18,940
people think they are.
Choices is horrible,

1637
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:21,700
but regardless of who's doing it,
and in that case,

1638
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:22,534
nobody has a monopoly on this because 
you have seen a hardcore religious 

1639
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:28,740
fundamentalists push totalitarianism,
you have seen Harlem,

1640
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,160
you know eight day study biology like 
communism pushing totalitarian.

1641
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,400
Yeah,
completely right.

1642
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,090
You see people on the political left 
report on the political right.

1643
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,400
Everybody has,
it's a virus.

1644
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,263
You know it's a viral self.
The mind that when he took over there's 

1645
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,024
this desire squall shola their choices 
and I find it equally horrible that 

1646
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:48,734
regardless of who's doing it,
you know I'm a little suspicious of 

1647
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:52,374
wearing the narrative becomes Luca dose 
guys doing it and you're only picking 

1648
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:56,764
one side.
It's like there are some guys where I 

1649
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:01,180
see even in the desperately try to be 
like,

1650
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:01,931
no,
I'm fair.

1651
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:02,890
Look,
I pick on my,

1652
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,810
I was listening to somebody doing this 
thing.

1653
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:07,390
I think it was more rightwing Korea 
entered and he was saying,

1654
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,340
Oh this time we are wrong.
And I was like,

1655
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:11,110
oh look at that.
That's kind of a self critique.

1656
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:12,400
That's interesting.
Let me listen.

1657
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,833
We are wrong because we are just like 
the left and you should hear what the 

1658
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:17,434
left at the and then for the next half 
hour he goes on about the left and I'm 

1659
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,820
like,
that's not seth Godin.

1660
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,300
He sees a motherfucker.
You're stele parties on shale know.

1661
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,353
That's like not been honest to me and 
that I think what bugs me is when it's 

1662
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:33,640
an ideological battle,
when you want to score points as opposed

1663
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:34,361
to saying,
look,

1664
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:38,590
there are certain scenes that are fucked
up that are evil totalitarianism,

1665
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:41,620
regardless of we charge a is attached to
it is bad.

1666
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,080
How about we agree on that?
You know,

1667
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:44,943
that's,
that's kind of where sometime I feel a 

1668
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:50,434
little sketch in the way the narrative 
gets pushed that it become semi tribe 

1669
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,150
versus your tribe thing.
Well,

1670
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:55,984
you would probably know better than most
because you've been teaching in 

1671
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:58,594
universities for so long.
I mean you would see that you're on the 

1672
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:01,384
battlefield.
I think a lot of what it is is a lot of 

1673
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:04,534
what you were talking about before about
people doing horrific things is that 

1674
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:08,854
they're cowards and they just give in to
the whims of those around them and the 

1675
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,230
mob mentality.

1676
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,063
And I think that happens with the right 
wing ideology that you see expressed in 

1677
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,030
horrific ways.
Like,

1678
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,490
you know,
whether it's uh,

1679
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,820
you know,
I mean fill in the blank.

1680
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:25,654
It could be Charlottesville shall be any
of these horrific things that have 

1681
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:29,284
happened where right wing people got 
together and protested versus what 

1682
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:34,024
happens with the left.
I think it's a lot of it is just people 

1683
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:39,820
wanting to be a part of a group.
People wanting to be a part of this,

1684
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,890
uh,
this thing that gives them,

1685
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,053
they have this feeling of being in a 
tribe and solidarity and then they go 

1686
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,920
along with whatever the ideology is that
tribes pushing.

1687
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,070
And that to me is such a danger because 
he's,

1688
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:55,563
you know,
that sense of belonging is something 

1689
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:59,410
that all human beings crave to one 
degree or another.

1690
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,783
And sweets.
The same thing that make people join 

1691
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:07,090
cults is the same thing that make people
join some hardcore political position is

1692
01:17:07,091 --> 01:17:09,440
the same thing that make people join 
biker guy.

1693
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,550
It's the same mentality,

1694
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,750
right?
Is we need to,

1695
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,530
as our [inaudible] group with the same 
clothes,

1696
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:16,364
with the same idea as we stand for,
because it feels good to have other 

1697
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:23,210
people who embrace he was one of them or
three t well as a result,

1698
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,073
but of course the price to pay is your 
individuality because you have to kind 

1699
01:17:28,071 --> 01:17:28,904
of sacrifice the complexity of who you 
are in order to fit in neatly into this 

1700
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:33,390
box.
Yeah,

1701
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:38,240
and you kind of have to,
you have to shut out objectivity because

1702
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:40,040
if you,
if you look at things objectively,

1703
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:40,581
you're going to say,
well,

1704
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:43,940
we're fucked up too and this is,
this doesn't make any sense on why these

1705
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:44,774
aren't my enemy.
They're just people that are on a bad 

1706
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,814
path like Saigon down on a,
I could have gone down that road too if 

1707
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:54,290
I lived over in that community and I've 
found myself in this one spot that leans

1708
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,540
left and so I'm leaning left to right.

1709
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,760
Yeah.
Well how does that stop though?

1710
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,710
This is my question about all that kind 
of stuff.

1711
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:01,544
Like what could ever happen?
What could you foresee happening in 

1712
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:08,090
history where people could look past 
that and sort of figure it out and go,

1713
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:08,924
you know what?
There has gotta be a better way to 

1714
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:12,134
behave and think,
and this is probably one of our main 

1715
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,194
concerns because if you really look at 
what if you ask people what's our main 

1716
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:19,131
concern?
Well,

1717
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:19,911
war.
Okay,

1718
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:20,660
sure.
Uh,

1719
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,620
the economy,
that's,

1720
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:23,120
that's big.
And then you know,

1721
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,580
and there's a host of other things that 
bothered people,

1722
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:27,590
crime and education and all these 
different things.

1723
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:28,790
Well,
what,

1724
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,540
what is causing all of this conflict?
What is,

1725
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,890
what is causing it?
Well,

1726
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:34,724
a giant percentage of what we're talking
about is some sort of a weird tribal 

1727
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:41,870
behavior.
Or you get a get a group,

1728
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,530
you become a part of that group and then
that's what you identify with.

1729
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,363
So that's what you reinforce and then 
you get some sort of Brownie points for 

1730
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:52,640
reinforcing the ideologies of that 
group.

1731
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:53,451
And you,
you know,

1732
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:58,130
if you're the most rabid person years,
the Steve Bannon of that group,

1733
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,173
everybody rises up and gets behind you.
This motherfuckers at the front of the 

1734
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:04,040
line.
Exactly supporting our values.

1735
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,263
And then you know,
you find these communities online where 

1736
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:08,114
people just,
they're constantly signaling to all 

1737
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:10,694
these other people in that group that 
they're supporting this ideology and 

1738
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:14,714
they get all these likes and me like I 
feel like likes on twitter and on 

1739
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:19,874
instagram and stuff like that.
I feel like that's shaping people's 

1740
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:26,720
opinions and behavior way more than 
anyone has taken into consideration.

1741
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,110
I mean even the fact that you know,
the algorithms,

1742
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,500
make sure that you only see the stuff 
that you are already click like.

1743
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,870
So you start seeing the same threads 
over and over the same topics.

1744
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,500
You'd really is creating echo chambers 
and that's really not good.

1745
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:41,320
It's fucking horrible.
You know,

1746
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:44,450
it's weird and it's weird what people 
like and what people don't like.

1747
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,880
A lot of of people like is just really 
stupid.

1748
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,510
I mean how many girls are getting fake 
asses just for likes on instagram?

1749
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,100
I know it's probably a lot.
Right?

1750
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,070
Definitely.
It's a very,

1751
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:55,904
very interesting time for human beings.
I feel like for you as a person who is 

1752
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,573
deeply knowledgeable about history and 
you study history and you have this 

1753
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:08,130
history podcast,
and when you look at today,

1754
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,113
do you ever try to look at today in a 
perspective of someone in the future 

1755
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:13,650
trying to teach about today?
Yeah,

1756
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:14,484
and the thing is that as much as there 
are obviously cycles in history and 

1757
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:20,820
there are patterns that are recognizable
and all of that two days or so,

1758
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:24,780
so damn unique because if you look at,
just forgot everything got us.

1759
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:25,614
If you look at the way just technology 
has shaped does the last hundred and 50 

1760
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:32,710
years are unlike the previous 200,000 
DRC.

1761
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,490
You know the stuff that has happened in 
the last time,

1762
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:39,450
they're 50 years from electricity,
the refrigerator or Internet radio,

1763
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:40,284
TV.
It's like the pace of technological 

1764
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:43,704
development is something that nobody has
ever even come close in human history 

1765
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:47,904
before.
So we are in a place where it's where 

1766
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,244
really an uncharted territory where the,
the human mind has evolved so much from 

1767
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:58,710
one where happy monkeys running around,
but we are now,

1768
01:20:58,711 --> 01:20:59,544
we have these tools to do stuff that we 
are really not prepared to deal with to 

1769
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:08,091
a large degree and Swiss,
kind of a big open question I how,

1770
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,470
where do we go from here?

1771
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,350
Because there's no previous model that 
you can say,

1772
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:14,184
well that one time,
3000 years ago when they invented the 

1773
01:21:16,531 --> 01:21:18,300
Internet,
they handled it this way.

1774
01:21:18,301 --> 01:21:20,430
It's like there's nothing like it.
You know,

1775
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:21,264
the tools we have are,
our disposals are unlike anything that 

1776
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:29,301
has ever happened before.
So that's how the case is sort of,

1777
01:21:29,361 --> 01:21:30,480
you know,
usually he is three.

1778
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:32,610
You can see,
oh you learned this lesson.

1779
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,410
You can definitely learn about human 
nature and how the human mind works.

1780
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,273
But then from that you have to predict 
how the human mind will be applied to a 

1781
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:41,634
context that's unlike anything,
any other contests that ever faced does 

1782
01:21:44,991 --> 01:21:45,824
before.
And then the big concern is that the 

1783
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,084
human mind will create an artificial 
mind that won't take into consideration 

1784
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:56,841
any of the previous cultural ideals that
we've supported and just go run rampant.

1785
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:57,773
Yup.
The Darpa has created an a robot that 

1786
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:01,630
I've been raving about.

1787
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,450
It drives me crazy.
It's called the eater robot.

1788
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,470
I t.
R.

1789
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:05,930
It,
uh,

1790
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:06,763
it operates on biological material,
meaning it fee is fueled by eating 

1791
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:13,490
bodies.
Okay.

1792
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,040
What could possibly go wrong with that?
The idea is that on the battlefield,

1793
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:20,520
I'm sure they're not talking about this,
they've conveniently left this,

1794
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:23,020
like one of the things that,
well it may be you could eat plants,

1795
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,143
maybe you could eat a rabbit or 
something or maybe give you fucking 

1796
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,350
people.
Like my,

1797
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:29,213
my number one concern with all this 
stuff is that I think it's happening so 

1798
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:33,864
fast and so many things are taking place
in so many different realms when it 

1799
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:37,974
comes to innovation that this stuff will
just catch up to us before we even 

1800
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:43,740
recognize it's happened.
And it will be too late for sure.

1801
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:46,190
I mean,
even just forget every single us,

1802
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:47,550
even just the whole,
uh,

1803
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,620
atomic bomb.

1804
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:53,010
See Schlau for the last ever since we 
started from the 1940 still today,

1805
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,650
there have been some seriously close 
calls.

1806
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,490
There was a,
um,

1807
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,640
I remember to one that was wanting the 
1980s,

1808
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,220
I think right before the end of the Cold
War where there was,

1809
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,480
you know,
Russia,

1810
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,053
you know,
the guy to his boring job where they're 

1811
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,053
supposed to look for missiles from the 
United States and nothing ever happened 

1812
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,770
day after day after day.
And I,

1813
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:13,810
one day there's a bleep on the radar and
you're like,

1814
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,510
oh shit.
And he's the guy,

1815
01:23:15,511 --> 01:23:17,350
he's jaw,
but to Cooley superiors.

1816
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,410
And then if he does the old site,
they are going to press the button.

1817
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,371
And he's like,
no,

1818
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:21,531
no,
no,

1819
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:21,940
no.
Wait,

1820
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,310
let's come down.
Maybe this wrong.

1821
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,360
I made a concern,
not that stupid.

1822
01:23:26,361 --> 01:23:28,660
They will not send one atomic bomb if 
they'd do it,

1823
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:29,410
they send a bunch.

1824
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:31,250
So these must be a mistake.
Let's hold that.

1825
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,830
I relax 30 minutes later and other bleep
and other beliefs and other,

1826
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:35,860
but he was like,
oh shit,

1827
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,660
they are set and you get a bunch of 
atomic bombs.

1828
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:38,494
This is the real deal.
And the Guy Steele doesn't do what he's 

1829
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:45,040
supposed to.
He's feels like if I make this call,

1830
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,023
nuclear war starts,
I need to be [inaudible] was in percent 

1831
01:23:48,671 --> 01:23:49,504
convenience.
The evidence in front of them is pretty 

1832
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:53,470
solid,
but I still don't feel it.

1833
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,960
And then five minutes later,
all the beliefs go off.

1834
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:59,590
It was a mistake on the radar and there 
was like some random bleep and uh,

1835
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,090
the guy promptly there and get bottle of
vodka straight because he was like,

1836
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,700
you know,
the almost caused world war three.

1837
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:08,590
Exactly.
And you know,

1838
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:09,424
most of us all their lives now,
some Russian dude in the 1980s who 

1839
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:14,284
decided not to do what he was supposed 
to and then the old because of this 

1840
01:24:18,561 --> 01:24:22,030
stupid mistake,
stupid bug in the radar.

1841
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,423
That's,
that's when you know that the 

1842
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:28,990
technologies we have are way too much 
for our decision make or way.

1843
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:32,280
Not enough because it should be exactly 
that.

1844
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:34,770
That's the other side.
Nothing.

1845
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,960
I mean what,
was it a flock of birds or was it,

1846
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,240
I don't even know what the thing,
yeah,

1847
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,050
that's,
that kind of shit terrifies me.

1848
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:45,430
It's just the ability to do something 
like that without the,

1849
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:49,150
the understanding or the discipline to 
create it is really nuts.

1850
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,520
I always liken it to like giving a baby 
a gun.

1851
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:54,700
Like the baby didn't figure out how to 
use that gun.

1852
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:57,880
They didn't invent it.
They don't know how to load a around,

1853
01:24:57,881 --> 01:24:59,260
but they can just fucking pull that 
trigger.

1854
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,130
But by,
Yup.

1855
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,233
And people can die that that can happen.
People get killed by toddlers all the 

1856
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:05,494
time.
People leave their person there and 

1857
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:08,980
their bag,
toddler picks it up,

1858
01:25:08,981 --> 01:25:09,850
shoots himself.

1859
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:12,400
Shoot someone else happens over at the 
time.

1860
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,600
All the time.
Yeah.

1861
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:15,880
Yeah.
It's um,

1862
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,690
human beings have access to all sorts of
technologies that we would never be able

1863
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:20,820
to figure it out on our own.
Yeah.

1864
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:21,813
And we don't,
we with those great with the great 

1865
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:26,290
responsibility that comes with using 
those things.

1866
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:31,330
There should be some sort of great 
knowledge that you have to acquire about

1867
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:32,164
the thing itself.
Like some sort of some reasonable 

1868
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:39,880
facsimile of like what it took to create
that thing.

1869
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:44,020
[inaudible] like some deep intensive 
program like,

1870
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:45,370
Hey,
you want to,

1871
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,263
you want to learn how to drive a car.
Like this is how an engine was 

1872
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:50,620
developed.
This is,

1873
01:25:50,621 --> 01:25:51,454
this is how breaks work this out and 
you've got to know you can't half ass 

1874
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:55,940
this or right.
You know,

1875
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,860
the same should be said about guns.
Same should be said about everything.

1876
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,040
We just have access to too much shit 
that we would never be able to figure

1877
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,920
out on our own.
Yeah.

1878
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,760
And we're like,
wow,

1879
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,760
this is fucking try it.
You press that button,

1880
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,390
see what happens.
Yeah.

1881
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,160
Old might be or approach to saying 
societies like learn how to you was he?

1882
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:15,040
Then we can talk about,
yeah,

1883
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,910
they keep coming up with new ones in 
Russia.

1884
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:20,090
Come up with some new super sonic 
missile like it just a few days ago they

1885
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:23,210
announced it.
The better off.

1886
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,260
You're better off not hearing about it.
It was Katie stuff with little,

1887
01:26:27,261 --> 01:26:27,980
uh,
you know,

1888
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,680
old your old,
the guest on the gre will be,

1889
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,553
or in your compound that we'd float 
tanks and stuff to survive depaul 

1890
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:39,770
collapse when the zombies attack.
You don't want to be a survivor.

1891
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,070
I mean you maybe one of your ancestors 
to survive,

1892
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,990
so he should survive.
But you answered,

1893
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,760
she's might get raped and eaton,
right.

1894
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:49,640
It all says off.
Surviving doesn't look like a fun one.

1895
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,181
Yeah.
Right.

1896
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:51,014
Like if you were around in Indonesia 
70,000 years ago when the big one blue 

1897
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:56,900
and you were one of the survivors and 
you're,

1898
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,783
you know,
picking through the wreckage of 

1899
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,650
civilization,
not good times stuff.

1900
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,170
Anyway,
man.

1901
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,330
But then again,
if it wasn't for them,

1902
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,790
we wouldn't have Disneyland.
If we chase it,

1903
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,400
bang part,
I'm calling.

1904
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,180
Yes.
It wasn't for them.

1905
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:12,260
No netflix.
Nope.

1906
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,273
It wasn't for them.
No iphone because of people in 

1907
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:16,510
Indonesia.
Yes,

1908
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,503
because those people did eat those dead 
people because those people did figure 

1909
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:22,094
out a way to somehow or another get 
enough nutrients from whatever the fuck 

1910
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:27,770
they ate to compensate for the fact they
were involved in nuclear winter.

1911
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:29,780
That's not man.
Yeah,

1912
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,000
it's crazy.
And it's,

1913
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,553
but it makes you realize,
which is we the people that are 

1914
01:27:37,011 --> 01:27:39,020
listening to this,
the people that are alive today,

1915
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,190
we're not going to make it.

1916
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:41,493
It's just we are not going to make it 
like everyone's so hopeful that the 

1917
01:27:44,091 --> 01:27:44,924
human race is gonna make it.
And that's one of the reasons why we 

1918
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:49,850
have offspring and loved ones and 
friends.

1919
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:52,190
And even if I'm gone,
I want everyone else to be happy.

1920
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,720
You know,
I had a great time while I'm here.

1921
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:56,000
Don't cry for me,
but no one's making it.

1922
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,760
They're not going to make it either.
You're just prolonging their life.

1923
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,570
Like everyone's life is going to come to
a wall.

1924
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:06,920
Everyone loud the game works.
But we're cool with that.

1925
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,260
We're cool with grandma dying.
Grandma died,

1926
01:28:09,261 --> 01:28:10,094
but she was 97 years old when she died.
She was a wonderful woman and she was 

1927
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:15,020
loved by many.
Everybody's cool with that.

1928
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,213
You know,
we're not cool with everybody dying all 

1929
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:18,860
at once.
Yeah.

1930
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,780
That's,
this is the end of the experiment.

1931
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:23,150
This is the end of the process.
Fuck no,

1932
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:25,840
it's not the end.
It's just we're going to,

1933
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:28,310
everyone's going to die and then we're 
going to restart with monkeys.

1934
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,410
It's going to take another few million 
years,

1935
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:31,940
but the chimps would eventually become 
people.

1936
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:32,840
Again,
it's a,

1937
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:33,674
it's kind of what I am saying is that if
anybody's going to survive is going to 

1938
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:37,154
be the people are leaving close to 
hunting and gathering conditions today 

1939
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:43,190
that are seen as you know,
the most backward people in the ward are

1940
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:44,024
the ones who actually have a shelter 
that making 18 a short apocalyptic 

1941
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,720
situation.
Yeah.

1942
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:49,310
Like people in the Amazon or something 
like that.

1943
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,510
They're,
they're probably the only ones that have

1944
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:51,344
a chance.
Yup.

1945
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,313
What's up mad at Jamie?
Do you see this going around the story 

1946
01:28:53,781 --> 01:28:56,060
about this new company that can upload 
your brain,

1947
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:56,894
but it kills you?
What a startup is pitching a mind 

1948
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:04,050
uploading service that is 100% fatal.

1949
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:06,023
I think they're taking like people that 
are already terminal patients and 

1950
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:10,020
whatnot.
That's their first sort of,

1951
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,520
and they to upload their mind.
Yeah.

1952
01:29:11,521 --> 01:29:12,261
I don't know.
I didn't,

1953
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:17,070
they're going to give you some bullshit 
scrambled version of what your,

1954
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:22,080
it's going to be all swa stickers like,
like we found grandpa's brain and a,

1955
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,360
we're going to upload it now and you'll 
be able to look into his thoughts out.

1956
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,390
It's all dicks.
GRANDPA's,

1957
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:32,391
all Dixon and Nazi memorabilia.
Preserve your brain uploaded company.

1958
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:37,140
It's chemical solution can keep a body 
intact for hundreds of years,

1959
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:40,830
maybe thousands as a statue of frozen 
glass.

1960
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:45,890
What the idea is that some day in the 
future scientists will scan your bricked

1961
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,413
brain and turn it into a computer 
simulation so they didn't even know how 

1962
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:51,834
to do it yet.
This is bullshit that way someone liked 

1963
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,940
a lot like you though.

1964
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:57,773
Not Exactly.
You will smell the flowers again in a 

1965
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,450
data server somewhere.
What?

1966
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,800
What?
Okay.

1967
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
The stories that grizzly twist though 
for NEC tomes procedure to work,

1968
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:12,773
it's essential that the brain be fresh.
The company says its plan is to connect 

1969
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:21,561
people with terminal illnesses to a 
heart lung machine in order to pump it's

1970
01:30:21,571 --> 01:30:22,404
mix of scientific and bombing chemicals 
into the big cardioid arteries in their 

1971
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:30,180
next,
well,

1972
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:32,820
they'll still alive though under general
anesthesia.

1973
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:34,770
Thank God you put them under before you 
kill him.

1974
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:35,843
Cause we will want them to experience 
any pain for they go into the great 

1975
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:42,450
frozen glass statue beyond,
there's a waiting list,

1976
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,120
of course is a waiting list.
A bunch of fucking idiots.

1977
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,580
Jesus Christ.
People are stupid.

1978
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:49,210
Uh,
there's uh,

1979
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,333
you know,
hundreds of thousands of people signed 

1980
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:53,370
up to die on Mars.
Do you know that?

1981
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:56,670
To have the opportunity to be one of the
first people to die on Mars,

1982
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,500
hundreds of thousands of people signed 
up.

1983
01:30:58,530 --> 01:30:59,363
Yeah.
You don't want to be the first to be 

1984
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,420
locked in a space ship for six months 
with a bunch of other people.

1985
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:06,060
So fucking stupid.
They're willing to die on Mars.

1986
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,830
Yeah.
Then you get there.

1987
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,170
They're just talking about social 
justice the entire way,

1988
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,820
all,
all the way over there.

1989
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:14,520
Talking about veganism and social 
justice and,

1990
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,950
oh man.
Yeah.

1991
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:21,900
Elon Musk on first Mars explorer as good
chance you'll die or chance.

1992
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,090
How about a hundred percent you're going
to die with you.

1993
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:25,780
Stay here,
stay here.

1994
01:31:25,781 --> 01:31:27,310
I get good chance you'll die.
Your die.

1995
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,580
Everyone's dying.
You're going to die.

1996
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:30,653
That's the fucked up thing.
We just don't want everybody to die all 

1997
01:31:32,401 --> 01:31:35,550
at once.
We're cool with small groups.

1998
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:39,240
People that are brown that die in caves 
on the other part of the world.

1999
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,860
If we could be convinced they're 
primitive,

2000
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:44,150
they hold these ridiculous beliefs and 
a,

2001
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,090
we don't even know them.

2002
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,013
Right,
so we're just going to kill them with 

2003
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:47,550
robots.
Yeah.

2004
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,130
It's somebody out there.
Oh cares.

2005
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,410
It's not us.
Yeah.

2006
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,820
I think just the rate of change is 
happening so fast.

2007
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:55,440
It's going to be a lot of dumb shit like
this.

2008
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,360
It happens along the way.
Of course,

2009
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:58,194
like the bell bottoms of technology.
It's like what is the thought fuck were 

2010
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:03,090
they thinking and it's just going to 
keep,

2011
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,780
keep happening like that.
It's,

2012
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:07,180
I mean you think about even most of the 
stuff that we do today,

2013
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:09,940
like which foods are okay to eat and 
which one's not?

2014
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,940
How many people like to go,
oh look at that.

2015
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,120
Greg is gone.
He had the wrong plants,

2016
01:32:15,121 --> 01:32:17,680
so let's make an older,
we do not eat that plant.

2017
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,670
Yeah,
we share.

2018
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:20,470
That's all greg eight.
Yeah,

2019
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:22,420
exactly.
It's like they should still eat it.

2020
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:25,000
Let's try one more time.
Get my to eat it.

2021
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:27,070
Yeah.
He's got an iron stomach.

2022
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:29,770
The duties,
old carcasses and shit.

2023
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,513
They had to like express it somehow or 
another in a way that everybody would 

2024
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:38,980
remember it too.
Probably in songs and shit.

2025
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,910
Yep.
Yeah,

2026
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:41,310
cause exactly.
That's the other thing I would do.

2027
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:45,070
You pass information in a society that's
not liter at and yet people did it.

2028
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:45,904
I mean,
when you think about things like the 

2029
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:47,404
[inaudible] or the all they say they 
don't know these long gas compositions 

2030
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:53,500
completely passed down orally,
you know,

2031
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:54,490
without,
you know,

2032
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:57,280
by the time they wrote down was saying 
to this down the road.

2033
01:32:57,281 --> 01:32:58,114
It's like that's some protein,
same thing that humans were able to do 

2034
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:03,800
in like memorize all this stuff.
Yeah.

2035
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:04,810
Really it's saying,
you know,

2036
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:05,644
I was thinking the other day about songs
like how crazy the technology of 

2037
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:13,510
remembering things through songs are.
Cause if like he didn't go all the songs

2038
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:15,040
you could sing along to the words.

2039
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,650
Now think of how many poems that you can
recite.

2040
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,770
It's like very few or stories that you 
can,

2041
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,260
what poems?
Maybe because they rhyme,

2042
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,800
but reciting a story verbatim.
Almost none.

2043
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,740
Very few.
But like we were a,

2044
01:33:29,741 --> 01:33:31,480
at the common story the other day,
we were talking about,

2045
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:32,314
um,
um,

2046
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,780
grammar and sentence structure and stuff
like that.

2047
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:36,820
And uh,
I brought up those,

2048
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:37,654
uh,
ABC afterschool things like conjunction 

2049
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:40,984
junction.
What's your function hook and up words 

2050
01:33:44,771 --> 01:33:47,140
and phrases and clauses.
Like,

2051
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,000
you know what it is like,
you know,

2052
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:49,834
I'm just a bill sitting here on Capitol 
Hill and like they explain these things 

2053
01:33:54,601 --> 01:33:57,840
in a way that you could remember fucking
decades later.

2054
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,713
You would never remember.
You would never remember if it wasn't 

2055
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:02,314
for those things.
There was a guy named Ariosa was like 

2056
01:34:05,471 --> 01:34:06,400
one of these,
uh,

2057
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,683
like back when they had the council of 
nicea and they kind of decided what is 

2058
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,980
real Christianity going to be a while we
decided to be the fake stuff.

2059
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,433
Ariosa was on the losing side,
but part of the theme that meeting 

2060
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:21,970
seemingly popular is that he put on all 
this theology and songs.

2061
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:22,863
Exactly like what you're saying.
It would be super complicated thing 

2062
01:34:26,181 --> 01:34:27,014
about,
you know,

2063
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:31,410
Jesus bees kind of like God the father 
but not really and Dah,

2064
01:34:31,411 --> 01:34:32,244
Dah,
Dah,

2065
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,213
really brainy stuff.
Puto like a silly song that the guy 

2066
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:38,950
would sing while he's baking bread and 
stuff.

2067
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,833
And so he was closely Paul polar because
he figured that's how people pick up 

2068
01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:45,130
stuff.
It is up.

2069
01:34:45,131 --> 01:34:47,200
People pick up stuff,
you know what I mean?

2070
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:48,760
To this day,
right.

2071
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:52,540
Like pronouns.
I think that that song pronouns take the

2072
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:53,374
place of a noun cause saying all those 
nouns over and over can really wear you 

2073
01:34:56,711 --> 01:34:57,980
down.
They need a

2074
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,280
missed too many days.
That's cool.

2075
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:03,140
Good job that,
that stuff for whatever reason sticks of

2076
01:35:03,141 --> 01:35:03,974
course.
I wonder why like making things rhyme 

2077
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:07,383
and and putting them in song has a 
particular profound effect on your 

2078
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:12,120
memory.
Yeah,

2079
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:14,030
it is funny cause even when you look at 
babies,

2080
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:14,864
you know they respond to music so much.
They have that immediate like Sam 

2081
01:35:18,401 --> 01:35:19,234
sounds,
that clique with the developing mind 

2082
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:22,940
have a baby.
You don't need to have culture.

2083
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:26,240
You don't need to have knowledge.
You don't need to have as baby.

2084
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:28,340
You can still pick up seeing and 
remembered.

2085
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:29,174
I mean yeah or sometime you know,
somebody put some music and one note to 

2086
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,030
goes into babies immediately recognize 
it.

2087
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:37,370
Just like I know what this is is that's 
the one I enjoy.

2088
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,670
And as you do it the other day,
by the way is fucking hilarious.

2089
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:41,630
Was in the,
in Italy,

2090
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:42,464
it is a,
he's this little kid is probably two or 

2091
01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:44,744
three are sold and the dad keeps trying 
to play like children song and the 

2092
01:35:48,111 --> 01:35:50,360
baby's pissed off and he's like no,
no,

2093
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,223
no.
And he's like what do you all and thank 

2094
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:54,500
you say something and the dad is like 
okay fine,

2095
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:55,334
we'll do this again.
And whole Lotta love by led Zeppelin 

2096
01:35:58,431 --> 01:36:01,250
started the baby just lights up is so 
happy.

2097
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:04,520
He's like yes.
So we are talking about,

2098
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,320
it would be amazing if that kid grows up
to be like a big rock star.

2099
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,690
Right?
Imagine you know what I mean?

2100
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:12,650
The whole lot of love and he's a baby 
palm,

2101
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,570
a bound bound back,
CSAC.

2102
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:17,423
I don't know.
That's to me is like I kind of did that 

2103
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:22,544
a lot with my daughter cause I'm like I 
hate to do this to you but you are my 

2104
01:36:24,831 --> 01:36:26,510
daughter and I want to listen to good 
shape.

2105
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:29,120
I don't want to listen to stupid baby 
stuff all the time.

2106
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:32,020
So it's like even to this day,
like she goes to bad,

2107
01:36:32,021 --> 01:36:32,854
we tend the exit like there's,
then drake says a Lula by of course the 

2108
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:37,820
mellow and rex was the hardcore stuff is
for the day,

2109
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:40,460
but like at night when she want to go to
sleep,

2110
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:41,294
I'll put on like the more metal or 
seeing like when Andrew is playing 

2111
01:36:43,911 --> 01:36:44,744
acoustic guitar or like [inaudible] or 
something like that that I like that I 

2112
01:36:47,901 --> 01:36:48,734
can tolerate.
Don't give me any baby shit stuff cause 

2113
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:52,790
I just,
I mean right now she's not a baby,

2114
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:56,270
but even when she was little I'm like,
sorry I can't do that like it though.

2115
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:57,103
The thing about baby stuff is like 
babies like baby stuff or even little 

2116
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:01,760
kids,
like little kid stuff.

2117
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:04,490
Like my kids,
like a lot of really fucking dumb shows,

2118
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:07,610
but they love them.
It's like what can you do?

2119
01:37:07,611 --> 01:37:08,444
Can you say no,
you can't love that because it's too 

2120
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:12,470
fucking stupid,
but it's not stupid to them.

2121
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,320
I can tolerate it.
If we balance it with something else,

2122
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:16,154
I'm like,
okay,

2123
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:17,420
that's fine.
I get it.

2124
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:19,970
It's part of your developmental stage.
Good for you,

2125
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:22,520
but give me something here.
Okay,

2126
01:37:22,521 --> 01:37:23,001
let,
let,

2127
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:23,834
let's find a middle ground here.
Or we can listen to the same music or 

2128
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:27,014
watch something like,
and that's where I recognize I may have 

2129
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:30,344
done irreparable damage to my offspring 
because I realized the other day we 

2130
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:35,144
watch a movie and my daughters come and 
to basically say this is the coolest 

2131
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:42,000
thing ever was like it says good as 
Conan the barbarian.

2132
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:43,580
That I was like,
yes,

2133
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,140
I'm glad you were my daughter.
Was she talking about the books?

2134
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:48,770
I was just talking about the movie 
though.

2135
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,640
Hold off.
And she like,

2136
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:50,960
she loves the,
you know,

2137
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:55,250
the one corner and that was [inaudible] 
now the 1982 one of course.

2138
01:37:55,251 --> 01:37:59,170
See I read their old,
the t our stories and wow.

2139
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,053
You know,
I changed the language slightly cause 

2140
01:38:01,011 --> 01:38:01,844
sometime in the language is a little 
like you need to really have a crazy 

2141
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:06,540
vocabulary for an eight year olds.
You're not going to pick it up.

2142
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:08,400
So I kind of tweak it a lethal,
but then,

2143
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:10,590
you know,
all the good stuff is there and uh,

2144
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,270
I feel like the best Conan could have 
been Jason Momoa.

2145
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:18,650
They just gave him a shit movie.
The script was like,

2146
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,970
my mind is so good.
He's very good.

2147
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:24,060
He looks like a fucking barbarian,
like you believe it.

2148
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:24,913
Perfect big giant guy.
And he's also not built like a 

2149
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:28,563
bodybuilder.
He's just built like a guy who was in 

2150
01:38:29,911 --> 01:38:30,744
really good shape,
which you would think Conan would be 

2151
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:33,180
there he is.
Right.

2152
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:38,490
I think he was the best Konan he's 
seemed to me to be the most realistic.

2153
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,470
Maybe could he use a little bit more gym
time,

2154
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,800
but not nothing crazy.
But the problem you had this crepes,

2155
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:44,693
that's something that's anti frustrates 
me when you see like all the elements 

2156
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:50,410
are there and the screenwriting socks 
says like,

2157
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,640
come on man.
Sucks.

2158
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,150
Just straight dog shit.
But he was fucking great as Conan.

2159
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,380
Like you believed it.
Yup.

2160
01:38:58,090 --> 01:39:00,570
No,
he just looked evil enough and it looked

2161
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:05,571
like a guy who really was a sword 
fighter who really did live in that era.

2162
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:10,650
Whereas Conan played by Arnold 
Schwarzenegger.

2163
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:11,370
You're like,
wait a minute,

2164
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:12,960
what's the guy's got no armpit hair.

2165
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:18,360
It's completely shaved down.
Built like a brick shit.

2166
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:19,051
I was like,
it just,

2167
01:39:19,051 --> 01:39:20,970
it was freakishly big.
Yeah.

2168
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,330
That's actually a picture.
He looks fairly reasonable there.

2169
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:26,420
All right.
Go to layer to think about new,

2170
01:39:26,421 --> 01:39:27,254
it's actually quite a bit leaner and 
those days that he was in his 

2171
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:30,510
bodybuilder day.
Yeah.

2172
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,020
Yeah.
That one was just all so,

2173
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,830
but he was still,
there's definitely to do,

2174
01:39:34,831 --> 01:39:35,664
it had been doing some bench pressing.
It wasn't someone just swine club bells 

2175
01:39:39,061 --> 01:39:39,894
around and I mean he didn't get those 
muscles just by pushing the wheel of 

2176
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,070
pain.
That was part of it too.

2177
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:45,420
Right.
There's definitely that.

2178
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:47,340
A little bit of that too.
Oh Man.

2179
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:48,470
On that note,
I've been,

2180
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:49,304
um,
the last couple of years I've been 

2181
01:39:50,701 --> 01:39:53,670
playing a lot in that world with 
screenwriting and stuff.

2182
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,030
I'm so excited with that.
I'm just getting,

2183
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:56,893
cause you know the thing that I enjoy 
like in [inaudible] on fire and stuff 

2184
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,604
like that at historic tiling and I 
realize I ended up doing that in 

2185
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,530
whatever field I'm,
you know,

2186
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,060
whether when I'm teaching,
most of it is storytelling.

2187
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,430
When um,
history on fire is storytelling.

2188
01:40:08,431 --> 01:40:12,210
And so I started playing a little,
it's getting writings because I had good

2189
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,250
hookups man.
I'm having so much fun.

2190
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:18,150
It's like when you're writing,
well there's the stuff that looks,

2191
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:19,523
there are a few,
like they are all mostly historical 

2192
01:40:21,211 --> 01:40:25,760
fiction kind of stories and one of them 
right now look really damn promising but

2193
01:40:25,761 --> 01:40:26,594
they have threatened me to chop off my 
bowls and nailed them two or three if I 

2194
01:40:29,971 --> 01:40:30,804
talk about it so I can really bring it 
up because that one actually has a shot 

2195
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:36,720
at making it a okay.
There are others seeing swear.

2196
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:40,620
I'm much more kind of early development.
Like for example,

2197
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:43,190
Oh I saw you got outside the Frank 
Frazetta painting.

2198
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,053
Yeah.
So Satta the granddaughter of Frank 

2199
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,483
Wants to develop one of the,
one of the characters that are 

2200
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,530
[inaudible] girls.
She's the one who does it all right,

2201
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,753
Shannon.

2202
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,570
Yeah,
she's awesome.

2203
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:57,240
She's super sweet.
And,

2204
01:40:57,470 --> 01:40:59,110
and I,
and she started asking,

2205
01:40:59,111 --> 01:40:59,944
you know,
I showed them some of my writing were 

2206
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:01,810
chatting.
She liked it.

2207
01:41:01,811 --> 01:41:05,050
And so she wanted me to develop like one
of those characters are seen to,

2208
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:06,940
uh,
create a ward around it,

2209
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:08,400
like a game of thrones,
meat,

2210
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:09,910
corn and kind of thing.
And I'm like,

2211
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,073
that's what you're asking of you to do 
or you see that's like the dream job 

2212
01:41:13,151 --> 01:41:14,890
ever.
It's like hell yeah,

2213
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:16,990
I want to play with that.
That sounded like fun.

2214
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:17,873
It will be epic.
So I think those movies and those shows 

2215
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:23,920
when done correctly,
when executed correctly,

2216
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:27,130
are some of the most entertaining 
compelling things,

2217
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:31,150
whether it's game of thrones or Lord of 
the rings or this is the Conan ones were

2218
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:34,180
just an arnold did a great job and those
are fun.

2219
01:41:34,181 --> 01:41:35,040
But they're campy.

2220
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:35,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

2221
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:38,230
I mean the first one was good.
The other ones were painful.

2222
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:41,620
They were reading.
I represent Robert Howard's don't work.

2223
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:44,080
Don't already,
Howard's work is still to this day.

2224
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:46,480
Never really,
totally been captured.

2225
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:47,503
Yeah.
I yard at Amazon is going to be doing a 

2226
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:52,570
corner and see it is,
I don't know.

2227
01:41:52,571 --> 01:41:53,440
They're not going to fuck.
I don't know.

2228
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:54,970
Maybe they are,
if they're doing it,

2229
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:56,440
who's going to play Kona?
And I have no idea.

2230
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:59,160
I don't think they peaked dts cause I do
would have announced it.

2231
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:00,860
I think they were just saying it seemed 
available.

2232
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:04,420
Mains they are gonna try to stick to a 
rubber t our stories.

2233
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,710
So who knows.
Let's see.

2234
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:09,370
But we got the shackles.
They could pull out the big money.

2235
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:10,204
Get Jason Mamoa to get back in the hunt.
I know that he's the Kona and I think 

2236
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:15,970
you made the guy,
he's like six foot three.

2237
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,500
He's built like a brick shit house.
Yeah,

2238
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:21,010
he looks like he would be a barbarian.
Like you looks perfect.

2239
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:23,260
Like when he paid call drago that was 
perfect.

2240
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,080
He was perfect.
Yeah.

2241
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:27,700
You buy it.
You see him playing that role.

2242
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:28,780
You're like,
oh I buy that.

2243
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,303
He's a savage.
He would be awesome if they did that 

2244
01:42:32,741 --> 01:42:33,670
man.
That would be epic.

2245
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:34,623
Yeah.
There's a a day or doing a bunch of 

2246
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:36,910
stuff there.
Do we and dad,

2247
01:42:36,911 --> 01:42:40,390
they are doing it but equal to Lord of 
the rings on Amazon's.

2248
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:41,224
Yeah.
Jesus Christ that Jeff Bezos guys got a 

2249
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:44,890
little too much cash.
Hey,

2250
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:47,260
I'm old for it.
Like do one more.

2251
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:48,730
Yeah.
Do it all.

2252
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:49,873
Look,
I mean it's just,

2253
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:50,853
I mean he,
they have that really good billy Bob 

2254
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:54,520
Thornton show too that people see me 
about.

2255
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,950
I haven't seen it either,
but people,

2256
01:42:56,951 --> 01:42:57,784
what is it called again?

2257
01:42:57,790 --> 01:43:02,230
That billy Bob Thornton show on Amazon?
Uh,

2258
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,193
Jamie,
you'll find it.

2259
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,210
Sure.
I don't,

2260
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:07,080
I don't know what it's called,
but I know that people keep raving about

2261
01:43:07,081 --> 01:43:08,450
it.
Aliah Goliath.

2262
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,820
Thank you.
Yeah.

2263
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,740
It's supposed to be really good.
Yeah.

2264
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:15,520
And you know the problem with those,
here's what's weird.

2265
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:18,970
More than half the households in this 
country have Amazon.

2266
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:21,240
I think Amazon prime.
Yup.

2267
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:23,380
Like right.
It's like 51% of the households.

2268
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,370
But how many people are actually 
watching those Amazon videos?

2269
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:28,563
That's a good question.
I think once they start booking these 

2270
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:33,610
kind of money on some of these big 
shows,

2271
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:35,640
the odds that that percentage is going 
to grow,

2272
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,810
it's pretty damn high.
Let's find out this,

2273
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,700
I don't know if Amazon releases their 
numbers.

2274
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,310
They don't do they do it?
Probably not.

2275
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,080
But did they do it the same way?
You don't know.

2276
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:45,610
Um,
Google,

2277
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,020
uh,
see if,

2278
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:50,440
what,
how many people watch Goliath on Amazon?

2279
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,883
Maybe we'll find out because date no one
has any idea how many people are 

2280
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:57,950
watching things on netflix other than 
Netflix and Netflix.

2281
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,023
They just,
they don't tell anybody nothing and 

2282
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:06,230
clearly must be a good number because 
they keep producing shows booked of mine

2283
01:44:06,231 --> 01:44:08,450
in it.
So you know that it's working for them.

2284
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,373
Well,
what they do know is how many people 

2285
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:14,450
have subscribed to Netflix and that's an
insane,

2286
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,373
huge number.
But the actual number of people that 

2287
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:18,710
watch every,
they don't tell you shit.

2288
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:21,020
Like,
I have a comedy special on Netflix.

2289
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:23,210
They don't tell you nothing.
They go,

2290
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:24,770
great job.
We like it.

2291
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,260
You have no idea.
Like you like it.

2292
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,010
Why?
Oh,

2293
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:29,390
it's great.
People love it.

2294
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,860
Okay,
well how many people love it?

2295
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,760
Oh,
lots.

2296
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,020
No fucking,
they don't give you any data,

2297
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:39,680
which they don't have to.
And maybe that's good.

2298
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:42,160
Maybe people concentrate too much on the
numbers.

2299
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,033
You know what I mean?
Like someone was saying that the Oscars 

2300
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:45,960
this year,
uh,

2301
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,260
the Oscars this year are down by you 
know,

2302
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:49,094
5 million people.
They still got washed by 25 million 

2303
01:44:51,381 --> 01:44:52,490
people.
Cause I'm like,

2304
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:54,110
what?
What do we do in here?

2305
01:44:54,111 --> 01:44:55,700
Like who cares?
Why is that even a thing?

2306
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,770
Because that's why we've been 
concentrating on that.

2307
01:44:57,771 --> 01:44:58,604
I can't find the viewers but they,
this is the kind of information they 

2308
01:45:00,171 --> 01:45:01,004
give out is the top Bin,
first season of a US produce Amazon 

2309
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:07,580
original series ever over its first 10 
days.

2310
01:45:07,581 --> 01:45:08,720
That doesn't mean shit.
Yeah.

2311
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,793
No other season,
no other season one had a higher season 

2312
01:45:13,131 --> 01:45:16,220
completion rate through 10 days.
Well that's interesting.

2313
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:20,030
That must mean it's a really good show.
So people binged it the first season.

2314
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:25,160
Can you get Amazon prime on a I on apple
TV,

2315
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,160
the other part of Apple TV because I'm 
always,

2316
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,470
or do you have to get one of those fire 
sticks?

2317
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,880
I can watch it through my teeth.
My TV has a thing,

2318
01:45:34,881 --> 01:45:37,460
has a smart tv app on it that I can get 
it through there.

2319
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:40,580
And it says it arrived on Apple TV in 
over a hundred countries as of December.

2320
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:43,010
So yeah.
Oh so last December.

2321
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,140
December of 2017 yes.
Okay.

2322
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:47,090
So we have it now.
Hmm.

2323
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,870
But still netflix is just so much more 
popular.

2324
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:55,370
It's like cue tips once it like becomes 
the name.

2325
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,170
Like give me a box.
Q tips.

2326
01:45:57,171 --> 01:45:58,340
Do you want cotton swabs?
No,

2327
01:45:58,341 --> 01:45:59,660
motherfucker.
I said q tip.

2328
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:01,693
You know,
it's like,

2329
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:03,560
dude,
do you want to watch streaming video and

2330
01:46:03,561 --> 01:46:06,650
want to watch Netflix?
We have Amazon streaming video,

2331
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:09,650
bitch net flicks.
Did I stutter?

2332
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,810
Netflix only took over that recently.
Right?

2333
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:12,644
Because give me a fucking iphone.
It used to be their bullshit fake 

2334
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:20,840
smartphone nonsense.
Ivivva yeah,

2335
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,920
it's pretty recent.
Yeah,

2336
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:22,910
just mailed before.

2337
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:24,920
Like they took over blockbuster first 
and then they're like,

2338
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,540
and now it's all streaming.
Yeah.

2339
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:30,200
You can still get dvds I think,
but I don't know how many I do cause I'm

2340
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:32,300
a nerd.
You get dvds still.

2341
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:33,463
Really?
Cause they don't have the same 

2342
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:34,814
offerings.
Their staff that they do have on DVD 

2343
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,200
that they don't have on streaming and 
vice versa.

2344
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,310
So like for example,
what was I watching?

2345
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,500
It was,
um,

2346
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:45,440
I think at the last season of Vikings 
for example,

2347
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,274
I think that's why I fine.
I've been watching it now I'm season 

2348
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:50,730
two.
It's good.

2349
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,720
That's the good,
you know,

2350
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:55,200
it kind of don't tell me that.
Don't tell me it goes down hill.

2351
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:57,210
I'll fucking go crazy.
There's two seasons are awesome,

2352
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:01,050
son of a [inaudible] game of thrones 
that way through Netflix for instance.

2353
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:02,660
Yeah,
yeah,

2354
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,513
yeah.
You can rent the dvds of game of 

2355
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:05,520
thrones,
exact shit,

2356
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,653
punch it through their streaming app,
but you could only get game of thrones 

2357
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:10,710
dvds.

2358
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,250
Yup.
Yeah.

2359
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,600
But you're paying the next year,
like what,

2360
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:14,810
10 bucks a month to rent those and send 
it.

2361
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,500
That's how they used,
that's what Netflix was when it started,

2362
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,191
you know,
one,

2363
01:47:17,191 --> 01:47:18,670
two,
three dvds a month or whenever.

2364
01:47:18,671 --> 01:47:19,411
We're at a time.
Weird.

2365
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:20,244
So netflix dvds has game of thrones.
Netflix streaming does not exactly 

2366
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,820
everything for any DVD you can get.
Yeah,

2367
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,910
that's weird.
They had a lot more on dvds.

2368
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:33,690
Then they have just streaming there a 
bunch of stuff that I want to watch like

2369
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,420
case in point you have game of thrones 
and Viking.

2370
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:37,254
Some of that stuff is uh,
I used to freak out and not having a 

2371
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:43,320
physical DVD player in my laptop.
Like this is ridiculous.

2372
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:45,420
So I bought one of those ones that plugs
in.

2373
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,100
Yeah,
I've never used it once.

2374
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,910
Sat there is by are just in watching 
Orleans stream,

2375
01:47:49,911 --> 01:47:50,744
you know,
download them from itunes and then they 

2376
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:53,850
sit on my laptop.

2377
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,520
I don't,
yeah,

2378
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,753
it's,
this is all so new but yet we're so 

2379
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:03,840
convinced that this is what this is the 
future,

2380
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:04,590
right?
This is it.

2381
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:07,230
Netflix period.
Everybody else fuck off.

2382
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,160
It's locked in.
I think they're doing comedy specials on

2383
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:12,560
Amazon as well.
Yeah,

2384
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,673
I'm pretty sure Amazon prime did Bob 
Saget new special and a few other 

2385
01:48:18,271 --> 01:48:19,104
people.
Then that's one of the cool things 

2386
01:48:20,491 --> 01:48:22,720
because Amazon is trying to compete with
Netflix,

2387
01:48:22,721 --> 01:48:25,440
so they are trying to come up.
So they're going to put an insane amount

2388
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:26,274
of money and show his,
and he's got eight for content because 

2389
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:30,234
there's today there's probably more 
possibilities for people doing stuff 

2390
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:34,944
that never before there where before you
had only so many studios producing only 

2391
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,110
so many movies.
Now there's so much more.

2392
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,390
Brian counts on there.
Joey Diaz is on there.

2393
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:45,330
Brian's on Netflix.
Jim burrs on Netflix.

2394
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,780
Um,
who else?

2395
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,300
Tom Papa.
I'm Securitas old one.

2396
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,830
Yeah,
Eddie pepitone.

2397
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:54,780
Oh Wow.
Greg Fitzsimmons.

2398
01:48:54,781 --> 01:48:59,190
So there's quite a few specials that are
available on Amazon.

2399
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:01,650
Jim Norton.
Very interesting.

2400
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:04,200
That might be where the,
what was that one that just closed that?

2401
01:49:04,201 --> 01:49:05,920
Um,
yeah,

2402
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,750
CSO.
Yeah.

2403
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,430
Maybe they just,
they have a lot of them on there now.

2404
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:11,250
Yeah,
I bet that's exactly what it is.

2405
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:14,190
Yeah.
Interesting.

2406
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,040
It says continue watching or watching 
the beginning.

2407
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:21,380
That means that Jamie Vernon was 
watching it.

2408
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:24,990
Interesting.
Yeah.

2409
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,340
Um,
I hope it works.

2410
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,260
I mean,
I would love to see a bunch of different

2411
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:33,180
viable outlets for people to release 
films and TV shows and stuff like that.

2412
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:36,720
And God knows Netflix has enough money.
I know they,

2413
01:49:36,721 --> 01:49:38,130
any sodas,
the Amazon,

2414
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:40,800
they have ton of fucking money.
Yeah.

2415
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:42,150
Yeah.
Apple's not doing that though.

2416
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:42,984
They're going to try to do that.
Create original stuff that they have 

2417
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:47,800
that one,
a Jennifer Aniston and reese show that's

2418
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:48,634
coming out soon.

2419
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,033
Look at me.
Look at me.

2420
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:54,820
I had a game show or not game show,
but planet of the apps with like,

2421
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:58,360
when is pouch row will I am Gary Vee was
on that trying to get me throw up,

2422
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:00,130
not Gary V.
I mean,

2423
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:01,780
they haven't all necessarily been 
successful,

2424
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:04,000
but they're trying,
I'm just kidding about throwing out.

2425
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,180
If you're a gallon year to those ladies,
just don't listen to me.

2426
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:08,410
I'm just fucking,
just make it fun.

2427
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,360
Yeah,
I think it's good.

2428
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:11,620
I mean,
I would like to see more.

2429
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:12,983
Um,
I just think in terms of like your 

2430
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:18,040
ability to sit down and do absolutely 
fucking nothing and zone out for days,

2431
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:19,203
there's never been a better time 
[inaudible] there's so much stuff 

2432
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:21,964
available.
Apple is reportedly investing 1 billion 

2433
01:50:24,731 --> 01:50:27,460
in original video content.
Wow.

2434
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:29,010
Jesus Christ.
Okay,

2435
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:29,853
so appellees add that to the mix and 
that's Gary v with a big old smile on 

2436
01:50:33,221 --> 01:50:33,680
his face.

2437
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,890
How does that Guy Sleep?
Talk does,

2438
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:37,173
how's he?
Where's he,

2439
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:40,630
where's he at the time I'm pretty busy 
but that's what that guy,

2440
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,733
exactly what people ask about you is 
like how does he manage to to like 72 

2441
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:49,300
carriers in one and an old hunting and 
workout and duties and that is like,

2442
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:50,163
oh I don't know.
I think human cloning or like really 

2443
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:52,653
three Joe Rogan's going around that 
there are like you have downloaded your 

2444
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:58,940
consciousness in three d for baldies 
were doing some of this stuff.

2445
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:02,230
One of them would fuck up hardcore if I 
did that.

2446
01:51:02,231 --> 01:51:03,064
Like it's,
it's hard enough to manage my insanity 

2447
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:07,150
with one life,
five,

2448
01:51:07,151 --> 01:51:07,984
three lives going on.
One of them are definitely go off the 

2449
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:13,490
rails with I think is what I do is it's 
more of a,

2450
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:17,440
it's an illusion that I'm as busy as 
people think I am.

2451
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:20,530
It's not as busy.
It is busy,

2452
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:26,160
but it's less busy with work than people
think because the podcast is,

2453
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,113
you know,
sitting here with a friend like you and 

2454
01:51:29,771 --> 01:51:31,810
talk for a few hours,
it's pretty easy.

2455
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,780
That's not really that hard.
And then the working out,

2456
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:35,614
well that's just mandatory.
Just have to go around and then there's 

2457
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:38,853
the standup comedy.
Well that's kind of a passion project 

2458
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:44,020
and it's interesting and I do it all the
right.

2459
01:51:44,021 --> 01:51:46,540
Like I know avid timed down like,
oh hang out with my family,

2460
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:47,620
tell my kids,
go to bed,

2461
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:49,120
which is usually like,
you know,

2462
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:51,060
eight ish and that's when I leave.
Right.

2463
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:51,903
Then I go to the comedy store.
Like I know I've have it pretty much 

2464
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:55,414
locked in.
I get my podcast done before the kids 

2465
01:51:57,641 --> 01:52:00,250
get home from school,
so I'm hanging out with them.

2466
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,110
I know how to do it.

2467
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:05,230
I'm working out while they're at school 
for the most part.

2468
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:08,130
But it impressive though because that 
means you have cause you every,

2469
01:52:08,131 --> 01:52:08,964
at least until you do have so much stuff
on your plate and the way you make it 

2470
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:12,844
flow.
There's that something in terms of time 

2471
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:16,174
management,
I think there will be people willing to 

2472
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:18,124
take courses from you on how to put it 
all together because that's a skill 

2473
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:21,334
right there.
You have to be really steadfast in what 

2474
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:26,590
you want to do and what you don't want 
to do.

2475
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:29,110
And when you don't want to do something,
just don't do it right.

2476
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:30,063
But that,
I wasn't able to do this until I really 

2477
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:32,164
started working for myself,
like working for myself and the ability 

2478
01:52:35,261 --> 01:52:36,094
to wait.
If you have a bunch of different jobs 

2479
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:40,120
but you're beholden to other people's 
schedules,

2480
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:41,240
it's almost on manager.
Yeah.

2481
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,480
It's up and you can't do it.
But,

2482
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:44,314
uh,
that's why I would assume I'm trying to 

2483
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,770
do,
I'm trying to,

2484
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,130
as much

2485
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,963
as I enjoy being in the classroom,
I'm trying to be in the classroom with 

2486
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:49,624
less and less,
just do more online and do more Paul 

2487
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,520
customer because I'm tired of being in 
somebody else's,

2488
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:57,140
you know?
Imagine if you like driving.

2489
01:52:57,141 --> 01:52:59,780
It's like I don't mind if you put me in 
the classroom and that's great,

2490
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:00,614
but if I have to drive an hour and a 
half to get there and then be stuck in 

2491
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,190
traffic,
it's like fuck this.

2492
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:07,130
This is just not fun.
Do you feel like there's opportunities,

2493
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:10,970
like real viable opportunities for 
people now to get an education online?

2494
01:53:11,530 --> 01:53:14,300
Legitimate full education?
It's definitely a merchant.

2495
01:53:14,301 --> 01:53:18,830
I mean I think it's a part of the 
problem is that the universities kind of

2496
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:19,664
have a monopoly on the diplomas,
which is something that people need for 

2497
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:25,700
their job is not the day choose who I 
want to be educated.

2498
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:26,563
There are ways to do it is also they 
need that piece of paper and of course 

2499
01:53:29,631 --> 01:53:32,120
so far only the official universities 
have that.

2500
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:33,500
But otherwise,
yeah,

2501
01:53:33,501 --> 01:53:35,090
there are a bunch of ways.
There's like,

2502
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:35,924
even when,
when was he on like [inaudible] that 

2503
01:53:38,421 --> 01:53:41,070
he's starting to do his own thing.
His Dad,

2504
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,920
something called,
I told him to change the name,

2505
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:44,870
it's called the renegade university.
And I'm like,

2506
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:46,340
stop,
stop.

2507
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,600
People are gonna think you're a 
douchebag.

2508
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,450
He's done.
I've got to do a,

2509
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:51,580
I probably got up to,
I think,

2510
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:52,423
I think,
cause he asked me to do these about the 

2511
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:55,340
history of martial arts.
I'm like,

2512
01:53:55,341 --> 01:53:56,174
Oh man,
I've done [inaudible] that's a course 

2513
01:53:57,231 --> 01:53:59,660
I've actually done at Ucla.
And it was so much fun.

2514
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,470
I taught at Ucla.
Yeah,

2515
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,290
check this out.
This was hilarious.

2516
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:06,380
I only had an ami and at Ucla you need a
phd to teach.

2517
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:07,873
And I was like white guy going into an 
Asian American studies department and 

2518
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,770
going,
you know,

2519
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:15,050
yeah.
If case you haven't noticed,

2520
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:18,430
I'm not Asian American and I do all the 
Nma and uh,

2521
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,960
I never taken a course in Asian American
studies,

2522
01:54:20,961 --> 01:54:23,200
but I would love to teach for you and 
dee rees why?

2523
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,073
And by the time I was done with the 
peach about history and philosophy of 

2524
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:27,230
martial arts,
they were like,

2525
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,490
yeah,
you're a hired,

2526
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:30,620
let's go do it.
And I was like,

2527
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:31,970
okay,
now why would they,

2528
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:35,330
would they want you to be Asian because 
you teaching about an agent subject.

2529
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,193
I mean they don't want you to,
it kind of works their way because of 

2530
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:39,764
the way you know most of the people who 
stopped taking a bunch of classes in 

2531
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,843
ethnic studies.
Usually people who are from that 

2532
01:54:45,201 --> 01:54:48,050
particular ethnic group you've had,
I'm kind of,

2533
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,660
people always look at me like,
Huh,

2534
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:53,300
what's going on here?
Because I do teach in an American Indian

2535
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:54,134
studies department.
I have taught in an Asian American 

2536
01:54:55,821 --> 01:54:58,790
studies department,
but when you look at everybody else,

2537
01:54:58,791 --> 01:54:59,624
usually they are people who are from 
that particular ethnic group who are 

2538
01:55:01,881 --> 01:55:06,320
passionate and to dig in that much to be
in that field.

2539
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,700
Is there a,
is that an issue?

2540
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,320
Is there like push back?
If you're not,

2541
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:11,810
I mean it's kind of a,
to be fair,

2542
01:55:11,811 --> 01:55:12,644
people have been really cool about it 
because I mean I've even had the 

2543
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:15,614
situation where I taught as pirate of an
ethnic ethnic studies class where they 

2544
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:20,090
were like four people,
right?

2545
01:55:20,091 --> 01:55:20,924
And there's the African American studies
guys and African American guy in the 

2546
01:55:24,051 --> 01:55:24,801
Chicano,
Latino,

2547
01:55:24,801 --> 01:55:25,634
Chicano,
Latino.

2548
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:28,160
And that was the odd one out,
right?

2549
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:30,860
I was teaching the American Indian 
studies section and they're like,

2550
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:32,780
Huh,
you just replaced my friend,

2551
01:55:32,781 --> 01:55:36,860
the native lady who the fuck are you?
White guy kind of thing.

2552
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:40,160
But you know,
the thing was they want to check you.

2553
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:42,770
And then once I did my thing,
the first few licensed,

2554
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:43,650
they were like,
Nah,

2555
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,000
he's cool.
We like him,

2556
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,953
it's all good.
And then there was no bullshit and like 

2557
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:50,550
I would have expected to run into a lot 
more pushback.

2558
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:53,850
There really wasn't one thing.
And in your favor about when it comes to

2559
01:55:53,851 --> 01:55:56,940
martial arts,
although it is mostly Asian in origin,

2560
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:59,610
it varies so widely.
These Chinese marshawn,

2561
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:01,170
Japanese,
Korean,

2562
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:05,820
I mean it goes on and on tie,
there's so many different styles.

2563
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:10,440
And then of course South America,
once Brazilian Jujitsu got into the mix.

2564
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:11,333
Of course they,
in my opinion have revolutionized 

2565
01:56:13,591 --> 01:56:14,424
martial arts more than any other group.
I think that one part of the country in 

2566
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,410
South America,
Brazil,

2567
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:20,693
they had more of an impact on martial 
arts I think than anyway because they 

2568
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:24,684
essentially started,
I mean they started the ultimate 

2569
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:31,530
fighting championship just to see if 
their martial art was superior.

2570
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:32,383
Yup.
And they proved it to be so it's at 

2571
01:56:33,391 --> 01:56:37,290
least on its own by itself at first,
you know,

2572
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:40,620
before anybody knew about it.
I think that stuff was a,

2573
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:44,130
there's the whole period from when 
Japanese martial arts,

2574
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:47,910
we're kind of crashing because nobody 
was dressing as a Samurai anymore,

2575
01:56:47,911 --> 01:56:48,744
you know,
doing that stuff didn't make sense 

2576
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:50,250
anymore.

2577
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,083
And Jiu Jitsu was seen kind of as low 
class activity for gain stairs and you 

2578
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:55,724
know,
there was less and less popularity for 

2579
01:56:57,211 --> 01:56:59,540
that field.
And then when did you go to Oakano?

2580
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:03,270
The creator of judo started.
He was these nerdy shopper class guy,

2581
01:57:03,271 --> 01:57:04,104
but he was very passionate about judo.
So He transformed the Jujitsu Cori into 

2582
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,380
judo,
gave it to a whole new spin.

2583
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:10,891
He's like,
no,

2584
01:57:10,891 --> 01:57:11,724
it's not this thing to beat people up.
Like all the tags you have seen so far 

2585
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:16,830
where using jude was a form of 
education.

2586
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:18,390
And then we started that.
Yeah,

2587
01:57:18,391 --> 01:57:19,224
it's a super cool story.
And then he starts sending people all 

2588
01:57:21,181 --> 01:57:22,014
over the world to spread it.
And so they go to Russia and then mix 

2589
01:57:24,601 --> 01:57:25,434
with Rashaun thing and they create sound
sambo and then come out here and then 

2590
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:29,184
with a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when my,
that goes down to Brazil and all of 

2591
01:57:31,801 --> 01:57:31,980
that.

2592
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,250
So it's like that whole story,
how it's beans is awesome.

2593
01:57:35,251 --> 01:57:38,250
And then you end up with the,
the joy of globalization where like when

2594
01:57:38,251 --> 01:57:41,100
you see like hallways going to fight 
against Sakuraba and you have,

2595
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:44,800
you know,
but as Elian Dude trained in,

2596
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:45,643
uh,
what originally was a Asia martial arts 

2597
01:57:47,311 --> 01:57:50,430
transformed into this Brazilian thing 
wearing ag,

2598
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:54,870
going against getting who was more of a 
catch wrestler with studied more through

2599
01:57:54,871 --> 01:57:57,530
western wrestling a whole lot.
He goes hilarious.

2600
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:00,400
It's like you have the Japanese guy who 
was a more western wrestling back.

2601
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:03,360
It's fun.
That is crazy.

2602
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:08,310
The Japanese especially Sakuraba we're 
way influenced by catch wrestling,

2603
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:11,040
but which is American folk style 
wrestling.

2604
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:11,963
Yup.
Yup.

2605
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,400
Yeah.
Now I didn't know that,

2606
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:17,160
um,
that Jujitsu was used by thugs.

2607
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:18,053
Yeah.
That was the pirates that he's in 

2608
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,713
Hawaii,
Japan bashing him polarities because 

2609
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:25,310
used to be sort of the Samurai arts,
right.

2610
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,750
You do all that stuff.
But then the summer I end that,

2611
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:30,570
you know,
by the 1870s or so,

2612
01:58:30,571 --> 01:58:31,404
that was the pulse of the summarize.
So there really wasn't a function for 

2613
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:34,980
this stuff anymore.
It's like,

2614
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:36,173
and the only people who trained were 
mostly against theirs and kind of rough 

2615
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:39,804
guys who train for,
because they got into fights on the 

2616
01:58:41,951 --> 01:58:44,230
street and then kind.
No,

2617
01:58:44,231 --> 01:58:46,360
because he was this kind of secretly 
child.

2618
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:49,720
They Puti mean to strain in Jiu Jitsu to
kind of build the map.

2619
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:52,900
Giving me some strand.
Any was a complete nerd,

2620
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:55,300
but he loved Jujitsu and so he's like,
no,

2621
01:58:55,301 --> 01:58:55,750
no,
no,

2622
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:58,750
don't put it down.
It's a great heart for other reason.

2623
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:04,080
And he had his old way of spinning it 
around to saying that was the old stuff.

2624
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:06,220
Yeah.
To beat people up.

2625
01:59:06,221 --> 01:59:10,180
What we do today is a form of education 
is a relationship with your body.

2626
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:13,060
Any bicycle.
He invented a new function for it.

2627
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:15,640
So the Japanese society went,
Oh shit,

2628
01:59:15,641 --> 01:59:18,460
we can still do that stuff and now 
there's a better reason for it.

2629
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:19,323
That's 15 the times.
That's not the same reason why we would 

2630
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:23,284
train in the 17 hundreds right.
These actually fit the context of our 

2631
01:59:26,471 --> 01:59:27,304
time.
Okay.

2632
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:31,960
Let's the judo and then do they have 
texts where you could see the techniques

2633
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:33,970
or where you could see what 
similarities?

2634
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:34,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2635
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,540
There are both English in Jujitsu,
Manuel's where there are,

2636
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:39,310
you know,
the drawings and stuff like that.

2637
01:59:39,311 --> 01:59:40,144
And then by the time of comes around,
they even start diving fruitage after a 

2638
01:59:43,181 --> 01:59:44,030
while.
Right.

2639
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:47,370
Footage of actual films of you 
utilization that they,

2640
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:48,213
lord drills.
They look goofy as hell because they're 

2641
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,790
sped up and the move from the and stuff.
But they,

2642
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:52,210
uh,
yeah,

2643
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:55,750
there's good stuff and some of those 
guys are just bad asses from day one.

2644
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:56,583
I mean some of the old judo guys,
they got the reputation for just being 

2645
01:59:58,991 --> 01:59:59,824
killers,
you know?

2646
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:00,680
Yeah.
Well for sure.

2647
02:00:00,681 --> 02:00:01,790
Judo,
I don't,

2648
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:06,520
I wonder how much Jujitsu has changed 
since then to now because obviously um,

2649
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,800
and putting so much emphasis on the 
ground,

2650
02:00:08,801 --> 02:00:09,634
the Brazilians really refined all the 
submission techniques to a razor sharp 

2651
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:17,560
edge and really changed a lot of the 
original setups and the way people enter

2652
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:20,110
into submissions.
I would love to see what it used to look

2653
02:00:20,111 --> 02:00:22,150
like.
Even that's funny because if you look at

2654
02:00:22,151 --> 02:00:24,080
like some old judo,
like causing judo,

2655
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:24,993
where they have is very ground oriented.
Those guys do leg locks where it's like 

2656
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:33,460
you see these Japanese guys from the 
1920s like lock in each other and you're

2657
02:00:33,461 --> 02:00:34,540
like,
oh my God,

2658
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:36,340
this.
So the stuff that today's hot,

2659
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:39,250
some of these guys were doing and it 
probably wasn't as refined,

2660
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:40,960
but it was like men,
they weren't doing it.

2661
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,500
That's catch wrestling.
Catch wrestling was all about leg locks.

2662
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:47,640
They were leg locking when,
you know,

2663
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:50,800
the Americans were really into Brazilian
Jujitsu and stuff.

2664
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:52,150
Is this,
I woulda got here,

2665
02:00:52,151 --> 02:00:57,151
Jamie 1,608 d the history of Jujitsu or 
Yo Wara Huh?

2666
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:01,470
Wow.
The,

2667
02:01:01,471 --> 02:01:03,280
the dressed up in like,
um,

2668
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:04,143
I Kito Kimonos with the big flowing 
pants and the guy's like doing some 

2669
02:01:08,981 --> 02:01:10,560
weird sort of wrist lock.
Go,

2670
02:01:10,561 --> 02:01:11,500
go,
stop scrolling.

2671
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,880
Go right up there.
What was it like?

2672
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:13,620
Yeah,
it looks like,

2673
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:15,160
yeah,
he's the race looking and getting the,

2674
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:16,360
yeah.
Yeah.

2675
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,910
Interesting.
And then the other one,

2676
02:01:18,911 --> 02:01:19,744
it looks like he's got,
it looks like it's setting up a full 

2677
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:22,540
Nelson.
Yeah.

2678
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,373
He has a half an less on one side and 
he's got an under hook and the other 

2679
02:01:25,661 --> 02:01:26,494
side of that,
you know,

2680
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:30,730
but I'm really going to spin around and 
slam him right on his face.

2681
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:32,500
Yeah.
Crazy.

2682
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:34,090
Um,
that they have,

2683
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:34,953
you get to look at it and these images 
or they were just trying to figure out 

2684
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,490
like what's the best way to manipulate 
the body.

2685
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,940
It's just amazing to me how much of it 
came from Japan.

2686
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:45,230
Yup.
I mean Japan,

2687
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,420
so many interesting techniques and that 
one area,

2688
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:51,403
it was so vital and so important when it
came to the development of martial arts 

2689
02:01:57,070 --> 02:01:58,250
in Japan.
Is that weird?

2690
02:01:58,280 --> 02:01:59,113
Like a distillery story between China 
and Japan is very similar to ancient 

2691
02:02:02,031 --> 02:02:03,950
Greece and ancient Rome.
You know,

2692
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,680
a lot of the developments came from 
Greece.

2693
02:02:06,681 --> 02:02:08,390
A lot of the developments came from 
China,

2694
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,673
but then both the Roman and the Japanese
took those ideas and then ran with it 

2695
02:02:13,191 --> 02:02:14,024
and systematize them,
gave them a lot more of a structure or 

2696
02:02:16,341 --> 02:02:17,174
gave them,
made them way easier to learn and to 

2697
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:21,380
teach and then popularize them as a 
result.

2698
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,160
And it was like,
Yep,

2699
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:24,090
now this stuff works.
It's a lot easier to,

2700
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:26,180
to that they brought it to other 
countries.

2701
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,020
Yeah,
that was part of vision.

2702
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:33,140
[inaudible] was not a nationalist.
He did not have these Japan,

2703
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:34,340
fuck you,
everybody else.

2704
02:02:34,341 --> 02:02:38,090
He had this idea of like you need is 
universal brotherhood of mankind,

2705
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:41,410
so we need to bring our staff so that 
everybody can benefit from it.

2706
02:02:41,411 --> 02:02:43,370
And,
and so he said,

2707
02:02:43,371 --> 02:02:44,930
yeah,
he's on people over door.

2708
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:45,973
That's amazing.
There was even an idea that followed 

2709
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:49,670
because he did a three part series on in
history,

2710
02:02:49,671 --> 02:02:50,504
on fire about till the Roosevelt,
because he was just such a crazy 

2711
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:53,660
motherfucker,
right?

2712
02:02:53,661 --> 02:02:54,181
He's like,
no,

2713
02:02:54,181 --> 02:02:55,400
why?
Maybe come precedent.

2714
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:56,234
That's the wildest dude out there and he
even like 1905 nine somewhere right 

2715
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:02,624
around there.
He had a guy sent by Cano that taught 

2716
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:09,860
judo to the United States precedent and 
so it was,

2717
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:10,694
well,
it was one of the very first Americans 

2718
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,670
ever to to learn some Judah.

2719
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:16,040
He was such an important precedent.
Man.

2720
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:16,903
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have the national public 

2721
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:19,610
lands we have to them.
He was awesome.

2722
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,661
He's the,
you know,

2723
02:03:20,661 --> 02:03:22,700
I generally speaking when you're talking
about us,

2724
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:26,300
but I sit in is like different degrees 
of what I don't like.

2725
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:26,811
It's like,
okay,

2726
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:28,850
I hate this guy,
mildly hate this guy.

2727
02:03:28,851 --> 02:03:32,480
I'd really hate this guy.
Total result was one of those dudes who,

2728
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:33,314
right.
I mean there's some stuff that he did 

2729
02:03:35,001 --> 02:03:36,560
then say they are like,
Oh shit.

2730
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:39,890
Okay that it wasn't so good,
but so much of it is awesome.

2731
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,170
What did he say that you don't like?
Well,

2732
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:46,460
I mean you got to give him a pass for 
when he leaves,

2733
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:48,140
but he of course,
the,

2734
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:48,974
his idea about race,
copper to what we would consider a cool 

2735
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:51,661
today.
Yeah.

2736
02:03:51,661 --> 02:03:54,350
Not the,
he had some pretty heavyweight.

2737
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:56,670
He started a lot more racist than the 
end that,

2738
02:03:56,671 --> 02:03:59,410
so I also giving credit for that.
For being adaptive.

2739
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,800
Yeah,
very adoptable.

2740
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:01,634
Then cooling direct guard.
But clearly some of his writings was 

2741
02:04:03,471 --> 02:04:04,304
pretty freaky and,
and also he's one of the guy who just 

2742
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:08,210
never swear war.
He didn't like,

2743
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,350
you know,
he's like,

2744
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:11,600
or yes,
venture.

2745
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:12,434
Right?
Yeah.

2746
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:15,440
The Art of Jujitsu is worth more in 
every way.

2747
02:04:15,441 --> 02:04:16,274
Then all of our athletics combined,
President Theodore Roosevelt 1905 I 

2748
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:21,560
agree.
Yup.

2749
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,830
I agree.
Me and Teddy Roosevelt,

2750
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:26,750
same page.
Good.

2751
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:27,923
You even seem like he lost sight in one 
eye while he was president because of 

2752
02:04:31,521 --> 02:04:32,540
sparring.
Too hard.

2753
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:35,900
Really go heat way to hire because he 
barks all the time.

2754
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:36,734
Right.
So he goes,

2755
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:38,010
he last division.
Yep.

2756
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,840
He lost vision in one eye.
Somebody's thumb.

2757
02:04:39,841 --> 02:04:44,820
The president probably mother fucker.
Yeah.

2758
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:48,090
Wow.
That's gangster as president until a lot

2759
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:49,080
of big game hunting too.

2760
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:50,310
Man,
that guy went all over the world.

2761
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:53,910
He did wild guy really when you think 
about it.

2762
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:56,960
But my favorite ever was about a story.
Speaking of bad ass is a,

2763
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,863
in 1912 he's running for president again
as a third party candidate out of which 

2764
02:05:01,421 --> 02:05:02,900
was cool in itself,
right.

2765
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:05,610
Because he was challenging both the 
Republican and Democrats.

2766
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,253
He is in his car waving to the people 
and somebody shooting for just a few 

2767
02:05:11,730 --> 02:05:13,410
feet away,
just straight in his chest.

2768
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:17,220
But at the time he had these a 50 page 
of speech,

2769
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:18,054
he had better pay or to,
so he had all the written notes in his 

2770
02:05:19,771 --> 02:05:21,990
pocket.
He had his glass case in his pocket.

2771
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:25,530
So the bullet did hit him,
but it was low down by going through the

2772
02:05:25,531 --> 02:05:27,200
glass case and the speech.
Yeah,

2773
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:30,030
but still you just took a bullet to the 
chest,

2774
02:05:30,031 --> 02:05:31,230
you're bleeding and stuff.

2775
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:32,580
And so everybody's like,
oh my God,

2776
02:05:32,581 --> 02:05:35,470
we need to take him to the hospital and 
the Roosevelt coffee,

2777
02:05:35,471 --> 02:05:36,304
any sand.
He said that there's no blood coming 

2778
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:38,191
out.
So he said,

2779
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:39,350
okay,
my lungs are in tough.

2780
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:41,850
They haven't been pierced,
so what are you talking about hospital?

2781
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:44,490
I got a speech to give,
so he shows up,

2782
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:48,270
we tee shirt covered in blood,
and he goes like,

2783
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,950
yeah,
I'm ladies and gentlemen.

2784
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,813
I don't know if you know I've been shot,
but it takes more than these two Kilo 

2785
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:59,300
Bull Moose and then deliver 90 minute 
speech before several of his attendance.

2786
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:00,000
Fine.
I'd be like,

2787
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,730
can we now go to the hospital please?
They're like,

2788
02:06:02,731 --> 02:06:03,330
okay,
sure.

2789
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:05,610
Now we can go.
What was the hospital back then?

2790
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,563
You'd probably be better off not going 
to rub the dead chicken on your whole 

2791
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:12,023
probably.
What could they possibly do to fix that 

2792
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:14,514
back then?

2793
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:16,170
You know?
Wow.

2794
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:18,510
Yeah,
I mean hard times,

2795
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:19,440
right?
Hard times,

2796
02:06:19,441 --> 02:06:20,274
great hard men,
soft times create a lot of the weak 

2797
02:06:23,131 --> 02:06:26,220
bitches we're seeing flopping around our
streets today.

2798
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:30,060
That's exactly what of the things that 
Roosevelt Hammer song over and over.

2799
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:32,090
He had this whole idea of the strenuous 
life,

2800
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:33,540
the idea that,
you know,

2801
02:06:33,541 --> 02:06:38,310
he came from an upper class super 
elitist background and he realize,

2802
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:40,350
and a lot of people back then works in,
you know,

2803
02:06:40,351 --> 02:06:41,184
our kids are going to be enough to be a 
bunch of Williams because they are too 

2804
02:06:43,051 --> 02:06:43,884
pampered.
And so he solution since he was a 

2805
02:06:46,201 --> 02:06:48,870
teenager was boxing,
wrestling,

2806
02:06:48,871 --> 02:06:52,320
hunting,
just these very tough mainly things.

2807
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:55,740
And so that's what he thrived on this 
whole idea of like,

2808
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:57,030
yeah,
you need to,

2809
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,820
he had a great quote about you have to 
keep your barbaric things,

2810
02:06:59,821 --> 02:07:01,890
things in order to go along with 
civilization.

2811
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:03,240
And that was like,
that's perfect.

2812
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:05,090
You know,
that's like the best of both words.

2813
02:07:05,091 --> 02:07:06,780
And yeah,
that guys,

2814
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:09,300
I had a blast style.
I mean I knew about him,

2815
02:07:09,301 --> 02:07:10,134
but once you get to do a series,
you really need to know your stuff in 

2816
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:13,914
and out.
So it was so fun to study his life 

2817
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,793
because it was a stand out like that.
And The Times that he did and the early 

2818
02:07:20,101 --> 02:07:23,430
19 hundreds I mean really,
really pretty significant.

2819
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:25,860
That's,
that's actually one of the things that I

2820
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:26,694
dig about that I do a little different 
from the way Dan approaches hardcore 

2821
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:31,254
history.
Dan tend to look at things from the big 

2822
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:34,291
picture,
you know,

2823
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,240
he's telling you big picture stories and
I loved that.

2824
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:41,480
But I also like jam pinning too.
I like biographies.

2825
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:46,030
I like sometimes telling the story of 
this one guy and what he really meant to

2826
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:47,980
be this individual in this story.

2827
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:48,970
And so I did,
you know,

2828
02:07:48,971 --> 02:07:51,850
I did to the Roosevelt,
I did one on crazy horse.

2829
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:55,480
I did one on [inaudible] painter.
We're talking about catch up.

2830
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:57,950
I've got to catch up as long as the 
blind that you was dig.

2831
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:00,490
I had did the Jack and Jill on some,
you know,

2832
02:08:00,491 --> 02:08:04,230
the first black heavyweight champion.
He's so fun.

2833
02:08:04,340 --> 02:08:05,173
You know my favorite Jack Johnson story 
is he got pulled over for speeding up 

2834
02:08:07,821 --> 02:08:10,600
the cars and the story,
you know,

2835
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:12,450
it's my dues.
That's exactly,

2836
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:14,080
I was telling that Carolyn the,
Oh,

2837
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:17,800
I've got to do Jack Johnson and he said,
ward by ward what you say.

2838
02:08:17,801 --> 02:08:18,481
And he said,
you know,

2839
02:08:18,481 --> 02:08:20,240
that's my favorite.
Jack Johnson started.

2840
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,850
I wonder if that was,
well,

2841
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:25,330
tell the story.
So what happened was he gets pulled over

2842
02:08:25,331 --> 02:08:28,480
in [inaudible] state,
I believe it was George at the time when

2843
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,820
you know,
being at Texas might've been Georgia.

2844
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,330
Everybody has their,
you know,

2845
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:34,173
not many people at the Paris and Jack 
Johnson was one of the guys who love is 

2846
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:37,714
fast cars and he was speeding.
So they pull him over and the cop is 

2847
02:08:40,301 --> 02:08:41,290
like,
hey boy,

2848
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,603
this is going to cost you.
You owe me $50 and you know back then 

2849
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:48,920
you could pay your ticket on the spot in
cash than Jack on some police cop,

2850
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,020
Catia,
I would start,

2851
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,580
it is a hundred and a coffee.
He's like,

2852
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:53,860
I don't have changed for that kind of 
money.

2853
02:08:53,861 --> 02:08:54,451
And he's like,
no,

2854
02:08:54,451 --> 02:08:54,611
no,
no,

2855
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:55,444
no.
Two hours from now I'm going to be 

2856
02:08:56,291 --> 02:08:58,990
driving back the same way and they're 
going to be doing the same speed.

2857
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,690
So I'm just paying you hand.

2858
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:06,570
I hope that was true.
I refuse to listen to anyway,

2859
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:09,300
that tells me any different,
fuck that story about the Victorian.

2860
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:10,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2861
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:13,420
Table ignore or give you that one.
I'll let you take that one,

2862
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:15,460
but I'm,
I want to keep that Jack Johnson story.

2863
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:17,800
Well,
there are too many that he did in public

2864
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,640
feats,
that persona to thing,

2865
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,270
like if he eats know it's that way.
Well is it,

2866
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:23,123
he was the dude with 1905 1906 around 
that time it was making a living as a 

2867
02:09:27,131 --> 02:09:27,964
black guy,
beating up white guys in their ink and 

2868
02:09:29,571 --> 02:09:33,640
sleeping with white women who,
and he figured it out.

2869
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:36,820
He did it and he didn't get lynched.
Amazingly enough.

2870
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:38,040
Amazing.
Yeah.

2871
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:40,180
I mean,
how do they keep that from happening?

2872
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:43,450
How did they keep that Guy Alive?
I mean with the racism that existed back

2873
02:09:43,451 --> 02:09:44,201
then,
I mean,

2874
02:09:44,201 --> 02:09:48,310
you're talking about just a few decades 
after slavery.

2875
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:49,031
He,
he,

2876
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:50,980
he's,
Byron's were born in slavery.

2877
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:54,250
He was the first generation of somebody 
who was not born in his live in,

2878
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:55,990
in his family.
And you know,

2879
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:59,170
they say that at times he did sleep with
a gun under his pillow.

2880
02:09:59,171 --> 02:10:00,840
They did say,
yeah,

2881
02:10:00,930 --> 02:10:01,763
well you're amazing.

2882
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,980
How the fuck could you,
I mean,

2883
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:10,390
how could you sleep back?
Imagine being a black guy at the turn of

2884
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:15,190
the century back then,
who was just in the kind of racism.

2885
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:17,370
I don't even think we can comprehend to 
it.

2886
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,393
It's something good.
Think about the civil rights movement 

2887
02:10:20,441 --> 02:10:20,861
and the,
the,

2888
02:10:20,861 --> 02:10:21,580
all the,
the,

2889
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:22,413
you know,
the hosing of the protests and stuff 

2890
02:10:23,531 --> 02:10:25,960
like that.
That was 60 years later.

2891
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:27,580
That's the mellow stuff.
That's everyone.

2892
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:29,500
It chilled out by then.
There was,

2893
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,940
um,
Taylor Roosevelt,

2894
02:10:30,941 --> 02:10:33,830
that booker t Washington for dinner,
the White House,

2895
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:34,664
and he was the first time ever done a 
black guy was officially invited for 

2896
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:40,670
dinner at the White House right after he
had the dinner.

2897
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,960
There was such a backlash,
like sense,

2898
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,800
uh,
some of the Santa sort on the side.

2899
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:45,634
I would start,
I flipping out and I forget the exact 

2900
02:10:47,811 --> 02:10:49,700
words,
but one of the guys at one point said,

2901
02:10:49,701 --> 02:10:51,750
you know,
after the precedent did the sing,

2902
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:53,023
we are gonna now have to lean shut 
thousand and Garcia our state to put 

2903
02:10:55,911 --> 02:10:57,080
them back in their place.

2904
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:58,910
And you're like,
I'm sorry.

2905
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,773
Try that again.
That's the u s senate from the Endi was 

2906
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:04,820
patty tick.
Sap did.

2907
02:11:04,821 --> 02:11:05,654
I was just,
I will know the La Times about Jack 

2908
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:10,460
Johnson said,
you know,

2909
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:14,720
why didn't Jim jefferies key limb that 
brutal based that you know,

2910
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,970
the staff that you read,
the quotes are like,

2911
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,953
come on,
somebody must have made it up because 

2912
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:22,330
they couldn't be dare racist.
He was in the La Times.

2913
02:11:22,790 --> 02:11:27,790
God will year was that a Johnson won the
title I believe in 1908,

2914
02:11:28,671 --> 02:11:30,130
I want to say.
And uh,

2915
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,270
but all,
even in the previous year she was making

2916
02:11:32,271 --> 02:11:35,170
a reputation for being a bad ass 
fighter.

2917
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:38,900
It's amazing that 110 years ago we were 
that fucked up.

2918
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:40,910
That's so recent.
Well,

2919
02:11:40,911 --> 02:11:41,510
when,
uh,

2920
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:44,900
when he had the fight with Jim Jefferies
was the old undefeated.

2921
02:11:44,901 --> 02:11:45,830
Why champion,
you know,

2922
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:47,960
because when he won the title and then 
it started,

2923
02:11:47,961 --> 02:11:49,760
they started throwing a bunch of white 
guys,

2924
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:52,100
a team that he crashed as the great 
white hope.

2925
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:53,563
Then eventually the writer,
Jac loan don't started this campaign to 

2926
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:57,283
bring Jim Jeff phase the undefeated why 
champion back from retirement to redeem 

2927
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:04,820
the white race.
And Jim [inaudible] was a beast,

2928
02:12:04,821 --> 02:12:05,654
right?
It was a whole coffee man strong and 

2929
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,520
knocked out all of his opponents,
but he'd been retired for a while and so

2930
02:12:10,521 --> 02:12:12,770
he comes back,
they have this fight in Reno,

2931
02:12:12,771 --> 02:12:17,420
Nevada on July 4th,
1910 by the time the fight is over,

2932
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:19,910
injector on some crashes him and wins 
the title,

2933
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,040
you know,
defends his title easy.

2934
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:23,623
There are riots in 25 states in 50 
different cities and by the time the 

2935
02:12:27,801 --> 02:12:28,634
riots are done,
like dozens of people are dead because 

2936
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:35,060
Jack Johnson and I'd beat and Jim 
Jefferies and what are they listening to

2937
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:38,390
it over the radio.
At the time it wasn't like they had like

2938
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:41,840
telegraph news,
the sand to the newspaper and there will

2939
02:12:41,841 --> 02:12:45,950
be a guy in this public square screaming
Johnson just landed and left took.

2940
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:49,640
That's how they did it.
Wow.

2941
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:52,530
That is crazy.
[inaudible] San Fransisco,

2942
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:55,140
they had a,
they had to box there,

2943
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:59,390
said he knocked the news of sent by 
telegraphs before what was going on.

2944
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:00,703
Everybody just walked around back then.
I mean look at these people just 

2945
02:13:03,021 --> 02:13:08,021
wandering through the streets.
Even like when there was a a fight going

2946
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:10,640
on,
like there's no announcers so there's no

2947
02:13:10,641 --> 02:13:12,350
commentary,
right?

2948
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:15,200
Yes.
It sit down and watch no TV.

2949
02:13:15,201 --> 02:13:15,951
There's no,
no,

2950
02:13:15,951 --> 02:13:19,030
this is,
this is Jeffery's training is clearly gy

2951
02:13:19,050 --> 02:13:22,580
star in training camp then yeah,
here it is.

2952
02:13:22,581 --> 02:13:23,414
There it was.
And back then you could clean shallot 

2953
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:26,714
inboxing,
which was kind of Jack Johnson and 

2954
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:30,530
style.
He would get like double bicep control.

2955
02:13:30,531 --> 02:13:31,980
Usually he would

2956
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:33,173
keep you there so you can't hate him.
And then once in a while he would break 

2957
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:35,994
free,
throw an upper cut and go back to 

2958
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:41,070
Clinton did.
He was fucking jacked for the time.

2959
02:13:41,071 --> 02:13:41,904
Yeah.
When you think about this time like 

2960
02:13:43,021 --> 02:13:43,854
people back then,
you know there was no fucking 

2961
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:47,490
supplements.
Yeah.

2962
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:49,590
They barely knew how to work out.
Exactly.

2963
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:50,663
You know,
even when he's punching like his 

2964
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:54,250
technique is very different.
Yup.

2965
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:55,413
They and also they had a be really 
concerned about breaking their hands 

2966
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,393
because they were fighting with these 
little tiny ass gloves and basically 

2967
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:05,280
like mma gloves with thumbs in some of 
these fights,

2968
02:14:05,281 --> 02:14:07,530
like they were scheduled for insane 
sinks.

2969
02:14:07,531 --> 02:14:08,364
Like,
I believe this one was scheduled for 45 

2970
02:14:09,631 --> 02:14:10,464
rounds.

2971
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:14,010
How many rounds it go?
Uh,

2972
02:14:14,011 --> 02:14:19,011
I think 15 fourth at 2:00 PM in July,
Nevada.

2973
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:22,350
And they're handled and 10 degree 
weather.

2974
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:24,720
It's like wow,
who does that?

2975
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:27,540
You know?
Hundred and 10 degree weather in fucking

2976
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:28,410
Reno.
Yup.

2977
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:32,290
Crazy hat on.
Everyone in the crowd.

2978
02:14:32,291 --> 02:14:34,650
They were in the same hat.
That's a good point Jamie.

2979
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:35,513
Look,
they all wore those goofy ass fucking 

2980
02:14:36,541 --> 02:14:37,374
hats.
Like why did everybody like I want to 

2981
02:14:39,091 --> 02:14:39,924
look,
just like say want to wear a nice hat 

2982
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:43,283
while I watched our white race sex hade 
like how many black people in the 

2983
02:14:46,171 --> 02:14:49,710
audience [inaudible] you can count on 
that yet.

2984
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:50,843
They say that the band before Jack and 
Jones came onto the rig shortly before 

2985
02:14:54,901 --> 02:14:56,400
they announced the,
when he came on,

2986
02:14:56,730 --> 02:14:57,563
the band was playing these popular songs
of the time called old coons look alike 

2987
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:04,620
to me.
Wow.

2988
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,330
That's right before he comes on.

2989
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:07,673
So this is like one of those things 
where like people are hoping that the 

2990
02:15:10,801 --> 02:15:11,634
bad guy loses.
So there millions of people are paying 

2991
02:15:14,581 --> 02:15:16,860
attention because they want Jack Johnson
to lose.

2992
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:17,723
It's not that they are hoping a good 
fight takes place and let's see who 

2993
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:22,134
wins.
They wanted to get this guy off the 

2994
02:15:24,091 --> 02:15:26,760
throne.
This was in tvm about boxing.

2995
02:15:26,761 --> 02:15:28,620
These was about race.
Yeah.

2996
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:31,650
Real kind of amazing.
Then I went as long as it did.

2997
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:33,150
Yup.
And here they are.

2998
02:15:33,151 --> 02:15:33,984
They're in the 13th round.
You gotta be a different kind of human 

2999
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:39,510
to fight with those little gloves for as
many rounds as these people fought.

3000
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:40,960
Yep.
No,

3001
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:44,940
it was geisler fascinating stuff.
Or who else have you covered,

3002
02:15:44,941 --> 02:15:45,531
uh,
on,

3003
02:15:45,531 --> 02:15:48,120
on your podcast?
Biographies?

3004
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:51,030
Let me think that you really like,
it changed the way you feel about them.

3005
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:52,590
Checking Johnson was awesome.

3006
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:54,840
I had so much fun studying though.
And you know,

3007
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:56,880
all the biographies done or some of my 
favorites.

3008
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:58,880
He unforgivable blackness.
I,

3009
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:01,110
that was the first thing when I started 
the research,

3010
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:01,944
that was where I started.
I started watching the Ken Burns 

3011
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:05,130
documentary,
which was great.

3012
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,190
And that kind of gave me the basics of 
the story.

3013
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:08,851
And I'm like,
okay,

3014
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:09,684
I see where all of you to going now go 
back through the tedious stuff or three 

3015
02:16:12,721 --> 02:16:16,470
devotee damn book about him and plugging
all the information and stuff.

3016
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:17,760
But yeah,
the documentary is great.

3017
02:16:17,761 --> 02:16:18,750
Yeah,
I love that one.

3018
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,940
So who else have you done that really 
like kind of stood out for you?

3019
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:25,110
So the big ones have been a crazy horse 
caravan.

3020
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:27,380
Joe Theodore Roosevelt,
Jack Johnson.

3021
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:30,120
Those are the biographies I've done.
Crazy horse is a fast

3022
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:30,953
anyone.
Are they still doing that crazy South 

3023
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:34,210
Dakota sculpture of him?
Yeah.

3024
02:16:34,211 --> 02:16:35,830
I mean,
I don't know.

3025
02:16:35,831 --> 02:16:36,664
I'll put him to do it forever because 
the guy who started a project is long 

3026
02:16:39,461 --> 02:16:40,890
dead,
so right.

3027
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:43,000
Second,
they depend on private money.

3028
02:16:43,001 --> 02:16:45,050
So they are not really moving a tiny 
kind of,

3029
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,550
so isn't it kind of fucked because there
was no pictures of crazy horse.

3030
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:50,470
We literally have no idea what I looked 
like.

3031
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:52,060
Nope.
None whatsoever.

3032
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:54,790
If you're doing this,
you're just essentially like guessing.

3033
02:16:54,791 --> 02:16:56,560
I mean,
they could use your face completely.

3034
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:58,410
Yeah.
I think they should use my face.

3035
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:01,170
Yeah.
Why not the,

3036
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:03,310
but yeah,
that's a better story right there.

3037
02:17:03,311 --> 02:17:05,590
Cause that was a guy,
he kind of a,

3038
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:08,140
it's almost like watching a Maryville 
thing about wolverine.

3039
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:08,974
You know,
he has this super power that guy was a 

3040
02:17:10,061 --> 02:17:10,894
beast in warfare,
but everyone he loved around him died 

3041
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:18,130
and so you'll have these kind of tragic 
figure off the guy was a beast.

3042
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:21,130
But for all his powers he can protect 
the ones they love.

3043
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:25,960
Well he fought naked and cut little 
pieces of his body off.

3044
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:29,260
Like he cut chunks of flesh off all over
his body.

3045
02:17:29,261 --> 02:17:32,200
Like his entire body was like a mosaic 
of scars.

3046
02:17:32,350 --> 02:17:36,460
There was um,
yeah it was even before like a couple of

3047
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:38,140
weeks before the battle of the little 
bighorn.

3048
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:42,840
It is the famous bath towel with Costa 
and doto flood and there was a 16 bul.

3049
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:43,683
One of the other main Lakota leaders 
participated in his sundance and one of 

3050
02:17:46,721 --> 02:17:47,554
the things they did was kind of cut like
50 flesh all fitting Oni Sharm where do 

3051
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:55,030
you kind of cut these like pin size 
needle of your flesh but steel.

3052
02:17:55,180 --> 02:17:58,810
And the whole point is to go into this 
trance partially from the pain,

3053
02:17:58,811 --> 02:18:02,830
partially from dehydration,
peripherally prayer and Dolo fit and the

3054
02:18:02,831 --> 02:18:03,664
stories that sitting bull then at this 
vision that they were going to be 

3055
02:18:07,121 --> 02:18:07,954
attacked.

3056
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:10,150
The troops were going to reach their 
camp,

3057
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:11,013
but they were going to get crushed.
And so the vision was even at a bath 

3058
02:18:14,101 --> 02:18:16,120
towel shortly thereafter and sitting 
bull was like,

3059
02:18:16,121 --> 02:18:16,954
yeah,
this wasn't,

3060
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:20,410
this wasn't close to our camp division 
is they are attacking our camp.

3061
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:23,620
And that's when supposedly the whole 
little bighorn thing,

3062
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:26,230
that's why they were feeling kind of 
like we can handle it.

3063
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,450
We're good with this.
She wish she knew if that was true.

3064
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:29,980
The whole,
you know,

3065
02:18:29,990 --> 02:18:30,821
vision.
Yeah.

3066
02:18:30,821 --> 02:18:31,654
Dares to think about that kind of a 
culture where the stories that they say 

3067
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:38,964
like a lot of the time in order to get a
reputation for being the guy who can 

3068
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:42,161
say,
hey,

3069
02:18:42,161 --> 02:18:44,110
I had a vision and people actually 
believe you,

3070
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:46,840
you need to have proven something along 
the way.

3071
02:18:46,841 --> 02:18:48,700
You need to have,
cause I mean,

3072
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:50,350
anybody can say I had a visa on the end.

3073
02:18:50,350 --> 02:18:50,771
He's like,
yeah,

3074
02:18:50,771 --> 02:18:52,000
that's great.
Show us.

3075
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:54,010
Are you,
can you now see that dude?

3076
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:55,540
Yes or no.
If you can't shut up,

3077
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:57,430
you're just not losing 18.
What can you say?

3078
02:18:57,431 --> 02:19:00,310
I have a vision and then it comes true.
Exactly as you said.

3079
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,990
Well in that case people are like,
okay,

3080
02:19:01,991 --> 02:19:02,824
now we're paying attention.
Next time you have a vision police 

3081
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,710
stylus.
But if you say,

3082
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:07,930
I had division that these happen and 
nothing happened,

3083
02:19:07,931 --> 02:19:09,070
everybody's like,
shut up.

3084
02:19:09,071 --> 02:19:09,904
You're just,
I just wish we knew that like him going 

3085
02:19:13,451 --> 02:19:17,280
into a state of mind where it was almost
dying because you're like,

3086
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,023
what was that a a man called horse of 
movie where they do that thing that 

3087
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:25,300
barb's through your nipples and hang you
from the ceiling.

3088
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:27,770
That's a sundance.
I've been actually too,

3089
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,350
because that was illegal for a really 
long time.

3090
02:19:30,351 --> 02:19:32,390
Right.
Then they brought it back in the open in

3091
02:19:32,391 --> 02:19:35,630
the 1970s,
and I've been to,

3092
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:38,280
I think seven sun dances rarely do that.

3093
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,313
You've watched people get suspended by 
their nipples that usually don't get 

3094
02:19:41,661 --> 02:19:44,510
suspended and is non nipples is uh,
just the um,

3095
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:45,403
yeah,
the,

3096
02:19:45,490 --> 02:19:46,323
the chest muscle,
well they don't go under the muscle is 

3097
02:19:47,721 --> 02:19:50,690
just kin but they go up on top and a 
day.

3098
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:52,063
So they usually don't get suspended but 
they dance attach we there is a rope to 

3099
02:19:55,281 --> 02:19:59,540
the tree and then when they want a bit 
of clues they just rip right through.

3100
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:02,480
And you know,
you've got like these quarter size,

3101
02:20:02,481 --> 02:20:07,070
the scar I auto fit.
And which you know,

3102
02:20:07,071 --> 02:20:07,904
when you think about the whole idea of 
sacrifice is something that they do in 

3103
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:13,550
all the religions pretty much to be 
friendly degrees.

3104
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:15,133
You know,
back in the day animal sacrifice was 

3105
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:19,100
huge.
That was one of the sinks and you know,

3106
02:20:19,101 --> 02:20:19,934
these guys have it as a,
you shed the blood cause that's your 

3107
02:20:23,361 --> 02:20:23,780
energy.

3108
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:24,613
That's the one thing.
And that will give strength to your 

3109
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:29,090
prayers and all of that stuff.
But yeah,

3110
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:31,940
first time I ever saw it I was like,
Holy Shit,

3111
02:20:31,970 --> 02:20:32,803
this is intense.
This is probably also something to that 

3112
02:20:35,091 --> 02:20:39,770
where they're trying to put people 
through something to make them stronger.

3113
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:42,710
There definitely is that aspect and that
is like,

3114
02:20:42,711 --> 02:20:45,050
yeah,
this is not something that somebody does

3115
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:45,884
Willy Nilly.
Like,

3116
02:20:45,890 --> 02:20:47,270
Oh,
I'm going to sundance tomorrow.

3117
02:20:47,271 --> 02:20:47,961
He's like,
no,

3118
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:50,390
you don't mess around it.
Now that this ritual,

3119
02:20:50,391 --> 02:20:51,224
in fact,
it's probably to strengthen their 

3120
02:20:52,161 --> 02:20:52,994
resolve and make their better warriors 
just by having experienced such a 

3121
02:20:56,181 --> 02:20:58,790
horrific ritual,
ritual,

3122
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:01,730
ritual,
practice ripping,

3123
02:21:01,731 --> 02:21:05,120
meet off your tits.
The m one started a day,

3124
02:21:05,121 --> 02:21:07,970
say legit.
It looks legit.

3125
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,980
Looks like a white guy thought,
I don't know.

3126
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:12,253
Yeah,
it looks like a guy who was pretty 

3127
02:21:12,621 --> 02:21:13,454
annoying.
So it looks like the betties on Venice 

3128
02:21:14,781 --> 02:21:15,614
beach right now.

3129
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:18,553
The,
there's a story that they say about can 

3130
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:20,423
see yours.
And then when he was a kid to toughen 

3131
02:21:21,441 --> 02:21:22,390
him up,
he said,

3132
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:23,130
dad,
uh,

3133
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:25,550
had killed a turtle,
that they were going to it.

3134
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:30,470
But the story goes that the turtle heart
keeps beating after it's dead for awhile

3135
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,813
and carved out with the third girl and 
pull out this still beating heart and 

3136
02:21:34,371 --> 02:21:38,390
gave it to crazy horse tweet.
Heathrow and yeah.

3137
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:41,180
Raw Turtle Heart.
I don't recommend it.

3138
02:21:41,181 --> 02:21:42,500
He'll be team.
Yeah.

3139
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:45,230
We were all kind of fucking diseases you
get from turtle hearts.

3140
02:21:46,430 --> 02:21:48,590
But as a,
I would say cook that well done.

3141
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:49,543
Right.
That's the only way to have seven good 

3142
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:53,480
third heart.
Yeah.

3143
02:21:53,481 --> 02:21:56,030
I mean what kinds of parasites and shit.
Her and turtles,

3144
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:57,740
turtles eat everything.
Right.

3145
02:21:57,741 --> 02:21:58,574
But that's also what's funny is like 
when you think about like walls or you 

3146
02:22:00,651 --> 02:22:03,470
think about people who live super close 
to nature,

3147
02:22:03,471 --> 02:22:04,304
they could eat stuff that if we try 
today were dead in 30 seconds and they 

3148
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:08,260
were fine.

3149
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:09,980
I think that it's speeding.
Yep.

3150
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:11,510
Googled it.
And it came up right away.

3151
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:14,000
Wow.
Turtle heart and just going off.

3152
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,880
Did you hear about that guy who just got
fired?

3153
02:22:16,881 --> 02:22:19,540
I think it was in Iowa.
He was a school teacher.

3154
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:22,730
He fed a snapping turtle.
A puppy in the middle of the class.

3155
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:24,170
What the hell?
No,

3156
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:26,130
I did not hear.
Yeah.

3157
02:22:26,131 --> 02:22:27,270
Yeah.
He,

3158
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:28,770
uh,
he's currently suspended.

3159
02:22:28,771 --> 02:22:30,330
That's what I think.
Yeah.

3160
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,920
Yeah.
This guy a,

3161
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:34,590
he had done some other dark shit in 
class before.

3162
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:37,890
It is teacher investigator for feeding 
puppies to snapping turtles.

3163
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:39,650
It's cool.
Go,

3164
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:42,240
go see the image of the guy in the 
beginning of the article again.

3165
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,210
They go back to the,
the video and pause in his face.

3166
02:22:46,310 --> 02:22:47,143
Cool.

3167
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,410
There he is out.
Fuck.

3168
02:22:51,010 --> 02:22:53,050
Why hasn't it shows face again right 
there.

3169
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:57,040
Let me see his face like goofy Prek.
Awesome.

3170
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:02,620
It looks like a fucking complete psycho.
Yeah.

3171
02:23:02,830 --> 02:23:03,940
There he is.
Look at him.

3172
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:04,913
Oh,
well,

3173
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:06,430
you know,
if you leave a puppy,

3174
02:23:06,431 --> 02:23:08,120
will the snapping to hurdle.
He will eat.

3175
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:11,490
He will.
I'll show Hoshyar.

3176
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,670
Okay.
Don't tell your mom.

3177
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:15,730
Yeah,
don't do that deck.

3178
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:18,250
We have animals that we like more than 
other animals.

3179
02:23:18,251 --> 02:23:19,120
Yeah.
That's a fact.

3180
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:19,973
That's,
and we like poppies a whole lot more 

3181
02:23:20,981 --> 02:23:24,160
than we like those dirty fucking stinky 
hardheaded turtles.

3182
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:25,013
Yeah.
Leavers.

3183
02:23:25,030 --> 02:23:26,110
Ari Parker.
Is he alone?

3184
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:26,970
Oh,
I like it.

3185
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:27,761
Yeah.
That's how it is.

3186
02:23:27,761 --> 02:23:28,630
Some item,
we'll start.

3187
02:23:28,631 --> 02:23:30,100
Cool.
There's fucking them.

3188
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:33,430
We have a profound hypocrisy,
fine by me.

3189
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:35,020
Don't you think?
Do you,

3190
02:23:35,021 --> 02:23:35,854
uh,
you're probably more aware of that than 

3191
02:23:36,641 --> 02:23:38,710
the average person because of your study
of history.

3192
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:41,160
I mean,
the,

3193
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:42,063
the hypocrisy of the human race are most
exposed by going over them and the 

3194
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:49,270
washing these patterns repeat themselves
over and over and over again.

3195
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:50,111
Yeah.
No,

3196
02:23:50,111 --> 02:23:51,210
I mean it's a,
the,

3197
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:52,083
that's why to me,
I'm completely fascinated by the inner 

3198
02:23:54,611 --> 02:23:55,444
workings of the human mind because the 
way that people can spin stories to 

3199
02:23:59,111 --> 02:23:59,944
themselves to justify stuff that in 
another context will be going see 

3200
02:24:02,501 --> 02:24:03,334
they're completely insane.
That kind of goes back to that like the 

3201
02:24:05,981 --> 02:24:08,810
average person is a flag in the wind 
that can go anyway.

3202
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,920
You know,
how ridiculous is it that like 200 years

3203
02:24:11,921 --> 02:24:12,754
ago,
if you tell people this lavery 

3204
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:16,960
overwhelming majority of people would be
like,

3205
02:24:16,961 --> 02:24:19,440
of course slavery school.
What's wrong with at it?

3206
02:24:19,570 --> 02:24:20,410
Kind of a free car.
You,

3207
02:24:20,411 --> 02:24:22,480
your anti slavery,
are you insane?

3208
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:24,260
And if you say today,
you know,

3209
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:28,600
you're going to have like 0.01% of the 
population would be cool with it.

3210
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:31,030
And,
and yet we're the same people,

3211
02:24:31,031 --> 02:24:31,864
200 years have gone by,
but suddenly what was completely normal 

3212
02:24:34,481 --> 02:24:37,210
at one point is considered batshit crazy
today.

3213
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:38,320
Yeah.
It is weird.

3214
02:24:38,650 --> 02:24:39,431
It's weird.
And it's,

3215
02:24:39,431 --> 02:24:41,120
and it's constantly changing,
you know,

3216
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:44,170
constantly evolving and it doesn't 
always need to make sense.

3217
02:24:44,171 --> 02:24:45,760
It just,
this is what's the new thing?

3218
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:46,603
Yeah.
This is the new way of being and you 

3219
02:24:48,341 --> 02:24:50,290
know,
there's always a small percentage of our

3220
02:24:50,291 --> 02:24:51,124
population that's not going to go along 
with the program that's going to be 

3221
02:24:53,111 --> 02:24:53,771
like,
no,

3222
02:24:53,771 --> 02:24:55,420
this is a stupid idea.
But,

3223
02:24:55,900 --> 02:25:00,430
but the average is just going to go 
wherever critical mass is steel team.

3224
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:03,010
They are going to go with it.
Yeah.

3225
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:04,540
Listen man,
I've got to wrap this up,

3226
02:25:04,541 --> 02:25:06,840
but uh,
always a beautiful thing to talk to you.

3227
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:07,683
My brother.
You'd go checkout Daniela [inaudible] 

3228
02:25:10,990 --> 02:25:11,823
podcast is called history on fire.
It's available on itunes and a year on 

3229
02:25:16,451 --> 02:25:20,170
all the social media things.
A deep allele on twitter,

3230
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:23,050
aud below on instagram as well.
Instagram,

3231
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,980
the only one I don't do.

3232
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:25,210
You don't do that at all?
No,

3233
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:29,440
they're on facebook.
So it's shallow assholes like me.

3234
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:31,750
All right.
Thank you brother.

3235
02:25:31,751 --> 02:25:32,350
Appreciate it,
