00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,311
Well,

3
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:07,090
why would I put my job on the line to
have an opinion about compelled pronouns?

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,583
I know why.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,870
Because the ability to speak your
truth is the bulwark against hell

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
and losing your job.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,070
That's nothing cuts,

8
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:25,630
nothing compared to where things
can go when they go badly.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,471
For me,

10
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,700
it was just preventative.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,580
It's like this isn't
going in a good direction.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,170
While should you take a risk?

13
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,120
It's like you don't have that choice.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,243
You're silent.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,300
That's a risk.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:37,991
Now,

17
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,390
most people don't understand
the risks of silence.

18
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,050
I happened to understand the risks of
scientists because I've been studying them

19
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,150
for 40 years.

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,660
Is it frustrating for you to get so
little support for these actions and for,

21
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,590
for your,

22
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:54,520
your protests?

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,631
Well,

24
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:58,960
I wouldn't say that that's what happened
and I don't mean so little support

25
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,910
because you get a lot of
support outside of the,

26
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,830
in the outside of the university.

27
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,851
It's okay.

28
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,590
It doesn't matter where
the support comes from.

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,120
Like I mean it's,

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,660
it's disappointing in the same way
that it's disappointing for me to say.

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,210
I think the universities
now do more harm than good.

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,680
That's disappointing.

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,873
But,

34
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,051
but it,

35
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:17,800
it doesn't,

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,450
it's not surprising to me.

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,760
It isn't as if intellectuals are
characterized by an intrinsic moral

38
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:25,541
superiority.

39
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:25,691
Oh,

40
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:26,351
they're smart.

41
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,450
So they will leap to the
defense of what's right.

42
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:28,781
It's like,

43
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:29,614
no,

44
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,240
there's no evidence for that.

45
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,290
And Intelligence and,

46
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,770
and moral wisdom aren't the same thing.

47
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,700
Like,

48
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,380
and if you're corrupt and smart,

49
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,990
all that makes you is
way more treacherous.

50
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,290
It doesn't make you less
likely to be corrupt.

51
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,560
It just makes you much more,

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
you're 50 snakes instead of two or
your 56 headed snakes instead of to,

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,370
like,

54
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,660
I've had clients who were,

55
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,410
who had very serious personality
disorders who are very intelligent.

56
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:59,830
It's like that's not necessarily
a good thing for them.

57
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,780
They're just better at arguing
for their pathology to themselves.

58
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,740
That is a real problem where
people automatically assume
that intelligent people

59
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:09,790
are going to be healthy.

60
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,501
Yeah.

61
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,720
Well they're healthy in
that often psychological,

62
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,620
better in the world,

63
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:14,891
you know,

64
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,280
because their skills are skills
are more marketable and so on.

65
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:21,850
But there's no evidence that there's any
relationship between intelligence and

66
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:22,684
morality.

67
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,740
I mean,

68
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,130
God,

69
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,090
let me tell you a story,

70
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:25,451
man.

71
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,770
One time I have this client,

72
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,660
this woman was just ruined.

73
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,460
She looked like a street person,

74
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:30,731
you know,

75
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:34,390
and she had very dirty clothes and
she was so shy that she couldn't even

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,111
approach you.

77
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,260
She had to shield her eyes from
you as if you were emitting light.

78
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,030
And she did that to
everyone on the street.

79
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:41,260
Like she was banned over and,

80
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,330
and,

81
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,720
and,

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,690
and humble like a,

83
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,270
like a Chinese peasant
brought before the emperor,

84
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,104
you know.

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,591
And,

86
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:48,424
uh,

87
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,760
one of the things I was doing with her
and behavior therapy was trying to just

88
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:56,200
get her to present herself in a more
normal manner so that people wouldn't shy

89
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,070
away from her and,

90
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,370
you know,

91
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,900
be instantly prejudice towards,

92
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,350
and,

93
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,300
and she'd come to the behavior
therapy clinic and she wasn't bright.

94
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,881
This woman,

95
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:07,330
she thinks she had only had
like a seventh grade education.

96
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,240
She was quite intellectually
impaired and she lived with her,

97
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,130
her sick aunt,

98
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,701
who was,

99
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,940
who was schizophrenia and who had like a,

100
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,090
uh,

101
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
say titanic possessed alcoholic boyfriend
that was always tormenting my client.

102
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,770
She lived in absolute hell,

103
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,030
but she had this dog and she used to take
it out and walk the dog all the time.

104
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,590
And then she,

105
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,130
she'd actually come to the behavior
therapy clinic partly because of her own

106
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,431
problem,

107
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,210
but,

108
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,720
but she'd come to this place called
the Douglas Hospital and she'd been an

109
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,670
inpatient in the Douglas
Hospital and in the,

110
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,020
in the Douglas Hospital,

111
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,010
there were these long term psychiatric
clients and they looked like something

112
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,590
out of a Hieronymus Bosch
painting or Dante's inferno.

113
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:47,831
I mean,

114
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,664
these people were,

115
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,340
this is way worse than one
flew over the cuckoo's nest.

116
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:55,000
These people were seriously destroyed
and they couldn't be let back out in the

117
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,980
streets during deinstitutionalization.

118
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,060
Like they were lifers.

119
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,000
And she had decided that part of
the reason she wanted to come to the

120
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,390
hospitalist because she
had been institutionalized
there and she thought that

121
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,380
maybe when she took
her dog out for a walk,

122
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,370
she could go and get one of those damn
inmates and take them out for a walk too.

123
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
Now that was a person who was moral,

124
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,770
dumb as a post,

125
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,320
just screwed in 50 different directions.

126
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,060
Nothing going for her.

127
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,280
And she had the bloody moral capacity to
decide that there was someone worse off

128
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:27,940
than her.

129
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,601
And believe me,

130
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,680
that wasn't easy to find.

131
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,540
And that maybe she could
do them some good if,

132
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,920
if the hospital would let her,

133
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,390
which they didn't by the way.

134
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,481
Yeah.

135
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:37,980
Well that's the story of the soul.

136
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:38,970
That's not the intellect,

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,833
that's for sure.

138
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,603
So,

139
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,980
so I didn't expect any support from my,

140
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,080
from my colleagues.

141
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,173
And,

142
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,931
and it isn't that,

143
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,070
I don't care if I got it,

144
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:50,510
but it's a,

145
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,260
it's in some sense it's irrelevant.

146
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,510
It's irrelevant to me because my goal was,

147
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,930
I'm not saying those goddamn pronouns.

148
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,420
And the reason I'm not saying them is
because they're made up by leftwing

149
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,940
ideologues and I don't
like left wing ideology.

150
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't like ediology period.

151
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,410
And I know where

152
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,580
corruption of speech leads
and I'm not going there.

153
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,871
And you know,

154
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,560
one of the things I tried to learn when
I was taking apart what happened in

155
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:27,670
Auschwitz and trying to put myself in
the position of an Auschwitz camp guard,

156
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,421
which by the way,

157
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:28,931
you can do,

158
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,550
if you use your imagination a bit,

159
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:34,540
I wouldn't call it exactly the world's
most pleasant meditative experience,

160
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,010
but you can call up parts of yourself
that would be capable of taking someone

161
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:44,011
who just got off a transport train and
having them carry a hundred pound sack of

162
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,500
wet salt from one side of the camp
compound to the other and back.

163
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,960
You can conjure that part
of yourself up if you want,

164
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,240
and that'll teach you something
about what you're like.

165
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,090
People don't do it because
it's too frightening,

166
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,250
but I know perfectly well I
could do that sort of thing.

167
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,520
And so once I learned that I could do
that sort of thing and maybe that I could

168
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,241
even enjoy it,

169
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,601
I thought,

170
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:02,931
okay,

171
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:03,261
fine,

172
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,040
I get it.

173
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,490
I'm going to see if I can figure out how
to live so that if that opportunity was

174
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,420
presented to me,

175
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,890
I wouldn't take it.

176
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,900
And I think that's the lesson that people
need to learn from the 20th century.

177
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,670
It's like that's what human beings did.

178
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,121
Okay.

179
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,050
While we're all human.

180
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,351
Okay,

181
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,110
so how is it that we should live
so that we don't do that again?

182
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,203
Well

183
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,390
part of that is to try to say the truth
no matter what because the alternative

184
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,970
is worse and it is worse.

185
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,580
The truth no matter what.

186
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,290
And that is the real problem that you
see with being forced into using these

187
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,370
made up pronouns.

188
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:41,911
Yeah,

189
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:42,601
absolutely.

190
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:46,590
It's my language all take
responsibility for what I say.

191
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,710
I am not saying your words and being
compelled to say your words by law.

192
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,033
Well that's that.

193
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,180
That that makes it,

194
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,340
that that takes it past the point of
absurdity to the point of tyranny in,

195
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,370
in my estimation.

196
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,010
And I've seen some criticisms
where people are saying,

197
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,810
you know he's talking about this,

198
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:06,720
but really he's grandstanding cause
no one's doing anything legally,

199
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
but the potential exists
that such rubbish.

200
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,280
But that is criminals.

201
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,581
Yes.

202
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,110
They wouldn't have
changed the damn criminal.

203
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,950
They put it in the hate speech
category and altered the criminal code.

204
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,070
It's as simple as that
and then you could say,

205
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:20,581
well no,

206
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:21,480
we didn't really mean it.

207
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:21,781
It's like,

208
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:22,561
Oh yeah you did.

209
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:26,100
You really meant it to have the social
justice warriors that have debated being

210
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,470
the last two months accused
me directly of hate speech.

211
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,370
All I had to do was poke them a tiny
bit and they came right out with it.

212
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,010
And then the university's legal team
reviewed everything I said carefully

213
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,860
believe me.

214
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,060
And they decided that,

215
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,223
oh,

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,060
it was not only illegal to not
use these compelled pronouns,

217
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:49,620
it was probably illegal to make a video
saying that I wouldn't use them because

218
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,650
otherwise why would they write me a
warning letter and tell me that I violated

219
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,170
university policy on the
Ontario Human Rights Act?

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,150
He did that lightly.

221
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
Have they acted on this at all?

222
00:07:58,741 --> 00:07:59,330
Is there,

223
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,120
they won't know.

224
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,260
Well they've acted in that.

225
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:05,180
They sent me two warning letters and
told me to stop talking and the don't.

226
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,630
The idea that I was going to be teaching
in January again cause I teach all my

227
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,580
undergraduate courses from January to May.

228
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,870
That was on the table.

229
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,420
And I think the only reason
that it hasn't happened,

230
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,850
one of the reasons it hasn't happened,

231
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,420
and I'm not attributing nothing
but malevolence to the university

232
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:22,111
administration,

233
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:25,500
cause obviously it's very complicated
and they did agree to host the debate for

234
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,334
example,

235
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,520
but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching
in January and still might not be is by

236
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,150
no means

237
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,980
that was a perfectly plausible outcome.

238
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,100
And had this not caused a firestorm,

239
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,280
much of which has
emerged in supportive me.

240
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,590
Then I would say there was a 50 50
chance that I would've had my teaching

241
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:50,670
privileges revoked,

242
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
tabbing to other professors.

243
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,420
So the idea that I'm making it,

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,580
I like that is a tempest in a teapot.

245
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,210
It's like,

246
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,451
yeah,

247
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:57,841
okay,

248
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,370
fine.

249
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,090
Why did you change the criminal code then?

250
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,940
And why did you put it
under the hate speech laws?

251
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,223
Exactly.

252
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,143
So no,

253
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,230
it doesn't wash.

254
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,350
And I did.

255
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,880
And the fundamental proof of that is the
university's response because for sure

256
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,130
there are legal team
crafted those letters.

257
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,920
You know what was like
recalcitrant employee,

258
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,970
you're responsible for them.

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,241
Okay.

260
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,040
What do you do with a
recalcitrant deployed?

261
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,520
You write them a letter telling them what
they're doing wrong and asking him to

262
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:25,940
stop.

263
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,810
Then if they don't stop,

264
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:29,150
you write them a second letter
that's more strongly worded.

265
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,320
Then if they don't stop,

266
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,790
you write them a third letter,

267
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,440
even more strongly worded.

268
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,300
Then you take disciplinary action.

269
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,470
That's like HR 101 that's how you do it.

270
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,280
So,

271
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,100
so here we said at the end of November,

272
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,730
uh,

273
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,900
closing on December,

274
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,950
you're literally a a bit more than a
month away and you don't know whether or

275
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,780
not you're teaching
your courses in January.

276
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,220
It seems highly probable
that I'll be teaching them.

277
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,930
I wouldn't say it's certain,

278
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,430
but if I'm teaching them,

279
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,670
it's because the cost of having me
not teach them would now be too high.

280
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,850
It's not because the university believes
that what I'm doing is either necessary

281
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:17,770
or acceptable.

282
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,400
If someone who's listening to this or
watching this feels compelled to act out

283
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:24,580
in your support,

284
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,480
how can they do that?

285
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,660
I think they could do the
future authoring exercise

286
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,250
and that that would be the
best way to act on your,

287
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,700
I'm dead serious about this.

288
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:39,340
It's like sort yourself out,

289
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,690
sort yourself out.

290
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,840
You're so you try to figure
out the world and the text.

291
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,380
That's the primary objective.

292
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:45,010
That's your,

293
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,740
that's your most important thing
that you can do yourself out.

294
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,900
Sort yourself out and,

295
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:53,710
and Marshall your arguments and put
yourself in order so that when someone

296
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,590
pushes you a little
farther than you should go,

297
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,270
you can say no,

298
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,650
and you know what's going on now.

299
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,050
Yep.
