And one of the cool
things that audible has,

12
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,870
if you're a junkie,

13
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,750
if you're into like technology like I am,

14
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,890
I'm a tech junkie.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,980
They have a thing called a whisper sync
and it works with the Amazon kindle

16
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:44,304
fire.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,470
And what it does is it's really bad ass.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,300
Say if you're reading books on the kindle
and a you like read a certain pegs and

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:51,930
you go to sleep,

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,181
you,

21
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:52,650
you cha,

22
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,200
you bookmark it and then
when you get in your car,

23
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,970
an audio version of that same
book plays really cool shit.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:00,721
So,

25
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:00,991
uh,

26
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,520
if you do a lot of traveling,

27
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,570
if you're stuck commuting,

28
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,404

29
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,650

it's an excellent company and
we've got some great books.

32
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,510
The one I'm a I'm listening slash
reading to them doing both is uh,

33
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,830
Christopher Ryans sex at dawn.

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,120
We're working on getting him here.

35
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,410
He's going to be in here in January.

36
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,060
Fascinating Dude who wrote a book
about primates and sex and very,

37
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,080
very interesting,

38
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:25,980
fascinating shit.

39
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,490
Speaking of primates and sex or
other sponsors on it.com that's,

40
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:29,911
Oh and,

41
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:30,744
and it,

42
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,340
what does that have to
do with primates and sex?

43
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,730
You're a primate and
ana.com will help your sex.

44
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,640
I've been using a lot of
on it products lately.

45
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,770
Honored satcoms going to
start selling boner pills.

46
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,530
I think really?

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,681
Well.

48
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,310
We're going to start selling some
sort of a testosterone booster now.

49
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,710
This is certain things that actually
work with your natural testosterone

50
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,544
boosting.

51
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:47,890
So

52
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,780
I've been trying,

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,240
I've been,

54
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,080
I've been testing all the ones that you
can buy at the convenience stores and my

55
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:56,530
new favorite one is like the super
sex pack or something like that.

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,340
And that comes with one magnum condom
and a pill for men and a pill for women

57
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:02,350
though I've never seen a woman pill.

58
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:05,210
So like I took it and the
the woman took it and she,

59
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,150
she said it worth it.

60
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,220
Kind of let's say,

61
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,901
what would that be?

62
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,640
That would make or have women?

63
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,530
Well that was an episode
of sex in the city.

64
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,341
It wasn't like,

65
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:12,690
uh,

66
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:12,920
they,

67
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,420
they was,

68
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,830
they were taking Viagra at the girls.

69
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,870
The girls were taking their,

70
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,150
yeah,

71
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,800
I think Viagara works on chicks too,

72
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,310
doesn't it?

73
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,150
They say so.

74
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,320
They say,

75
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,631
oh,

76
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:21,341
so check it out though.

77
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,360
It's great if it's only $7 and
you get two pills in if hadn't,

78
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,700
it's a crazy thing is,

79
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,310
is Viagara for seven bucks.

80
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,250
You could get Viagara you can get the
condom and you get it all the a bit,

81
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,581
you know,

82
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:33,700
it's the weird loopholes that
you're buying it as a six pack at a,

83
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,840
at a drug store.

84
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,450
I just use the oysters
cause that one zinc.

85

I just get a bucket of
them and stick my dick.

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,340
I don't know.

88
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,530
How does your Dick it
in the bucket correctly.

89
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,873
So fat,

90
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,733
it's a perfect fit.

91
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,480
Wow.

92
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,920

Thanks.

140
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,940
One of the funniest fucking
things I've overheard.

141
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,930
Do we have to restart the computer?

142
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,103
Know

143
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,163
why this is.

144
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,010
We have a,

145
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,843
a new setup.

146
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,503
That's why there's two,

147
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,620
two monkeys behind the boards now.

148
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:17,840
Well,

149
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,110
good experience.

150
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,710
[inaudible]

151
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,330
when we had bitches,

152
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,830
we're here.

153
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,191
All right.

154
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,540
Fuck the end of the world.

155
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,620
The Shit did not materialize
the Mayans or bust,

156
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,480
they will go down in history like the
y two k cock suckers that May 11th guy.

157
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,000
All these assholes that called the end.

158
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,900
Nope.

159
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,733
Sorry.

160
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,240
You got to continue suffering.

161
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,050
Stupid.

162
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,550
Continue being confused.

163
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,950
Continue living your life with no answers.

164
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,270
That is the answer.

165
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,130
The answer is there's no fucking answer.

166
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,050
You're supposed to be,

167
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:52,160
yeah.

168
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,820
Terrified.

169
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,001
Yeah.

170
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,730
Red Bed when you out when
you're back in your seat.

171
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,180
Search a wiki deaths.

172
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,080
2012.

173
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:03,170
See who died on 12 2112.

174
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,640
Then for them it was the,

175
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,451
Oh shit.

176
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,284
This is right.

177
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,620
Yeah.

178
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,320
For them.

179
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,110
Oh my chest is seizing up.

180
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:13,280
Maybe we were one of those in a parallel
continuum and in this life we somehow

181
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,760
or another got through and
that's the path we followed.

182
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,740
But maybe in another life we all did.

183
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,753
Maybe it's true.

184
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,661
Maybe it is.

185
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,190
Maybe the end of the world did happen.

186
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,820
Well we can't remember it because we
didn't really truly experience it because

187
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:29,060
we moved onto the next and now
we don't have to pay our taxes.

188
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,320
That would be the Shit,

189
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,920
Huh?

190
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,490
If you woke up one day and all of a
sudden the whole tax system and the whole

191
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:35,810
monetary system made sense.

192
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,070
It's like it had been fixed.

193
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,600
It's not fixed now.

194
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,171
Oh,

195
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,004
okay.

196
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,330
Wouldn't it be beautiful,

197
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,070
be nice.

198
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,510
You think with all these
smart motherfuckers we have
running this world that

199
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,420
that would be possible if you
let the right people control it,

200
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,800
you know?

201
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,633
Is that possible?

202
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,511
Sorry.

203
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:53,270
Please hold me doing getting
out cash to pay that guy.

204
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,223
You're a guy.

205
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,490
I shouldn't say that guy.

206
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,324
He's coming back.

207
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,140
No.

208
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,630
Oh,

209
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,110
don't worry about

210
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,151
it.

211
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:58,670
We got that.

212
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,100
Don't worry.

213
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,170
We got that dude.

214
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,330
We got to like a company stack of cash.

215
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,960
Don't worry about it.

216
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,250
What do you use dealing
you son of a bitch.

217
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,330
All right,

218
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,111
well you're so rich.

219
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,270
You probably forget to that 10 bucks.

220
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,690
I a shit load of money and he's telling
him gambling addict and he just ran over

221
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:18,500
here with cigarettes for me so he can
play more scratch tickets and he's hoping

222
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,420
you notice and Stan Hope.

223
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Good morning.

224
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,170
That's how you always look at it.

225
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
Did last night was awesome.

226
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,690
That was a one of the most fun
times I've ever had as a comedian.

227
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,360
I just wished we fucked
around with it a little more.

228
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,703
Yeah.

229
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,821
I don't know.

230
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,530
Like something goofy
like we're all together.

231
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,360
We should be doing
something goofy at the end.

232
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,260
Like the part may blue.

233
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,163
All our guys,

234
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,400
I tell stories or like
something that like didn't get,

235
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,680
makes it more than just how it,

236
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,970
here's three guys in a row.

237
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,533
But you,

238
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,710
we still around and took pictures
with everybody for hours.

239
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,140
I ever purposely didn't stand near you
cause they didn't want to create that.

240
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,591
No,

241
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,580
just you situation.

242
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,903
That's all ugly.

243
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,590
Yeah.

244
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:01,980
I just,

245
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,320
I just worked the lobby.

246
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,260
I Laughner well that's how it usually is.

247
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:09,500
We usually have like little packets of
people like Brian will have is a little

248
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,900
packet of people taking
pictures and Joey will have is,

249
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,940
but Joey will inevitably disappear back,

250
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,971
be right back.

251
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,870
Dog Vanish and he's always got some story.

252
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,810
I thought you were going
to meet me in the garage.

253
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,570
It's,

254
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,930
you are on the fucking highway.

255
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,920
Joey's the best vantage or ever cause
he just had to sub this is look at his

256
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:33,111
eyes.

257
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,370
He goes,

258
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,920
okay.

259
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,300
Salva Hesburgh was the best he would like.

260
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,990
He would disappear from
like a closed room.

261
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,850
I seal the,

262
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,780
and somehow hedbergs gone.

263
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,060
I remember we're in St cloud once,

264
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,510
we did a one nighter and
then we went to the bar.

265
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,820
We go to the 24 hour restaurant.

266
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,331
I go,

267
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,410
you get a booth,

268
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,550
it's a two in the morning.

269
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,331
And I said,

270
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,060
you get a booth and I'm just
going to use a pay phone.

271
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,110
This is how long ago was and not
call this girl that I had met.

272
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,070
And uh,

273
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,491
he goes,

274
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:01,821
okay.

275
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,510
And he goes in,

276
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,310
I look all over the restaurant.

277
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:04,551
I go,

278
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,870
as soon as he's in the men's room,

279
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
I get a menu.

280
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm sitting there waiting.

281
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,200
He had left cause he thought,

282
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,950
oh you said you would call it a girl man,

283
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,540
I don't want to be a third wheel

284
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,490
sitting around him fucking
restaurant for an hour waiting.

285
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,920
Well he was probably just psyched.

286
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,990
It was like perfect opportunity to go
do smack the priest smack day if we're

287
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,740
doing a one night or in St,

288
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,574
cloud together,

289
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,530
the smack days start.

290
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,453
Uh,

291
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,580
the first time he ever
mentioned it to me was,

292
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,590
well I knew you knew by his act he'd
have his jokes and then the asides he'd,

293
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,520
you know,

294
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,181
so he goes,

295
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,930
do you ever have something that is good
but then you do something better and it

296
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,100
ruins a good thing.

297
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,330
Like I you like to smoke pot and then
someone that's sprinkled some heroin in

298
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,280
your pot and a regular pots,

299
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,123
no good anymore.

300
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,390
And so I knew would

301
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,780
he didn't just write that.

302
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,060
See that's why I won't
smoke pot with strangers.

303
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,290
Some creepy ass holes,

304
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,190
sprinkle some heroin.

305
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,510
And cause he think he's being goofy.

306
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,860
And then boom,

307
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,521
Du,

308
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:05,791
Du,

309
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,031
Du,

310
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,470
Du,

311
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,950
Du,

312
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,460
Du,

313
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,920
Du,

314
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,161
Du,

315
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:08,580
Du,

316
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,120
Du.

317
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Did you ever had anything
that like addiction?

318
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,330
No.

319
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:14,860
No,

320
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,660
no.

321
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,130
Definitely.

322
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,963
Um,

323
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,670
I've never even touched anything
that I heard was addictive.

324
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:20,911
I mean,

325
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,780
alcohol is addictive,

326
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,000
but it seems to be addictive
for certain people only,

327
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,930
you know,

328
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,160
for me it's not at all.

329
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,890
But I've seen people that,

330
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:28,160
you know,

331
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
one drink in there,

332
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,670
they're gone.

333
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,740
They just don't switch goes
off and they're fucked.

334
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,360
But that seems to be very,

335
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,350
very variable.

336
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,950
But,

337
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,340
um,

338
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,510
like heroin,

339
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,370
never thought about it.

340
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,760
Coke never thought that anything.

341
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,231
And fet,

342
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:39,690
amines,

343
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,520
all that shit never appealed to me.

344
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,950
Just anything that where you go,

345
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,521
oh shit,

346
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,290
I couldn't live without that.

347
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,920
He's like sugar or no,

348
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,880
no,

349
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,713
I would,

350
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,291
I mean,

351
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,160
staples of life,

352
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,000
water and food.

353
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:51,834
Other than that,

354
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,150
I could live without almost everything,

355
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,030
you know?

356
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,470
Yeah.

357
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,681
Yeah.

358
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,010
I mean,

359
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,130
I think that's a weird connection that
people have to like certain things,

360
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,810
whether it's sugar or coffee or,

361
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,170
you know,

362
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,010
cigarettes are,

363
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,930
this is weird connections
that people have.

364
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:08,931
They like seek normalcy and repetitive
things and reoccurring themes in their

365
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,510
life and they just get connected to it.

366
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,170
There's people that will lose their
fucking mind if a bar they'd go to closes

367
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:16,980
down,

368
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,060
they'll lose their fucking mind.

369
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,200
Like it's the end of the world.

370
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,640
They don't know what the fuck to do.

371
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,500
The bars go in and if I still lived here,

372
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,380
I'd be like that about
the coach and coach.

373
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,570
So sad and I sick.

374
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,230
That place is fucking classic
because that place was a vortex to,

375
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,520
that's the place where Callan was out
in the front of the coach and horses and

376
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:39,690
he ran into an ex girlfriend that he
had who had turned into a streetwalker.

377
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,883
Wow.

378
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,230
That was deep.

379
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,270
I asked fucking deep.

380
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,320
I had that happen.

381
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,730
Uh Oh God,

382
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,451
what was his name?

383
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,890
There's Josh something.

384
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:54,660
It was a comic and it was playing Vegas
and I'd say five or six in the morning

385
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:55,230
now,

386
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,280
and there's a hooker at the bar and she,

387
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,410
she says,

388
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,360
do you want me to go up
to your room and danced?

389
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,373
And he says,

390
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:01,791
well,

391
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,140
what did he,

392
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,971
what are you going to do?

393
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:03,450
I mean,

394
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,620
are you going to dance?

395
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,050
I'm not prepaying you
that much money to dance.

396
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:07,740
What?

397
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,573
And she goes,

398
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:08,941
well,

399
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,900
are you a cop?

400
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,711
And he goes,

401
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:10,951
no,

402
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:11,641
I'm a comic.

403
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,001
She goes,

404
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:12,271
really?

405
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:12,901
Do you know Doug?

406
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,780
Stan hope that's a good girl.

407
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,460
And the ex old friend of mine,

408
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,294
his ex wife,

409
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,070
who I and I ended up banging after
they broke up once it was horrible.

410
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,870
And that hooker,

411
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,100
wow.

412
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,070
I was reading a story about
a woman who was an Olympian.

413
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,260
She was a two time Olympian,

414
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,950
I think for track and field.

415
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,400
And she was 40 years old and she
just decided to become a hook.

416
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,250
Suzy favor Hamilton.

417
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,941
Is that an area?

418
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:39,481
That's her name.

419
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,850
She's like a gold metal.

420
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,660
I guess she was a big deal on
the 2000 Olympics and now she's,

421
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,930
she was apparently,

422
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,540
I think they're trying to say
that it's antidepressants.

423
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,650
The turned her into a hooker.

424
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,130
She say she blamed

425
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,671
depression.

426
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,040
I don't know if she blamed
the actual medication.

427
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,450
Uh,

428
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,400
I think she was saying that the,

429
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:00,730
uh,

430
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,560
I think people were blaming Zoloft.

431
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,210
See,

432
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,740
I'm going to switch these headphones.

433
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,630
Did you ever hear that song from Weans
Zoloft as long it sounds like you're on

434
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,050
Zoloft when you're listening to it.

435
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,210
I feel like,

436
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,610
uh,

437
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,400
it's like very dreamy and the fork
I think if I remember really well.

438
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,210
I mean if you put it up
your bike well isn't that,

439
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,830
isn't that the thing about
it as it's supposed to get?

440
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,730
It's supposed to like relieve you
of any of the worries of life.

441
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,380
Like it takes all that shit away.

442
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,000
I got really anxious.

443
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:31,151
I,

444
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,590
I wasn't prescribed it,

445
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,160
but my dad was and what he died,

446
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:36,340
I,

447
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,150
I started taking them and
I just got a vague anxiety.

448
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,470
It gives you an anxiety if
you don't need a medication,

449
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,010
you don't know what it,

450
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,020
yeah.

451
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,840
She took Zoloft and once
you started taking Zoloft,

452
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,220
that allowed her to,

453
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:51,880
uh,

454
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,670
pursue Zoloft is the new Spanish fly.

455
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,501
Well,

456
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:56,741
you know,

457
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:01,741
that was the thing with McAfee and
believes what he was supposedly doing it.

458
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,780
He claims that it was all a ruse and
that it was all like he's a prankster and

459
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:11,350
he wasn't really cooking up bath salts
and he didn't really have a forum name

460
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,300
even though he had a formed
and it wasn't even his name.

461
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,380
It was like a,

462
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,730
I forget the stuff monger or something
like that was the the forum name,

463
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,140
so it wasn't like he was John
McAfee reporting live from beliefs.

464
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,380
It was just some dude wrote incredibly
detailed articles on extractions of m

465
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,030
DPV,

466
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,690
which apparently makes
people super duper sexual.

467
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,700
I read some stuff after I talked to you.

468
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,950
I haven't listened to the
podcast with them yet,

469
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,760
but I read a couple of
articles talking about it.

470
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,593
Did you get those the,

471
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,391
I sent you the links,

472
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:43,660
right?

473
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100
Did I send you links
that you sent me legs,

474
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,090
but I haven't had time yet.

475
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,103
He's ridiculous.

476
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,670
I mean it's really a hilarious,

477
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,570
hilarious story,

478
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,620
but this MDPV apparently just makes me
want to scratch your dick off and makes

479
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:58,621
you just completely like just a
little crazed rabid fuck monkey.

480
00:13:59,141 --> 00:13:59,621
Apparently.

481
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,160
It's just,

482
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
it's a constant thing while you're on it.

483
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,100
Even if you're not horny anymore,

484
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,450
you're like rubbing your dick raw.

485
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,471
I got him.

486
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,220
Get it.

487
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,490
Well,

488
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:06,670
yeah,

489
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:06,880
no,

490
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,280
I've done that with a lot of a lot
of drugs that do that to stimulants.

491
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:10,630
Yeah.

492
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:10,960
Yeah,

493
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,471
I've heard that.

494
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,480
I've heard with some
people like smoking crack,

495
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,790
like my friend Johnny
who had a crack problem,

496
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,230
he say,

497
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,400
I just like to smoke
crack and go beat off.

498
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,860
This was back in the day
when they had peep shows,

499
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,370
like he would go to a,

500
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,650
this was like times square,

501
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:27,160
like when it was really time square and
he would go down to the Pete booths when

502
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:30,100
he was smoking crack and he would just
stay in one of those things and keep

503
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:34,360
putting dollars in feeding dollars and
the thing and smoking crack and the girl

504
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,860
and he would beat off
and the growing like,

505
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,460
you know,

506
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,200
finger herself in front of him and shit.

507
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,500
I used to do that all in my youth.

508
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,460
Very dark.

509
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,750
Not The crack smoking,

510
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,141
but yeah,

511
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,090
go to s smudge shops and jerk off.

512
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,680
They'll want the sex world in Minneapolis
would have the live girls in the booth

513
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,421
and he'd in there.

514
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:52,170
What do you do to them?

515
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,003
You ask them.

516
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,590
They're sitting there on a bed or Dildos,

517
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,070
oh thing.

518
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,371
Whatever.

519
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,204
You're like,

520
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,460
I went to the lusty lady in
Seattle once with Dave Fulton.

521
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,930
I did a Gig and we want
to just go for that.

522
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,211
All right,

523
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:10,170
let's go in here and goof off and then
I'll sneak in what both and jerk off and

524
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:14,640
we ran into James in and randomly Edwin.

525
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,540
That's funny.

526
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,440
Is He?

527
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,610
He's not from Minneapolis,

528
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:17,851
right?

529
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,640
Where's he from?

530
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,230
He's,

531
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,063
he comes to Sydney.

532
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,700
He was in,

533
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,690
that was Seattle,

534
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,940
but he's back in Kansas City now.

535
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,590
He's a fucking insane person.

536
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,150
Kansas City is a fun town.

537
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,860
I haven't been in that
place in a long time.

538
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,700
I got to get back there.

539
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,623
That's a fun place.

540
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,600
I had a lot of fun there.

541
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,570
It says something about,

542
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,950
I think that's where I get herpes.

543
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,990
Pretty sure there's some weird
chick that looked like Ooma Thurman

544
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,913
therapies.

545
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,110
Extra long toes freak pitcher.

546
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,541
Too much.

547
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,280
Your actual own toes and your herpes.

548
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,633
Yeah.

549
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,170
People from Kansas City.

550
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,330
It's like Kansas City
is like a humble town,

551
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,661
you know,

552
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:55,950
they can't really brag too much.

553
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:56,850
That's Kansas City,

554
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:57,031
you know,

555
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:57,811
it's not New York.

556
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:58,710
It's not Chicago.

557
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,030
There's no debate anymore.

558
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:00,870
It's just Kansas City.

559
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:01,440
It's all good.

560
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
You can kind of judge it town by the,

561
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,020
uh,

562
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,501
by the,

563
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,120
uh,

564
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,510
they're,

565
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,140
they're sports fans.

566
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,191
Like yeah,

567
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,300
they have shitty teams,

568
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,450
but they still support him
like Chicago in the bears,

569
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:12,780
right?

570
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,730
Or Chicago and the,

571
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:13,971
the,

572
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,370
the,

573
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,840
the white sox for the longest time.

574
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,620
But they've had some winning teams.

575
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:18,301
They're kind of Dicks,

576
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,420
but green bay years of futility.

577
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,630
But that stadium was sold out every
time and they're the happiest,

578
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:25,530
nicest people.

579
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,530
You're not going to get a lot
of stories out of green bay.

580
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,860
You're not going to get herpes in Greenbay
isn't that a funny thing about the

581
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:32,431
Midwest?

582
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,490
Like how fucking nice a lot
of the people are there.

583
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:34,801
I mean,

584
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,090
obviously it's a generalization,

585
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:40,220
but I think the overall tone of the people
just seems to be really fucking Nice.

586
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,190
Minnesota was calling
Douche bags everywhere.

587
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:44,821
People will tell,

588
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:45,654
you know,

589
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
tell people about some
somewhere being nice and like,

590
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,911
oh,

591
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,950
I went there and some guard punch from
your folk and foods and that can happen

592
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,010
anywhere as probably you could be you
and that should can happen anywhere.

593
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:57,950
You'll get always run into random people.

594
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:58,784
You can't like judge it

595
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,270
town based on one or two
incidences that you have you,

596
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,200
but your overall sense like when
you're in places like Wisconsin,

597
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,610
they're fucking nicest shit.

598
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,050
They're super nice.

599
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,161
Like everywhere you go,

600
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,890
people like really
reasonable down to earth.

601
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,300
Easy to talk to.

602
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,590
Yeah.

603
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,070
It's better.

604
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,560
It's better than being in New York,

605
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,980
being all fucking please be yourself.

606
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,790
Yeah.

607
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,031
You know,

608
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:20,864
I'm going a Yorker,

609
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,531
I'm a New Yorker,

610
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:21,950
you know,

611
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,840
nothing phases me.

612
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,020
How many yonker that is the one of the
grossest statements ever that I'm a New

613
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,651
Yorker.

614
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:28,550
I've seen it all.

615
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm in New York or nothing.

616
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,494
Phases me.

617
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,010
Shot it.

618
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,321
Yeah.

619
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:33,770
The Hurricane Sandy was dye.

620
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,730
There was a lot of shot
and Freud and that.

621
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
The two weeks.

622
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,150
This is New York City in the world.

623
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:43,620
We shouldn't have power.

624
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,083
Yeah.

625
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,923
No,

626
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,921
it doesn't work that way.

627
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:47,750
Stupid.

628
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,170
It's just another fucking city.

629
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,100
It just

630
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,560
so happens that it's a really famous one.

631
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,240
But all the rules of cities apply.

632
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,370
And when cities get
fucking drowned in water,

633
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,850
it takes a long time to turn ship
back on and dry everything off.

634
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,590
Crazy fucks.

635
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,700
That place is going to go if that
happens again and again and again,

636
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,840
which had very well good.

637
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,990
And we had this guy on who's
talking about climate change.

638
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,950
Who was uh,

639
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,390
was it Shane Smith and
it was telling us this,

640
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,171
I think it was Shane Smith,

641
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:17,370
cause he's usually pretty doom
and gloom and my backpack.

642
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,630
Can you get me a stir in the front pack?

643
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,060
Um,

644
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,230
he was telling us that these,

645
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,240
these hundred year storms like Sandy,

646
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,601
he goes,

647
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,890
they're going to happen
three times a year.

648
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,120
Like that's,

649
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,650
that's the reality of climate change.

650
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,311
Three times a year.

651
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:34,311
You're gonna have hurricane Sandy's fuck
the east coast farm in the desert baby.

652
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,131
Yeah.

653
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,780
That's the way you're in a good spot.

654
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,060
You'll probably be tropical
in the next hundred years.

655
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:41,900
So you'll probably be in
a fucking rain forest.

656
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,421
Yeah.

657
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:42,770
What else?

658
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,111
What am I,

659
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,340
145.

660
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,980
I don't think that day's Kevin.

661
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,930
It's going to be really hot.

662
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,371
You never know,

663
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:47,551
man.

664
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,070
They might find some plant in the
Amazon that keeps you alive forever.

665
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,510
And then next thing you know,

666
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:52,350
global warming,

667
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,640
overpopulation,

668
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,880
Bisbee is the shit cause the move.

669
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,040
How often do you take shots into Maaco?

670
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,701
Uh,

671
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,350
almost never know,

672
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,610
but it's seven miles away,

673
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:03,060
right?

674
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,271
Yeah.

675
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:03,611
But the,

676
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:05,970
the town on the other side
is like nothing there.

677
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,230
The only reason you ever go over to that
town is to get prescription drugs and

678
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,064
they don't have a,

679
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,150
they have Xanax.

680
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,113
So that's it.

681
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,541
If I,

682
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:13,751
yeah,

683
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,610
if I needed Xanax or Viagara,

684
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:16,990
that would be the reason I went to,

685
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,430
and I have a script for it now.

686
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:21,970
So now when you do that and you
go over there and you get it,

687
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:23,110
how hard is it to bring it back?

688
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,570
You can bring up to,

689
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,520
they'll allow you to bring up to 30 pills,

690
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,063
uh,

691
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,430
across,

692
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,870
and sometimes they'll give you shit,

693
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,081
like,

694
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:32,531
do you need it?

695
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:32,741
You know,

696
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,000
you need a prescription for this.

697
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:34,301
And you go,

698
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:34,510
oh,

699
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,343
I have one.

700
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,230
And at one time I brought
my prescription bottle,

701
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:39,340
which had expired and I go,

702
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:39,491
yeah,

703
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:40,121
I got it right here.

704
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:40,481
And he goes,

705
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,291
this is expired.

706
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,220
You know you have,

707
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,210
but I know their policy is 30 pills
of any type of pill you can bring.

708
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,631
You know,

709
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,180
you can buy five different types of pills,

710
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,150
but as long as there's no
more than 30 they let you go.

711
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,020
So the guy's trying to
give me attitude and I,

712
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,390
but I know that I go,

713
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,280
so are you saying I
can't take these across?

714
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,450
I didn't say that.

715
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,763
All right.

716
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,540
So,

717
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,250
but normally you don't have any problems,

718
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:03,880
but I haven't

719
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,290
prescription now and I don't take them
often enough that I have to go get the

720
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,130
fake

721
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,960
refill across the board of the unnecessary
asshole security slash cop guy.

722
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,040
That is a really good

723
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,050
fortunate and aspect of our society.

724
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,670
The unnecessary asshole.

725
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,511
When you just like,

726
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,440
we could just talk,

727
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:21,580
everything can be fine.

728
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:21,881
You know,

729
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,230
you could just tell me what I,

730
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,420
what I can and can't do.

731
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,790
Well that's a,

732
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,900
that's the society we live it.

733
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:31,380
Look it up like kitchen
nightmares or bar rescue,

734
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,400
but it shows where,

735
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,791
okay,

736
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,790
if you want to help the guy
fixed his restaurant or bar,

737
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,380
you could just do it normally,

738
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,450
but no one's gonna Watch.

739
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:40,500
So you have to be a fucking dildo.

740
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,680
You've gotta be raided.

741
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,430
Yeah.

742
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,860
I have to be Gordon Ramsay,

743
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:45,540
Simon Style and asshole.

744
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,070
She has to get to watch cause

745
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,240
otherwise who'd care?

746
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,701
Yeah.

747
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:50,534
Isn't that funny?

748
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:50,960
What a,

749
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,730
what a weird aspect of society.

750
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:53,330
The uh,

751
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,141
the Douche bag,

752
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:57,680
the thinks he's allowed to
be a Douche bag because a,

753
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:57,951
you know,

754
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:02,480
he's being real or it's a part of the
job that we're fucking toughen up or this

755
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,460
and this is America.

756
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:03,750
There's no,

757
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,570
it's just where we have to keep you safe.

758
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,960
I need to know what
you're bringing across.

759
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,170
We have rules.

760
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,360
Those Xanax could kill babies
for baby ate all of those Xanax

761
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,750
fucking officer country
mcfuck face Douche bags,

762
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,670
but not all of them.

763
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:23,361
That's the problem.

764
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:24,010
So cool.

765
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,400
The clanking of my ice,

766
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,360
just in my head.

767
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,650
No,

768
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,440
it's beautiful.

769
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,800
All right,

770
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,191
sounds good.

771
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,024
Beautiful.

772
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,800
Sounds romantic.

773
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,633
No carrot.

774
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:32,200
Let's,

775
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,033
you know,

776
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Brian had a podcast.

777
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,660
Some chick insists on eating carrots.

778
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,560
Eliza slash that nothing
makes me more rage.

779
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,801
Well,

780
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:46,050
she had a little dog with her
little dog in her lab bench.

781
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,370
He used to fuck you proper.

782
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,530
Let's set you straight.

783
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,630
Not that I really believe that,

784
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,650
man.

785
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,470
I think that's cool.

786
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,110
I think last night's buzz
is hitting back in now.

787
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,820
I feel pretty fucked up right now.

788
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,550
I bet.

789
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:01,881
Yeah.

790
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:02,631
Last night was fun,

791
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:02,900
man.

792
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,291
That was,

793
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:03,710
uh,

794
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,160
that,

795
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,270
that whole show.

796
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,781
First of all,

797
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:08,840
it was an interesting
twist having honey honey,

798
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,520
having a band opened for us.

799
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,780
It made the whole thing feel like a
totally different sort of experience,

800
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,550
you know?

801
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,070
So that worked well because it is,

802
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,330
I know most times when he
mixed music with comedy,

803
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,940
it always seems to be annoying.

804
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,341
But yeah,

805
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,120
but you know,

806
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,600
oh,

807
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,950
something that we were,

808
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,930
we were talking about last night,

809
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:30,931
me and Eddie were like that with some
shows and some crowds that might be the

810
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:31,961
case.

811
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:32,830
Like you might not,

812
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,290
it might not mix to have music.

813
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,640
I've traveled with a couple of guys,

814
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:40,930
Miss Michigan Shambala who I fucking
love and he's a Solo Act Guitar and a lot

815
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,270
of songs have fit my crowd drinking,

816
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,230
you know,

817
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,063
hardcore,

818
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,063
uh,

819
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,600
almost like boot Koski s songs and uh,

820
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,120
the Matt Boyd who is just
as weird guy from Finland,

821
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,560
that was really crazy,

822
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:55,330
but it didn't work.

823
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,330
Touring like,

824
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,950
all right,

825
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,420
one night last night was perfect because
it was a hyped show that everyone's

826
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:01,601
there,

827
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,710
they know what's going on,

828
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:04,900
they know that it's going
to be music and comedy,

829
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,070
but when we were touring show
up in whatever Fuck Ville,

830
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,840
Tennessee and they're like,

831
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,580
that guy's not funny.

832
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,740
He's not supposed to be funny.

833
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,700
It's music.

834
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,740
Some people,

835
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,220
yeah,

836
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,520
it hasn't been promoted enough
that you know what to expect.

837
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,430
Yeah.

838
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,690
As long as it's good.

839
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,630
I mean some people would
just so fucking tight minded.

840
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,480
They're so closed minded when it comes
to what they want to see and what they

841
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:30,314
don't want to see.

842
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,880
But it's what they're trained to expect.

843
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:33,631
Exactly too.

844
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:37,170
So like when Michigan would have
songs that are vaguely funny,

845
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,310
then they think he's,

846
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,641
you know,

847
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,590
supposed to be Henry
Phillips and they're like,

848
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,610
well,

849
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,421
he's not supposed to.

850
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,790
If it happens to be funny in the song,

851
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,624
that's part of it,

852
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,220
but it's

853
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,090
not his job.

854
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,583
But you can't,

855
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,490
like you're the only one you trust to
go out and tell the audience and as the

856
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,200
headline or you can open up and go,

857
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,711
okay,

858
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm going to open the show and
then closed the show later on.

859
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,290
But I have to explain to you fucking
nitwits what's about to happen.

860
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,880
Yeah,

861
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,440
well the crowds that we,

862
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:03,711
uh,

863
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:04,371
attract though,

864
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,860
that doesn't seem to be a problem at all.

865
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,070
Like,

866
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,410
um,

867
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,250
this last night,

868
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,470
obviously it was a hype show
and it was sort of a big event.

869
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,560
So I don't know if it's indicative
of how to work every time,

870
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,041
but it's,

871
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,330
it seemed to be so smooth.

872
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,580
A theater show is different than the
shit I was doing where playing some goofy

873
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,740
rock and roll bars out of a van.

874
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah,

875
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,030
dude,

876
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,220
there's good things and bad
things about theater shows.

877
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,210
It was really interesting.

878
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,500
We did a show a Thursday
night at the Improv and a,

879
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,950
these people came up to me and they said,

880
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,840
this is the first time they'd
seen me in a comedy club.

881
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,300
They only see me and they saw me in
Austin and they sent me somewhere else.

882
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,230
I think I've only seen in
these big places like the,

883
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,851
the guy was like,

884
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,500
it's way better in a small place.

885
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,741
Oh,

886
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:40,101
it's all.

887
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:40,540
Yeah,

888
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,530
it really is the money.

889
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,850
We're all the same that I do.

890
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,410
I do 75 seaters.

891
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,101
Really?

892
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:50,390
75 you think that fucking Velveeta
Room in Austin like I would love,

893
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,990
is that 70 how many
think it's 65 70 people.

894
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,800
Wow.

895
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,160
But it's so close and intimate and you,

896
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:57,860
it's,

897
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,500
it's like,

898
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,880
it's,

899
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,400
you feel like the life of
the party rather than a paid,

900
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,593
you know,

901
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,030
this something.

902
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,390
But there's the other side of it is
there's something crazy about doing,

903
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,010
like it's a different sort of a show,

904
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,000
but when you do a crowd like last
night where it's whatever it is,

905
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:16,850
2000 screaming fucking
people going bananas.

906
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,410
There's something about that too,

907
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,780
like when you're brushing felt so removed,

908
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,210
like you couldn't see
anybody even leaning in.

909
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,190
It was hard to see a face.

910
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,590
It's certainly a different experience.

911
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,390
It's definitely the big,

912
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,620
the big theaters are way different
experience we had in the UK.

913
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:34,910
We were doing all theaters,

914
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:35,481
most of them.

915
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,100
We had no business playing.

916
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,710
We're not going to sell out a 2000
seat or in Sunderland Ingo but someone

917
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,400
thought it was a great idea but,

918
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,820
but a few of them like Wolverhampton,

919
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,980
it's still my favorite city in the UK.

920
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,990
Go Wolverhampton Wolves.

921
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,711
Yes.

922
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:52,371
That's my team.

923
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:53,690
Just because the show is so great.

924
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:54,130
We,

925
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,490
it was like a small like Beatles thing
getting from the back door into the van

926
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,450
where they're like slapping on
the side of the van afterwards.

927
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,810
This is crazy.

928
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,680
Wow.

929
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,060
Yeah.

930
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,510
Great.

931
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,091
Hampton.

932
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,050
Wolverhampton.

933
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,680
Wow.

934
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,810
And we knew it was going to
be great cause everyone goes,

935
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
oh you're going to Wolverhampton.

936
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,481
Oh good luck.

937
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,314
They're there for,

938
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,410
that's what I was going to be our place.

939
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,761
If you hate it.

940
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,830
We like it isn't funny.

941
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:21,920
Look that fucking Detroit
is always great shows.

942
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,840
And everyone's like,

943
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,710
it's got such a bad rep,

944
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:26,270
but if fucking grade his fans,

945
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,550
he pulled this one thing
though that people do.

946
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,630
There's something they love about being
in a giant group of people experiencing

947
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:33,860
the same thing at the same time.

948
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,030
Like if you go to see a band,

949
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,020
you know,

950
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,510
I've seen bands and intimate
settings and it's pretty bad ass,

951
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:40,880
but I've also seen him in front of
thousands of people and there's something

952
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,200
like,

953
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,630
yeah,

954
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,560
crazy trick about that,

955
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:43,940
you know?

956
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,773
Yeah.

957
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,210
It's,

958
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,070
it's just,

959
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,370
it's good to have him bolt.

960
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,450
It's good to have the same,

961
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:48,901
you know,

962
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,550
it's good to have big,

963
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,510
giant crazy crowds,

964
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,030
but it's also good to just
show up someplace and do a,

965
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,601
you know,

966
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,330
a 1:00 AM spot of the stolen.

967
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,530
It's nice when you can go
out afterwards and you know,

968
00:26:58,531 --> 00:26:59,580
take a lot of pictures,

969
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:04,320
but you spent probably twice as long
taking pictures as you did on stage.

970
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,531
Yeah,

971
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:04,831
probably.

972
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,030
That's almost impossible when you said,

973
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:07,020
we're going out front.

974
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:07,291
I'm like,

975
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,220
you're fucking kidding me.

976
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,310
You're going to go shakes is 1700 hands.

977
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,180
I don't even know what the,

978
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,050
I figure if they want to wait
in line and they paid to see me,

979
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,400
I'll fucking no hanging out.

980
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,870
I'm not going to,

981
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,211
I never,

982
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:20,100
I never thought to do the makeup,

983
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,810
a line situation.

984
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,990
I just go out into absolute
chaos after a show.

985
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,460
Even I was like 300 people.

986
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,661
But I like,

987
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:30,690
it's just so it's everyone like
can I get a picture of this way?

988
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,200
Like I don't know what
camera I'm looking at.

989
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,063
Yeah,

990
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,000
well that was how I always did it.

991
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,020
But live nation just took
over and started making lines.

992
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,741
That's what it was.

993
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:43,110
Cause I would just go out and
they would go care you got,

994
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,580
you're going to go out and do that again.

995
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,371
And then I'd go,

996
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:45,631
yeah,

997
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,201
probably.

998
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:46,531
And they're like,

999
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:46,771
okay,

1000
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:47,050
let me,

1001
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:47,311
let's,

1002
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,960
can we set up a line and said okay,

1003
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:49,830
go ahead and set up a line.

1004
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,400
And they usually have that one guy that
knows how to use every single on camera.

1005
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,263
It was like

1006
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,990
that's a problem as people
in their fucking droid.

1007
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:59,760
So they have no idea how to use them.

1008
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,620
But what's the give a droid to someone
who's never used a droid and they look at

1009
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,990
that shit and like warthog
which one's the can't?

1010
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:07,301
What's that?

1011
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:10,230
Cause they can have the exact
same icons and exact same place.

1012
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,960
So like the camera buttons bigger
and it's on the lefthand side.

1013
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:14,131
You're like,

1014
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,060
what the fuck is this?

1015
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,860
Where's the flash and the flash here?

1016
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,030
I still do that.

1017
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,650
Just trying to dial my phone.

1018
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,521
Which one?

1019
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:23,340
Contacts or droid,

1020
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,174
is that what that is?

1021
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,220
That's a,

1022
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,610
that's the big screen one
yesterday for online man.

1023
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:29,791
No,

1024
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,480
I think he's got a,

1025
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,313
what is that?

1026
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,270
Which one is the razor?

1027
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,500
It was the biggest one song.

1028
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,413
That's the last three.

1029
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,660
And I still like,

1030
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,250
that's the biggest one I could get.

1031
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:46,251
And I only get it because I was forced
into what world where I have to text and

1032
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,240
it's still not big enough for my thumbs.

1033
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:52,800
I is a typo in every fucking
word because my thumbs are fat.

1034
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,850
How long you've been doing it?

1035
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,290
I've had this like,

1036
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:55,860
uh,

1037
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,550
about a year.

1038
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,960
So you're so behold over here.

1039
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,380
Brian and I had been typing in those
fucking things for years and years and

1040
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:01,651
years.

1041
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,840
So we're like [inaudible]
we just get used to it.

1042
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,800
Know while you're driving.

1043
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,913
No,

1044
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,753
no,

1045
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,300
I don't.

1046
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,300
I don't fuck with my phone while I'm
driving and you should need law here.

1047
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,770
It should be a law.

1048
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,280
Don't fucking text while you're driving,

1049
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,051
not texting,

1050
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,310
just talking on the phone.

1051
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,800
Even that these fucking
people cover half their face.

1052
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,150
Get a little plugs,

1053
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:21,721
stick in your ear.

1054
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:22,554
Stupid.

1055
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,760
These people are ridiculous.

1056
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,270
They were like holding their
left hand up to their window,

1057
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:31,110
their car window and driving and they
literally can't see the whole left side.

1058
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,760
I believe it's been proven that it's
not the actual holding the phone that

1059
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:36,850
causes the accident.

1060
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,540
It's because you're paying
attention to the conversation.

1061
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,220
So the fucking ear piece,

1062
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,090
it's all bullshit.

1063
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,571
It is.

1064
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:43,620
But you,

1065
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:46,980
you are in a disadvantage if you can only
hold the steering wheel with one hand,

1066
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,750
if that's the only way you can do it.

1067
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:50,400
And if you're holding
a phone up to your ear,

1068
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:50,680
it's not.

1069
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,460
You mean you have to throw the phone
down and grab that takes too much time.

1070
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,820
All right.

1071
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,460
That's the fact.

1072
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,751
It's too,

1073
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,370
it's not safe and it's one thing.

1074
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:57,240
You're holding a drink.

1075
00:29:57,241 --> 00:29:58,980
If I'm holding a coffee
and I see an accident,

1076
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,320
I'll let that fucking coffee going.

1077
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,550
You're not going to throw your
phone down and grabbed this.

1078
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,440
That's why I walk everywhere.

1079
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,330
That my announcement.

1080
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,243
No sentence.

1081
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,970
Maybe you wouldn't drop
your coffee either.

1082
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:09,990
You'd probably just crash.

1083
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,330
Make any sense at all.

1084
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,150
Probably

1085
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,040
easier to drop your phone.

1086
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,980
Terrific.

1087
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,900
Studies with Doug and Joe will be back
after we're going to go start an accident

1088
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,310
with coffee and a phone.

1089
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,960
I just one thing of all and someone
out there do this because I have the,

1090
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,390
I have all these great ideas that
are going to die in my brain,

1091
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,420
but someone go out and take an 80
year old sober guy on a course,

1092
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,150
you know,

1093
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,983
obstacle,

1094
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,861
obstacle course,

1095
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:40,720
but a driving course and put
them next to a spry 25 year old,

1096
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,470
uh,

1097
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,570
twice the legal driving limit.

1098
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:44,860
Yeah.

1099
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,020
And See who drives better on a

1100
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,580
and a controlled.

1101
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,870
Yeah.

1102
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,703
It's a good idea.

1103
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,540
I love that that youtube clip would get
a lot of fucking hits and a lot of lot

1104
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,351
of controversy.

1105
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:00,640
So real problem with us allowing old
people to continue to drive like well,

1106
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:00,911
well,

1107
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,990
well into dementia,

1108
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,560
you know,

1109
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,161
cause there's no,

1110
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,550
no one gets in there and stops him.

1111
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:07,160
And I mean how many times we've heard
about like that Santa Monica woman,

1112
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,550
that dude hit the gas and
ran over all those people.

1113
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,520
And another one happened recently
where a guy knocks and people over,

1114
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,840
we called the cops,

1115
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,090
which I like it,

1116
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,430
it killed me to have to call
the cops on a drunk driver.

1117
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,670
But we were following someone from Bisbee
to Tucson on a two lane and over the

1118
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,130
line and then into the
breakdown lane over the line.

1119
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,211
And I go,

1120
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,260
if I don't call the cops and this
person's swerves into oncoming traffic,

1121
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,150
how much of a deck am
I going to feel like?

1122
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,270
So I called the cops and
they didn't get there before.

1123
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,410
There's a border checkpoint we have to
go through to get from our house to the

1124
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:42,310
Tucson airport.

1125
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,300
And when we got to the
checkpoint we get to,

1126
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,410
it was like an 89 year old.

1127
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,880
Whoa.

1128
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,460
Just a hunchback,

1129
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,700
most elderly woman.

1130
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,320
And I'm like,

1131
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,660
what?

1132
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,710
So she wasn't even drunk?

1133
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,220
No,

1134
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,491
no,

1135
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,170
it was just fucking old.

1136
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,831
Oh my God.

1137
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,530
Who is terrifying and wish you
and one of those really old cars.

1138
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:00,370
It's like real loose.

1139
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:01,540
Like those old like no,

1140
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:01,751
no,

1141
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:01,961
no.

1142
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,341
She No,

1143
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:03,600
she had a normal car.

1144
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:03,971
She'll,

1145
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:04,804
yeah.

1146
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,011
Old Cars.

1147
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,870
Have you ever tried to
drive like a really old,

1148
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,120
like Shitty Oldsmobile?

1149
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,260
Remember the one I bought it,

1150
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:12,700
the band shell that was pair,

1151
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,811
I bought it.

1152
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:18,270
I had to go to Fresno to pick it up
as a 1980 dodge aspen that had the,

1153
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,290
the roof it off,

1154
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,740
uh,

1155
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,620
and painted lime green with
a big white racing stripe.

1156
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:24,160
And I just,

1157
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,570
I bought this on purpose to fuck with
Rogan cause he had just got this $120,000

1158
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,380
Porsche.

1159
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,820
So I parked it right next.

1160
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:34,450
We had a parking space is
side by side on the man.

1161
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,284
She'll lot.

1162
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,410
So I've bought the biggest piece
of Shit I could find on Ebay,

1163
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:39,050
the loudest,

1164
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,591
ugliest,

1165
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:39,980
stupid

1166
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,940
his car and had the prop department
makeup a bumper sticker that said,

1167
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,810
I'm with Rogan,

1168
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,340
with an Arrow towards your car.

1169
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,270
And I still have that bumper
sticker on my refrigerator now.

1170
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,353
Uh,

1171
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,131
I remember,

1172
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:52,611
I remember that,

1173
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:53,690
but it was terrifying.

1174
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:57,320
It's the speed limit should go
by the quality of your vehicle.

1175
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,030
It shouldn't just be a blanket thing.

1176
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,220
So fucking loon lake.

1177
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:00,471
Yeah,

1178
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:02,810
there's old cars like
with drum brakes and shit.

1179
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,460
Those things are really sketchy.

1180
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,790
Everybody you know,

1181
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,310
has one bill burr.

1182
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,580
Bill burr has a really old Ford,

1183
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,230
I think it's a Ford pickup truck,

1184
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:15,500
like a 1950 something
pickup truck where it's a,

1185
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,590
it's a manual transmission
where you shifted on,

1186
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,540
on the stalk,

1187
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,351
you know,

1188
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:21,621
it's like,

1189
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,191
so you're like,

1190
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,650
you're pulling a lever that's
attached to the steering wheel.

1191
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,380
It's craziness and he loves it.

1192
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,290
The joy and sparkle in his eyes,

1193
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:30,981
you know,

1194
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,561
it's like I go,

1195
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:31,641
well,

1196
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:31,911
you know,

1197
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:32,810
navigation system,

1198
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,200
fucking no navigation system.

1199
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,510
It's like,

1200
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,160
it does everything.

1201
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,430
I think the radio works.

1202
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,710
It was just his old Angie's
like you could work on it,

1203
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,430
look at the open and hope I can
work on that fucking bill burr.

1204
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,280
Just talking to them.

1205
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,060
It just about whatever.

1206
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,250
I don't even remember what
we were talking about,

1207
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,080
but right before I went on stage and
just everyone in the green room is just

1208
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,110
dying laughing and he's just talking
casually about whatevers and then I get to

1209
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,250
go on stage after this and nothing
in my act as is funny as just him.

1210
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,980
Kibitzing yeah,

1211
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,370
he's a,

1212
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,970
he's such an awesome dude too.

1213
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:09,771
You know he liked,

1214
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:10,131
didn't want,

1215
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,140
he didn't want to hang.

1216
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:11,391
It's like,

1217
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:11,511
oh,

1218
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:11,961
I don't want to,

1219
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:12,440
you know.

1220
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,610
Zynga went out and got him.

1221
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,640
He was leaving and he said,

1222
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,720
I don't want to impose
like fuck outta here.

1223
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,800
Come hang out with us.

1224
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,660
You want us to be completely overrun by
industry and no one fund in the green

1225
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,260
room.

1226
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,420
It was a weird green
room and talking about,

1227
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,021
we're talking about this,

1228
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,180
I think we talked about this
before the podcast started.

1229
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:30,920
We didn't know fucking
half the people in there.

1230
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,941
It was weird.

1231
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:34,130
It's like all these industry people,

1232
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:35,630
I thought they were all Europe people.

1233
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,940
Joey d is talked me out of even going,

1234
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:38,181
he's like,

1235
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:38,540
talk,

1236
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,440
you don't want to go down there.

1237
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:39,771
I'm like,

1238
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:40,700
and I thought it was like,

1239
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,001
all right,

1240
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,180
there's some creepy sex shit.

1241
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,351
Well,

1242
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:46,400
Stan hope scared off most of them from
the after party by bringing in strangers.

1243
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,680
Standups went out and
grabbed some strangers.

1244
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:52,370
They had this giant spread of food that
you know there's going to go straight in

1245
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:52,970
the trash.

1246
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,430
Jeff wills assured me it
goes to the homeless people.

1247
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,671
I'm like,

1248
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,120
yeah,

1249
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm sure that's what you're thinking
about while you're counting the beans at

1250
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:00,470
the end of the night is oh,

1251
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:05,120
make sure the cold cuts get to the
homeless just to just drop him off of the

1252
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:06,140
corner of skid row.

1253
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,980
Flop.

1254
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,251
Yeah,

1255
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:12,251
and there's like three cases of beer
and it's just us in the industry,

1256
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,780
so I've just got people out of your line.

1257
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:14,991
I go,

1258
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:17,090
he'll be down here eventually
come drink free beer.

1259
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:17,810
So Stan,

1260
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,160
he'll grab a bunch of people,

1261
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,100
brought them down to the after party
and smoked out all the industry people.

1262
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,890
Eventually like I'm on and I'm calm.

1263
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:25,850
I'm uncomfortable here.

1264
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,460
I'm talking about my pending deals.

1265
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,460
Really.

1266
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,260
I didn't know most of the
people that were back there.

1267
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,770
It was like my manager and my agent
and there's like a bunch of strangers.

1268
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,611
That was Shandra,

1269
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,660
that was my managers.

1270
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,411
Who's your,

1271
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,300
who's the cleaners?

1272
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:42,530
Hussman Sas.

1273
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,520
I was talking to the wrong call.

1274
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,210
Sussman.

1275
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,560
I was talking to the guys from,

1276
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:49,920
uh,

1277
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,360
impractical jokers.

1278
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,380
I don't know if you've seen it.

1279
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,970
What does that sound like?

1280
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,100
A prank show on true TV,

1281
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:57,810
which is a fucking awful network.

1282
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,580
It's the only good thing on the network.

1283
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,450
But it's like,

1284
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,330
it's genuinely funny there
for friends and they just,

1285
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,140
the prey,

1286
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,400
they pull pranks on people.

1287
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:06,930
But the idea is to,

1288
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,210
we're gonna make our friend go do this.

1289
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,290
And then they like,

1290
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,400
so it's really,

1291
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,470
the prank is out there
fucking with each other.

1292
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,700
It's really funny.

1293
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,683
I soft,

1294
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,650
genuinely funny and they,

1295
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,050
I was talking to them cause they,

1296
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,940
they have some problems with the network
that make them man show look fucking

1297
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:24,960
like we owned it.

1298
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,630
Really?

1299
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,463
Yeah.

1300
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,520
And I'm like you gotta get a
guy like fucking Rogan's guy.

1301
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,510
We called him the cleaner.

1302
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,560
I couldn't think of his name.

1303
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,050
Yeah,

1304
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,270
you,

1305
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,420
you need someone to call like the network
telling them what to do on their off

1306
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:38,130
time and oh my God,

1307
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,590
really the tell them what
to do on their off time.

1308
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,963
Like what?

1309
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,480
Like they were like they were
going to do a Gig in Iowa.

1310
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,720
They have like five shows booked
in Iowa just on their own.

1311
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,920
We couldn't let him use the
impractical jokers name.

1312
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,860
Then they told them they couldn't even
do the gig because they wanted them to be

1313
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,170
focused on the show even
though they're not taping.

1314
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,840
It was like crazy.

1315
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:04,100
You remember when we first
sat down to do the mantra,

1316
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:09,110
one of their first ideas was that we film
the beginning of it in Iraq and we go

1317
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,370
over and do the man show in Iraq.

1318
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,953
I don't remember that.

1319
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,500
And I was like,

1320
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,070
I go,

1321
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,620
oh,

1322
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,580
that was their idea on Stanley's idea.

1323
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,511
And I go,

1324
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,030
are you out of your fucking mind?

1325
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,331
I go,

1326
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:25,830
you want to go to a war zone and have
girls jump up and down on trampolines?

1327
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,170
And I go,

1328
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,691
what are you doing?

1329
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:30,300
Are you endorsing this
invasion of this country?

1330
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:31,470
That makes no fucking sense.

1331
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:34,230
That's supposed to be connected to
nine 11 but isn't really in any way,

1332
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:35,064
shape or form.

1333
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,910
Is that what we're doing?

1334
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,460
And we just sat there and looked at
me like they didn't know what to say.

1335
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:38,611
I go,

1336
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,050
what the fuck are you talking about?

1337
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,270
That was like the beginning
of the end with those guys.

1338
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:47,160
I do remember when we were going to get
Oj Simpson on to do Andy Rooney spot at

1339
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,150
the end of every show

1340
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,850
and just announce him,

1341
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,020
his Heisman trophy winner,

1342
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:52,840
Oj Simpson,

1343
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,740
and then he just bitches
about ATM fees or something.

1344
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,630
Is it just money?

1345
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,590
You're getting money from me anyway.

1346
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,750
Why are you going to,

1347
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,750
so Stanley had some connection
to them where he's like,

1348
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,051
no,

1349
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,780
that's no possible way off the table.

1350
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,390
You know?

1351
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,223
That's,

1352
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,750
that should have never happened.

1353
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,860
We fucked up,

1354
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:14,101
man.

1355
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:14,400
We,

1356
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,170
that was an interesting lesson,

1357
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,090
but what happened was,

1358
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,200
first of all,

1359
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,030
if anybody does the history of the show,

1360
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,830
I was doing fear factor at the same time.

1361
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:24,780
So my time was very
limited and I was fucked.

1362
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,710
Um,

1363
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,470
and the other thing was
they kind of bullshitted us.

1364
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,300
They told me when I was setting up,

1365
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,681
when,

1366
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:31,740
when they were sending it out for me,

1367
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:32,131
they were like,

1368
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:32,730
listen,

1369
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,800
you could do whatever the fuck you want.

1370
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,250
Like if you guys get sued,

1371
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
that would be good for us.

1372
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,380
It'd be good publicity.

1373
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,921
They go,

1374
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:39,311
I go,

1375
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,031
what about nudity?

1376
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:40,780
Can we blow it out?

1377
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,381
Absolutely.

1378
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:41,801
Nudity.

1379
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:42,634
We'll blur it out.

1380
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,590
Swears sweat would just beep it out.

1381
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,483
Do whatever the fuck.

1382
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,331
Stanley,

1383
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:47,270
the production company,

1384
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,070
no,

1385
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,891
they don't stand on.

1386
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,260
He literally said to me,

1387
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,520
if we get sued,

1388
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,383
it would be great.

1389
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,740
It would be great publicity.

1390
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:54,071
I was like,

1391
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:54,910
this is perfect.

1392
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,280
And then I'm saying you deal
with Stan help and they yes.

1393
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:58,630
If Steven Steinhouse what you want to go.

1394
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,950
The only way I'm doing
it is with stand up.

1395
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,580
Okay,

1396
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,881
good.

1397
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:01,600
We're in.

1398
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
And then once we got,

1399
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,660
and Oh my God,

1400
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,171
it was just,

1401
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,820
they lied to us.

1402
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,210
It was like the network had these
really silly idea was it was so

1403
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,270
compartmentalize that you have,

1404
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,840
you know,

1405
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,610
the network saying one thing,

1406
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,670
then you have the stolen Stanley's
saying another thing and then there's the

1407
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,070
lawyers and then there's
standards and practices.

1408
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,140
So you couldn't get a cohesive answer.

1409
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,330
One person might be genuinely saying,

1410
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:28,481
yeah,

1411
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,590
you can do whatever you want.

1412
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,190
Hang on Duns Helberg our
lawyer says you can't do that.

1413
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,440
But it was the idea that the the most,

1414
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,400
the,

1415
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,050
the thing that I didn't expect the most
was these people who weren't funny in

1416
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:41,651
any way,

1417
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:46,300
shape or form telling you what is and
isn't funny and telling you like sketches

1418
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,400
that are and aren't funny and you're like,

1419
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,030
what do you,

1420
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,050
what do you even saying?

1421
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,270
Like when did you become
an expert on what's funny?

1422
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,021
Like you don't,

1423
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:56,260
you have no idea what it would
take to put something down,

1424
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,160
write it down on paper,

1425
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,920
conceptualize it in a way that
the audience is gonna absorb it.

1426
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,180
Go on stage and kill.

1427
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,470
You don't understand what that is.

1428
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,250
Oh,

1429
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:03,940
I know what that is.

1430
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,181
That's,

1431
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:04,871
that's my job.

1432
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:05,704
That's your job.

1433
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,130
I don't want to talk too much about
the impractical jokers stories.

1434
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,470
I don't,

1435
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,560
I don't know how much I'm
talking out of school,

1436
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:15,160
but like the fucking head of the network,

1437
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:16,000
mark jurists,

1438
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:16,834
this dose,

1439
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,350
we'll make them fucking write out possible
improv things they might say under

1440
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:23,680
these circumstances.

1441
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,071
Okay,

1442
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,300
we approve the gag,

1443
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,460
so what jokes might you say to someone
in and it will approve things that might

1444
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,260
or might not be sad,

1445
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,020
so he improves possibly fucking
almost in tears on the phone call.

1446
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,230
I don't know how to do this.

1447
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,273
I go,

1448
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,540
I don't know what to tell you.

1449
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:40,901
Is He?

1450
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:44,410
That is someone who's a Douche bag who
doesn't understand that your creative

1451
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:45,310
process in any way,

1452
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,144
shape or form.

1453
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,980
If you're out there and you
work with something creative,

1454
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,060
there's one way,

1455
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,380
only one way.

1456
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,790
You can get the most out of that person.

1457
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,463
Leave him alone.

1458
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,400
It's it.

1459
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,120
Leave me alone.

1460
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,400
Let them come up with their
own shit and that's it.

1461
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,091
It's the only way.

1462
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:58,840
It's going to work.

1463
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,040
If you start meddling,

1464
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,210
you're not going to make it better.

1465
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,110
You're not,

1466
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,940
you're not going to
fucking straighten out the,

1467
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:04,721
the plot lines.

1468
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:05,230
You're not,

1469
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,890
you're not.

1470
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,850
If they're funny,

1471
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,440
they're going to have
figure out how to do it.

1472
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,610
If they work on it hard,

1473
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:09,840
if they,

1474
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,870
they care about it,

1475
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,763
they'll make it good.

1476
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,270
If they,

1477
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,971
they can't,

1478
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,804
they suck.

1479
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,100
And you're not going to fix that.

1480
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,500
You're not going to fix suck and
you're not going to make funny,

1481
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:17,920
funnier.

1482
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,753
You're just not.

1483
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,620
Me and bill were talking about that,

1484
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:22,630
about we're getting to a level where,

1485
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,230
you know what?

1486
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,490
I can just do standup.

1487
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,200
I don't need to be on TV.

1488
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,070
I can make that,

1489
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,700
uh,

1490
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,940
you know enough money now
as a standup where fuck you.

1491
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,750
Yeah.

1492
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,100
I feel like that with
everything except the UFC,

1493
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,810
the UFC,

1494
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,330
the like,

1495
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,530
they're like a family to me.

1496
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,340
Like Dana and,

1497
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,431
yeah,

1498
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,930
but that's not a game where they go,

1499
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,351
okay,

1500
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:41,420
you have to do this and
this and this and where,

1501
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,320
no,

1502
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,591
no.

1503
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:46,220
I mean it's like it's the easiest Gig
of all time from me because I'm this

1504
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:46,671
passionate,

1505
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,660
fanatical fan.

1506
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,250
But as far as like,

1507
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,110
I mean anything else,

1508
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:52,340
like I don't give a fuck.

1509
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,450
Like I got,

1510
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,190
I've been offered movies
before and I'm like,

1511
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,390
well I don't want to do that.

1512
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,190
I'm going to how to go to
New Orleans for a month.

1513
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,260
The fuck am I going to get sell trailer?

1514
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:00,531
Yeah.

1515
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:01,760
I have no desire.

1516
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,600
I like,

1517
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,600
if the level of fame that I had two
years ago was all I could ever get to,

1518
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,200
I'm good with that.

1519
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:09,980
I'm,

1520
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm not even famous.

1521
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,240
I'm uncomfortable with
the amount of fame have,

1522
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,290
you're unquestionably famous,

1523
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
not famous.

1524
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:17,420
Walk down the street.

1525
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,820
That's better because you're
famous among standing Examity fan.

1526
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,650
I'm perfect.

1527
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,101
There's a,

1528
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,750
there's a elite group of
human beings you know,

1529
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,760
that are like in this,

1530
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:29,300
this one category that I consider funny
and there's not that many of them.

1531
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,601
You know,

1532
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:30,434
there's like a,

1533
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,810
it's really kind of amazing if
you stop and think about it.

1534
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,850
If you think about how many
people were actually on the,

1535
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,990
I just got a text,

1536
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,990
I just wanted to make sure it wasn't Q.

1537
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,920
Listening from the practical jokers gold.

1538
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,980
You're going to get us fired,

1539
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,281
man.

1540
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:42,801
Fuck man.

1541
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,390
True TV pays my mortgage,

1542
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:45,224
man.

1543
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,520
What else is on true TV?

1544
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,701
All the fake,

1545
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:50,510
it shows in their world fake as shit.

1546
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,530
Hardcore pawn is completely fucking fake.

1547
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,830
Set up mystery diners was one.

1548
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,280
They would run it where
they watch a bad employee.

1549
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,710
It's like slap you in the face.

1550
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:05,020
Insulting leave.

1551
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,170
Poorly staged.

1552
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,033
Wow.

1553
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,970
They'll have a bad employee and we think
he's stealing and now we have video

1554
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:11,121
for,

1555
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,820
we set up hidden cameras and
we see him stealing things.

1556
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,650
And uh,

1557
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,210
w we watched one where the guy,

1558
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:18,381
oh,

1559
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:21,530
he's caught him and his friends
are carrying a keg out the back.

1560
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,280
Well,

1561
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,400
when they're going out the
door from the inside shot,

1562
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,290
that keg is not tapped.

1563
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,970
But on the other side of the door,

1564
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:29,990
the keg is tap.

1565
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,090
So we called them,

1566
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,920
we called up and we go,

1567
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,281
ah,

1568
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:34,671
yeah,

1569
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,110
I need to talk to that employee,

1570
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:36,830
Jed,

1571
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,330
whatever the guy's name was.

1572
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:38,990
Uh,

1573
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,231
yeah,

1574
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:40,700
we saw the show,

1575
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,390
I think because he was serving
underage people and we go,

1576
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,721
yeah,

1577
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:47,210
I think he served my
underage daughter and I'm,

1578
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,040
I'm going to take legal action.

1579
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:49,970
And then fucking manager.

1580
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,110
I had to tell me outright,

1581
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,470
no,

1582
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,030
that show's completely stage.

1583
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:53,901
Yeah,

1584
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:54,081
no,

1585
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:54,561
they hide.

1586
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,910
Those are hired to actors.

1587
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,033
That's funny.

1588
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,370
Do you remember being okay,

1589
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,243

1590
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,240
Thank you.

1591
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,450

He,

1598
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:18,611

would do various talk shows and uh,

1599
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,641
they had a deal.

1600
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:20,660
They would call him up and then go,

1601
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:21,410

1602
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,760

love and is having an affair with his

1603
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:26,780
brother's wife.

1604
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,921
And he'd be like,

1605
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,090

and they would just sit.

1610
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,150
I do with Jerry Springer.

1611
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:35,940
And you did it?

1612
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,010
I did that Springer when it first started,

1613
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,030
like yeah,

1614
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,500
I did Springer.

1615
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,510
And then while I was there,

1616
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,110
the fucking uh,

1617
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,150
producer guy,

1618
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,460
just fucking crazy.

1619
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:48,450
I actually got sued by him later on.

1620
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,563
Uh,

1621
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,131
he said,

1622
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:50,520
uh,

1623
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,060
he goes,

1624
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,560
okay,

1625
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,800
we're going over the script.

1626
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:56,580
It's me and two strippers that are
pretending to be strippers probably.

1627
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,840
And uh,

1628
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,710
we are going over the,

1629
00:44:58,711 --> 00:44:59,070
you know,

1630
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,903
rehearsing.

1631
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,240
They flew me out for free
is 1998 or something.

1632
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,313
And uh,

1633
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:04,891
he said,

1634
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:05,461
and by the way,

1635
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:09,870
don't talk to anyone in the hotel
because a 20 twenty's investigating us or

1636
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:11,370
dateline and a,

1637
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,560
so if anyone comes up to you,

1638
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,470
and it was such a Dick that the
next morning I called my agent,

1639
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,060
I go get me a number for 20,

1640
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:18,894
20.

1641
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,590
And then it turned into this whole like
spy versus spy where I'm leaving the

1642
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,930
outline snuck out under my door.

1643
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:29,190
So 2020 can come grab it and copy it and
then put it back while I'm in the other

1644
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:30,200
room rehearsing.

1645
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,890
It was fucking crazy.

1646
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,070
And then I,

1647
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,171
yeah,

1648
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:34,561
it just,

1649
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:35,520
it was a whole,

1650
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,380
the stories on my website,

1651
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:42,000
somewhere in the archives happened to
that really fucking funny show you did for

1652
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:42,751
Fox.

1653
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,300
That hidden camera show
where you cooked a cat.

1654
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,020
Yeah.

1655
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,450
You brought a cat too.

1656
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,160
Was that what has tried to mail my,

1657
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:50,311
yeah.

1658
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:50,790
My,

1659
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,050
my ex girlfriend says
she wants her cat back.

1660
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:55,690
So I went to him like mailing mailboxes,

1661
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:56,051
et cetera.

1662
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:59,690
At a male it was what
looked like a dead cat boy.

1663
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,610
Did they mail it for you?

1664
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,840
I don't remember

1665
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,140
as a montage of different places.

1666
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,150
That show was funny.

1667
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,060
Think anyone mailed it.

1668
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,470
That was in the 90s right?

1669
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,333
Let's say we,

1670
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,350
we filmed it in [inaudible] 99 and it
didn't air until 2001 they just shelved

1671
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:16,770
it.

1672
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,050
But then they pulled it out
as a summer replacement.

1673
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:19,741
It was right,

1674
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:23,940
it was after nine 11 because they changed
it from attack of the hidden cameras

1675
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,680
to invasion of the hidden cameras.

1676
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:29,130
Cause they thought attack was
too strong in a post nine 11

1677
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,760
oh God.

1678
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,601
Oh God.

1679
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,500
I hate everybody.

1680
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,610
I fucking love him.

1681
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,420
The camera and that.

1682
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,560
None of it's good.

1683
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,670
Yeah,

1684
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,241
that's definitely,

1685
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:40,950
that's why I love impractical jokers.

1686
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:45,720
It's finally like after years of punk
and you just want to leap through the TV

1687
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:50,270
and slap that fucking Ashton Kutcher
and his mouth and then the car off,

1688
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,670
right?

1689
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,090
Yeah.

1690
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:51,720
This,

1691
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,460
we set up a fake valet.

1692
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,540
What idiot is just going to give
their keys to a random stranger?

1693
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,021
Really?

1694
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:00,300
You don't Valet Park your fucking car.

1695
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:04,800
Ashton could cheer you spar me cut like
smarmy and there were just so like so

1696
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:07,290
poor I fucking candid camera.

1697
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,860
I want to get like box sets of old
candid camera cause this shit makes me

1698
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:11,671
fucking cry.

1699
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,920
Laugh candid camera
was pretty fucking bad.

1700
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,793
Yes.

1701
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,170
Yeah.

1702
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:15,661
It's a,

1703
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:16,710
there's not that is it?

1704
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,050
What is the deal with
a hidden camera though?

1705
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:23,400
There's like certain rules that exist
now that I don't think existed before was

1706
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,560
reasonable expectation of privacy.

1707
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,741
Oh,

1708
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:27,630
I gotta fucking tell you
a story off of there.

1709
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,160
I have the injection,

1710
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,160
my backpack

1711
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,760
of why I can't tell you why
there I got a story off the air.

1712
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,030
I remember the fake Doctor
Phil that we had for the man.

1713
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:35,860
Yeah,

1714
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,240
it was fucking brilliant.

1715
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,490
That was funny.

1716
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:39,820
Shit.

1717
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,300
Yeah.

1718
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,310
He had an earpiece.

1719
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,360
He just looked like he was,

1720
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,300
he was a brilliant impress you.

1721
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:45,611
Oh,

1722
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:46,030
he did.

1723
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,301
Dot.

1724
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:47,134
Hold it off.

1725
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,840
Those women really thought
it was doctor Phil,

1726
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,940
but that was fucking awesome dude.

1727
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,200
That was like one of my favorite things.

1728
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:53,950
We did that.

1729
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,491
And uh,

1730
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:59,491
when you stole the old Mancho
midget when your romance to Arturo.

1731
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,640
Oh,

1732
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,750
that was beautiful too.

1733
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,100
I got the master tapes.

1734
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:03,670
I want to,

1735
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,850
I want to put them on Ebay
because they won't release our,

1736
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,853
you know,

1737
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,940
our show ever the case.

1738
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:10,774
They won't release it.

1739
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,010
They would have,

1740
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,830
they've released every
other one on box at DVDs.

1741
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,420
I know.

1742
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,090
I just want,

1743
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,490
I just want to Ebay that
the tapes for charity.

1744
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,193
That's not a bad idea.

1745
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,850
He probably get sued though.

1746
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,900
Why?

1747
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,171
I don't know.

1748
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:24,490
Because so many probably owns it.

1749
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:26,050
And if they over wanting
to sell it as a d,

1750
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,150
Why did they give me the fucking tapes?

1751
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,500
I probably fucked up.

1752
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,340
They didn't think you were crazy and going
like they didn't understand what Ebay

1753
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:33,611
was.

1754
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:34,240
Probably.

1755
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,680
They probably didn't have email back then.

1756
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,840
I did another court problem right now.

1757
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,171
Yeah,

1758
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,180
don't do it because if we don't,

1759
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:42,490
if we an Andy or flying
to Florida for Christmas,

1760
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:46,990
that's how we realized we will be spending
our Christmases in court in Florida,

1761
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,621
in court,

1762
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:48,221
in Florida.

1763
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,570
We've flagged Christmas Day.

1764
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,230
Forget.

1765
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,370
We can't talk about it.

1766
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,173
Oh,

1767
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,060
is this that thing that you
were talking about before?

1768
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,200
Yeah.

1769
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,351
Oh,

1770
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,350
someone's upset shouldn't
have been fucking kids,

1771
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:00,184
pal.

1772
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,111
It's how it goes.

1773
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:02,944
Right.

1774
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,500
I wouldn't say any son of a bitch.

1775
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,570
I don't even know what
we're talking about.

1776
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,740
I'm just making things up folks.

1777
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,520
If this in any way coincidentally
relates to the actual events of the case,

1778
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,760
it's a don't,

1779
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:15,731
don't worry.

1780
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:17,260
After after we're out of court,

1781
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:17,651
it's,

1782
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:18,130
yeah,

1783
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,200
we'll be able to talk.

1784
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:20,930
Yeah,

1785
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:21,551
we're good.

1786
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:23,950
So it could become a part
of your act 20 minutes.

1787
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,030
That's a problem.

1788
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,590
That's the problem.

1789
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:29,170
When you have a great story,

1790
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:32,500
but it's with another comic
and it's pretty much his story.

1791
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,030
Well you,

1792
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,390
here's what you do with that guy.

1793
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,370
Don't fucking lay it
out for him and say it.

1794
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:38,600
And the perfect joke for him.

1795
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,490
Yeah,

1796
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,500
he'll have his own take,

1797
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,060
but he's been making
jokes about it for years.

1798
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,990
Let's get off because this is

1799
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,001
not only that,

1800
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:49,570
we're already probably
tripping on some legal issues.

1801
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,900
You can consult with Jay more
though if you need help with it.

1802
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,330
Speaking of fucking hilarious.

1803
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,631
Uh,

1804
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:03,280
I sent Doug this thing and
this is a video of Bill Burr,

1805
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,060
um,

1806
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,040
talking about Yoko Ono and John Lennon
and it is one of the fucking funniest

1807
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,210
things I've ever seen.

1808
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,044
Like you to keep that.

1809
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,561
Yeah.

1810
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:11,771
Yeah.

1811
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:12,131
We're going to,

1812
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:13,350
we're going to show it cause it's,

1813
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:13,840
it's,

1814
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,651
it's so perfect.

1815
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:19,651
It was when John Lennon had a chance to
perform on a television show with Chuck

1816
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,300
Berry and he brought Yoko Ono with
them and bill Burgess breaks it down.

1817
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,100
It's one of the fun
you to see it visually.

1818
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,491
Folks,

1819
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:28,851
two of you,

1820
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:30,200
you're listening to this on iTunes.

1821
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:35,201
Do yourself a favor and just youtube
bill burr Yoko Ono and find the clip and

1822
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:40,511
watch it because the look on Chuck
Berry's face is fucking priceless.

1823
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,100
I mean it's priceless.

1824
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,300
Chuck Berry,

1825
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,970
Yoko Ono about the Beatles
and how great is this?

1826
00:50:47,971 --> 00:50:50,690
The video was whatever you want to say.

1827
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,980
I totally agree with them.

1828
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,590
I think that the greatest
band of all time,

1829
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,760
but I have to be honest with you.

1830
00:50:55,761 --> 00:51:00,440
John Lennon and Paul McCartney
redefined pussy whipped.

1831
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,930
You have to watch this fucking video.

1832
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,143
It's

1833
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,210
John Lennon is singing with Chuck Berry.

1834
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:09,660
Chuck Berry is probably one of
the main reasons why John Lennon,

1835
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,370
Lennon ever picked up a guitar.

1836
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:12,721
He's on TV.

1837
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:14,160
He gets to play with this idol.

1838
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,270
They're playing.

1839
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,050
Uh,

1840
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,430
Chuck Berry's hit Memphis.

1841
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,713
Okay.

1842
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,600
John Lennon's got Yoko
in his fucking band.

1843
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,250
They're in the middle of singing this
song on television and the killing it.

1844
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,270
It's going great.

1845
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:30,180
Yoko's playing some stupid fucking drum.

1846
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,170
And even though she has no
fucking talent whatsoever,

1847
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,210
he's putting her in the fucking band.

1848
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,351
Just she'll,

1849
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:40,830
she'll shut the fuck up and stop nagging
him cause he's too much of a fucking

1850
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,710
pussy to tell her that she has no talent.

1851
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:45,723
All right.

1852
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,020
The only reason why you're here
Yoko's cause just sucking my dick.

1853
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,310
All right.

1854
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:50,611
No,

1855
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,020
you can't play the bongos.

1856
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,311
But anyway,

1857
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:54,690
she's up to playing the Bongos,

1858
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,350
right?

1859
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,190
So John Lennon,

1860
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,840
Chuck Berry to the greats of all time
harmonizing singing this hit from the

1861
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:03,450
1950s that's what this is about.

1862
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,580
And Yoko in the middle
of it can't handle that.

1863
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,780
She's not getting any shine.

1864
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,210
She takes the fucking
microphone out of the stands,

1865
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,420
starts playing the Bongo
and as they're singing,

1866
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:11,731
you know,

1867
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:12,151
go,

1868
00:52:12,151 --> 00:52:13,440
go Johnny go whatever.

1869
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,810
She picks up the mic
and I swear to God goes

1870
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,620
some fucking crazy shit.

1871
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,570
And you see Chuck Berry's eyes
fucking open as wide as they are.

1872
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,410
And it's that.

1873
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,900
It's that fucking look dude.

1874
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:29,610
You have to have like a
buddy of yours and he's,

1875
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:29,941
he's,

1876
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:31,530
he's dating some fucking psycho,

1877
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:32,340
but he's in love with her.

1878
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:37,290
So you can't fucking say anything and
you're just sitting there waiting for the

1879
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:40,890
fucking lightning bolt to hit your friend
in the head where he finally realizes

1880
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,330
that he's dating a psycho cunt.

1881
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,230
Chuck Berry had that look on his face.

1882
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,991
I'm not even joking.

1883
00:52:45,991 --> 00:52:47,150
I'm not even an exaggeration.

1884
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,780
That's what the fuck she did.

1885
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,910
And Chuck diaries like what the fuck?

1886
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,700
And it's kind of like John,

1887
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:56,250
that's your woman get her in line.

1888
00:52:56,251 --> 00:52:58,740
And John Lennon does not even fucking,

1889
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,120
he doesn't even blink.

1890
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:02,251
He just,

1891
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:05,460
he just keeps playing and then she
does it again later on in that song.

1892
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,880
And then you look at all the other
musicians and they just keep playing the

1893
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:09,181
song.

1894
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:11,400
Like Yoko isn't even fucking there.

1895
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:12,890
And uh,

1896
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,590
I actually get infuriated when I watched
this video of the fact that John didn't

1897
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:19,260
just stop playing in that moment.

1898
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,350
And what he should have done
was dressed or down right there.

1899
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:22,561
Yes.

1900
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:23,940
I find you want to have a fucking moment.

1901
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:24,511
This is your mom.

1902
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:25,830
If you ever do that again,

1903
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,110
I will slap you so
fucking hard in the head.

1904
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,540
Your eyes are going to look like mine
standing play that fucking Bongo and you

1905
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,291
shut your face.

1906
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,101
You look like that bitch.

1907
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:36,510
You crawled out of the
fucking well in ring stand me.

1908
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,640
I didn't mean why I'm fucking,

1909
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:38,570
you are going to be fucking,

1910
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:40,850
anybody can't play the pong ball goes.

1911
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,100
You can't say shut your fucking face.

1912
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,550
And then he just walks back up to the
mic and just counts the band back in.

1913
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,400
Is that what the fuck
you should have done?

1914
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,093
Beautiful.

1915
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:55,480
Okay.

1916
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:55,880
Bingo.

1917
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,571
Bingo is here.

1918
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:57,890
I told Rogan I go out.

1919
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,580
Anytime we get into a like a
really strong riff together,

1920
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,421
I'm going to have bingo.

1921
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:03,670
Lean into the mic and just go

1922
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:08,863
right.

1923
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,300
Oh my God.

1924
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:11,691
That's,

1925
00:54:11,691 --> 00:54:16,691
so I went to a Yoko Ono art exhibit in
Massachusetts once when I was living in

1926
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:18,111
Boston.

1927
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,300
They had some things set up somewhere.

1928
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,550
It was the most ridiculous shit I had.

1929
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,350
Eh,

1930
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:23,780
I,

1931
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,250
I didn't know what to expect.

1932
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:25,521
I just,

1933
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:28,760
I was going there hoping that
there'll be something funny and uh,

1934
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,040
I go there and one of the art pieces was
a block of wood with some nails in it

1935
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,430
and there was a box of nails and a hammer

1936
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,060
that was the piece of art.

1937
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,310
And she said that she wanted it,

1938
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:47,870
she was encouraging people to participate
and they should pick up a nail and put

1939
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:48,800
it into the block of wood.

1940
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,723
And that was the art.

1941
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,773
Yeah.

1942
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,960
This reminds me of what you
went to the wine tasting.

1943
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:54,800
Yeah.

1944
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,570
What kind of Super Pussy did she have?

1945
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,570
The captain morale.

1946
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,490
What was going on there?

1947
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,201
It's not what it was.

1948
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:00,820
I mean,

1949
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,010
was he just not even like hot Asian
and it's hard to be not hot and Asian.

1950
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:05,910
Yeah.

1951
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,743
It's difficult.

1952
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,070
She was gross.

1953
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,180
She was weird.

1954
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,400
It was a strange fucking,

1955
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,860
it's almost like she
hypnotized him or something,

1956
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,913
you know?

1957
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:15,571
Yeah.

1958
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:16,410
Sometimes when you,

1959
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,333
you do,

1960
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:17,760
you know,

1961
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,680
hardcore hallucinogens with someone,

1962
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,530
maybe you see something in
them that no one else can see.

1963
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:24,120
Even if it's not really there.

1964
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,010
Maybe it was,

1965
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,350
this bitch is not going anywhere.

1966
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,670
Maybe it was one of those,

1967
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,061
it was like,

1968
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:30,301
look,

1969
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:30,590
I need you

1970
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:30,950
somewhat.

1971
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,680
I need to make sure you're going
to be around for a long time.

1972
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,131
You know,

1973
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:34,550
can we,

1974
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,750
can we bank on this?

1975
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:36,500
You know,

1976
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,640
I don't know John.

1977
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,990
I'm like the wind.

1978
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,480
I go where my conscience takes me.

1979
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,980
I don't know.

1980
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,540
Yup.

1981
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,850
Head with chicks that I,

1982
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:48,851
because I thought there was another
level to them that I'm not finding yet.

1983
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:49,731
And you go,

1984
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:49,941
no,

1985
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:52,310
you're just a fucking empty
shell of a human being.

1986
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,040
It's not like you're not
giving me more and you're,

1987
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,551
you're,

1988
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:56,660
you're not secret.

1989
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,290
You're hoping there was more
that you would just dilute,

1990
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,800
take that initial infatuation and like,

1991
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,311
oh,

1992
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:05,144
okay.

1993
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,690
Convinced that there's
something more that I'm,

1994
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,430
you're not giving me.

1995
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,730
I expect more from my heroes is do.

1996
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,170
It makes me sad.

1997
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,540
I mean like firemen and shit,

1998
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,360
you know,

1999
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,193
like,

2000
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,303
like John Lennon.

2001
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,060
Oh,

2002
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,500
I expect the more I thought
you meant me that was going to,

2003
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,200
no,

2004
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,441
no,

2005
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:23,681
not,

2006
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,190
you

2007
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,770
know me and I'm very happy.

2008
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:26,710
I thought you were saying that.

2009
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:26,921
I,

2010
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,754
I,

2011
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,150
I let you down by staying with
women that were fucking subpar.

2012
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:33,250
No,

2013
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,590
you did an awesome job
with everything so far.

2014
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:40,870
My issues with John Lennon and Yoko Ono
and the fucking block of wood with nails

2015
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:41,050
in it.

2016
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:44,050
I remember just standing there sitting
there like what kind of bullshit is this?

2017
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:44,950
How is this art?

2018
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,470
It's a box of nails and a fucking hammer.

2019
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,623
Speaker

2020
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:51,803
performance.

2021
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,020
No chance.

2022
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,280
Is that Dick Cabot?

2023
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:55,541
Yeah.

2024
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:59,170
Off of Dick Cavett look
at this little esoteric,

2025
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,950
I don't understand a fucking word.

2026
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,460
We are water.

2027
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,633
A lot of money.

2028
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,180
I wonder if you just stretch.

2029
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,711
I love that though.

2030
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:37,711
I love cause I have horrible teeth so I
love seeing like back then you've actors

2031
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:40,140
that have great teeth
now had these fucking

2032
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:45,110
horrible wrecked fucking miles and the
true sixties and seventies and I missed

2033
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,231
her.

2034
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:46,600
I love being in the UK.

2035
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,800
Like I can be ugly as shit and
be on TV like Jeremy Clarkson.

2036
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,240
I Dunno who that is.

2037
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,200
You got from top gear,

2038
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,030
you never watched the show top gear,

2039
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,330
but is he the fatter,

2040
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,030
bigger one?

2041
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:58,430
Yeah,

2042
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:58,620
I,

2043
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,690
I don't remember his mouth
but funny fucking dude is he,

2044
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,680
he's funny man.

2045
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,573
He's very funny.

2046
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,170
You don't give a fuck about cars.

2047
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:07,900
But then that is not really about
car in the UK you don't have,

2048
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,960
you don't have the choice of giving
a fuck cause they only have like nine

2049
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:14,830
channels and you're stuck in a hotel all
day and you don't want to go out cause

2050
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:18,070
there's nothing to eat and the fucking
beers are overpriced and everyone's

2051
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:18,940
surely in the pub.

2052
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:19,810
So you watch TV.

2053
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:21,670
I watch music videos over there.

2054
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,070
Someone is a little on
the negative side today.

2055
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,683
Do you feel this,

2056
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,570
do you ever heard the song down
with the trumpets by Rizal kicks?

2057
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,080
No,

2058
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,920
that's a fucking,

2059
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,251
it's,

2060
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:34,690
I like it now because I hated it so
much and I watched a video so many times

2061
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,530
over five weeks and in
London that it became like,

2062
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,120
why do you torture
yourself with those long,

2063
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,290
long tours like that?

2064
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,550
Like five a young.

2065
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,331
Well,

2066
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:44,230
I in the states,

2067
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,840
we've been this year we went
back old school and just put,

2068
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,380
yeah,

2069
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,270
me and two other comics and Charlie,

2070
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:53,950
my road manager and Bingo in a van and
just went town to town and we had a

2071
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,030
fucking blast.

2072
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,560
I heard the dude who's opening for you,

2073
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:57,640
who opened for you at the comedy store.

2074
00:58:57,641 --> 00:58:58,260
It's really fun.

2075
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,000
Junior stop.

2076
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,270
Go.

2077
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,890
Oh,

2078
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:00,641
he's bucking.

2079
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,180
He's my,

2080
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,620
my new fucking guys.

2081
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,610
You have anything online?

2082
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:03,811
Can you?

2083
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:05,140
But it's nothing.

2084
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,190
Nothing quality.

2085
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:06,640
No.

2086
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,040
Uh,

2087
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,350
is no quality footage.

2088
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:09,520
But junior stopped.

2089
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:10,210
[inaudible].

2090
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,410
S t o p.

2091
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:11,771
K.

2092
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:14,140
A fucking wicked funny.

2093
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,800
Is this the video?

2094
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,790
Nice guy.

2095
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,660
O p.

2096
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,830
K A.

2097
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:18,930
Pka.

2098
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,763
No.

2099
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,420
Friendless up.

2100
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,363
It

2101
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,391
comes up with,

2102
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:37,920
so we don't want to

2103
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,573
break

2104
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,013
internet.

2105
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,450
That's all right.

2106
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,081
That was pretty good,

2107
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:50,914
man.

2108
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,710
God Rizal Kicks Down with the trumpet and
data that became an obsession with you

2109
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:59,470
while you were looking at I
got the video bothered me.

2110
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,940
The kids bothered me.

2111
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,850
Do you know the rules to wash itself?

2112
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:03,221
No,

2113
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:03,581
I don't.

2114
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,220
I didn't get that deep sneaker.

2115
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,750
I watched it watch darts either.

2116
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:07,584
Yeah.

2117
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,570
I've watched a watch,

2118
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,830
an hour and a half of snooker.

2119
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,220
I did get into football over there.

2120
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,293
I mean soccer.

2121
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,223
Yes.

2122
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,161
I know.

2123
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:18,460
I still like I have bits that I wrote
over there and I still have to when I do

2124
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:19,230
and I'm over here,

2125
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:24,230
stopped myself from saying football
and say soccer or you know those those

2126
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,030
buzzwords.

2127
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,740
It's like saying nigger over there.

2128
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:27,880
If you call it soccer,

2129
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,370
you'll get worse reaction from saying
soccer about football on stage in the UK

2130
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:37,150
than any racial slur or Ealing soccer.

2131
01:00:37,151 --> 01:00:37,470
Huh?

2132
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,830
He's fucking football.

2133
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:40,630
You're fucking whoa.

2134
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:41,380
Easy.

2135
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,220
That's all they have.

2136
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,460
[inaudible] is a smarter football.

2137
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:44,150
Really.

2138
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,830
Those guys don't get as much brain damage,

2139
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,410
but problem with American football man
is just fucking helmets apparently said,

2140
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,310
everybody says that they
took off the helmets.

2141
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:53,370
They wouldn't be slamming head.

2142
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,100
Exactly.

2143
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,230
Yeah.

2144
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,240
That's why when they say,

2145
01:00:55,241 --> 01:00:55,391
Oh,

2146
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:57,040
rugby is so much harder than football.

2147
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:57,311
No,

2148
01:00:57,311 --> 01:01:00,730
they don't have a false sense of
security like football players do.

2149
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,440
Yeah,

2150
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:01,830
you're,

2151
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,680
you're jarring your melon like that.

2152
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:05,341
That's not good.

2153
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,800
Even if your skull is
protected from cracking,

2154
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:09,870
it's a soft innards that are the issue.

2155
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,460
Just the impact alone.

2156
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:12,870
That's a,

2157
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,640
it's a weird sort of a thing though,

2158
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,070
to tell,

2159
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,980
to tell people that you would be safer.

2160
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:17,760
You know the,

2161
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,240
you would actually be safer if
you had a leather helmet on.

2162
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,650
People don't want to
hear that kind of shit.

2163
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:24,510
That's that kind of weird logic.

2164
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:26,820
Like it would actually be
better if drugs were legal.

2165
01:01:26,821 --> 01:01:27,830
People wouldn't do drugs.

2166
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,650
Like what the fuck he saying
fall drugs were legal.

2167
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:32,930
I mean less,

2168
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,413
right.

2169
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,970
I've never had more fun driving a car.

2170
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:40,570
Then when I was 16 and didn't have a
license and my brother's girlfriend was

2171
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,370
going to let me drive a car illegally.

2172
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,850
Yeah,

2173
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,450
and now I wish I had that
thrill of sitting in traffic.

2174
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,310
I shouldn't be doing this.

2175
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:51,670
Do you remember the thrill of
just piloting the car at all?

2176
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:54,670
Just moving it around and
it's turning and stopping.

2177
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:55,510
It was so fun.

2178
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,350
When it was illegal,

2179
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,370
it was the most fun.

2180
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,420
I don't have a license.

2181
01:01:58,421 --> 01:01:59,320
I'm driving illegally.

2182
01:01:59,321 --> 01:02:00,154
We just,

2183
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,960
we realized by US stepmothers Toyota
Corolla wagon would turn on with a butter

2184
01:02:04,961 --> 01:02:05,260
knife.

2185
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,891
Like the key.

2186
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:09,880
You didn't even need a key go out of
town and we'd be driving all over butter

2187
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,450
nation.

2188
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:10,870
Yeah.

2189
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:11,421
Just anything.

2190
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:12,430
You leave it in,

2191
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:13,390
it would turn.

2192
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:14,951
Fuck.

2193
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:16,180
Did someone figure that out?

2194
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:16,840
What?

2195
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,810
My brother was trying to figure out how
to hot wire a car realized they didn't

2196
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:20,080
need

2197
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,913
to.

2198
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,860
Well that was the thing that
would break off on some cars.

2199
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:26,860
They would break off the part where the
key goes in and just stick a screwdriver

2200
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:27,700
in and just turn it off.

2201
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,580
Like instantly.

2202
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:29,830
Took like five seconds.

2203
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:30,910
Didn't even have to do that.

2204
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,950
It was some shit designs of cars.

2205
01:02:32,951 --> 01:02:36,550
I guess some of them just fucking just
now the push button ones and now it's

2206
01:02:36,551 --> 01:02:37,630
probably a pain in the deck.

2207
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:38,811
We want to really try to,

2208
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:39,750
I get a coach button,

2209
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,050
one push button.

2210
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:41,321
Oh,

2211
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:42,140
it's beautiful.

2212
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,360
You keep the keys in your pocket.

2213
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,931
Just get in there.

2214
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:47,560
You don't have to think about shit if
you live in Bisbee and keep the key right

2215
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:48,360
in the car.

2216
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,780
I probably shouldn't have said that.

2217
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,270
Random illegal aliens
sneaking across the border.

2218
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:56,893
Yeah.

2219
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,380
By your fluorescent [inaudible] insurance.

2220
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:00,640
There you go.

2221
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:00,970
Yeah.

2222
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,630
Fuck him.

2223
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:01,961
Fuck,

2224
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:02,621
I'm looking at you.

2225
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:03,490
You don't give a shit.

2226
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:04,324
That's gangster.

2227
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,830
Have you heard of Gungeon before?

2228
01:03:05,831 --> 01:03:06,160
Jets?

2229
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,750
It's a calculated risk again,

2230
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,900
dungeon gushing.

2231
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,680
Gushing is no,

2232
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:13,030
is that that fat Korean guy?

2233
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:13,280
No.

2234
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:13,540
No.

2235
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,780
It's [inaudible] styles.

2236
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:18,670
When you take a dead lady
and you and your friend,

2237
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,490
you got stuck on her pussy and the
other guy jumped on her stomach.

2238
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,593
She off the phone.

2239
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,890
Alright to shut the fuck up.

2240
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:25,720
Go to the hospital.

2241
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:26,950
But I do remember on that

2242
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,170
man shall using w w w gets,

2243
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,150
everything's censored,

2244
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,350
but they had no idea.

2245
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:32,940
All the new Cleveland,

2246
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,980
Cleveland Steamer and so we'd throw all
those in because they have no idea what

2247
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,810
a dirty Sanchez is.

2248
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:41,940
So it is to any vulgarity,

2249
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:43,711
dirty sand.

2250
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:44,580
Some girl told me that.

2251
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,001
Yeah,

2252
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:45,834
well yeah,

2253
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,330
Molly did it last night.

2254
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,680
I think it was her story.

2255
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,660
I not allowed to say that anymore.

2256
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,300
How does it,

2257
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:51,810
you can,

2258
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,300
can you say Cleveland Steamer on yeah,

2259
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,153
TV.

2260
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,390
But as long as you just keep
making up through memes,

2261
01:03:58,391 --> 01:03:59,710
new ways,

2262
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:00,910
new obscenities,

2263
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,160
you can just keep saying stuff
because they'll never know.

2264
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,390
Pointing that the,

2265
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,570
the customer thing has been worked out
yet it's just that alone deflates all

2266
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:13,990
your faith in humanity.

2267
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,680
Just the idea that you've created the,

2268
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,990
you've made a word dirty
and now you can't say it

2269
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,270
now it's over forever and you
never get those words back cut.

2270
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,930
Like never makes it just like,

2271
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:25,764
you know,

2272
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:30,360
seeing on whatever desperate housewives
or at any kind of show of cheese,

2273
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:30,820
a condom.

2274
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,820
Dora the explorer is the idea that
if it were completely okay to say it,

2275
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:37,870
then we kind of lose.

2276
01:04:37,871 --> 01:04:42,130
Cause then you don't have any expletive
when you really want to deliver a

2277
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:42,431
thought,

2278
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:43,420
you're a fucking cunt.

2279
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,940
And if it was an okay word to say,

2280
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:49,450
then what are you going to say to make
someone upset when you want to hurt their

2281
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:50,210
feelings?

2282
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,043
Eh,

2283
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,670
comma fucking dummy.

2284
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,050
It's just as just say there is,

2285
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:55,270
I don't,

2286
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,860
I wouldn't miss it if
cutting lost it's impact.

2287
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,950
I'd be fine with dummy or fuckface stupid,

2288
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,090
stupid,

2289
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:02,670
stupid fart.

2290
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,500
That actually makes it easier cause then
then you'd have to go after them for

2291
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,760
aesthetically you're,

2292
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,680
you're an pleasing to the eye.

2293
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,643
Yeah.

2294
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,243
Yeah.

2295
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,130
Well you wouldn't have,

2296
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,810
and that's just their personality sucks.

2297
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:15,980
Dick,

2298
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,640
I was uh,

2299
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,540
you're boring.

2300
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,170
Like

2301
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,940
you could never insult me more.

2302
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:21,830
You're boring.

2303
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:22,910
Oh,

2304
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,290
that's my biggest fear.

2305
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,640
You tapped into it there.

2306
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:26,690
We shouldn't have said that either.

2307
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,760
There was a dude once,

2308
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,691
I'll never forget this.

2309
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:33,830
I was watching like one of those Jenny
Jones shows and there was a girl and she

2310
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:36,730
was out with her mother and her mother
was upset because the girl was dressed

2311
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,780
and trashy and uh,

2312
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,231
this,

2313
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:39,381
uh,

2314
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:40,191
the girl was like,

2315
01:05:40,191 --> 01:05:41,090
I don't give a fuck.

2316
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:42,940
Like I beat whatever neon mother beep.

2317
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:43,440
Say,

2318
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:43,591
ah,

2319
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:43,881
you know,

2320
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:44,810
I know I look good.

2321
01:05:44,811 --> 01:05:45,644
I know I look good.

2322
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,750
And some guy got up and he goes,

2323
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,230
the problem is all about your personality.

2324
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:51,891
He goes,

2325
01:05:51,891 --> 01:05:53,570
if you have some Pazazz,

2326
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,460
maybe you would pull that off,

2327
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,780
but your personality sucks
and then make you look nasty.

2328
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Never forget him saying
that your personality sucks
and that may you look nasty

2329
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:12,680
and the place just fell out because it's
like black people of a certain way of

2330
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:16,430
saying things and they say things
and they know how to phrase it,

2331
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:19,150
that they know at the end of
that sense everyone around them.

2332
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:21,020
Oh Shit.

2333
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:22,860
Oh Shit.

2334
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,190
Because when he did it,

2335
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:24,581
it was like,

2336
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,510
it was like an actor.

2337
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,710
Like he was in a movie,

2338
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:28,000
like he had the perfect line,

2339
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:32,260
he practice it for weeks because your
personality sucks and that may you look

2340
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:33,094
nasty.

2341
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,530
And when he said NASA,

2342
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,530
he knew it was coming.

2343
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,491
He knew it was coming.

2344
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:37,324
Everybody behind him,

2345
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,790
the whole crowd just went nuts.

2346
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:41,624
And that girl was like,

2347
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:42,523
damn,

2348
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,820
that motherfucker just dressed
me down and called me out.

2349
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,440
It was beautiful.

2350
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,890
I played my first black
room the other day,

2351
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,220
I'll,

2352
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,200
it was a casino and uh,

2353
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,221
it was,

2354
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:54,910
uh,

2355
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,060
I was the only white comic and I thought
it was going to be like a regular black

2356
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:58,151
guy,

2357
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:58,750
but it was a,

2358
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,400
a Bingo and a slot place.

2359
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,460
And so it was just like 60 year olds.

2360
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,520
And up for the most part in like in
those little crickets or whatever,

2361
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:08,380
the little wheelchairs and I go,

2362
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:08,711
you know,

2363
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:10,390
I'm a dirty fucking comic.

2364
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,400
And she's like,

2365
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:11,570
ah.

2366
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,580
The MC was like,

2367
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,181
don't worry.

2368
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:13,571
You know,

2369
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:13,870
who cares?

2370
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,130
They love dirty material.

2371
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,670
I'm like in the whole thing got
broadcast throughout the whole casino.

2372
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:21,460
So everyone that casino and so I,

2373
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,060
I,

2374
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,980
the first person comes up and she's like,

2375
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:24,400
you know,

2376
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,600
like taking questions like,

2377
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:26,434
have you ever met,

2378
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:27,240
you know,

2379
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,630
will Smith or something like that.

2380
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:29,770
And they're just talking about it.

2381
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,280
And then they're like,

2382
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:30,461
oh,

2383
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,930
and here's Brian Red band.

2384
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,350
I come out and start talking to
doing pussy jokes and calm jokes.

2385
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,400
And Man,

2386
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:40,840
that was the most horrible fucking
set I've ever done in my lap at all.

2387
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:41,650
There was,

2388
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:44,710
there was little pockets where you could
tell there was like a one or two people

2389
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:46,330
that were like getting it,

2390
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:46,730
you know.

2391
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,090
Then most of the people at
least enjoying the discomfort,

2392
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:52,930
much more likely that the
staff told me they love it.

2393
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,310
They said they were
cracking their ass off,

2394
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:57,100
but that was probably because they were
laughing at me having to do all this in

2395
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:57,551
front of it.

2396
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:58,370
But yeah.

2397
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,360
How did the old people,

2398
01:07:59,361 --> 01:08:00,560
did anybody yell at you?

2399
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:00,971
No.

2400
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:01,510
No one,

2401
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:01,841
no one.

2402
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:03,610
Actually no one just said anything.

2403
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,120
The one,

2404
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,230
one of the ladies and the crickets or
whatever they call it did leave and uh,

2405
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,310
I don't know where she went.

2406
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,220
Me and Becker played a bus
once in our early days,

2407
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,870
in the early nineties in Minnesota,

2408
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:16,730
there was a bus that would
people from Minneapolis

2409
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,960
to the Indian casino,

2410
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:21,530
like an hour and a half away
and they hire a comedian.

2411
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:24,230
Did you just walk up and down
the aisle with a cordless mic?

2412
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:24,660
No,

2413
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,520
we dared each other.

2414
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:30,521
We were both going to deal at one time
and I was up first and we go and the bus,

2415
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:33,950
we see the people getting
on and they're elderly,

2416
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:34,940
not just old,

2417
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,200
they're elderly.

2418
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,100
And I'm like,

2419
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,580
I have,

2420
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,290
even if I did clean material,

2421
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,880
it has no reference to them.

2422
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:41,211
They don't,

2423
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:46,140
wouldn't even understand what Columbia
House record and tape club is like.

2424
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,840
So,

2425
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,600
so I go,

2426
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,433
you have to do this.

2427
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,071
I can't do this,

2428
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,660
and I'm going to sheer panic.

2429
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,250
I like flop sweats.

2430
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:56,150
Just thinking about watching
them go on the bus and he's like,

2431
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:56,391
no,

2432
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,350
you're going first.

2433
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,000
Becker's of ball buster notes.

2434
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,130
You good luck buddy.

2435
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,300
Get on.

2436
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,550
And they'd give me the
mic and I look at Becker,

2437
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,970
he's sitting in the stairwell
of the bus and I go,

2438
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,203
all right,

2439
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,340
I'm stealing your act.

2440
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,440
Here I go,

2441
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,220
count.

2442
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,720
I'll give you a dollar for every
one of the jokes of yours at use.

2443
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:17,360
And I did Becker's act.

2444
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,480
I used to sell doorbells door
to door or ring the doorbell.

2445
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:24,261
They answered the door.

2446
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,340
I go out next towels.

2447
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,263
Fitzsimmons

2448
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,800
you got a Gig once while
we were hired by a company,

2449
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:34,830
they wanted comedians just walk around
this aquarium and make funny things and

2450
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,040
talk to people and be funny like,

2451
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:39,671
and we're like,

2452
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:39,781
well,

2453
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:40,630
what's the parameters?

2454
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:41,291
Like what should we do?

2455
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:41,470
Like,

2456
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:41,771
well,

2457
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:41,990
you know,

2458
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,551
just be funny.

2459
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:43,384
Go around and be funny.

2460
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,280
So,

2461
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:44,750
uh,

2462
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,670
Greg,

2463
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:46,810
this was in Greg's young,

2464
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:47,680
angry days.

2465
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:48,331
No,

2466
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:48,990
they still,

2467
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:49,761
they're still here.

2468
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:54,090
I did his podcast a few weeks ago and he
was about to get into a fist fight with

2469
01:09:54,091 --> 01:09:56,550
the owner of the place
he rents his studio from.

2470
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,500
They actually coming in and I'm like,

2471
01:09:58,501 --> 01:09:58,861
hi.

2472
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,460
And he's like,

2473
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,240
fuck you.

2474
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:00,481
Yeah,

2475
01:10:00,481 --> 01:10:01,560
you would've fucking go,

2476
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:04,920
I'll fucking grand walks
right past me and goes,

2477
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:05,161
hey,

2478
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:06,630
like he didn't even recognize me.

2479
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:10,380
He's just boiling mad like you don't see,

2480
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,650
wow,

2481
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,810
that's crazy sauce.

2482
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,153
But anyway,

2483
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,440
back to his earlier I angry days,

2484
01:10:16,441 --> 01:10:16,801
he,

2485
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:17,330
uh,

2486
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:17,700
he

2487
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,120
just,

2488
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,960
there was like,

2489
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,080
it was the opening of this
aquarium or opening of the exhibit,

2490
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:22,800
I guess.

2491
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,070
And so they had like food out there and
people were walking around and plates

2492
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,580
and Greg would just walk up to people
and take food off their plates and eat it

2493
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:30,414
right in front of them.

2494
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,030
All right.

2495
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,260
That was what he thought was funny.

2496
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,220
He's so nice.

2497
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,390
He's a great guy.

2498
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:35,111
He's a great guy.

2499
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:35,710
Look,

2500
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:36,543
he just tries.

2501
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,820
So it was trying to be funny.

2502
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:38,830
He's trying to push the envelope.

2503
01:10:38,831 --> 01:10:39,780
I was trying to get a guy to go,

2504
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:40,321
what the fuck,

2505
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:40,471
man,

2506
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:41,304
I want to do it.

2507
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,490
But that he did it to this guy
and this guy was like so defeated.

2508
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,324
The guys calls years,

2509
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,410
you're an asshole,

2510
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,783
and he did it like that.

2511
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,151
You're,

2512
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:48,984
you're,

2513
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,010
you're an asshole.

2514
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,900
I just walked away and I go,

2515
01:10:51,901 --> 01:10:52,411
hey man,

2516
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:52,690
I go,

2517
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:57,060
you can't be just taking food from people
is he ended up trying to joke around.

2518
01:10:57,061 --> 01:10:58,440
I thought it would be fun to joke around.

2519
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,341
Is he in a bondage?

2520
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:00,820
Does he like to be spanked and titans?

2521
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,183
That's doctrine.

2522
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:04,250
Doug.

2523
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,850
It's in a ball gags and shit

2524
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,020
saying I'm into it.

2525
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,040
That is not me.

2526
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,610
And then he told me that one time.

2527
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:19,210
He said,

2528
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,021
I was joking,

2529
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:20,261
man.

2530
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:21,280
He didn't know I was joking.

2531
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:21,521
I'm like,

2532
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:21,970
dude,

2533
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:22,730
no you aren't.

2534
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,080
They like,

2535
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,260
that's total magic ball gags
and sharing diapers and stuff.

2536
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,360
Well maybe I draw the line.

2537
01:11:28,361 --> 01:11:29,440
I'm into that stuff too,

2538
01:11:29,441 --> 01:11:31,270
but I draw the line at diapers.

2539
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:31,601
Yeah,

2540
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:32,710
that seems a little silly.

2541
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,330
That seems unnecessary to try brand.

2542
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:35,981
Trust me,

2543
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:36,371
man.

2544
01:11:36,371 --> 01:11:37,031
Trust me.

2545
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:37,840
It's great.

2546
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,651
Hey everybody,

2547
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:39,484
I'm wearing it.

2548
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,310
Dunkin is another place in the
spectrum that you wouldn't have known,

2549
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,200
known existed if it wasn't for Dunkin.

2550
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:48,860
You know,

2551
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,400
you wouldn't have known as a Duncan
Trussell out there fucking love Dunkin.

2552
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:53,931
You know,

2553
01:11:53,931 --> 01:11:55,610
he just had a cancer surgery.

2554
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,271
Oh,

2555
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:56,751
that's right.

2556
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:57,584
How did that go?

2557
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,020
He said he feels better
than he's ever felt before.

2558
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:00,440
He goes,

2559
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:00,681
he goes,

2560
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:03,020
turns out having cancer
makes you feel like shit.

2561
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,980
They cut the cancer out
and now he feels great.

2562
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,150
He had one of his uh,

2563
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,013
nuts removed.

2564
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:14,110
Now is it okay if somebody told me was
the biggest job most giant loads has ever

2565
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:15,554
had in his life?

2566
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,940
Said his dick is hard.

2567
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:17,210
Like,

2568
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:17,600
like,

2569
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,800
like high school style.

2570
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,920
Boners it was like is apparently his
whole body was fucked because one of his

2571
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,680
balls had shut down and
it was going funky on him.

2572
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,780
It was crazy.

2573
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,140
Yeah.

2574
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:30,820
Just went through a ball ball thing
right when that happens I'll thing,

2575
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:31,391
yeah.

2576
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:36,391
I did this crazy flight to get diamond
status and I didn't know if was flight

2577
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:36,761
related.

2578
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:39,760
I flew from Tucson to
Johannesburg to Amsterdam,

2579
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:40,594
to Vegas,

2580
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,900
back home through Salt Lake and uh,

2581
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:49,000
Justin just to get
23,000 miles in 72 hours.

2582
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:49,920
How many balls?

2583
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,160
But on the last flight,

2584
01:12:51,161 --> 01:12:54,550
I just started getting this fucking
wicked ball pain in my left nut.

2585
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:01,010
And then like I lasted like two by
the second day if I could get it,

2586
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:02,231
whereas,

2587
01:13:02,231 --> 01:13:03,064
okay.

2588
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,000
Uh,

2589
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,890
but if I got up to stand up and would
just almost floor me like tears in my eyes

2590
01:13:08,891 --> 01:13:10,790
just as like,

2591
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:14,830
like someone like twisting the
fucking back that you know,

2592
01:13:14,831 --> 01:13:16,340
that back cord on your neck

2593
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:18,773
and shit.

2594
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,031
And I,

2595
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:19,530
so I,

2596
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:20,021
I don't,

2597
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,360
I don't go to doctors
unless it's necessary,

2598
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,770
but I did tweet about it.

2599
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,830
Like that's how I get my medical advice.

2600
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:26,830
Go on Twitter and go,

2601
01:13:26,831 --> 01:13:26,981
hey,

2602
01:13:26,981 --> 01:13:28,120
my ball really hurts.

2603
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,410
She pull your groin.

2604
01:13:29,411 --> 01:13:29,870
So I got,

2605
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,121
uh,

2606
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:30,560
the,

2607
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,870
the doctor that's always on ONA.

2608
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:33,970
Dr Oz.

2609
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:34,540
Yeah.

2610
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:34,820
Wait,

2611
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,120
no,

2612
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,470
no.

2613
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:35,950
Steve.

2614
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:36,701
Dr Steve.

2615
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:37,280
Yeah.

2616
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,500
Punk doctor Oz.

2617
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:39,810
So he walked me through his,

2618
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:40,241
he said,

2619
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:41,420
but it's nice and open.

2620
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,390
It's almost definitely this.

2621
01:13:43,391 --> 01:13:47,830
And so I had a friend who brought over
some antibiotics that had been sitting in

2622
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:48,664
their cupboard.

2623
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:49,931
So what did he say?

2624
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:50,764
It was almost,

2625
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,243
it's,

2626
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,570
I forget epidemic.

2627
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,110
It's,

2628
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,970
it begins with an e and it ends with the,

2629
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,740
it never went to a doctor to doctor,

2630
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,880
doctor,

2631
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Doctor Steve and found a lady in town
that had some stashed antibiotics and I

2632
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,960
said I didn't take the full run.

2633
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,070
We have

2634
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,030
to do that.

2635
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,460
She didn't get to cause aids.

2636
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:16,510
You get a car super eight.

2637
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:17,890
Do you know the whole deal?

2638
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:19,180
You know you're not dumb,

2639
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:20,350
you know the whole deal behind that.

2640
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:20,650
Right?

2641
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,000
Like the antibiotics,

2642
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:23,410
the reason why you have
to take the full dose.

2643
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,050
Yeah.

2644
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:24,190
Yeah.

2645
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,070
He creates stronger strains of bacteria.

2646
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,360
So the point where they can't be treated,

2647
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:29,470
that's where mercy comes from.

2648
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,080
It's in my balls and I
don't really fuck anymore.

2649
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:33,970
So I'd figure it's safe you say that,

2650
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,810
but it could get out.

2651
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:36,520
They can creep out of the underwear
in the middle of the night,

2652
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,050
crawl down near your ankles and the
fucking jump free when the close to the

2653
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:43,840
ground you're walking through tall grass.

2654
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:45,880
Like it's time to make God move.

2655
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,630
It's like a heartburn and come jump off
and then they jump on a baby living on

2656
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:50,470
my jock strap.

2657
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:52,930
Cause I said well make sure you
were at something supportive.

2658
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,260
I was wearing a jock strap.

2659
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:55,650
I'm still wearing it.

2660
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,270
Haven't washed this is two
and a half weeks later.

2661
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:02,650
But when it was in full bloom
like I couldn't push a Piss,

2662
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:03,221
I'd piss.

2663
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:05,020
But when it gets to the end part,

2664
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:05,820
so yeah,

2665
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:09,700
I am wearing a filthy to this day.

2666
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:10,540
Yeah.

2667
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,160
Why in this chair?

2668
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,053
Why?

2669
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,670
Why to keep my balls close to,

2670
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,513
but I'm scared.

2671
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:17,530
You just schedule it ball pain yet.

2672
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,773
Yeah.

2673
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,320
So badly.

2674
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,183
Do they hang back?

2675
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,511
Getting keyless?

2676
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:23,051
Some underwear.

2677
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,260
Just one science too tight
and I did that but I still,

2678
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:30,640
I'm wearing the jock jock strap
and you don't wash this thing.

2679
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,630
You just keep what happened?

2680
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:34,150
Cause I didn't want to beat
without it for a laundry cycle.

2681
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:35,080
You need to go to a doctor.

2682
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:35,950
It's like the site.

2683
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,680
My teddy bear now you need to go again.

2684
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,770
It's like my pig pen blanket
that I won't give up.

2685
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,063
It's your [inaudible].

2686
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,200
Oh No.

2687
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,960
Maybe you should just
buy more of them though.

2688
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,610
Like who's that guy and I should,

2689
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:49,720
I should do a lot of things.

2690
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:53,230
I should make another
fucking McAfee Rogan podcast.

2691
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:54,543
I've been busy.

2692
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,830
I've been dealing with
fucking legal briefs.

2693
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:57,641
Yeah.

2694
01:15:57,641 --> 01:15:58,474
It this because,

2695
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:58,841
well,

2696
01:15:58,841 --> 01:15:59,980
you can't say I'll talk,

2697
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:01,290
but after,

2698
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:01,481
yeah,

2699
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:03,940
we'll have to discuss this because the
whole thing is pretty fucking lick.

2700
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:06,070
It is wicked fucking funny.

2701
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,030
Do you,

2702
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:08,801
you're not involved,

2703
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:09,910
you don't do anymore that,

2704
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,660
uh,

2705
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,760
trolling for pedophiles.

2706
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:13,510
Should they use no baiting.org?

2707
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:13,661
No,

2708
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,340
but it's mentioned in the legal brief.

2709
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,353
Is it really?

2710
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,900
I'll show you.

2711
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,733
Oh,

2712
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:22,180
this is like a standard
characteristics of Mr. Standoff.

2713
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,260
The end.

2714
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:26,710
I mean,

2715
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:28,390
as long as you can talk about it on stage,

2716
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:29,171
it's so worth it.

2717
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,004
Whatever you have to pay.

2718
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,440
I'll this footage that we,

2719
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:33,700
that we need to get released,

2720
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,490
it's fucking complete.

2721
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:37,870
Chris Hansen caught on tape.

2722
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,130
Wow.

2723
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,480
That's hilarious.

2724
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,770
That is hilarious.

2725
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,090
That's funny how,

2726
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:44,411
okay.

2727
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:45,244
We can

2728
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,180
do something you had planned.

2729
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:50,170
I have to piss really,

2730
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:50,710
really bad.

2731
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,041
Okay.

2732
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:51,791
You go ahead and Piss.

2733
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:52,061
Really,

2734
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:53,010
really go to a break.

2735
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,890
We're going to talk about school
shootings are going to cheer everybody up.

2736
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,040
Go down a first door
on the right hand side.

2737
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,533
So do you know?

2738
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,850
Uh Huh.

2739
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,070
No,

2740
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,150
it's just like a skull.

2741
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,080
There's,

2742
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,310
there's these tests to do.

2743
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,900
You like Mtma Molly,

2744
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:15,350
you could test the purity of
it and I forget what it was.

2745
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:15,591
It was like,

2746
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:15,741
you know,

2747
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:16,551
if it turns blue,

2748
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:17,630
it's pretty good.

2749
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:17,900
You know,

2750
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,430
it's pretty pure turns purple.

2751
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:20,090
It's amazing.

2752
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,380
If it starts smoking,

2753
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,420
it's like almost a hundred percent pure.

2754
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,303
MTMA.

2755
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,990
So the stuff I did last night was smoking
and like this rich billionaire guy,

2756
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,160
a guy who parties like every day,

2757
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:31,740
he,

2758
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,331
he's just like,

2759
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,820
come to my mentioned later if you want to,

2760
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,090
we have a party every night.

2761
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,983
Like it's crazy.

2762
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,093
But uh,

2763
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:37,911
hold on.

2764
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:38,331
Slow down.

2765
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:39,320
You shitty storyteller.

2766
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,790
Who is this rich billionaire?

2767
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,850
Where are you when you're meeting
this guy through another person?

2768
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,130
Through a secret secret person.

2769
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:46,581
Okay.

2770
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:51,110
So secret person knows rich billionaire
who likes to party somehow or another

2771
01:17:51,111 --> 01:17:52,220
get secret person,

2772
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:53,850
some MDM,

2773
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,490
but it's just a hundred percent pure,

2774
01:17:55,491 --> 01:17:56,450
100% pure.

2775
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,520
Is that the stuff that
gives you no headaches?

2776
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,130
Is that right?

2777
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,090
It's pretty much ecstasy with just,

2778
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,340
it's just pure ecstasy
as nothing else in it.

2779
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,960
So you take this stuff so it takes the
stuff and immediately I had to like,

2780
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,980
like just close my eyes
fall to the ground.

2781
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:13,790
Like every single pour my body
felt like there was just like,

2782
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,550
or like cum coming out of
every single hole of my body.

2783
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:17,810
Fucking amazing.

2784
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:18,290
Really?

2785
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:18,860
Yeah.

2786
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,693
How much did you take?

2787
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,593
How many pills?

2788
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:21,903
Uh,

2789
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,350
to uh,

2790
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,050
to two,

2791
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:24,883
each

2792
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,040
problem with ecstasy.

2793
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,210
Like it's the same thing.

2794
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,130
The problem that exists
with medical marijuana,

2795
01:18:30,131 --> 01:18:31,150
it's like your dosage.

2796
01:18:31,151 --> 01:18:33,970
Like who the fuck knows
what your dosages are?

2797
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,200
Like if you buy a cookie,

2798
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:36,490
a medical marijuana cookie,

2799
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:38,020
you're really taking it crazy.

2800
01:18:38,021 --> 01:18:38,740
Giant risk.

2801
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,920
You really have no idea.

2802
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,170
The way red band described it
is he has some kind of test.

2803
01:18:44,171 --> 01:18:46,810
Who knows what scientist
gave them the information.

2804
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,860
But if you,

2805
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:51,340
you apply this whatever to the ecstasy,

2806
01:18:51,341 --> 01:18:54,320
if it turns blue and telling a
story did while you were paying.

2807
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:54,550
Yeah,

2808
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:55,450
I was just telling us that.

2809
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,320
Yeah,

2810
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,520
that's scientific as fuck.

2811
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:58,500
That's like a mood.

2812
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,403
Right?

2813
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,420
But it's crazy cause I got to,

2814
01:19:03,421 --> 01:19:05,880
I thought that your show is at
a different theater last night.

2815
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:06,630
So I was like,

2816
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,081
oh,

2817
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,280
it's at the pantageous theater.

2818
01:19:08,281 --> 01:19:10,470
So I got the hotel right
across the street from it,

2819
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,330
and of course it was the wrong theater,

2820
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,164
but the,

2821
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,120
it was just half awesome
how that worked out there.

2822
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:15,421
Like,

2823
01:19:15,421 --> 01:19:15,870
uh,

2824
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:16,260
uh,

2825
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,650
do you want a king size bed?

2826
01:19:17,651 --> 01:19:17,881
And I'm like,

2827
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:18,061
yeah,

2828
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:18,300
sure.

2829
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:18,821
King size bed.

2830
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:19,260
And they're like,

2831
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:19,620
oh,

2832
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,880
you're here for business or pleasure.

2833
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:21,150
I'm like,

2834
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,983
Oh man,

2835
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,480
we've got to show across the
street and stuff like that.

2836
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:24,990
She goes,

2837
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,321
Oh,

2838
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:27,180
well let me upgrade you
from when you were tanning.

2839
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,081
He goes,

2840
01:19:28,081 --> 01:19:28,920
I'm a comic.

2841
01:19:28,921 --> 01:19:29,754
And she goes,

2842
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,983
let me upgrade you.

2843
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:31,261
Yeah.

2844
01:19:31,261 --> 01:19:34,280
And so we got like the pimps
repeating like the puff daddy sweet.

2845
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:34,501
Yeah.

2846
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:35,610
You're told us this already.

2847
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,390
Rapper sweet.

2848
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,571
Yeah.

2849
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,460
But I was off the air and I just,

2850
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:38,770
okay,

2851
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,400
sorry.

2852
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:39,760
Yeah.

2853
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,360
Um,

2854
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:40,661
yeah.

2855
01:19:40,661 --> 01:19:42,820
That's funny that you thought
it was the wrong place.

2856
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:43,840
You're so fucked up.

2857
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:44,651
Like learn what?

2858
01:19:44,651 --> 01:19:46,090
Theater that the name,

2859
01:19:46,091 --> 01:19:47,020
it's a different name,

2860
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:47,471
right?

2861
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:48,200
One starts with,

2862
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,080
it starts with a w,

2863
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:53,950
I don't know because it's been on my
website and I'll fucking six [inaudible]

2864
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:56,480
and love by Ricky Lee Jones
and that's where chuck,

2865
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,530
he was sitting behind us down
at the pantageous Chucky.

2866
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:04,630
Apparently her voice is shot in.

2867
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,780
She has something called more Jaylin's.

2868
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:07,773
Do you know what,

2869
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,621
hang on,

2870
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:09,371
let me get a pen.

2871
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:09,940
Is it,

2872
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,470
is it terminal?

2873
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,060
No,

2874
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,380
God,

2875
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,151
I need my death.

2876
01:20:13,151 --> 01:20:13,360
Pug.

2877
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,940
Got To get my dental picks ready for 2013

2878
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,550
Morgellons is what they think
is a crazy person's disease.

2879
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,140
They don't know what the fuck this is,

2880
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:25,150
but apparently it's fibers that are
embedded in people's skin and you can pull

2881
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:26,860
them out and not only
can you pull them out,

2882
01:20:26,861 --> 01:20:31,861
but somehow or another the related to
nanotechnology and they actually vibrate

2883
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:34,380
with music like eight out of 10

2884
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,590
tell Jesse Ventura looked into this.

2885
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,760
A lot of people looked into this.

2886
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,021
It sounds crazy,

2887
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:40,290
but this actually can be,

2888
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:43,040
there's fibers that react to music.

2889
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,440
[inaudible] have gone.

2890
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:50,441
We'll sit by applying and those fibers
in her arm as a former governor,

2891
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:57,050
loud to just walk into the CIA and go
through your files are maybe she'll,

2892
01:20:57,130 --> 01:21:00,430
why can't I go to area 51 pull,

2893
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,153
pull up pictures,

2894
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,013
more jelly beans.

2895
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,340
It's a skin disorder.

2896
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,400
And these people that get these horrible
rashes on their skin and the more

2897
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:12,590
Jelena and more jealous disease.

2898
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,780
Well Joni Mitchell has it and uh,

2899
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:17,360
some baseball was some famous
baseball player has it.

2900
01:21:17,361 --> 01:21:18,650
And if you look at images it's like,

2901
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,240
do people have pictures of this shit?

2902
01:21:20,241 --> 01:21:21,260
It's really strange.

2903
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,513
It's um,

2904
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:25,190
they're these tiny
fibers and these people,

2905
01:21:25,191 --> 01:21:25,730
they grow up,

2906
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:29,960
they have like scabs on their skin
and these fibers grow their scabs.

2907
01:21:29,961 --> 01:21:30,794
You see that shit?

2908
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,350
Well there's doctors that have like,

2909
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:33,801
you know,

2910
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,390
I mean they've done tests on these things.

2911
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,510
They don't know what the fuck they are
and they think that it's related to

2912
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,630
nanotechnology and nano
fibers and clothing.

2913
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:45,260
All of these different things that they
can self assemble somehow when under the

2914
01:21:45,261 --> 01:21:47,420
right circumstances
they can self assemble.

2915
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,130
And when they do that,

2916
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,380
the problem is these things are moving.

2917
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:54,680
And dividing and growing
inside someone's skin.

2918
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,580
I hate when you're smart.

2919
01:21:59,180 --> 01:21:59,941
That's not smart.

2920
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:01,020
This is repeating shit.

2921
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:01,790
That's smart people.

2922
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,281
I know.

2923
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:02,770
That's,

2924
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:03,150
I know.

2925
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,790
I hate that you remember all that shit.

2926
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,770
I read a book about something smart.

2927
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:08,341
It's gone.

2928
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:09,720
As soon as I shut the book,

2929
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,060
my fucking head is completely empty again.

2930
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,300
I find that a documentaries
for whatever reason,

2931
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:19,140
I can remember things more
from documentaries and
exactly and I've always used

2932
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:21,180
that argument about
people who have fucking,

2933
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:21,700
oh well yeah.

2934
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,680
What pickup a book.

2935
01:22:22,681 --> 01:22:23,400
Every now and then.

2936
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,920
I don't remember it visual,

2937
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:26,680
you know,

2938
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,650
I see something on TV.

2939
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:29,940
It sticks in my head more.

2940
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,320
I had some more engaging medium.

2941
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,630
It's like what I was talking about last
night when people talk to you about game

2942
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:34,171
of Thrones,

2943
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:34,351
like,

2944
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:34,561
oh,

2945
01:22:34,561 --> 01:22:36,540
you should read the book or
you should read the book.

2946
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,430
There's so much better and like
how the fuck could it be better?

2947
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:41,190
I'm looking at naked people and dragons.

2948
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,430
How could it be better if I'm reading
your telling me that's better.

2949
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,333
You're full of shit.

2950
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,230
Oh Shit.

2951
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,370
It's not as engaging.

2952
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:47,971
I do.

2953
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:48,804
I do find it,

2954
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:53,250
reading helps my creative process
because it forces you to imagine.

2955
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,560
And so it's better for writing.

2956
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:57,330
If I read something I thoroughly agree.

2957
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:01,690
What's the fucking great
documentary guy of hers arm?

2958
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:02,611
No,

2959
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:02,851
no,

2960
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:04,290
he's a British guy.

He doesn't really text that much.

3041
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:36,763
It's not really,

3042
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,950
I've just always been my
manager against your manager.

3043
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,530
Your manager wins and that's her.

01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,340
But Google beat your managers.

3045
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,300

3046

01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:38,840
we,

3134
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,673
we all got,

3135
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,690
we all got white except for Jr.

3136
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,350
He's the only,

3137
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,180
cause they're all built for fat people.

3138
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,520
So the rest of us are small.

3139
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:48,140
So we had to get white with different,

3140
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,040
like we,

3141
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,730
I had a,

3142
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,120
uh,

3143
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,360
pink and Charlie got black
and Carlos got purple,

3144
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,530
like juniors,

3145
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,600
like six foot something.

3146
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,510
He looks just like the Indian from
one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

3147
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,400
Looks like a retarded Mitch Hedberg,

3148
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:02,450
like a misshapen head.

3149
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:03,861
Mitch Hedberg,

3150
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:04,190
long,

3151
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,360
long stringy hair.

3152
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:08,210
And she got aqua blue.

3153
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,290
Uh,

3154
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:13,160
but Chaley like he'll dress like me
and these ridiculous leisure suits,

3155
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,200
but somehow people take them seriously.

3156
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:15,980
And He,

3157
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,690
I get hate mail from him.

3158
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,580
Just going up to introduce the show.

3159
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:20,331
Welcome to the show.

3160
01:27:20,331 --> 01:27:21,680
Turn off your cell phones.

3161
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,820
We have a great show for
you tonight and here's it.

3162
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:28,460
And someone emailed me and that first
guy with the fucking weird mustaches,

3163
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,510
he fucking sucked like
he introduced the show.

3164
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,990
But people know when someone's socks,

3165
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:34,440
even when they're just introducing Sunday.

3166
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:35,391
Okay,

3167
01:27:35,391 --> 01:27:36,680
you got can't fuck with them.

3168
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:38,810
This guy gets standing
ovations when he goes on stage.

3169
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,620
How dare you?

3170
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,340
How dare you?

3171
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:43,670
That's pit your slave up
against my master craftsmen.

3172
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:44,271
Oh No,

3173
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:44,841
my guys,

3174
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:46,240
the fucking he can play.

3175
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,470
I can play any base in the gameplay,

3176
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,331
in a fucking band.

3177
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,164
Stupid.

3178
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:52,130
Go play.

3179
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,140
He can do that too.

3180
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:55,250
That there you play and he's in a band.

3181
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:56,661
My Song,

3182
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:57,820
I wrote those garden bumps.

3183
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:59,150
It's been remade five times.

3184
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:02,180
Hade it's almost as big as day.

3185
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,041
That's good for him,

3186
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:04,311
man.

3187
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:06,400
He's delivering newspapers to look guys,

3188
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,303
you've got a slave.

3189
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:11,410
You take it a slave and you putting
them up against the specialist.

3190
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:12,260
That's ridiculous.

3191
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:14,150
Barden read Ben's legit.

3192
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,170
How dare you sir.

3193
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:15,980
How dare you?

3194
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,590
He's mad.

3195
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,510
Doug's just mad at me.

3196
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,310
He treats his guy like a slave.

3197
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:20,240
He's women live under,

3198
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:22,040
I'm just promoting my guys.

3199
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:22,641
The Guy Out,

3200
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:25,850
he sends the guy out to go fucking
take gum off his tires and shit.

3201
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,110
Hey death squad.

3202
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:27,944
I hope that uh,

3203
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,300
at junior stop cut has 50,000
fucking Twitter followers by now.

3204
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:32,511
Well,

3205
01:28:32,511 --> 01:28:33,230
I don't even even think.

3206
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:35,990
I'm glad you heard about that organically.

3207
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:37,520
Totally organically.

3208
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,720
Everybody was talking about it.

3209
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:39,890
Apparently he's a,

3210
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,750
he fucking killed at the comedy store.

3211
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:43,490
A lot of people saying is this big guy.

3212
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:44,640
He's got crazy hair,

3213
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:48,260
I guess like Hedberg but
stringy Indian version.

3214
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:49,820
I just started following him on Twitter.

3215
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:50,990
I advise you to do the same.

3216
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:54,200
We're only at 1,134 fucking followers.

3217
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:57,650
I think by the end of this show we
can at least get them up to 2000.

3218
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:00,410
I'm not asking for a crazy amount
and that's a reasonable request,

3219
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:01,244
ladies and gentlemen,

3220
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,100
because it goes,

3221
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,790
follow him.

3222
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:04,440
It's junior stopcock,

3223
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,660
s t o p k and uh,

3224
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:08,530
the fucking Dude loves funny pks.

3225
01:29:08,531 --> 01:29:13,290
Stop like stop sign and k a repeated what
you did earlier and you didn't add the

3226
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:13,891
a earlier.

3227
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,140
And then I asked you if there
was an a and you said yeah.

3228
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,300
And then I did the same
fucking thing cause I'm,

3229
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:19,380
see that's what I'm good at.

3230
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:20,550
I'm good at repeating shit.

3231
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,170
That's stupid.

3232
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,780
It's a fucking Roos,

3233
01:29:23,781 --> 01:29:24,614
ladies and gentlemen.

3234
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,400
But um,

3235
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,110
this is a picture of junior sub can his
Twitter following and he's smoking a

3236
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:33,111
cigarette and his hair is long and pulled
behind his ears to shitty choices in

3237
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,134
life.

3238
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,660
He didn't really has no choice
what to do with his hair.

3239
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:37,140
You know,

3240
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,370
you see his hair and you go,

3241
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:41,160
that's just going to lay
like that no matter what,

3242
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,590
unless you got a giant crazy perm.

3243
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:44,700
Unless he got some like,

3244
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,730
like Eddie Bravo spiky thing going on.

3245
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:48,623
Maybe you could do that.

3246
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,160
Do you know possum man?

3247
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:51,243
No,

3248
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:52,111
but he looks,

3249
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:53,400
he looks kind of like possum.

3250
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:56,250
And I have for you a
hardcore Hedberg fans.

3251
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:58,390
What is possible possum mal junior stop.

3252
01:29:58,391 --> 01:29:59,670
Go right there as junior.

3253
01:29:59,671 --> 01:29:59,971
Yeah.

3254
01:29:59,971 --> 01:30:01,710
Well that's a face and a half right there.

3255
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:02,101
Sign.

3256
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:02,731
Holy Shit.

3257
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:03,750
Is he parked Korean?

3258
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,470
The fuck is he parked
Korean or part Frisbee?

3259
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,050
He's just straight up retarded.

3260
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:11,143
It's great.

3261
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,990
He is so fucking good.

3262
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,920
Where'd you pick him up?

3263
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,873
Chicago.

3264
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:15,390
Yeah.

3265
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:15,910
Is there,

3266
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,890
did you work for Ritter ever now?

3267
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,710
I'm one of the things I was saying,

3268
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:19,921
I was,

3269
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:22,320
I did this a bunch of
interviews yesterday because uh,

3270
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,340
my new special just came out and I had
to do a bunch of these things and uh,

3271
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,520
but one of the things I was saying
was that like a real network,

3272
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:30,000
like,

3273
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,390
like,

3274
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,230
like death squad.

3275
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,650
Like we actually have a
network and it's not official,

3276
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:34,950
but that,

3277
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:35,220
you know,

3278
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,700
it's not like written down in
a contract form or anything.

3279
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:43,500
But what it is is there's a network of
people that are really funny and they're

3280
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:45,000
all connected with each other.

3281
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:48,780
And like if I tell you about
Duncan trussell's cause
Duncan Trussell hilarious.

3282
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,620
If I say,

3283
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:49,831
Hey,

3284
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:51,060
go listen to bill Burr,

3285
01:30:51,061 --> 01:30:52,320
I'm not steering you wrong.

3286
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:54,660
I'm telling you about like
really hilarious shit.

3287
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:57,060
And that's what I heard about this junior.

3288
01:30:57,061 --> 01:30:57,601
Stop you kid.

3289
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:57,900
I'm like,

3290
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:58,171
Doug,

3291
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:59,520
Stan hubs taking them
on the road with him.

3292
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,630
He's gotta be funny.

3293
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,291
And then it was like,

3294
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:02,340
this guy's hilarious.

3295
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,270
And then boom.

3296
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,060
It's like everybody's
talking about them already.

3297
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,910
Tells me about I'm Dunkin
tells me about him.

3298
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:08,850
A couple of people tell me
about him and it's like,

3299
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:10,530
I love that.

3300
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,190
I love,

3301
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,150
I love that.

3302
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,040
That that is a real network is that
comics are getting support from all these

3303
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:18,870
other like like your green lighting gum.

3304
01:31:18,871 --> 01:31:19,411
You know what I mean?

3305
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:21,660
Like you're like this kid's greenlit.

3306
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:25,920
Put them on the road for his
first legitimate road trip.

3307
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,220
So to watch with new eyes,

3308
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:33,540
what you used to be so excited
about and you're so bored with,

3309
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,010
I'm not bored with it.

3310
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:35,910
No,

3311
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:36,610
I'm saying that the,

3312
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:40,220
just the minutia of him getting
a free drink at the bar.

3313
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:41,711
Exactly.

3314
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:42,580
That he did.

3315
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:47,520
He bingo had to show him the how to use
a roller bag cause he didn't know how

3316
01:31:47,521 --> 01:31:47,790
the,

3317
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:51,050
he couldn't figure out the button
part of it to make the handle go down.

3318
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:56,480
He went to a military website to
learn how to fold clothes properly.

3319
01:31:56,551 --> 01:31:57,660
To put in.

3320
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,153
Wow.

3321
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:00,300
You know what,

3322
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,790
can we play some of his shit online?

3323
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,753
Yeah.

3324
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:05,420
I've never found anything
where the audio is any good.

3325
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:13,550
Does Brian know he's got
to youtube things open?

3326
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,840
Do you got another youtube thing open?

3327
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,231
Yeah,

3328
01:32:18,231 --> 01:32:19,790
he's good at listening to.

3329
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,620
That was the original kicks.

3330
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:22,610
Please cancel that.

3331
01:32:22,611 --> 01:32:24,050
That's killing up bandwidth son.

3332
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,850
I see a lady reversed on me.

3333
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,580
This sounds sad.

3334
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,770
It's nothing good on youtube.

3335
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:43,981
Well,

3336
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:44,371
you know,

3337
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:47,070
that was me until I put out my first CD.

3338
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:48,570
I don't have anything good out there.

3339
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,410
You know,

3340
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,940
it's funny that we knew and I,

3341
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,240
we never would really think of you.

3342
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:55,890
You don't want to think of that somehow
or another were from a different era,

3343
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,100
but we really are.

3344
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,840
Fuck yeah,

3345
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,550
we came up in the era of no Internet.

3346
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,001
Yeah.

3347
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:03,390
We had to send a VHS tape
to a club to get booked.

3348
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,840
It's hard to really wrap my head sitting
here and there's this office that we're

3349
01:33:06,841 --> 01:33:09,120
renting out just to do the internet,

3350
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:09,661
you know,

3351
01:33:09,661 --> 01:33:10,580
with uh,

3352
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:11,780
Brian and our,

3353
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:12,743
and uh,

3354
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:13,351
you know,

3355
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:16,140
and everybody attached is our
whole lives completely different.

3356
01:33:16,141 --> 01:33:17,700
Just because the engine is a gym.

3357
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:18,871
This guy right here,

3358
01:33:18,871 --> 01:33:19,650
that's Jamie.

3359
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,130
Jamie.

3360
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:20,640
All right,

3361
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,100
well you do go.

3362
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,050
It's Brian and I,

3363
01:33:22,051 --> 01:33:22,920
and then you motioned to him.

3364
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:26,660
I'm waiting [inaudible]
names so I don't call him.

3365
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,190
I met like all the people that were
there in the beginning of this whole

3366
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:29,761
craziness.

3367
01:33:29,761 --> 01:33:30,061
It's like,

3368
01:33:30,061 --> 01:33:31,540
it's all because of I need,

3369
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,580
I need a backup.

3370
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,060
Uh,

3371
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,870
just for,

3372
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:34,200
uh,

3373
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:34,710
okay.

3374
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:34,811
Uh,

3375
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:35,610
what was the giggle?

3376
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,060
Yeah.

3377
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,271
Yeah.

3378
01:33:36,271 --> 01:33:37,170
The giggle was that,

3379
01:33:37,171 --> 01:33:40,410
that wasn't Hennigan that texted me,

3380
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:40,830
so,

3381
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:41,190
oh,

3382
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:46,190
I can't put Hannigan against Sussman
anymore because I just assumed some guy

3383
01:33:46,231 --> 01:33:48,820
that has my number you can
put of going against us.

3384
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:49,060
One,

3385
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:51,450
because Hennigan would probably crack
under pressure and it's awesome.

3386
01:33:51,451 --> 01:33:53,220
Just got fucking antifreeze in his veins.

3387
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,050
Trust.

3388
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:54,361
Yeah,

3389
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:58,300
but fertilizer as a reason
why you crossed some clients.

3390
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,730
Brian works solely,

3391
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,960
you know how many clients he's got?

3392
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,010
One.

3393
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:02,420
Really?

3394
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:02,750
Yeah.

3395
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,660
You got the same deal?

3396
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,141
No,

3397
01:34:04,141 --> 01:34:05,280
he's got one other client.

3398
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:06,900
Oh yeah.

3399
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:10,320
It's like another guy who's a
director is pretty low maintenance,

3400
01:34:10,321 --> 01:34:10,950
but it's like,

3401
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:12,320
it's three people all the time.

3402
01:34:12,321 --> 01:34:12,930
The agency.

3403
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:13,650
All right,

3404
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:14,160
beautiful.

3405
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:14,431
Yeah.

3406
01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:15,264
They don't fuck around,

3407
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:17,370
suspends the cleaner.

3408
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:22,050
But he was fucking strong on the marriage
and he's wrong about a lot of shit too

3409
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:22,231
though.

3410
01:34:22,231 --> 01:34:24,660
He told me not to have the
fleshlight sponsor the podcast.

3411
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,531
Oh yeah.

3412
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:26,790
He doesn't like me talking about this.

3413
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,240
And that's by Brian talked
me into doing that Oslo DVD.

3414
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,440
So what was wrong with the Oslo DVD?

3415
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,030
Didn't like it.

3416
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:37,950
It was fucking brand new material
that if I did the same material nine,

3417
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:38,940
six months later,

3418
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:40,380
even it would have been a fucking great.

3419
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:41,370
Great.

3420
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:41,760
Yeah.

3421
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,650
Honestly that wasn't one
of my favorites of yours.

3422
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:43,861
Oh,

3423
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:44,291
I ate it.

3424
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:44,460
It,

3425
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,180
but uh,

3426
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,481
you know,

3427
01:34:45,481 --> 01:34:48,450
and I worry sometimes when someone
puts out something that like,

3428
01:34:48,451 --> 01:34:48,751
man,

3429
01:34:48,751 --> 01:34:51,780
like maybe like they're losing
enthusiasm or the health's not good.

3430
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:54,810
But then you came back with
before turning the gun on himself.

3431
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,070
Holy Shit.

3432
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,160
Was that good in my car,

3433
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,083
listening,

3434
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,700
clapping and laughing.

3435
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:02,660
Long drive.

3436
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,411
That's what we did.

3437
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:06,440
When we listen to your fucking
Jamie Kilstein podcasts,

3438
01:35:06,441 --> 01:35:07,250
we were in,

3439
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:11,690
in the van with junior and jumping
out of our fucking van seats,

3440
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:13,370
like fucking unruly children.

3441
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:14,780
Go to a special school.

3442
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:14,901
Well,

3443
01:35:14,901 --> 01:35:16,760
you never even saw the Jamie kills team.

3444
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:18,440
Delusion videotaped this kid.

3445
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:18,860
Uh,

3446
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,530
Brandon Aka the mischief maker on Youtube,

3447
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:23,360
put out kills team.

3448
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:24,760
Went on his podcast.

3449
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:24,941
Yeah,

3450
01:35:24,941 --> 01:35:25,100
no,

3451
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,300
I did see that on Youtube.

3452
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:28,640
That was fucking crazy.

3453
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,870
And that was sad.

3454
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:30,770
There's two parts to it.

3455
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:31,221
I don't know if you ever,

3456
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:31,791
yeah,

3457
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,320
I can't watch the rest of it.

3458
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:34,910
It's just say it ran its course.

3459
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,421
Yes.

3460
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:40,421
It ran its course and he was talking
about it recently on a stage and he said

3461
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:43,040
that he was on a news channel.

3462
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:48,050
I mean the way he described the situation
was that he was on a news station and

3463
01:35:48,051 --> 01:35:53,051
that he was saying that rape is bad
and that he got all this hate from the

3464
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:54,134
Internet.

3465
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:54,861
I was like,

3466
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:55,641
wow.

3467
01:35:55,641 --> 01:36:00,641
You talk about like painting Oban Fuck
is biased picture of what actually

3468
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:01,994
happened.

3469
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,050
You know,

3470
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:04,530
the idea to me is going to,

3471
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,520
this is going to drive me
crazy to the end of the time.

3472
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:06,631
The,

3473
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:08,300
one of the things I loved about Bill Burr,

3474
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,010
there was a video of that I saw of Paul
Provenza show the green room and bill

3475
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:17,750
burr was on there with 'em Lizz Winstead
and they were debating back and forth

3476
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:19,520
about the whole Tracy Morgan thing.

3477
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,181
And he's like,

3478
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:20,541
what was this?

3479
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:25,220
The best innography in the history of the
world is fucking guy remembers exactly

3480
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:27,440
what he says after a whole hour set.

3481
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,700
He could tell you exactly the word for
word what this guy said and the context

3482
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:32,421
in which she said it,

3483
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:33,380
get the fuck outta here.

3484
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:33,771
You know?

3485
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:34,280
And I was like,

3486
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,120
thank you.

3487
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:37,040
And then the other was in the green room.

3488
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,261
Yeah,

3489
01:36:37,261 --> 01:36:37,610
yeah,

3490
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:38,030
yeah.

3491
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,520
And I so love that bill did that,

3492
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:41,090
but the,

3493
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,540
and the,

3494
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:41,950
you know,

3495
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:42,060
the,

3496
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,380
the other thing that drives
me crazy about this whole,

3497
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:45,590
uh,

3498
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:46,191
like shit,

3499
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,200
like the Tracy Morgan thing
and it relates to this,

3500
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:51,800
is that everybody wants
to pretend that the,

3501
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:52,430
the,

3502
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:56,480
there's not an art form
and saying unbelievably
ridiculous shit that you don't

3503
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:57,120
really mean.

3504
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:57,500
Yeah,

3505
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,850
it's a fucking art forum.

3506
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,110
It's just like Nwa talking about shooting
cops and not really shooting cops.

3507
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:03,650
Okay.

3508
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:06,500
They used to be in a fucking
band where they did like disco.

3509
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,240
Okay.

3510
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:07,701
They're just,

3511
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:08,780
this is the art form.

3512
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:10,130
This is what they're trying to sell.

3513
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:15,410
And with a guy like Tracy Morgan or
a guy like Brian Holtzman or dice,

3514
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:16,040
you know,

3515
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,030
had Holtzman on,

3516
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:17,691
no,

3517
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:18,920
we gotta we gotta locate him.

3518
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:19,920
Apparently he's like a,

3519
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,710
he's a meter maid or something.

3520
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:22,791
But he was,

3521
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:27,791
you said he was just out since the fucking
new town shooting talking about it at

3522
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:28,784
the comedy store?

3523
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,723
I didn't,

3524
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:30,051
no,

3525
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:30,800
I didn't say that.

3526
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,730
You were saying he was like,

3527
01:37:31,731 --> 01:37:32,750
those kids went bad.

3528
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,141
None of them.

3529
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,250
That was Susan Smith.

3530
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,790
He was talking to a woman who drowned.

3531
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,420
I thought he was out doing,

3532
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:43,820
I surely has banned him from the comedy
store after nine 11 for like a week.

3533
01:37:43,821 --> 01:37:45,020
Cause they knew he'd say the bad,

3534
01:37:45,021 --> 01:37:45,854
bad thing.

3535
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:47,090
He was saying the bad,

3536
01:37:47,091 --> 01:37:47,924
bad things.

3537
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:49,970
The Susan Smith thing was,

3538
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:50,661
that was,

3539
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:50,870
uh,

3540
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:51,860
the woman who drowned her.

3541
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:52,881
It wasn't?

3542
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:53,031
No,

3543
01:37:53,031 --> 01:37:53,641
that was I,

3544
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:54,200
I just,

3545
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,040
I heard a half a,

3546
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,850
Oh,

3547
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:57,990
and I assumed when you said,

3548
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,820
and he's up there on
stage and that he's a bad,

3549
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:00,930
bad kids anyway.

3550
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:04,050
I get assumed like people like
Lizz Winstead and a video.

3551
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:05,970
Then that shit infuriates me.

3552
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,960
The idea that you're going to pretend
that this is a statement of his opinions

3553
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,220
and not a re who is the top.

3554
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,040
She created the daily show.

3555
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,600
It's a very intelligent woman.

3556
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,250
She was her roots.

3557
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:18,210
She just stand up.

3558
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,790
She started out as a standing
standout Chelsea handler.

3559
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:21,780
Where did she come from?

3560
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:23,101
She was again,

3561
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:24,240
she's a good comic man.

3562
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:28,070
She was a very good comic
ever as a common well,

3563
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:28,621
I knew her.

3564
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:29,760
I knew her from the store,

3565
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:30,151
you know,

3566
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:31,770
I always respected her as a comic.

3567
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,990
I think she'd be great
to get hammered with.

3568
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:34,741
Yeah,

3569
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:36,180
she's a bad ass bitch man.

3570
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,350
She's a bad ass bitch.

3571
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:41,460
He's religious and so's Lizz Winstead
she's legit to me and she's really

3572
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:42,001
brilliant,

3573
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:44,580
but she also like a lot
of brilliant people.

3574
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:49,110
She's like incredibly like rigid and
stubborn and our ideas and this idea that,

3575
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:49,973
you know,

3576
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:50,813
I look,

3577
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:54,960
there's a weird idea that if you're in
somehow or another making fun of anything

3578
01:38:54,961 --> 01:38:59,400
gay or somehow or another making fun of
anything that has to do with women that

3579
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,020
you,

3580
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:01,650
you somehow or another,

3581
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:04,020
especially coming from the
point of view of a white male,

3582
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:07,500
which is like we are
judged as always being the,

3583
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,920
the,

3584
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,590
the most fucked up in our beliefs,

3585
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:12,690
the least deserving of any,

3586
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:14,580
any slack,

3587
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:14,881
you know,

3588
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:17,640
the white male is like the
real problem in this society.

3589
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:22,640
So when a white male is making fun of
gays or women and so all of a sudden you

3590
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,040
are anti gang or a
sudden you're anti women,

3591
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:28,200
it's completely ridiculous.

3592
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,940
And I could see the fact that a lot
of people feel like there's some,

3593
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,840
some back work to be made up when
it comes to like the gay community.

3594
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:39,990
Like there's some like some damage that
means it needs to be covered because it

3595
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:44,820
must absolutely suck to be gay and have
to deal with all these fucking people

3596
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:48,240
that have an issue with what your
natural desires are with a bunch of other

3597
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:49,051
people that are the same.

3598
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:51,990
Natural desires are with
the same natural desires.

3599
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:52,920
It's so stupid.

3600
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:56,130
I so I can see this wanting
to protect and defend them,

3601
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:01,700
but you can't pretend that someone just
fucking around is being serious because

3602
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:04,320
then you ruin the whole point
you're making because their whole,

3603
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:05,340
you point you're making,

3604
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:07,590
you're making about real
people in real life.

3605
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,210
When Tracy Morgan is like,

3606
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:09,931
my son was gay,

3607
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:11,190
I stabbed that little Nigga.

3608
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,110
He's not being serious.

3609
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,360
You're confusing,

3610
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:15,750
uh,

3611
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,300
an art form with real life,

3612
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:20,000
with the real statements of real life.

3613
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:24,030
He is a serious in the fact that
his child would be a nigger.

3614
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:25,351
I mean,

3615
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:27,300
technically he doesn't use the art.

3616
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:27,650
It's,

3617
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:28,890
it don't you understand?

3618
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:29,190
Well,

3619
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,390
maybe he's from Boston.

3620
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:31,613
Uh,

3621
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:34,943
the uh,

3622
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:35,450

3623
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:35,650
the,

3624
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:35,820
the,

3625
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,120
the,

3626
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:36,301
the,

3627
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:36,991
I know I said,

3628
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:37,824
Nigga,

3629
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:38,843
Nigga,

3630
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:41,070
the idea that a comic would,

3631
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:41,730
you know,

3632
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:46,730
would step up and try to say like a guy
joking around with hecklers about rape

3633
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:48,930
is supporting rape culture.

3634
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,773
I know.

3635
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:50,330
That's,

3636
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,040
yeah.

3637
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:51,873
Damn God.

3638
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:52,621
Yeah.

3639
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:53,454
They're stuck.

3640
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,640
Not make me fucking boil.

3641
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,010
Boil with chimpanzee rage.

3642
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:04,530
Just fucking wild dick biting rate.

3643
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:07,740
That's the real rage.

3644
01:41:07,741 --> 01:41:08,790
Not Human rage.

3645
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,530
You have a lot less rage.

3646
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,930
I said watching you last night.

3647
01:41:12,931 --> 01:41:13,530
I go,

3648
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:16,920
Joe has like this whole
human aspect to them now.

3649
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,010
I think it might've been
when you uttered the word.

3650
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:25,160
Well now I'm a father and you didn't like
go like normally a comics has now I'm

3651
01:41:25,471 --> 01:41:25,951
a father.

3652
01:41:25,951 --> 01:41:26,340
You Go,

3653
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:26,581
oh,

3654
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,230
I never want to hear you again,

3655
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:28,831
right?

3656
01:41:28,831 --> 01:41:29,080
Yeah.

3657
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:31,560
Louis C K is that made it okay

3658
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,380
to not go down that her babies
are like little drug people.

3659
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:39,720
I would've never done that road anyway.

3660
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,050
No.

3661
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:43,230
I always felt like there
was that for a minute.

3662
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:44,340
I wasn't afraid of you

3663
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,630
just seemed like nicer.

3664
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,770
I'm always been nice,

3665
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:50,230
man.

3666
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:50,900
I just look,

3667
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,300
I've developed in a very fucked up way.

3668
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:53,781
You know,

3669
01:41:53,781 --> 01:41:54,071
if you,

3670
01:41:54,071 --> 01:41:54,904
you look,

3671
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,050
if I look back in my own life,

3672
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:57,913
in my own,

3673
01:41:58,130 --> 01:41:59,570
the time when I was in high school,

3674
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,100
like the most important time,

3675
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:06,080
all I was doing was fighting like
in my entire high school life,

3676
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:06,891
my entire,

3677
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:10,130
like all throughout my twenties
and into like 22 years old,

3678
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,890
their early twenties all
I did was martial arts.

3679
01:42:12,891 --> 01:42:13,760
It's all I did.

3680
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:18,020
So I was just wired for this
like really crazy reality.

3681
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:22,010
And it took a long time
for me to like let that go.

3682
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:26,960
It took a long time to like
really come off of def con for,

3683
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:27,621
you know,

3684
01:42:27,621 --> 01:42:28,670
let's bring it to three.

3685
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:29,310
Well yeah,

3686
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,490
I could never do that
because I physically,

3687
01:42:32,491 --> 01:42:33,324
I'm not,

3688
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,520
there's no amount of
training in the world,

3689
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:40,140
but I would try to get smarter and
learn a lot of things so I could repeat

3690
01:42:40,141 --> 01:42:41,110
things or like,

3691
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,143
you're in fucking,

3692
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,560
but I can't do it anymore.

3693
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:44,453
Now I read a book,

3694
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:45,960
it's fucking gone.

3695
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,250
You got to get you some Alpha brain.

3696
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,220
Get him a block,

3697
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:49,060
Jamie for

3698
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:55,960
that fucking I'm up in it or whatever
you're promoting came up in it on it.

3699
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:57,361
This is the same thing.

3700
01:42:57,361 --> 01:42:58,560
Alpha brain is from on it.

3701
01:42:58,850 --> 01:42:59,420
Okay.

3702
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,440
Does it work with good?

3703
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,240
Yeah.

3704
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:06,120
It has a battle battle is my dick in my
brain are having a battle for who can be

3705
01:43:06,121 --> 01:43:07,470
the tortoise in the race.

3706
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,263
Who can

3707
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,680
just take 20 of them all together.

3708
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,680
One take home with me the
first time I did your podcast.

3709
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,231
We fuck it.

3710
01:43:16,231 --> 01:43:17,370
Promoted your flashlight.

3711
01:43:17,371 --> 01:43:17,640
I like,

3712
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,750
I'm going home with one of these.

3713
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:19,380
Nope.

3714
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:19,651
No.

3715
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:20,221
Joe Rogan.

3716
01:43:20,221 --> 01:43:20,700
Nope.

3717
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,000
Nope,

3718
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:21,360
nope.

3719
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,760
Nothing in my fucking stock.

3720
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:23,590
Cole.

3721
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:24,423
I said,

3722
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,100
if you just reminded me,

3723
01:43:26,101 --> 01:43:26,940
I have a box of them.

3724
01:43:26,941 --> 01:43:27,290

3726
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:28,533
listen.

3727
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,453
If if,

3728
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,710
if it's anything like Bingos Vagina,

3729
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:32,730
the fleshlight,

3730
01:43:32,731 --> 01:43:35,740
we'll just sit there and grow
hair because it's unused.

3731
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,653
Oh.

3732
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:39,810
Have you completely
given up on intercourse?

3733
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,440
Yeah,

3734
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:40,951
pretty much.

3735
01:43:40,951 --> 01:43:45,951
Unless we're doing a lot of drugs
will drive still horny in me.

3736
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:46,591
Yeah.

3737
01:43:46,591 --> 01:43:47,610
It was like just scratchy,

3738
01:43:47,611 --> 01:43:48,444
horny.

3739
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:48,911
No.

3740
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:49,410
Just like,

3741
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:49,621

3742
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:50,170
I'm only,

3743
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,130
I feel urge so I might

3744
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,920
as well capitalize while like,

3745
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:54,530
and then,

3746
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:54,741
yeah,

3747
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:56,150
it's seconds and it's over.

3748
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:58,300
We try to fuck once in Oregon.

3749
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,270
I remember it was so
like stupid and pathetic.

3750
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:05,020
We just burst in a fucking
laughed or enrolled over like,

3751
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,863
all right,

3752
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,370
this is ride this out.

3753
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:08,443
Wow,

3754
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,440
that's amazing.

3755
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:10,850
But again,

3756
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:11,151
if I,

3757
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:14,000
if you talk to a younger me and said,

3758
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,073
yeah,

3759
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,150
I remember you saying it other day,

3760
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:19,100
I don't want to fuck
anymore is the day I'm dead.

3761
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:20,023
That's me.

3762
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,120
I don't like,

3763
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,740
I don't know that in my thirties.

3764
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:25,510
I like,

3765
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,090
uh,

3766
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:26,440
you know,

3767
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:26,621
it's,

3768
01:44:26,621 --> 01:44:27,890
it was then,

3769
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:28,970
it was still kind of fun.

3770
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:32,420
If someone had wanted to fuck you on the
road and they're hot and it was quick

3771
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:33,254
and easy,

3772
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:37,940
you should go to a book that was
more about ego than actual right.

3773
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,213
Worse it,

3774
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:42,740
the road road pussy
was like keeping score.

3775
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:43,140
It's like,

3776
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,790
yes,

3777
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:46,890
successful showing pictures.

3778
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:51,410
I [inaudible] see what
happens off the podcast.

3779
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:56,750
I didn't say about it last night.

3780
01:44:56,751 --> 01:45:00,590
I met from another 10 other
age era before cell phones.

3781
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:02,240
There's a drawing on his phone.

3782
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:03,231
Yeah,

3783
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:03,561
I know.

3784
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:04,520
I know what he's talking about.

3785
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,500
So I go,

3786
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:05,680
look,

3787
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:06,320
look,

3788
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,160
at the end of the day,

3789
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:07,551
it's like,

3790
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,070
it's not an essential value.

3791
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,390
You don't need to fuck.

3792
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,520
And a lot of it is absolutely pointless.

3793
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:15,770
I enjoy a lot of it is winning.

3794
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,730
It's a fucking,

3795
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,061
yeah,

3796
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:19,040
it's a sense of score thing.

3797
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:19,431
Sure.

3798
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:21,210
And it's also like a reinforcement.

3799
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:24,020
Knowing the people that find you
attractive and still want to fuck you.

3800
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:26,840
And when you meet drugs on the road,

3801
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:28,400
I love you.

3802
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:30,500
Hey,

3803
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:31,031
you will get you,

3804
01:45:31,031 --> 01:45:32,030
you want to smoke a joint?

3805
01:45:32,031 --> 01:45:32,271
I go,

3806
01:45:32,271 --> 01:45:33,021
I don't smoke.

3807
01:45:33,021 --> 01:45:35,720
But the day people stop asking.

3808
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:37,030
Yeah,

3809
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,511
yeah,

3810
01:45:37,511 --> 01:45:37,760
yeah,

3811
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:37,971
yeah,

3812
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:38,211
yeah.

3813
01:45:38,211 --> 01:45:40,310
The day people stop wanting to fuck you.

3814
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,180
That's sad.

3815
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,020
That's sad thing.

3816
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:44,370
We're milfs are dropping
hints when we don't,

3817
01:45:44,371 --> 01:45:45,204
you know,

3818
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:46,460
have to stay here.

3819
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:47,930
We could get outta here.

3820
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:48,171
I mean,

3821
01:45:48,171 --> 01:45:48,920
I'm just saying,

3822
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,920
the worst is when chicks that you
would never fucking a million years,

3823
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:55,970
but they're your age,

3824
01:45:55,971 --> 01:45:57,440
so you should be fucking them.

3825
01:45:57,441 --> 01:45:58,040
And you're like,

3826
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,701
oh,

3827
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:03,701
I feel really bad that I just realized
that I should be fucking someone like

3828
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:05,310
you.

3829
01:46:05,310 --> 01:46:09,110
Have you ever been in real life when
you're old girlfriends and she's like 45

3830
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:09,470
now.

3831
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:09,771
Oh,

3832
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:10,604
it's terrible.

3833
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:15,380
It's the fucking worst that have
lived in normal Massachusetts life.

3834
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:20,390
Then the lunch lady down
this about fucking lunch,

3835
01:46:20,391 --> 01:46:23,690
lady shoveling snow makes
you age three times as fast

3836
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,950
if you're asking him.

3837
01:46:26,951 --> 01:46:27,590
Forced.

3838
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:31,460
I got married when I was 20 years
old to a girl I knew for two weeks.

3839
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:33,110
That was my secretary and fraud,

3840
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:34,610
telemarketing and we,

3841
01:46:34,611 --> 01:46:36,170
it was a drunk and Goof Vegas,

3842
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:36,530
you know,

3843
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:36,741
hey,

3844
01:46:36,741 --> 01:46:37,790
let's go get married.

3845
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:41,450
And so now I just got divorced finally,

3846
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,100
cause I know it's on paper out there.

3847
01:46:43,101 --> 01:46:44,330
I should have to pay or anything.

3848
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:44,990
No,

3849
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:45,351
no,

3850
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:45,860
she,

3851
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:46,280
she's,

3852
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,050
I think Mary do another guy.

3853
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:49,040
She was a psychotic.

3854
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:52,470
She was like really a pathological liar.

3855
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,670
Fucking crazy.

3856
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:57,600
But she was like 12 years
older than me in bed.

3857
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:58,440
No,

3858
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:58,890
no,

3859
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,430
no,

3860
01:46:59,430 --> 01:46:59,641
no.

3861
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:01,380
She was like evil crazy.

3862
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:02,281
Oh No.

3863
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:03,870
She might've shot up sandy hook.

3864
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,980
But the point is,

3865
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:13,010
she was 11 years older than me and
not really attractive at that point.

3866
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:18,890
So now that means I was
married to a 57 year old woman.

3867
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,910
Like if I saw her,

3868
01:47:20,911 --> 01:47:21,211
I like,

3869
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:22,260
that's my wife.

3870
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:25,250
I wish I could've seen her to go.

3871
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:26,670
I'm married to her.

3872
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,020
I remember when I first,

3873
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:29,160
before I ever met you,

3874
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:30,450
I saw photos of you.

3875
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:31,740
I think that before I ever met you,

3876
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:34,860
people were telling me you were really
funny and I saw a picture of you at the

3877
01:47:34,861 --> 01:47:38,640
Houston last stop and you had long melody.

3878
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:41,220
Heck see hair long,

3879
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:42,480
beautiful hair.

3880
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,131
And I was like,

3881
01:47:44,131 --> 01:47:46,020
look at this asshole with his long hair.

3882
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:47,160
You're telling me this guy's farming

3883
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,550
town is Doug Stan hope guys.

3884
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:51,384
Really funny.

3885
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:53,050
It's a,

3886
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:55,920
you said something once and I
repeated all the time on the podcast.

3887
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:56,880
We had a conversation.

3888
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,340
You were a little lit up or we're
talking on the phone and he said,

3889
01:47:59,341 --> 01:48:01,800
I could give up comedy but
I couldn't give up comics.

3890
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:02,550
Yeah,

3891
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:02,791
no,

3892
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:04,590
I fucking say that sober too.

3893
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:06,690
I Miss Comics so much.

3894
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,570
It's just such an ease
about being around them.

3895
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:14,190
That's why the fucking industry in
the green room was such a vulture.

3896
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:17,460
You just fucking Leech off of.

3897
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,953
Oh yeah.

3898
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:23,390
That was 1,995 God,

3899
01:48:23,391 --> 01:48:24,540
this doesn't even look like you.

3900
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:28,880
I bought that suit at a thrift store for
the finals of the San Francisco comedy

3901
01:48:28,881 --> 01:48:29,460
competition.

3902
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,110
Even your fucking head.

3903
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,040
That's my face.

3904
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,143
That's weird.

3905
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:37,730
That's like when you see
like Charlie's thrawn.

3906
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:38,341
No,

3907
01:48:38,341 --> 01:48:38,940
not Shirley's.

3908
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:39,450
Thrawn.

3909
01:48:39,450 --> 01:48:40,380
Who's the other chick?

3910
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:41,820
Yeah.

3911
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,580
Charlise thrawn in their ideas.

3912
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:45,880
Sleeping beauty when they make a living.

3913
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,740
She's 20 again.

3914
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,123
Oh

3915
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:50,050
yeah.

3916
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:51,150
Just looking at pictures of dogs.

3917
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,110
There you go.

3918
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:52,590
Okay.

3919
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:53,300
I get this album come.

3920
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,450
Unfortunately Google support.

3921
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,313
It was great.

3922
01:48:56,990 --> 01:48:58,280
I think the first time I saw you though,

3923
01:48:58,281 --> 01:48:59,091
was that the,

3924
01:48:59,091 --> 01:48:59,480
uh,

3925
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,320
that little place?

3926
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:01,280
Yeah,

3927
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:01,571
yeah,

3928
01:49:01,571 --> 01:49:02,170
yeah.

3929
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:03,530
My mother was performing.

3930
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,130
That was a little place
that was at sunset,

3931
01:49:07,131 --> 01:49:07,371
right?

3932
01:49:07,371 --> 01:49:07,730
Fine.

3933
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:08,170
Yeah.

3934
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:09,440
It was beside the place.

3935
01:49:09,441 --> 01:49:10,160
That was cool.

3936
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,850
Yeah.

3937
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,380
That Jay Davis ran.

3938
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,400
Yeah.

3939
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:14,720
I forget the name of that place.

3940
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:17,690
Davis is a fucking Hoofer.

3941
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:18,980
You talking about dude,

3942
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:20,500
who puts in the hours?

3943
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:21,110
He's,

3944
01:49:21,110 --> 01:49:22,220
he's a late age.

3945
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:23,590
Josh de Denado.

3946
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:25,690
If I go to a,

3947
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,310
who actually started Largo and then when
I became cool fucking cool people took

3948
01:49:31,311 --> 01:49:31,970
it away from him.

3949
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:32,631
Like let's go.

3950
01:49:32,631 --> 01:49:33,110
All right,

3951
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:36,440
thanks for throwing all those
flyers on cars for three months.

3952
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,220
We got it.

3953
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,960
We got on to greener pastures,

3954
01:49:38,961 --> 01:49:39,350
son.

3955
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:40,183
Yep.

3956
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:40,791
Yeah.

3957
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:41,331
That place,

3958
01:49:41,331 --> 01:49:42,111
that little small,

3959
01:49:42,111 --> 01:49:42,711
tiny place.

3960
01:49:42,711 --> 01:49:43,381
That was the first time.

3961
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:44,360
That's where I met Rene,

3962
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,203
my

3963
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,660
latter wife,

3964
01:49:48,830 --> 01:49:51,260
the Nancy to my sin.

3965
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:53,400
The wanted to my boot cows.

3966
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:54,643
She uh,

3967
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,910
I still like her.

3968
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,650
She hasn't talked to me in years,

3969
01:49:57,651 --> 01:49:59,090
but she wanted a bad person.

3970
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,860
She's had a couple of issues.

3971
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:02,030
She'll on a bad person.

3972
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:03,680
I liked her because she liked wheen.

3973
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,360
I always thought when was
Weezer until like a week ago.

3974
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:13,490
I love that Hash pipe song.

3975
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:18,073
I thought it was weed.

3976
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:19,320
Oh,

3977
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:20,690
hang on.

3978
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:22,220
Here's Yoko to sing.

3979
01:50:22,221 --> 01:50:23,054
Ween

3980
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:32,370
spinal Bifida man.

3981
01:50:35,070 --> 01:50:35,660
Wow.

3982
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:39,170
Is Yoko spinal meningitis can be done.

3983
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:40,623
It's great.

3984
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,870
Dentsu when we'd started the man show,

3985
01:50:42,871 --> 01:50:47,871
there's a club called the three two one
in Memphis and wean was playing the same

3986
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:53,510
night I was playing and they did a wean
after party without weans knowledge.

3987
01:50:55,080 --> 01:51:00,080
So they had me go over and introduce
the band in front of ween and

3988
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:06,400
fuck the host of the mad show Doug
Stanhope though Yo fucking knew Matt show

3989
01:51:06,401 --> 01:51:09,190
sucks or yelling at me and I'm
like I'm just here to introduce,

3990
01:51:09,191 --> 01:51:10,120
hey ladies and gentlemen,

3991
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:14,290
welcome out ween and like one of the
band members came to the club afterwards

3992
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:16,340
for this pseudo after party.

3993
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:18,290
Renee was so shit phase.

3994
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:21,400
She pissed the couch and went
into fucking rehab the next day.

3995
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,560
That's my wean story.

3996
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:24,431
Yeah,

3997
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:25,264
that um,

3998
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,730
that would be unfortunate.

3999
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:31,990
The last thing we want to do is go on
stage in front of a bunch of people after

4000
01:51:31,991 --> 01:51:35,170
you just replaced some
people on another show.

4001
01:51:35,171 --> 01:51:36,280
The replacing people.

4002
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,410
If we just had the Doug and Joe show

4003
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:42,640
opens when it sucked anyway,

4004
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:46,660
anywhere now with the just
in that amount of time,

4005
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:47,680
which is 10 years,

4006
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:48,970
I guess that is a lot of time.

4007
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:53,230
Look if we wanted to do something well
we could do now is we could just produce

4008
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:53,860
it ourselves.

4009
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:56,830
Just release it entirely on the Internet.

4010
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:57,431
Exactly.

4011
01:51:57,431 --> 01:51:58,420
Completely possible.

4012
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:58,630
Well,

4013
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:02,470
I'm out of my record contract
on I now I can do fucking DVDs.

4014
01:52:02,471 --> 01:52:03,680
Louis C K.

4015
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:03,970
Oh really?

4016
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:05,280
Oh fucking Louis Ck.

4017
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:06,670
Hey fucking return a call.

4018
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:08,200
Cont wow.

4019
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,270
What's a matter you call it?

4020
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:11,410
I'll tell you off the air.

4021
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,101
He's kind of busy.

4022
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:12,700
That guy.

4023
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:13,300
Yeah,

4024
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,320
he's too busy.

4025
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:16,450
I think he started thinking
about what he does,

4026
01:52:16,451 --> 01:52:16,931
editing,

4027
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:17,590
writing,

4028
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:21,580
producing and performing in his own
show and writing an hour of new comedy.

4029
01:52:21,581 --> 01:52:22,150
Did I tell you?

4030
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:24,760
Did I tell you what I
did the part for him?

4031
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:25,480
No.

4032
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:25,991
What I would,

4033
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:27,320
I did the thing on Louis.

4034
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:28,440
Uh,

4035
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,140
he,

4036
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:30,220
he called me and he said,

4037
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:30,790
Hey,

4038
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:31,960
do you do any acting?

4039
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:32,794
And I said,

4040
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:33,101
no,

4041
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:33,881
I suck at it.

4042
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:34,720
I was very open.

4043
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:36,490
I suck at acting again,

4044
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:41,520
just knowing that I'm glad the TV with
my face is not where I can see it in this

4045
01:52:42,011 --> 01:52:43,980
studio because that just,

4046
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:46,250
just seeing me in monitor on the mantra,

4047
01:52:46,251 --> 01:52:46,851
I fucking,

4048
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:48,640
I see my head frees up.

4049
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:50,463
Oh,

4050
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,381
I said,

4051
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:52,101
I suck at it.

4052
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:52,550
He goes,

4053
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:53,301
yeah,

4054
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:54,650
but would you want to,

4055
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:55,953
uh,

4056
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:56,953
and I said,

4057
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:57,741
I'll try it.

4058
01:52:57,741 --> 01:53:00,290
I'm just telling you
upfront I stink at acting.

4059
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,340
And so he,

4060
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:01,581
uh,

4061
01:53:01,581 --> 01:53:05,180
we read through the part
via Skype and he said,

4062
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:05,421
okay,

4063
01:53:05,421 --> 01:53:06,590
we read through it once,

4064
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:07,520
do this different,

4065
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:07,941
try this,

4066
01:53:07,941 --> 01:53:12,050
get familiar with the material and
we'll do this again in a couple of days.

4067
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,700
And I said,

4068
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:14,091
okay.

4069
01:53:14,091 --> 01:53:16,790
And then I'm walking around my backyard,

4070
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,940
I'm doing the lines to my dogs to Bingo,

4071
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:21,380
reading the,

4072
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,480
just trying to get it fucking right.

4073
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,330
And he didn't call back.

4074
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,870
So then there's like two weeks
later and how that mother Fucker,

4075
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:33,650
I told him I suck at acting and you don't
even have the decency to call me back

4076
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:35,330
and say we went another direction.

4077
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:38,330
But then I'm about to do stern.

4078
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:39,560
I'm a play in New York,

4079
01:53:39,561 --> 01:53:40,610
so I'm going to do stern.

4080
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:43,460
So my idea was I'm going to go on stern.

4081
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,500
I have these lines memorized.

4082
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:50,620
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
insinuate them verbatim into conversation

4083
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:52,304
with stern.

4084
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:53,400
So,

4085
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:56,960
so months later when you've booked
someone else to play this part,

4086
01:53:56,990 --> 01:54:01,370
it's gonna look like you stole the
entire script from my Howard stern

4087
01:54:01,371 --> 01:54:02,204
appearance.

4088
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,670
And then he called and said,

4089
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:04,851
Oh,

4090
01:54:04,851 --> 01:54:05,661
I'm sorry I was busy.

4091
01:54:05,661 --> 01:54:06,021
I get you.

4092
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:06,854
Get the part,

4093
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:10,000
I want to do this stern thing.

4094
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:10,391
Yeah,

4095
01:54:10,391 --> 01:54:10,601
no,

4096
01:54:10,601 --> 01:54:11,261
I think he's,

4097
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:12,400
he's almost too busy.

4098
01:54:12,401 --> 01:54:13,234
It's like,

4099
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:18,160
I love the fact that he's so inspirational
with is all the different shit that

4100
01:54:18,161 --> 01:54:18,820
he's doing.

4101
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,110
But at a certain point
in time you're like,

4102
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:21,310
look at the pace that he's putting.

4103
01:54:21,311 --> 01:54:21,580
Like,

4104
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:22,270
okay,

4105
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:25,510
I'm just like doing the math
and I'm not that good at math,

4106
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:27,340
but when I do the math I go to,

4107
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:27,931
there's just this,

4108
01:54:27,931 --> 01:54:29,470
this doesn't seem like
a lot of time for fun.

4109
01:54:29,471 --> 01:54:30,301
They're like,

4110
01:54:30,301 --> 01:54:30,821
it seems,

4111
01:54:30,821 --> 01:54:32,620
this seems like a crazy pace.

4112
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,370
Yeah.

4113
01:54:33,370 --> 01:54:34,210
Did doing a show,

4114
01:54:34,211 --> 01:54:35,230
recording a show,

4115
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:35,530
uh,

4116
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,340
editing it,

4117
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,240
producing it,

4118
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:39,540
and then doing a whole
hour of standup every year.

4119
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,140
Like wow.

4120
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:40,321
Yeah,

4121
01:54:40,321 --> 01:54:40,471
no,

4122
01:54:40,471 --> 01:54:40,721
he,

4123
01:54:40,721 --> 01:54:42,100
he called me about something I,

4124
01:54:42,101 --> 01:54:42,811
that's why I'm saying,

4125
01:54:42,811 --> 01:54:47,520
Hey fucking Louis called me back or email
me back because I don't know what you

4126
01:54:47,521 --> 01:54:48,660
fucking check anymore.

4127
01:54:48,661 --> 01:54:51,600
But he called me about something and
I've been trying to follow up on,

4128
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:52,050
oh,

4129
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:52,740
okay.

4130
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:53,221
I'm not like,

4131
01:54:53,221 --> 01:54:53,590
Hey,

4132
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:54,960
I want to talk man.

4133
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:56,520
Now that you're big and famous,

4134
01:54:56,521 --> 01:54:57,360
let's chat.

4135
01:54:57,361 --> 01:54:58,194
I'm not that guy,

4136
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,610
which is a my house.

4137
01:54:59,611 --> 01:55:00,444
You don't need to go.

4138
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:04,350
The guy that emails you from a different
email address every fucking time.

4139
01:55:04,351 --> 01:55:04,710
And I'm like,

4140
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:07,230
I don't know which one
to contact you back at.

4141
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:07,651
Oh,

4142
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:08,484
that's funny.

4143
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,503
Yeah,

4144
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:10,320
isn't it fine?

4145
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,370
The pressures of stardom

4146
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,970
and then you also have the thing,

4147
01:55:12,971 --> 01:55:15,010
well maybe he's telling
me to fuck off again.

4148
01:55:15,011 --> 01:55:17,260
Just like I did the first
time when I get the part,

4149
01:55:17,261 --> 01:55:18,094
but he was busy.

4150
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,860
I don't think it's that I get to,

4151
01:55:19,861 --> 01:55:20,110
fuck,

4152
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:23,530
I got to get on the new
CD is so fucking ready.

4153
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:25,870
I got to get something out.

4154
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:26,261
Like what?

4155
01:55:26,261 --> 01:55:27,910
You're doing the material too long,

4156
01:55:27,911 --> 01:55:28,181
you know,

4157
01:55:28,181 --> 01:55:29,800
if you don't keep doing it,

4158
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:32,020
you're going to forget
all the nuances of it.

4159
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:35,230
When did you leave before
turning the gun on himself?

4160
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:38,140
That's a year and a half ago,

4161
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:43,680
but we taped it July of 10 I it is now,

4162
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:44,960
wait,

4163
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,793
oh 11.

4164
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:46,750
Yeah,

4165
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:49,720
July of [inaudible] 11 and
then it didn't get released.

4166
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:53,260
It's released digitally
in March of this year.

4167
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:56,380
But then showtime picked it up
so they could only do digital,

4168
01:55:56,381 --> 01:55:56,591
you know,

4169
01:55:56,591 --> 01:56:01,591
online audio release till showtime aired
it in August and then they had a 90 day

4170
01:56:03,341 --> 01:56:06,040
window before we could
sell the actual DVD,

4171
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,970
which is,

4172
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:07,271
you know,

4173
01:56:07,271 --> 01:56:08,830
a fucking eight track tape now.

4174
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:09,981
Yeah,

4175
01:56:09,981 --> 01:56:11,630
I was excited when I saw it on showtime.

4176
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,800
I didn't know you were doing it that way.

4177
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:14,630
I thought you were just doing it as a CD.

4178
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:16,150
I know.

4179
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:16,530
Yeah.

4180
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:16,891
I don't,

4181
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:19,620
I don't like to see
myself but DVDs sell more.

4182
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:20,590
What was your,

4183
01:56:20,591 --> 01:56:21,130
um,

4184
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:22,930
what was your deal that you had,

4185
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:23,940
you had some sort of a,

4186
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:25,360
you were locked into a deal,

4187
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:26,223
like a long term

4188
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,850
runner had a four record.

4189
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:30,410
Why the fuck did you sign that?

4190
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,090
Cause a upfront money.

4191
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:33,213
Oh

4192
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:35,561
yeah,

4193
01:56:35,561 --> 01:56:36,010
you can.

4194
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:38,500
I would never sign like a four or three.

4195
01:56:38,501 --> 01:56:38,920
I,

4196
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,300
everything I've ever done is one.

4197
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:41,800
It seemed like a,

4198
01:56:41,801 --> 01:56:43,300
that's a douchey movement.

4199
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,830
Assign you to a four fucking,

4200
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:46,520
that's what they let us out of your work.

4201
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:46,781
Oh,

4202
01:56:46,781 --> 01:56:47,560
they let you out of it.

4203
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:47,801
Oh,

4204
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:48,634
that's cool.

4205
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:48,971
Yeah.

4206
01:56:48,971 --> 01:56:49,840
That's like years.

4207
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,950
Everything is digital.

4208
01:56:50,951 --> 01:56:51,580
I know.

4209
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:52,413
Yeah.

4210
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:53,381
But again,

4211
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:53,680
I'm,

4212
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,030
I'm still backlogged.

4213
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,080
This material,

4214
01:56:56,081 --> 01:56:57,370
I'm going to have to go back.

4215
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:58,240
Like I,

4216
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,920
I've done so much that I'm going to
have to relearn because I do have,

4217
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,240
I have a fucking good chunk now.

4218
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,950
Yeah.

4219
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:05,370
Um,

4220
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,001
I saw,

4221
01:57:06,001 --> 01:57:07,350
I saw everything that I saw.

4222
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:07,591
I mean,

4223
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:10,440
I only watched a certain amount because
it was trying to concentrate on my own

4224
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:10,651
shit,

4225
01:57:10,651 --> 01:57:12,210
but everything I saw was completely new.

4226
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:13,851
Oh yeah.

4227
01:57:13,851 --> 01:57:14,990
There's a lot of that shit's,

4228
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:16,490
that'll be on the next one.

4229
01:57:16,730 --> 01:57:18,730
Like I had a backlog of other shit.

4230
01:57:18,850 --> 01:57:19,061
Good.

4231
01:57:19,061 --> 01:57:22,330
So how much do you have ready for the
night you have like do you do like an

4232
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:22,331
hour,

4233
01:57:22,331 --> 01:57:23,164
an hour and 10

4234
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:25,150
did last night I had a shaved down,

4235
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:26,920
I tried to do 40 and I,

4236
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:28,630
I evidently did 50,

4237
01:57:28,631 --> 01:57:33,010
but that was like cutting
out a whole lot of detail.

4238
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:34,240
I think we both did the same.

4239
01:57:34,241 --> 01:57:37,000
I think I did 49 and I think Joey did 30.

4240
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,250
And then honey honey did
like 20 is a long ass show.

4241
01:57:39,251 --> 01:57:40,060
But it was awesome.

4242
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:40,360
Yeah.

4243
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,350
That crowd man,

4244
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:42,700
they're amazing.

4245
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:44,780
They were like with us that squad,

4246
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:46,150
we're going to have to uh,

4247
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:51,260
cause cause the Stan hope sausage army
is like a revolutionary of fucking stand

4248
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:54,150
compared to death squad.

4249
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:56,670
So I think we might just
have to have a branch.

4250
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:58,070
You missed what uh,

4251
01:57:58,090 --> 01:57:58,570
with uh,

4252
01:57:58,570 --> 01:58:00,430
Ben said then if you
didn't see honey honey.

4253
01:58:00,431 --> 01:58:00,950
Yeah.

4254
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:01,750
Then they were,

4255
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,790
they were in the middle of
playing and they played this,

4256
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:05,470
first of all they played angel of death,

4257
01:58:05,471 --> 01:58:06,920
which is like one of my favorite songs.

4258
01:58:06,921 --> 01:58:07,241
And they do,

4259
01:58:07,241 --> 01:58:08,074
it's amazing.

4260
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:08,921
And then he said,

4261
01:58:08,921 --> 01:58:09,071
uh,

4262
01:58:09,071 --> 01:58:10,030
it's so crazy that,

4263
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,570
uh,

4264
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:11,980
since we did the podcast,

4265
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:16,990
we will go to these places and perform
and do these like really like deep

4266
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,550
emotional songs.

4267
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,573
Any here

4268
01:58:21,670 --> 01:58:22,390
I see,

4269
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:26,290
I see almost one death squad
tee-shirt per show at my show.

4270
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:26,801
Yeah.

4271
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:27,311
All Day,

4272
01:58:27,311 --> 01:58:28,144
man.

4273
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,370
That's cool.

4274
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:30,160
They're out there.

4275
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:30,551
Well,

4276
01:58:30,551 --> 01:58:31,384
it's,

4277
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,231
you know,

4278
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:32,431
we,

4279
01:58:32,431 --> 01:58:33,071
we talk about,

4280
01:58:33,071 --> 01:58:34,100
I don't know how it happened,

4281
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:35,530
it sort of happened organically.

4282
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:36,340
Uh,

4283
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,620
I don't know how we got
this amazing following,

4284
01:58:38,621 --> 01:58:40,990
but they're like the nicest
fucking human beings.

4285
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:41,740
The world.

4286
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,400
They are like super enthusiastic.

4287
01:58:43,401 --> 01:58:44,360
They're super cooled,

4288
01:58:44,361 --> 01:58:45,194
they're everywhere.

4289
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:47,960
It's really weird and it's growing.

4290
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:52,940
And the crazy thing is you
get these likeminded people
that come to these shows.

4291
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:55,730
That's one of the more interesting things
about it is these people that come to

4292
01:58:55,731 --> 01:58:56,564
these shows,

4293
01:58:56,690 --> 01:59:00,350
they're like really friendly
openminded people who are like,

4294
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,210
and it all comes from the podcast,

4295
01:59:02,211 --> 01:59:02,631
all of it.

4296
01:59:02,631 --> 01:59:03,464
100% of it.

4297
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,070
I mean,

4298
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:06,290
a lot of them were friends
of my standup before,

4299
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,440
but this movement all
comes from the podcast.

4300
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:10,863
But when,

4301
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,980
when you realize that kind of power,

4302
01:59:12,981 --> 01:59:16,190
when you get those people
together on an anonymous level,

4303
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:21,340
I fucking love anonymous so much
where you can actually fucking change.

4304
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:23,380
Yeah,

4305
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:24,213
and not,

4306
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:26,750
let's go to the polls or picking a thing.

4307
01:59:26,751 --> 01:59:26,931
No,

4308
01:59:26,931 --> 01:59:28,430
let's do something weird and funny.

4309
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:33,320
That's fuck with it on a creative
level that is actually art.

4310
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,110
Well the in,

4311
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:35,300
but an anonymous case,

4312
01:59:35,301 --> 01:59:38,300
it's like you gotta be really careful
if like if you're a company and you're

4313
01:59:38,301 --> 01:59:39,170
doing something shady,

4314
01:59:39,171 --> 01:59:40,310
they'll take you down.

4315
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:40,761
Oh yeah.

4316
01:59:40,761 --> 01:59:42,680
We'll go and find the to structure.

4317
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,570
They'll figure out a way
to hack in your system.

4318
01:59:44,571 --> 01:59:46,850
That's why you have to do it creatively.

4319
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:50,150
I'm an armchair
revolutionary at this point.

4320
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:50,900
I'm,

4321
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:51,171
yeah,

4322
01:59:51,171 --> 01:59:52,580
I at any point really,

4323
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:52,881
well,

4324
01:59:52,881 --> 01:59:53,061
no,

4325
01:59:53,061 --> 01:59:54,590
I'm not getting a farm here.

4326
01:59:54,591 --> 01:59:56,510
Gas at the WTO riots.

4327
01:59:56,511 --> 01:59:57,470
It's not my thing.

4328
01:59:57,471 --> 01:59:58,400
I don't run quick.

4329
01:59:58,401 --> 01:59:59,234
I'm fucking,

4330
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:01,130
I'm easily winded

4331
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:03,580
but it,

4332
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:08,580
but you can do funny shit where I've seen
what my fucking fan base will do when

4333
02:00:09,621 --> 02:00:12,110
that guy was stealing my
shit online and they just,

4334
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,520
they decimated him.

4335
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:13,941
Yeah.

4336
02:00:13,941 --> 02:00:16,070
There was a guy for folks
who don't know the story.

4337
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,760
Somebody sent Troy home was his name,

4338
02:00:19,761 --> 02:00:20,031
h.

4339
02:00:20,031 --> 02:00:20,960
O.

4340
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:20,960
L.

4341
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:20,960
M.

4342
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:21,890
E somebody put it up

4343
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,500
by my message board when
Doug found out about it.

4344
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:28,780
But there was some character that
was taking all of Doug's rants and,

4345
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,121
and,

4346
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:31,000
and bits and putting them on a

4347
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,310
blog like verbatim,

4348
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:38,311
like taking exact like transcripts of
cds or blog updates and then promoting it

4349
02:00:39,881 --> 02:00:40,714
on his Twitter.

4350
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:43,180
Come read my tales of real life,

4351
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:44,200
uh,

4352
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,520
perversion and drugs.

4353
02:00:45,521 --> 02:00:49,390
And it said he's trying to like make
himself into some fun Thompson character.

4354
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:50,600
No fucking worse.

4355
02:00:50,601 --> 02:00:52,990
Like a fucking halfass Tucker Max.

4356
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:56,620
And that's a quarter of an ass because
that guy is the worst piece of shit and

4357
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:57,454
I'm fucking world.

4358
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:58,091
Oh,

4359
02:00:58,091 --> 02:01:00,260
do this desk squad fucking mountain.

4360
02:01:00,261 --> 02:01:01,660
No referendum.

4361
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:06,010
Anytime you're in an airport or a
bookstore and you see a fucking Tucker Max

4362
02:01:06,011 --> 02:01:06,550
book,

4363
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:09,280
take another book and put
it in front of this stack.

4364
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:09,870
Cause they,

4365
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:14,440
they always frontload his books and
just so no one ever sees the book in the

4366
02:01:14,441 --> 02:01:15,210
airport.

4367
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:15,430
What?

4368
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,210
Tucker Max.

4369
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:16,980
He's just a,

4370
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:17,471
you know,

4371
02:01:17,471 --> 02:01:20,590
he's a Joe Francis from
girls gone wild type of dude,

4372
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,360
you don't have to do any research.

4373
02:01:22,361 --> 02:01:27,030
You know immediately he's that kind of
fuck that just gets off on people hating

4374
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:27,883
him.

4375
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:32,260
All you have to do nowadays to
be famous is to be easily hated.

4376
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:34,990
That's what all those
reality shows are about.

4377
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,760
They just put a dick on the reality.

4378
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:38,770
Are you going to watch American chopper?

4379
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:39,990
Do you want to watch

4380
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:41,580
people weld for 30 minutes?

4381
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:42,390
No,

4382
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:44,700
but if someone's going to be
an asshole to someone else,

4383
02:01:44,701 --> 02:01:47,370
and that's creating this
influx of people who are like,

4384
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,390
I want to be an asshole so I
can be famous of fucking Lou.

4385
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:53,700
I want to be a fucking Paris Hilton card.

4386
02:01:53,701 --> 02:01:55,600
Dashi and asshole.

4387
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:56,880
Anyway,

4388
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,040
you don't have find
fascinating when people learn,

4389
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:01,140
when they try that and then they learn.

4390
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:06,180
And what I really saw that
was with Camille Grammar
who was Kelsey Grammer's ex

4391
02:02:06,181 --> 02:02:07,890
wife and it was,

4392
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:08,490
you know,

4393
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:12,750
she's on the real housewives of Beverly
Hills and one of the things like,

4394
02:02:12,751 --> 02:02:12,961
you know,

4395
02:02:12,961 --> 02:02:16,680
they would have each character go out
and say who they are and just like,

4396
02:02:16,681 --> 02:02:17,040
you know,

4397
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:19,410
I'm finally stepping out
of my husband's shadow,

4398
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,101
you know,

4399
02:02:20,101 --> 02:02:20,791
and for what?

4400
02:02:20,791 --> 02:02:21,900
For being a cunt.

4401
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:23,790
And that's what she was for one season.

4402
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:24,780
She was a client,

4403
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:28,380
she was a ruthless con and the backlash,

4404
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:33,590
the fucking and repercussion they'll
below back was so intense that she

4405
02:02:33,691 --> 02:02:36,180
completely switched it
up on the next season.

4406
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:37,080
She's like,

4407
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,160
I'm done with this.

4408
02:02:38,161 --> 02:02:38,671
I'm just going to,

4409
02:02:38,671 --> 02:02:40,410
I don't give a fuck what you do.

4410
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,393
I'm a sweetie,

4411
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,201
give you a hug.

4412
02:02:42,201 --> 02:02:43,190
I send you on your way.

4413
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:46,280
She didn't want any more
negative attention anymore.

4414
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:49,620
The first season all she was
doing was talking shit and this,

4415
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:53,830
she was married to her husband and she
was like riding on motorcycles with other

4416
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:54,401
guys,

4417
02:02:54,401 --> 02:02:57,340
like her friends that were
like struggling actors.

4418
02:02:57,660 --> 02:03:01,000
And I'm like looking at this
like this is this gusting

4419
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:05,000
and we have to have people in the
industry that work on these shows.

4420
02:03:05,001 --> 02:03:06,260
Any fucking dirt.

4421
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:11,261
You can email me anonymous anonymously
about the fucking reality shows and how

4422
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:13,250
exactly they're staged.

4423
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:14,750
They're all stays now.

4424
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:15,081
I mean,

4425
02:03:15,081 --> 02:03:17,360
the one that they did at
the comedy store when,

4426
02:03:17,361 --> 02:03:17,840
uh,

4427
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:18,141
you know,

4428
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:19,520
Ari did a Dunkin,

4429
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:20,690
God bless him,

4430
02:03:20,691 --> 02:03:21,980
quit his fucking job.

4431
02:03:22,190 --> 02:03:23,240
They wanted him to,

4432
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:23,600
uh,

4433
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,760
to be in on the reality
show at the comedy store.

4434
02:03:25,761 --> 02:03:27,680
And rather than be on television,

4435
02:03:27,681 --> 02:03:32,480
Dunkin quit his job
answering phones for real.

4436
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:33,380
He's like done.

4437
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:35,590
Dunkin has to be making a decent living.

4438
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:37,093
He is now,

4439
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:37,700
yeah,

4440
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,660
it's really recent.

4441
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:40,400
It's over the last year or so.

4442
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,263
It's a crazy

4443
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,790
this and that's again,

4444
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:43,840
the podcast,

4445
02:03:43,841 --> 02:03:47,620
introducing people to his podcast
and his podcast taking off and yeah,

4446
02:03:47,621 --> 02:03:48,251
it's amazing.

4447
02:03:48,251 --> 02:03:48,760
He,

4448
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,930
he makes the living now it's selling his
posters and tee shirts and then doing

4449
02:03:52,931 --> 02:03:53,261
gigs.

4450
02:03:53,261 --> 02:03:53,550
Right.

4451
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:53,881
Fuck,

4452
02:03:53,881 --> 02:03:55,020
we got to get posters.

4453
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,600
That's the need to reprint that one,

4454
02:03:57,601 --> 02:03:57,901
Doug,

4455
02:03:57,901 --> 02:03:58,021
that,

4456
02:03:58,021 --> 02:03:59,040
that's one of my favorite posts.

4457
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:02,790
It's all made out of like heroin needles.

4458
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:03,624
And drugs

4459
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,840
default photo on Twitter.

4460
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,810
I had that put original poster.

4461
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,061
No,

4462
02:04:09,061 --> 02:04:10,080
that's an old one,

4463
02:04:10,150 --> 02:04:12,180
but we would love if you
got any copies of it.

4464
02:04:12,181 --> 02:04:14,190
I would love to get it to put
it up in here if you're not.

4465
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:16,150
I haven't.

4466
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:16,910
I haven't.

4467
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:18,360
I have no,

4468
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:19,223
I just have that one.

4469
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:20,160
Do you use it?

4470
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:20,551
Oh yeah,

4471
02:04:20,551 --> 02:04:25,551
it's my favorite place for
washboard jerking off on,

4472
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:28,770
so I was thinking just take it if
you can get us a copy of it though,

4473
02:04:28,771 --> 02:04:28,981
man.

4474
02:04:28,981 --> 02:04:31,620
I would love to put it up in here
because already just gave me one of his

4475
02:04:31,621 --> 02:04:32,041
posters.

4476
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:35,700
I'm going to have it framed and put up
in here and I know a lot of comics used

4477
02:04:35,701 --> 02:04:36,181
to do it,

4478
02:04:36,181 --> 02:04:38,170
but I like head shots but

4479
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,030
no one has head shots anymore.

4480
02:04:40,031 --> 02:04:40,851
They don't exist anymore.

4481
02:04:40,851 --> 02:04:44,740
I want to do that for my house but get
a comics headshots and put them on the

4482
02:04:44,741 --> 02:04:45,940
wall like the old ones.

4483
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:46,140
Yeah.

4484
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:50,380
I got really old ones from the Warner
brothers days from 1999 I'll get you one

4485
02:04:50,381 --> 02:04:50,980
of those.

4486
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:51,191
No,

4487
02:04:51,191 --> 02:04:51,371
no,

4488
02:04:51,371 --> 02:04:52,510
I have you.

4489
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:53,621
Fuck.

4490
02:04:53,621 --> 02:04:53,950
Yeah.

4491
02:04:53,950 --> 02:04:57,310
I would love to get everybody's oldest
headshots that they have the most

4492
02:04:57,311 --> 02:04:58,180
embarrassing ones.

4493
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:58,751
I don't know.

4494
02:04:58,751 --> 02:04:59,650
I don't have him anymore,

4495
02:04:59,651 --> 02:05:02,560
but I had some ones where it had a
leather jacket on like a tank top,

4496
02:05:02,561 --> 02:05:04,100
and I got some acids.

4497
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:05,250
I looked sorry.

4498
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:05,791
Really bad.

4499
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:10,791
I have one of me standing in a swimming
pool in his suit up to my chest with a

4500
02:05:11,161 --> 02:05:13,050
wicked Billy Ray Cyrus mullet,

4501
02:05:13,051 --> 02:05:17,310
holding a glass of wine with sunglasses
on because I thought it's crazy.

4502
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:19,980
Two years into the business,

4503
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,190
you know,

4504
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:22,560
here's the hack one that everybody tries

4505
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:26,190
the standing in the boat with
a mugshot with your name on it.

4506
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:27,170
Oh yeah.

4507
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:28,003
Oh God.

4508
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,233
I tried that one.

4509
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:30,253
I tried.

4510
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:31,290
I tried that one.

4511
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:32,090
I couldn't do it.

4512
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:33,350
It was just so pathetic.

4513
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:34,221
You know,

4514
02:05:34,221 --> 02:05:38,030
Louis C K is one that he
had for like 15 years,

4515
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:43,010
was one of those pictures from
when he was like 16 or 17,

4516
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:44,240
uh,

4517
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:46,400
that you're getting a stripped
from sitting in a booth,

4518
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:51,080
you po and you get a strip of
four pictures for 15 years.

4519
02:05:51,081 --> 02:05:51,620
He fucked.

4520
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:53,510
I might be exaggerating,

4521
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:56,480
but forever until he
was a fucking grown man.

4522
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:58,370
He used that as his headshot.

4523
02:05:58,430 --> 02:05:58,970
Wow.

4524
02:05:58,970 --> 02:05:59,803
That's funny.

4525
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:01,383
Yeah.

4526
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:02,000
Oh,

4527
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,340
headshots were funny
thing like Mike Donovan.

4528
02:06:04,341 --> 02:06:05,240
Do you remember Mike Diamond?

4529
02:06:05,241 --> 02:06:06,380
Did you know Mike Donovan at all

4530
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:08,211
too common?

4531
02:06:08,211 --> 02:06:09,044
A name to say

4532
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:11,420
really hilarious Boston comedian,

4533
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,060
but one of the things he said it,

4534
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:13,680
he goes,

4535
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:13,971
he goes,

4536
02:06:13,971 --> 02:06:14,661
any comics,

4537
02:06:14,661 --> 02:06:16,070
it's worth his fucking salt.

4538
02:06:16,071 --> 02:06:17,190
Doesn't have a head shot.

4539
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:18,331
That's it.

4540
02:06:18,331 --> 02:06:19,164
They always say,

4541
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:22,310
that's the guy that
ruins you as a open mic.

4542
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,090
You Go,

4543
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:23,301
oh,

4544
02:06:23,301 --> 02:06:26,180
I can be unprofessional to without an act.

4545
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:28,190
He wanted you to be unprofessional.

4546
02:06:28,191 --> 02:06:29,180
He didn't give a fuck,

4547
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:30,380
but he was hilarious.

4548
02:06:30,381 --> 02:06:30,561
I mean,

4549
02:06:30,561 --> 02:06:34,310
he was right in certain ways at which is
really be concentrating on is your act.

4550
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,780
That's why Dane Cook,

4551
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:38,070
uh,

4552
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:43,070
the hatred of Dane Cook hurts so many
comics because they would a shoe my space

4553
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:47,220
based solely on their
dislike for Dane Cook,

4554
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,750
where social networking,

4555
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:51,450
that's why comedy clubs
have comment cards,

4556
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:54,090
is to get direct access to the audience.

4557
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:55,283
But you,

4558
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:58,770
you don't want to go on my space and
do a good thing for your career cause

4559
02:06:58,771 --> 02:06:59,940
that's so Dane Cook.

4560
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:03,270
We'll fucking get past that Dane
Cook and look at how the thing works.

4561
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:05,290
There are guys there is they do a shoe.

4562
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:05,910
The uh,

4563
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:10,480
the social media Bill Byrd didn't have
Twitter until we signed up for him for

4564
02:07:10,481 --> 02:07:11,314
them.

4565
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:12,640
Cops are here cause that shit.

4566
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,370
Audio issues.

4567
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:16,293
Helicopters,

4568
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:19,030
helicopter Bill Burr Bingo.

4569
02:07:19,031 --> 02:07:22,930
Right on time with the fucking
vodka and grapefruit juice.

4570
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:24,033
Perfect.

4571
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:25,180
But liquored up.

4572
02:07:25,450 --> 02:07:25,631
Yeah,

4573
02:07:25,631 --> 02:07:26,464
I am as well.

4574
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:27,161
This is a,

4575
02:07:27,161 --> 02:07:28,430
I love having this studio though,

4576
02:07:28,431 --> 02:07:28,601
man.

4577
02:07:28,601 --> 02:07:29,590
This is fucking great.

4578
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:31,870
Fucking so exciting to have our own space.

4579
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,560
It was so disappointed
when I went to your house.

4580
02:07:34,561 --> 02:07:36,100
Have I said this before?

4581
02:07:37,070 --> 02:07:38,080
That's so normal.

4582
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:38,771
No,

4583
02:07:38,771 --> 02:07:41,170
when you had it in your
house and it was like,

4584
02:07:41,171 --> 02:07:44,650
it was like boxes of clothes and shit.

4585
02:07:44,850 --> 02:07:47,860
Like you always go so far
out to make everything.

4586
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:52,660
I thought you'd have this and you're
like set up and we're sitting on a couch

4587
02:07:52,661 --> 02:07:54,280
like public access TV.

4588
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:57,760
Both trying to look into the
camera but talk to each other.

4589
02:07:57,761 --> 02:07:58,040
At this,

4590
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,380
you know how to do it.

4591
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:01,750
It took a while to figure
out how to do it right.

4592
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:02,770
At first I figured out,

4593
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:02,991
well,

4594
02:08:02,991 --> 02:08:06,760
let's just put like a little coffee
table and some microphones on it and a

4595
02:08:06,761 --> 02:08:07,151
couch.

4596
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:07,990
That'd be comfortable,

4597
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:08,741
but couches aren't,

4598
02:08:08,741 --> 02:08:09,251
they're comfortable.

4599
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:10,270
It turns out no,

4600
02:08:10,330 --> 02:08:11,410
not to talk to each other.

4601
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:12,700
No couches suck.

4602
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:14,140
Office chairs are where it's at.

4603
02:08:14,141 --> 02:08:16,280
Like a good solid leather offers this,

4604
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,040
this,

4605
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:17,330
yeah.

4606
02:08:17,330 --> 02:08:18,970
This a oak table.

4607
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,150
People liked wood.

4608
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:21,630
Wood feels good.

4609
02:08:21,650 --> 02:08:22,830
Feels good to put your hands on it.

4610
02:08:22,831 --> 02:08:24,760
You did it the opposite of how I do it.

4611
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:28,330
I would have the whole setup
and then not know how to do it.

4612
02:08:29,730 --> 02:08:30,130
Hello.

4613
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:30,963
Hello.

4614
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:31,650
Hello.

4615
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:34,000
Well that's exactly how I would
do it if it wasn't for him.

4616
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:35,230
That's why he's better than your guy.

4617
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:37,060
I'm not talking about the electronics.

4618
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:38,440
I'd have someone else do that.

4619
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:39,520
I just wouldn't,

4620
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:39,911
I,

4621
02:08:39,911 --> 02:08:41,140
I'd stutter and go.

4622
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:41,770
Um,

4623
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,190
I,

4624
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:42,461
yeah,

4625
02:08:42,461 --> 02:08:43,570
this is the,

4626
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:45,010
we did that at first.

4627
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:46,810
Go back and if anybody wants to,

4628
02:08:46,811 --> 02:08:50,140
if you're a fan of this podcast and you
listen and go back and watch episode

4629
02:08:50,141 --> 02:08:50,710
one,

4630
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:54,040
if you have any illusions
of how great we are at this,

4631
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:58,870
if you can see the exact fucking
evolution of this sort of a thing for us,

4632
02:08:58,970 --> 02:08:59,950
we were terrible.

4633
02:08:59,951 --> 02:09:02,290
This is exactly what we
want to do at the house.

4634
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:03,430
We got to,

4635
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:04,263
you know,

4636
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:05,051
small,

4637
02:09:05,051 --> 02:09:06,070
small time equipment,

4638
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:07,000
but we tested it.

4639
02:09:07,001 --> 02:09:08,080
Sounds great.

4640
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,180
And are the,

4641
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:13,570
we have a thing between the dining room
and the kitchen is a table this shape.

4642
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,081
Well listen,

4643
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:15,370
I've got a great solution for you.

4644
02:09:15,371 --> 02:09:17,050
I know exactly what the way to do this.

4645
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:17,800
How about this?

4646
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,380
How about we'll pick up the equipment.

4647
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:20,831
We'll,

4648
02:09:20,831 --> 02:09:21,160
we'll,

4649
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,720
we'll order everything for you.

4650
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:24,280
We'll have it installed in your house.

4651
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,461
No,

4652
02:09:24,461 --> 02:09:25,390
we have the equipment.

4653
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:27,550
We have the equipment to do it right.

4654
02:09:27,551 --> 02:09:28,301
We tested it.

4655
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:29,980
We did a fake podcasts.

4656
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:30,761
Absolutely.

4657
02:09:30,761 --> 02:09:31,451
Shit faced.

4658
02:09:31,451 --> 02:09:32,940
You have an account to upload it

4659
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:35,470
so you have everything.

4660
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:35,950
Yeah.

4661
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:39,430
All I need to do is fucking
man up and get on a mic.

4662
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,150
That's it.

4663
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:40,510
Yeah.

4664
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:41,343
So you're ready?

4665
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:41,920
Yeah.

4666
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:42,101
Oh,

4667
02:09:42,101 --> 02:09:43,480
what I was gonna say is there,

4668
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:45,580
we'll set it up for you
and put you on desk squad.

4669
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:46,773
Put you on,

4670
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:47,290
on,

4671
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:48,340
on Brian's network.

4672
02:09:48,370 --> 02:09:48,600
What?

4673
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,630
We can do that too.

4674
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:49,781
Well,

4675
02:09:49,781 --> 02:09:50,441
if you do that,

4676
02:09:50,441 --> 02:09:54,220
you're going to get more viewers for sure.

4677
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:55,540
People are gonna know about it.

4678
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:56,231
It'll be,

4679
02:09:56,231 --> 02:09:58,090
it'll be something and it'd be awesome.

4680
02:09:58,091 --> 02:10:02,080
And right now he's got Kevin Pereira on
who's fucking hilarious and you know,

4681
02:10:02,081 --> 02:10:04,990
and you and Kevin Prayer would be
amazing if you want to do it that way.

4682
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:06,340
I don't be easy.

4683
02:10:06,341 --> 02:10:07,570
It would be easy to promote it.

4684
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:09,130
Join in,

4685
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:09,963
join us,

4686
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:12,033
join us.

4687
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:12,581
See,

4688
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:14,560
I think of death squad as anonymous.

4689
02:10:14,561 --> 02:10:17,160
I don't know how it
actually works into this.

4690
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:17,850
We'll look at this,

4691
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:18,060
this,

4692
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:18,251
this,

4693
02:10:18,251 --> 02:10:19,240
this is how it works.

4694
02:10:19,390 --> 02:10:22,750
The way it works is I call
my fans a sausage army.

4695
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:24,540
I call your fans death school.

4696
02:10:24,860 --> 02:10:29,290
It is going to have to fucking
succumb to your corporate takeover.

4697
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:30,143
We're all the same.

4698
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,190
It's all just saying the,

4699
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:31,510
the,

4700
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:31,811
the,

4701
02:10:31,811 --> 02:10:32,201
the sea.

4702
02:10:32,201 --> 02:10:33,130
There's death squad,

4703
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:33,983
which is

4704
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:37,560
Brian and Joey and Ari and
Eddie Bravo and Tait Fletcher,

4705
02:10:37,561 --> 02:10:38,480
that his desk squad.

4706
02:10:38,481 --> 02:10:40,500
That was all of us that
has Dunkin does you?

4707
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:41,041
You're included.

4708
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:42,060
Anybody but death squad,

4709
02:10:42,061 --> 02:10:42,241
honey,

4710
02:10:42,241 --> 02:10:42,750
honey,

4711
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:43,770
anybody comes in the pocket?

4712
02:10:43,771 --> 02:10:44,581
Anybody crash?

4713
02:10:44,581 --> 02:10:45,720
You're going to mention his name.

4714
02:10:45,721 --> 02:10:46,171
Powerful.

4715
02:10:46,171 --> 02:10:48,450
Bert Kreischer is
unquestionably desk squad.

4716
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:50,130
Jamie Kilstein got thrown out.

4717
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:50,380
Yeah,

4718
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:51,213
he got thrown out.

4719
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:52,450
He can make his way back,

4720
02:10:52,451 --> 02:10:55,640
but he's got to eat meat suck cause
something happened along the line.

4721
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:57,030
Start at sausage army.

4722
02:10:57,031 --> 02:10:57,390
Jamie,

4723
02:10:57,390 --> 02:11:01,270
something happened along the line
and you're going to have to sit com.

4724
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:02,310
We,

4725
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:02,820
anyway,

4726
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:04,830
Brian started a the desk squad.

4727
02:11:04,831 --> 02:11:08,730
Dot TV website and death squad podcasts
was sort of like an extension of branch

4728
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:10,500
and then everyone has
their own little branches.

4729
02:11:10,501 --> 02:11:10,981
You know what I'm saying?

4730
02:11:10,981 --> 02:11:13,650
Like like Ari's Po got the skeptic tank.

4731
02:11:13,651 --> 02:11:17,340
That's a branch of the desk squad
and network and it's like we're all,

4732
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:18,020
it's all the,

4733
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,530
I mean whatever the word is,

4734
02:11:19,531 --> 02:11:20,400
a weird word.

4735
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:20,641
It's a,

4736
02:11:20,641 --> 02:11:22,950
it's just like an approval
of the group of friends,

4737
02:11:22,951 --> 02:11:24,300
like to noise you make with your mouth.

4738
02:11:24,301 --> 02:11:25,140
That means all of us,

4739
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:26,003
what we would all

4740
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:26,971
and it's,

4741
02:11:26,971 --> 02:11:30,570
it's something that we'll come back
to haunt you in a court of law to ask,

4742
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:30,930
well,

4743
02:11:30,930 --> 02:11:35,640
if you called this death squad and
you're claiming you're not a terrorist

4744
02:11:35,641 --> 02:11:36,474
organization,

4745
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:37,550
digital niche,

4746
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:40,440
I have death and so many of my fucking,

4747
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:42,020
I'm going to be dead some days.

4748
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,990
Your first I have death is a theme in all.

4749
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:47,670
Almost all my cds,

4750
02:11:47,671 --> 02:11:52,671
I had a deadbeat hero die laughing
before turning the gun on himself.

4751
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:55,050
I didn't even notice from Oslo.

4752
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:58,050
That's why I didn't listen.

4753
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:03,080
I have the title is the best
part of getting the great
title for a CD and that's

4754
02:12:03,631 --> 02:12:07,080
why that one is a shitty title
cause I knew it was a shitty DVD.

4755
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:08,471
Tabernacles.

4756
02:12:08,471 --> 02:12:10,600
My last one and I just
didn't know what to call it.

4757
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:12,010
I had no idea what to call it.

4758
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:14,530
I sat down and I had no fucking answers.

4759
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,490
I should've called me.

4760
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:17,651
Why though?

4761
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:19,270
I mean life from Jack and dino.

4762
02:12:19,390 --> 02:12:20,920
I like live from the Tabernacle.

4763
02:12:20,921 --> 02:12:21,730
Where is it?

4764
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,260
It was at the Tabernacle and Atlanta.

4765
02:12:23,530 --> 02:12:24,690
It's on Joe rogan.net.

4766
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:27,440
I assume it's from fucking Salt Lake City.

4767
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,171
Is the Tabernacle,

4768
02:12:28,171 --> 02:12:29,630
the Mormon Tabernacle choir.

4769
02:12:29,631 --> 02:12:30,464
Stupid.

4770
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:30,940
See,

4771
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:35,090
I wouldn't call it log chains and water
bottles of water be how are the more

4772
02:12:35,091 --> 02:12:35,721
cocktails?

4773
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:37,760
I have more cocktails.

4774
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:40,800
I have that more likely
I am to call Joe Rogan.

4775
02:12:40,801 --> 02:12:41,634
Stupid

4776
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:46,970
shit gets crazy fucking two drinks
away from fucking taekwondo.

4777
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:50,181
That guy that,

4778
02:12:50,181 --> 02:12:50,330
uh,

4779
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:52,880
did you see that photo that was
on the cover of the New York Post?

4780
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:54,040
The guy got thrown into the,

4781
02:12:54,041 --> 02:12:54,690
um,

4782
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:55,610
the train tracks.

4783
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:56,060
Yeah.

4784
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:56,500
Yeah.

4785
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:57,170
When we were like,

4786
02:12:57,170 --> 02:13:00,470
this man is about to die and they see
the garlic trying to climb out as a trans

4787
02:13:00,471 --> 02:13:01,304
coming.

4788
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:02,203
Did you see that?

4789
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:04,560
I didn't see the unedited.

4790
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,240
To me it was more evidence,

4791
02:13:06,241 --> 02:13:08,550
like avoid conflict at all costs.

4792
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:09,120
All right.

4793
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:12,510
Everybody that wants a mouth off to
people in public and when to fucking puff

4794
02:13:12,511 --> 02:13:13,620
your chest out and flare,

4795
02:13:13,621 --> 02:13:15,450
you go stop.

4796
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:15,990
No,

4797
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:18,590
that's why you go on Facebook
and say something off.

4798
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:21,920
Go on youtube and comment
on someone's video.

4799
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:23,090
Tell them the diamond fire.

4800
02:13:23,750 --> 02:13:23,901
Oh,

4801
02:13:23,901 --> 02:13:25,610
you're a big man behind the keyboard.

4802
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,181
Uh,

4803
02:13:26,181 --> 02:13:28,270
yeah cause I don't want to
get pushed under a subway.

4804
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,113
Stupid.

4805
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,690
That's what you're supposed be a big man.

4806
02:13:31,691 --> 02:13:32,080
That's called

4807
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:32,651
evolution.

4808
02:13:32,651 --> 02:13:33,484
Fuck face.

4809
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:34,473
Okay.

4810
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:35,231
Now man,

4811
02:13:35,231 --> 02:13:35,921
when you have a gun,

4812
02:13:35,921 --> 02:13:36,880
that's why he got a gun,

4813
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:41,110
because you would have punched the
shit out of me when I'm fucking week.

4814
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:41,471
Really?

4815
02:13:41,471 --> 02:13:42,131
It's amazing.

4816
02:13:42,131 --> 02:13:42,551
You should be,

4817
02:13:42,551 --> 02:13:46,900
you should really be applauding someone's
figured out her not have to do squats

4818
02:13:46,901 --> 02:13:49,420
and bison meat for 10 years.

4819
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:50,921
Look at that.

4820
02:13:50,921 --> 02:13:51,371
That's it.

4821
02:13:51,371 --> 02:13:52,810
Pushed onto a subway track.

4822
02:13:52,811 --> 02:13:53,890
This man is about to die.

4823
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:55,560
I fucked up picture.

4824
02:13:55,561 --> 02:13:56,110
Sure.

4825
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:58,960
I wanted to say Jake Lamata in all his,

4826
02:13:58,961 --> 02:13:59,620
uh,

4827
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:00,160
uh,

4828
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:00,993
fog.

4829
02:14:02,990 --> 02:14:03,823
Ooh.

4830
02:14:03,850 --> 02:14:07,120
Remember when you trained
me to fight Tonya Harding?

4831
02:14:07,121 --> 02:14:07,420
Yes.

4832
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:07,900
Yes.

4833
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,040
He actually tried to train.

4834
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:09,280
Yeah,

4835
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:09,651
a little bit.

4836
02:14:09,651 --> 02:14:14,651
He laughed hysterically at my complete
absolute ignorance of physical dexterity.

4837
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:17,193
Uh,

4838
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:20,680
she wouldn't sign the boxing
gloves that I fought her with,

4839
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:21,753
cause she said,

4840
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,150
well,

4841
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:23,800
people will just put this on Ebay.

4842
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:25,480
People being me.

4843
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:26,260
Wait,

4844
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,280
I'm the one asking.

4845
02:14:27,281 --> 02:14:29,030
So you're saying people
will put it on Ebay.

4846
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:34,780
So those boxing gloves had been hanging
up in my house forever and Jake Lamata

4847
02:14:34,930 --> 02:14:37,270
in all his fog signed them for me.

4848
02:14:37,271 --> 02:14:40,840
So fuck you Tonya Harding
not signing my boxing gloves,

4849
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:42,460
but now they're assigned by Jake Lamont.

4850
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:44,080
Now they're worth a hundred times more.

4851
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:46,450
You you're pals with Jake Lamata.

4852
02:14:46,451 --> 02:14:47,470
Does he live in Bisbee?

4853
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:48,701
Yeah,

4854
02:14:48,701 --> 02:14:49,511
there's no pal.

4855
02:14:49,511 --> 02:14:50,740
He doesn't know who I am.

4856
02:14:50,741 --> 02:14:51,251
I've said,

4857
02:14:51,251 --> 02:14:51,430
you know,

4858
02:14:51,430 --> 02:14:52,870
he's coming to my show.

4859
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:55,120
We went to his show.

4860
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:57,720
We played poker at his house in Maya.

4861
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,110
He has no idea who I am.

4862
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:00,203
That is that.

4863
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:01,840
Is that gone?

4864
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:02,591
And uh,

4865
02:15:02,591 --> 02:15:04,540
if you're on the Stan hope,

4866
02:15:04,541 --> 02:15:05,380
celebrity death,

4867
02:15:05,381 --> 02:15:09,780
poole.com and you're thinking about Jake
Lamata thinking you're the first person

4868
02:15:10,030 --> 02:15:10,863
to think of it.

4869
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:11,590
No,

4870
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:13,840
Bingo already has him and Joey Diaz.

4871
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:16,370
That's supposed to say that.

4872
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:17,200
Why?

4873
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:19,930
I had fucking Ron shock
and I feel bad about it.

4874
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,910
Did you want shocks long gone?

4875
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:22,870
Yeah,

4876
02:15:22,870 --> 02:15:23,703
he died.

4877
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:24,041
Well,

4878
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:24,610
you win.

4879
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:26,380
But this is what happened

4880
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:30,130
for full disclosure.

4881
02:15:30,131 --> 02:15:31,480
I had my list.

4882
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:33,130
We every new years,

4883
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:38,370
me and Joby and Bingo Joby
started this like death pool.

4884
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,350
He started doing it for us.

4885
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:45,160
And then it's such a pain in
the ass to keep track of like,

4886
02:15:45,161 --> 02:15:45,461
okay,

4887
02:15:45,461 --> 02:15:49,060
we have 38 people in our
pool and we have money on it.

4888
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:50,613
But two,

4889
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:53,500
you have 38 people picking 20 celebrities.

4890
02:15:53,650 --> 02:15:54,490
How many fucking,

4891
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,290
so every day someone dies,

4892
02:15:56,291 --> 02:15:58,470
Joby has to go through who had what.

4893
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:59,500
He's had pain in the ass.

4894
02:15:59,501 --> 02:16:02,840
So he decided to make this
website that does all that for,

4895
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:03,461
for us.

4896
02:16:03,461 --> 02:16:05,950
That's what Stan of
celebrity death pool is.

4897
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:07,053
So,

4898
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:08,073
uh,

4899
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:12,870
New Year's eve is that's when we break
out our picks and we all sit there and

4900
02:16:12,871 --> 02:16:13,191
like 10,

4901
02:16:13,191 --> 02:16:14,200
how would you find,

4902
02:16:14,201 --> 02:16:15,034
who'd you find?

4903
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:15,761
And another girl,

4904
02:16:15,761 --> 02:16:17,770
Melissa holding in our town and,

4905
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:19,473
and uh,

4906
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:20,170
we didn't,

4907
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:21,520
we were too drunk to do it.

4908
02:16:21,521 --> 02:16:22,301
New Year's Eve.

4909
02:16:22,301 --> 02:16:26,380
So New Year's morning I wake
up and Vince fluke is a comic,

4910
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:27,273
emailed me,

4911
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:27,970
Hey,

4912
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:28,331
you know,

4913
02:16:28,331 --> 02:16:31,530
Ron shock cancer and we
want to do a benefit.

4914
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,800
And so you immediately pull it out like,

4915
02:16:33,801 --> 02:16:34,500
well,

4916
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:36,290
we haven't released our picks in,

4917
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:36,901
Oh,

4918
02:16:36,901 --> 02:16:37,950
you son of a bitch.

4919
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:39,900
What kind of cancer?

4920
02:16:39,930 --> 02:16:40,160
No,

4921
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:40,601
I di,

4922
02:16:40,601 --> 02:16:42,350
I did send him some money and I,

4923
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:44,310
I promoted to all of his shit,

4924
02:16:44,730 --> 02:16:49,650
but death pool is death pool and
affect the outcome of Ron shocks death.

4925
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:51,960
But I immediately I took,

4926
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:54,000
I took the iron sheik out,

4927
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,100
I put it Ron shock and,

4928
02:16:56,101 --> 02:16:57,090
and now I'm

4929
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:01,680
nine days away from fucking first place.

4930
02:17:01,681 --> 02:17:03,630
Ben Goes in third place out of 30,

4931
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:04,800
unless you get for this,

4932
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:05,793
uh,

4933
02:17:05,970 --> 02:17:07,020
was 50 bucks a piece,

4934
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:12,030
I'll get $900 for first shit and the
people are runs it over and people are

4935
02:17:12,511 --> 02:17:12,730
like,

4936
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:14,340
we felt we'd been your death pool.

4937
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:18,660
I'm going to set up a fucking open
illegal gambling fucking operate.

4938
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,021
No.

4939
02:17:19,021 --> 02:17:20,580
If you want to gamble on your own,

4940
02:17:20,581 --> 02:17:21,361
you do that,

4941
02:17:21,361 --> 02:17:22,590
but you can't be in our death

4942
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:23,070
pool.

4943
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:23,230
Yeah.

4944
02:17:23,230 --> 02:17:24,010
How dare you,

4945
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:26,140
how dare you strive and you
make up your own league.

4946
02:17:26,141 --> 02:17:28,180
We just do all the fucking book work,

4947
02:17:28,181 --> 02:17:31,390
which is why we were going to stop doing
it because it's that much of a pain in

4948
02:17:31,391 --> 02:17:31,481
the,

4949
02:17:31,481 --> 02:17:32,230
by the way.

4950
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:35,860
How beautiful would it be if this
country was so free that you could have a

4951
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:39,940
death pool on Doug Stan hope.com and
you could take it a little taste.

4952
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:40,160
Oh,

4953
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:40,690
how about,

4954
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:43,870
how about you health billion
dollar everybody and hey,

4955
02:17:43,871 --> 02:17:45,490
we need to create jobs.

4956
02:17:45,610 --> 02:17:45,941
Well,

4957
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:49,750
all the fucking illegal
gambling is going to fucking UK,

4958
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:50,471
Caribbean,

4959
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:51,460
Coasta Rica.

4960
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:53,423
Yeah.

4961
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:55,270
Those countries are doing fine.

4962
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:55,721
Yeah,

4963
02:17:55,721 --> 02:17:56,441
you're fucked.

4964
02:17:56,441 --> 02:18:00,760
They're fucking illegal gambling
and they're getting the $12 billion.

4965
02:18:00,910 --> 02:18:04,090
You've that gambling is
the one male prostitution.

4966
02:18:04,091 --> 02:18:07,270
You have the fucking Jesus
and the fucking drugs and

4967
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:10,001
gambling.

4968
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:10,834
Gambling.

4969
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:12,490
Everyone's doing it every mile.

4970
02:18:12,491 --> 02:18:13,420
It's available too.

4971
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:14,320
It's just like drugs.

4972
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:16,870
You can go to the fucking corner store
and you could play scratch tickets.

4973
02:18:16,990 --> 02:18:18,460
You can gamble on something.

4974
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:19,403
Yeah.

4975
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:21,370
It's one of those,

4976
02:18:21,370 --> 02:18:23,230
it's like swear words that,

4977
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:23,771
okay,

4978
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:25,030
there's kind of a benefit.

4979
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:29,920
There's a benefit in drugs being
illegal because it's a black market.

4980
02:18:29,921 --> 02:18:30,754
Fucking,

4981
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:31,511
okay.

4982
02:18:31,511 --> 02:18:32,740
I don't have skills.

4983
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:34,090
I can't get a job.

4984
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:35,410
I have three kids.

4985
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:35,861
Oh,

4986
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:36,940
I can sell pot.

4987
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:38,740
Ignore illegal.

4988
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:40,080
Really drives me crazy.

4989
02:18:40,081 --> 02:18:41,010
Sports gambling.

4990
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,620
The fact that sports
gambling cannot be regulated.

4991
02:18:43,621 --> 02:18:45,120
They can't figure out a way to just say,

4992
02:18:45,121 --> 02:18:45,481
listen,

4993
02:18:45,481 --> 02:18:46,530
if you're an American citizen,

4994
02:18:46,531 --> 02:18:48,240
you have to do it in American soil.

4995
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:49,340
Just gamble on,

4996
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:49,800
let's,

4997
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,041
let's,

4998
02:18:50,041 --> 02:18:50,251
let's,

4999
02:18:50,251 --> 02:18:53,190
let's cut out all the fucking
believes and Costa Rica,

5000
02:18:53,191 --> 02:18:53,700
Shit,

5001
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,340
let's just look.

5002
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:55,740
You want to keep the economy strong.

5003
02:18:55,890 --> 02:18:57,450
What's happening inside America?

5004
02:18:57,570 --> 02:19:02,400
Let's have legal gambling
on illegal American servers
that are on American soil.

5005
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:03,900
The taxes go to us.

5006
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:05,630
Slight government gambling,

5007
02:19:05,631 --> 02:19:08,930
lotto scratch with a chance to win.

5008
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:10,270
And by the way,

5009
02:19:10,271 --> 02:19:12,250
it's makes it more fun.

5010
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:15,720
If you're watching a fucking
football game and you have money on,

5011
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:17,260
it becomes more excited.

5012
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:18,460
I bet.

5013
02:19:18,470 --> 02:19:19,610
Only 10 bucks.

5014
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:23,960
I bet on every football game
on Sunday and Monday night,

5015
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:28,130
and now Thursday and occasionally
Saturday and Tuesday if stadium collapses,

5016
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:31,790
it's the only thing that I miss about
working for the UFC is I don't gamble in a

5017
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:32,510
fights.

5018
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:32,930
Really?

5019
02:19:32,930 --> 02:19:33,500
No.

5020
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:33,681
Well,

5021
02:19:33,681 --> 02:19:35,150
you could call me.

5022
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:35,751
I could,

5023
02:19:35,751 --> 02:19:37,490
I have before I hooked up.

5024
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,070
Uh,

5025
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:38,903
uh,

5026
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:39,200
uh,

5027
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,130
Ari Shaffir,

5028
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:44,700
Ari Shaffir was in Vegas and there
was a Glover to sharer was finding.

5029
02:19:44,701 --> 02:19:46,670
It was like one of the best
205 pounders in the world.

5030
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:47,623
Nobody's ever heard of him.

5031
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:48,650
First Time in the UFC,

5032
02:19:48,830 --> 02:19:51,770
I go bet the House on this motherfucker.

5033
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,210
I go back to the house.

5034
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:54,500
I don't tell you that I go,

5035
02:19:54,501 --> 02:19:54,831
listen,

5036
02:19:54,831 --> 02:19:56,510
this guy is a savage.

5037
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:59,270
I mean he's straight
out of fucking Babylon.

5038
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:00,440
Bet The house.

5039
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:04,760
But everything has got to happen
to Joey Diaz is fucking great.

5040
02:20:04,761 --> 02:20:05,750
Youtube picks.

5041
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:06,350
Yeah,

5042
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:07,070
it's busy.

5043
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,060
Joey Diaz is too busy.

5044
02:20:08,061 --> 02:20:08,894
It's too busy.

5045
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:12,830
The Church of what's happening now as
podcast is almost always in the top 10

5046
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:16,640
iTunes comedy charts now washing it.

5047
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,080
That's what we do is can't go me.

5048
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:19,640
You saw what happened when
he went on stage last night.

5049
02:20:19,641 --> 02:20:20,474
He can't go anywhere.

5050
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:22,130
He's gone everywhere he goes.

5051
02:20:22,131 --> 02:20:23,450
He's selling out every club.

5052
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:25,400
He goes to Santa and the club owners,

5053
02:20:25,401 --> 02:20:27,230
these fucking cock suckers,

5054
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,640
they don't want to recognize it,

5055
02:20:28,641 --> 02:20:28,851
man.

5056
02:20:28,851 --> 02:20:31,340
They're trying to low ball
him and give him shitty money.

5057
02:20:31,490 --> 02:20:33,860
He's selling out on like
Tuesdays and Thursday nights.

5058
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:34,873
And I tried to bring him,

5059
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:37,970
I get a whole series of
fucking alternative venues

5060
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,201
do that.

5061
02:20:39,201 --> 02:20:39,381
I'm,

5062
02:20:39,381 --> 02:20:40,790
I'm going to produce his,

5063
02:20:40,791 --> 02:20:41,270
uh,

5064
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:45,980
he needs to have something in a physical
form out there in a video form and you

5065
02:20:45,981 --> 02:20:46,161
know,

5066
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:46,641
and he needs to,

5067
02:20:46,641 --> 02:20:48,980
he needs a DV date and so
we're going to produce it.

5068
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,251
Yeah.

5069
02:20:49,251 --> 02:20:49,511
That's,

5070
02:20:49,511 --> 02:20:54,511
come on Christine Levine always like
she played my party and the cops and the

5071
02:20:56,331 --> 02:20:57,860
first time in seven years,

5072
02:20:57,861 --> 02:21:00,870
we're called to my house and we
have live music in the backyard,

5073
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:04,310
but we live in a small neighborhood where
everyone has to listen to everything

5074
02:21:04,311 --> 02:21:04,701
we do,

5075
02:21:04,701 --> 02:21:07,850
including uptempo conversations,

5076
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:08,684
people here.

5077
02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:09,170
Right.

5078
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:09,860
And she,

5079
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:11,690
she went on stage with an eight minutes.

5080
02:21:11,691 --> 02:21:13,790
The police were there
because of the language.

5081
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:15,560
People finally called the cops.

5082
02:21:15,561 --> 02:21:16,760
She's fucking brilliant.

5083
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:17,031
Well,

5084
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:18,710
you have a stage in your backyard

5085
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:21,701
that quick.

5086
02:21:21,701 --> 02:21:22,041
He says,

5087
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:22,530
yeah,

5088
02:21:22,530 --> 02:21:23,241
I get really does.

5089
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:23,760
Yeah.

5090
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:23,950
Well,

5091
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:24,783
no,

5092
02:21:24,970 --> 02:21:28,970
I should have fucking tried to
create some semblance of no,

5093
02:21:28,971 --> 02:21:29,151
no,

5094
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:29,631
you don't.

5095
02:21:29,631 --> 02:21:30,710
You don't have to live in Bisbee.

5096
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,311
Okay.

5097
02:21:31,311 --> 02:21:32,750
You can go back to Venice.

5098
02:21:32,810 --> 02:21:34,870
I had housing with the flag on the hole.

5099
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,570
That's ready for you.

5100
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:40,780
Do this doubt each other
day because it's Saturday.

5101
02:21:40,781 --> 02:21:44,270
I know there's no traffic idea of traffic.

5102
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:49,410
I W W if I fly into Chicago I will
land at fucking 1130 at night.

5103
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:51,830
So I don't have to,

5104
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:54,740
I hate traffic more than
just makes me crazy.

5105
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,230
I don't have that option
because I'm just too busy.

5106
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:58,430
Well you have to live here.

5107
02:21:58,480 --> 02:21:58,900
Yeah.

5108
02:21:58,900 --> 02:21:59,860
But um,

5109
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,250
the one thing that I wouldn't give up
about La is all the people that I know

5110
02:22:03,251 --> 02:22:04,084
that live in La.

5111
02:22:04,270 --> 02:22:04,511
I mean,

5112
02:22:04,511 --> 02:22:07,690
if I had to live like I did
when I lived in Colorado,

5113
02:22:07,691 --> 02:22:08,650
I lived away from everybody.

5114
02:22:08,651 --> 02:22:10,150
But I saw everybody
when I went on the road.

5115
02:22:10,151 --> 02:22:10,750
So it wasn't so

5116
02:22:10,750 --> 02:22:12,730
absence makes the heart grow.

5117
02:22:12,731 --> 02:22:14,020
When I fucking,

5118
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:16,390
when someone I know comes to Bisbee,

5119
02:22:16,750 --> 02:22:18,580
I feel like I've fallen in love again.

5120
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:22,770
Busy fucking rouse and Henry Phillips,

5121
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:23,470
we'll come,

5122
02:22:23,470 --> 02:22:25,150
we'll come next time we do a podcast.

5123
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:25,760
Let's do it.

5124
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,000
No,

5125
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,431
you don't.

5126
02:22:26,431 --> 02:22:26,941
Don't come.

5127
02:22:26,941 --> 02:22:27,810
And you would hate it.

5128
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:31,650
I want you would fucking
cause you don't like to relax.

5129
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,300
I do like the actually wrong.

5130
02:22:33,301 --> 02:22:33,960
I do.

5131
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:34,793
Really.

5132
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:37,680
I can imagine you being
so fucking bored there.

5133
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:38,281
No,

5134
02:22:38,281 --> 02:22:38,491
no.

5135
02:22:38,491 --> 02:22:38,791
Listen,

5136
02:22:38,791 --> 02:22:39,660
I like to relax.

5137
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:42,780
I just like to sit
around and Pajama pants.

5138
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:43,740
I don't mind doing that.

5139
02:22:43,741 --> 02:22:44,610
What would make you think that?

5140
02:22:44,611 --> 02:22:45,840
I don't like to relax.

5141
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,270
He was like to do stuff,

5142
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:49,290
but when I'm done I like to relax.

5143
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:50,041
I do like put,

5144
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:52,320
there's no doing stuff to get done from,

5145
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,230
but I in my regular life though,

5146
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:56,123
I like that.

5147
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:57,060
Like I,

5148
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:57,510
I went,

5149
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:59,970
he could never do nothing for,

5150
02:22:59,971 --> 02:23:03,720
I would challenge you to see
how long you could do nothing.

5151
02:23:03,721 --> 02:23:04,740
Like I do nothing.

5152
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:09,960
I can see it in the same pair of Pajama
pants on the same couch watching the

5153
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:14,190
shittiest television shows
and doing absolutely nothing.

5154
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:16,410
Like how many days

5155
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,320
I found myself at,

5156
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:22,021
well,

5157
02:23:22,021 --> 02:23:27,021
we were on the road once where Brendan
Walsh and I realized we hadn't showered

5158
02:23:28,111 --> 02:23:29,970
in seven days.

5159
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:31,560
So we go,

5160
02:23:31,740 --> 02:23:35,640
we should really shower and then
we made it to the eighth Oh my God.

5161
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:37,110
How bad is you guys smell?

5162
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:37,860
I would.

5163
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:40,800
You don't smell bad if
you don't exert energy.

5164
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:41,933
That's not true.

5165
02:23:43,330 --> 02:23:47,400
You change your socks and
your socks still stink.

5166
02:23:47,401 --> 02:23:50,520
Olfactory senses socks cover it up.

5167
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:50,671
No,

5168
02:23:50,671 --> 02:23:51,241
they told,

5169
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:51,451
yes,

5170
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:53,490
they do need baby powder.

5171
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,740
All all fact.

5172
02:23:55,750 --> 02:24:00,240
Use the powder because you sweat because
you're exerting energy by going to the

5173
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:00,811
store.

5174
02:24:00,811 --> 02:24:01,644
Maybe

5175
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:05,130
talking to your hotel room.

5176
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:09,780
All factory senses apparently
only detect changes in smell.

5177
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:13,470
That's how people live in shitty
areas like drive through Pennsylvania,

5178
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:14,453
hoarders,

5179
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:17,760
people that live in my
towel around your pillow.

5180
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:19,110
They don't smell it.

5181
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:23,310
People that go to cow towns and you know
like how the fuck do people live here?

5182
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:24,420
The people that live there,

5183
02:24:24,421 --> 02:24:25,730
they don't smell it cause your,

5184
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:27,960
your nose detects changes in smell.

5185
02:24:27,961 --> 02:24:29,280
It's really weird like that.

5186
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:29,850
Yeah.

5187
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:30,660
Yeah.

5188
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,830
That's how homeless people go.

5189
02:24:31,831 --> 02:24:33,210
What do you mean or I can't get a ride.

5190
02:24:33,211 --> 02:24:34,410
I'm going to stinking up your car.

5191
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:34,861
Yeah.

5192
02:24:34,861 --> 02:24:36,990
I can only sit around for a few hours.

5193
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:42,020
I unfortunately have a furnace
that I have to throw wood into.

5194
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:43,650
I got to keep moving.

5195
02:24:44,130 --> 02:24:45,360
This is who I am.

5196
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:47,520
You have a furnace inside me,

5197
02:24:47,550 --> 02:24:48,330
inside myself.

5198
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:48,750
Oh,

5199
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:49,140
okay.

5200
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:49,381
All right.

5201
02:24:49,381 --> 02:24:49,950
Sorry.

5202
02:24:49,950 --> 02:24:50,810
Is there a metaphor?

5203
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:56,360
All of a sudden it's a metaphor for
change will come picture Joe Rogan living

5204
02:24:56,371 --> 02:24:57,204
off the grid.

5205
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,073
I would like to,

5206
02:24:58,210 --> 02:24:58,981
I I look,

5207
02:24:58,981 --> 02:25:00,600
I tried to do that when
I lived in Colorado.

5208
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:02,040
I pretty much lived off the grid.

5209
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:03,690
You know the House that I was,

5210
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:06,000
I was like eight miles down
a dirt road in the woods,

5211
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:07,171
off the grid,

5212
02:25:07,171 --> 02:25:10,620
like Bisbee off the grid where there's
a whole community that's off the grid

5213
02:25:10,621 --> 02:25:11,454
solar,

5214
02:25:12,450 --> 02:25:13,390
there's be solar.

5215
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:17,280
A lot of it is that they have a whole
community off the grid that they don't

5216
02:25:17,310 --> 02:25:18,450
have electric fills.

5217
02:25:18,451 --> 02:25:19,500
It's all solar.

5218
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:20,101
Yeah.

5219
02:25:20,101 --> 02:25:20,341
No,

5220
02:25:20,341 --> 02:25:22,290
I have no bills and
that'll be at my house.

5221
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:24,220
I'm setting that up at
my house in California.

5222
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:24,850
I,

5223
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:27,190
you know why I think were
ridiculous and not do that.

5224
02:25:27,191 --> 02:25:28,570
If you have the availability,

5225
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:29,750
like why would you want to be defined?

5226
02:25:29,751 --> 02:25:30,820
I don't have the people.

5227
02:25:30,990 --> 02:25:31,510
Yeah.

5228
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:34,180
That's one of like the
occupy thing where they go,

5229
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:34,601
no,

5230
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:35,800
we want to work.

5231
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:41,070
I have so many things I want to spend
money on in Bisbee and there's people that

5232
02:25:41,231 --> 02:25:46,231
know how to do it and I could stand
on a ladder waving cash and uh,

5233
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:47,703
well Yo,

5234
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:48,111
they've all,

5235
02:25:48,111 --> 02:25:49,310
I can think about it and I'm,

5236
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:52,450
maybe we put a thing together to see
how much and then never hear from them

5237
02:25:52,451 --> 02:25:52,811
again.

5238
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:53,890
Like I want,

5239
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:55,510
I want a new fucking bathroom.

5240
02:25:55,511 --> 02:25:57,070
My bathroom is ugly as shit.

5241
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,460
I wouldn't get anybody to work on this.

5242
02:25:59,510 --> 02:26:01,810
Be just devoid of contractors.

5243
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:07,680
Unemployment is the fucking major or
disability is the major income there.

5244
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,740
Wow.

5245
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:09,240
Yeah.

5246
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:13,630
That's isn't it funny how people
become addicted to like aid?

5247
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:17,320
That's a strange thing with
people like this welfare state.

5248
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:18,040
Well like wait,

5249
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:20,560
before I get fucking Bisbee turned on me,

5250
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:23,290
there's a lot of people that
just work enough to live.

5251
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:24,310
They don't want to work.

5252
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:24,670
Right.

5253
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:26,290
And they don't have big bills.

5254
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:31,590
Almost everyone watches TV on the
Internet on a laptop and don't pay for it.

5255
02:26:32,670 --> 02:26:33,220
So yeah,

5256
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:34,450
they'll download shit.

5257
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,980
They just don't want to work.

5258
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:36,521
Well,

5259
02:26:36,521 --> 02:26:37,331
I understand that.

5260
02:26:37,331 --> 02:26:38,770
I'm completely behind it.

5261
02:26:38,830 --> 02:26:39,521
Well isn't the idea.

5262
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:39,761
It's,

5263
02:26:39,761 --> 02:26:40,870
it's an artist community,

5264
02:26:40,871 --> 02:26:41,051
right?

5265
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:44,350
Is it the idea which means how
far it is a fucking redneck.

5266
02:26:44,351 --> 02:26:45,220
A real job.

5267
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,550
Half artist have rednecks.

5268
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:48,970
Balance doesn't happen.

5269
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:49,551
It's a,

5270
02:26:49,551 --> 02:26:52,330
it's the only small town I could
ever live in that I've found.

5271
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,990
Have you found anybody that's moved
to that town because they're crazy.

5272
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:56,410
Doug.

5273
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:57,340
Stan hope fans.

5274
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:58,203
One guy.

5275
02:26:58,560 --> 02:26:59,800
Do you remember that guy?

5276
02:26:59,801 --> 02:27:00,634
Knew it.

5277
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,270
One Guy,

5278
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:01,930
but he wasn't,

5279
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:02,890
it wasn't bothersome.

5280
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:04,151
I didn't know.

5281
02:27:04,151 --> 02:27:06,820
He said I moved here because you
talked about it on the Internet,

5282
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:08,410
but he lives in old Bisbee.

5283
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:09,071
I'm,

5284
02:27:09,071 --> 02:27:10,780
I'm well that's different.

5285
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:11,261
I mean that,

5286
02:27:11,261 --> 02:27:11,531
look,

5287
02:27:11,531 --> 02:27:12,610
if you told me,

5288
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:13,120
uh,

5289
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:13,601
the one,

5290
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:16,290
the reasons why I moved to boulder
is someone told me about Boulder's,

5291
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:17,770
about how beautiful boulder is,

5292
02:27:17,771 --> 02:27:18,461
and then I went down.

5293
02:27:18,461 --> 02:27:18,670
I'm like,

5294
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:19,360
Holy Fuck.

5295
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,080
They were right.

5296
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:22,360
There's nothing wrong with
accepting correct information.

5297
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,220
You're talking about how
great you love Bisbee.

5298
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,300
There's no money there.

5299
02:27:25,301 --> 02:27:26,740
There's no you can't I,

5300
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:27,640
yeah,

5301
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,870
but that resonates with some people.

5302
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:29,710
That's what they're looking for.

5303
02:27:29,711 --> 02:27:31,810
They're looking for like
a relaxed sort of asleep.

5304
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:33,160
You can't make a living there.

5305
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:34,341
So you ask,

5306
02:27:34,341 --> 02:27:36,190
you want to work in the Deli at Safeway?

5307
02:27:36,710 --> 02:27:41,710
Unloading cannot keep fucking anyone at
the Safeway because Colin Evelyn at the

5308
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:43,961
deli neighbor,

5309
02:27:43,961 --> 02:27:44,794
Dave's wife.

5310
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:45,620
Oh yeah.

5311
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:46,510
Neighbor Dave's wife.

5312
02:27:46,511 --> 02:27:48,980
She's a deli manager and nobody answered.

5313
02:27:48,990 --> 02:27:52,690
Be The deli person and safe way
because all the positions pay the same.

5314
02:27:52,691 --> 02:27:54,760
And the Deli is where you lose a finger.

5315
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:56,140
It's a hard job.

5316
02:27:56,470 --> 02:27:56,831
They're like,

5317
02:27:56,831 --> 02:27:57,251
fuck it,

5318
02:27:57,251 --> 02:27:58,330
I'll be a bagger.

5319
02:27:58,470 --> 02:27:58,780
Ah,

5320
02:27:58,780 --> 02:27:59,260
okay.

5321
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:00,430
Well that does make sense.

5322
02:28:00,431 --> 02:28:00,940
Yes.

5323
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:05,320
So does that one of my favorite bits on
a turning it before talking referendum

5324
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:05,861
number two,

5325
02:28:05,861 --> 02:28:06,700
death squad.

5326
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:07,481
Yes.

5327
02:28:07,481 --> 02:28:10,390
Gets safe way to change
their fucking a wage.

5328
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:10,880
All right.

5329
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:15,860
You know some crazy desk on character
moving to fucking Bisbee to be the the,

5330
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:18,850
the Doug just want to tell you,

5331
02:28:18,970 --> 02:28:19,551
you know you,

5332
02:28:19,551 --> 02:28:22,130
you brought it up on the Joe podcast

5333
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:27,250
and then I knew that I was mad to me the
Deli person at Bisbee in the Safeway,

5334
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:28,820
there was something missing in my life.

5335
02:28:28,821 --> 02:28:29,840
I didn't even know what it said to you.

5336
02:28:29,841 --> 02:28:31,340
Said that it was like a
light went off in my head.

5337
02:28:31,341 --> 02:28:31,491
Man.

5338
02:28:31,491 --> 02:28:32,031
I just want to tell you,

5339
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:36,050
I really love you and want to get your
first tattooed on my body somewhere.

5340
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:36,810
Okay?

5341
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:37,643
We've had some,

5342
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:39,011
oh wait,

5343
02:28:39,011 --> 02:28:41,080
we had those people show up for football.

5344
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:44,290
They were trying to find my
house cause I put my address.

5345
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:45,330
Okay.

5346
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:46,051
Get a pen.

5347
02:28:46,051 --> 02:28:47,720
People two,

5348
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:48,270
one,

5349
02:28:48,270 --> 02:28:49,550
two vans.

5350
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,530
Street bidding goes over in her eyes.

5351
02:28:52,531 --> 02:28:53,364
Bingo.

5352
02:28:53,430 --> 02:28:53,761
No,

5353
02:28:53,761 --> 02:28:54,520
Bingo.

5354
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:55,200
Yes sir.

5355
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:55,921
You live with a woman,

5356
02:28:55,921 --> 02:28:56,231
you know,

5357
02:28:56,231 --> 02:28:56,790
take care of,

5358
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:00,560
but I have people send shit to Bingo
because I do this all the time and Bingo.

5359
02:29:00,561 --> 02:29:01,470
So retarded.

5360
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,180
The packages will show up.

5361
02:29:03,550 --> 02:29:04,190
Hang on.

5362
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:04,621
Here you go.

5363
02:29:04,621 --> 02:29:04,861
That's,

5364
02:29:04,861 --> 02:29:05,720
that's people calling him.

5365
02:29:05,721 --> 02:29:07,040
Why don't you just put your phone on off?

5366
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:07,860
Fuck.

5367
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:09,480
Who is this thing called?

5368
02:29:09,481 --> 02:29:10,110
Speaker phone.

5369
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:10,821
Are you listening?

5370
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:11,654
Jaylee.

5371
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:18,980
Oh well I'm on the Joe Rogan podcast and
we're just re upping the you versus red

5372
02:29:19,930 --> 02:29:20,250
band.

5373
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:25,250
Who's the better fucking tour
manager slash webcast guy?

5374
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:33,390
See My fucking guy is prescient.

5375
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:36,450
That holds you already
bet you got a slave.

5376
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:36,900
All right.

5377
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:39,630
I have a master craftsman call you back.

5378
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:40,141
If I,

5379
02:29:40,141 --> 02:29:41,190
if I text Brian,

5380
02:29:41,191 --> 02:29:42,470
he calls me back like an hour.

5381
02:29:42,471 --> 02:29:42,871
There it goes,

5382
02:29:42,871 --> 02:29:43,200
you know,

5383
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,033
and so

5384
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,021
someone with talent,

5385
02:29:46,021 --> 02:29:47,370
I don't have to call my guy,

5386
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,780
I think his name,

5387
02:29:48,781 --> 02:29:53,450
like beetle juice and he calls into the
show because he's got no talent cause

5388
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:54,091
he's scared.

5389
02:29:54,091 --> 02:29:57,120
Brian's out there having threesomes with
porn stars and he comes back and tells

5390
02:29:57,121 --> 02:29:57,601
me about it.

5391
02:29:57,601 --> 02:29:58,380
Okay,

5392
02:29:58,380 --> 02:29:59,850
I'll take my guy over yours.

5393
02:29:59,870 --> 02:30:00,450
All right,

5394
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:01,650
I'll take my guy over years.

5395
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:02,640
All Day.

5396
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:03,503
How about that?

5397
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:08,790
Not that there's anything
wrong with your guy.

5398
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,833
I'm not saying

5399
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:12,280
I find Red Ben.

5400
02:30:12,310 --> 02:30:13,840
Even more adorable than you.

5401
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:14,380
Look.

5402
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:15,000
Thank you.

5403
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,030
I don't know what to say about that.

5404
02:30:16,530 --> 02:30:18,370
Am I competitive instincts get fueled.

5405
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:22,440
You must not be correct possible.

5406
02:30:24,370 --> 02:30:26,830
You must be wrong all along with you.

5407
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:27,873
No matter what.

5408
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:31,000
What were we talking about before Charlie?

5409
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:31,600
Bucket check.

5410
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:33,760
Probably blow jobs and bad teeth.

5411
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:34,011
Oh,

5412
02:30:34,011 --> 02:30:34,090
okay.

5413
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:34,391
You're,

5414
02:30:34,391 --> 02:30:34,781
you're a,

5415
02:30:34,781 --> 02:30:36,820
those people came to your house to watch.

5416
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:41,200
Someone was driving around
trying to find my house.

5417
02:30:41,370 --> 02:30:43,750
I know it was during football and they,

5418
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:44,590
they uh,

5419
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:47,470
they went to a local store
in old Bisbee and said,

5420
02:30:47,710 --> 02:30:47,891
hey,

5421
02:30:47,891 --> 02:30:49,480
do you know where Doug Stanhope lives?

5422
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:51,520
And it's the Sh uh,

5423
02:30:51,580 --> 02:30:54,190
wife of the guy that's always at football.

5424
02:30:54,610 --> 02:30:58,390
They just happen to go into
that store and she's like,

5425
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:00,940
there's a guy looking around,

5426
02:31:00,941 --> 02:31:01,030
right?

5427
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:04,020
So she calls you doing the
hand up to the [inaudible].

5428
02:31:04,510 --> 02:31:06,090
I did the imaginary

5429
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:06,561
phone,

5430
02:31:06,561 --> 02:31:07,430
hand motion,

5431
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:09,210
add a site.

5432
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:09,651
I go,

5433
02:31:09,651 --> 02:31:09,891
yeah,

5434
02:31:09,891 --> 02:31:10,460
fuck it.

5435
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:11,121
It's football.

5436
02:31:11,121 --> 02:31:11,510
They can,

5437
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:12,710
anyone can come over Durham.

5438
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:14,670
So you let anybody come over your house

5439
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:15,520
for football,

5440
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,270
for football.

5441
02:31:16,270 --> 02:31:16,841
That makes sense.

5442
02:31:16,841 --> 02:31:18,190
If I'm in town for football,

5443
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:19,720
so let's,

5444
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:20,030
let's,

5445
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:20,863
let's it

5446
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:23,880
looking like the Nero scan
and I'm not even tripping.

5447
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,230
I'm looking like to Niro again.

5448
02:31:25,580 --> 02:31:26,281
Mark Babbitt.

5449
02:31:26,281 --> 02:31:26,910
I'm Deniro.

5450
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:27,743
I'm Joe Rogan.

5451
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:28,171
But Hey,

5452
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:30,150
I am wearing last time
when I was tripping,

5453
02:31:30,151 --> 02:31:35,010
you fucking look like the de Niro and
which one in Cape fear or in raging bull,

5454
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:35,520
I don't know.

5455
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:39,720
But last night it was seriously
mark Babbitt because of
the shading of your head

5456
02:31:39,930 --> 02:31:42,420
made you look like you had
bald guy hair in the back.

5457
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:43,713
I was um,

5458
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:43,990
uh,

5459
02:31:43,990 --> 02:31:45,050
thinking about your,

5460
02:31:45,051 --> 02:31:46,750
a bad teeth thing.

5461
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:47,850
You know about you.

5462
02:31:47,851 --> 02:31:50,500
You have a thing about
bad teeth and the smile.

5463
02:31:50,530 --> 02:31:51,580
I just have miserable.

5464
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:54,250
I have to give this one one person props.

5465
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:57,250
This is girl who's a ring
card girl for Bela Tarr.

5466
02:31:57,310 --> 02:31:58,143
Look at that.

5467
02:31:58,270 --> 02:31:59,103
Oh Wow.

5468
02:31:59,170 --> 02:31:59,650
Oh yeah,

5469
02:31:59,650 --> 02:32:00,483
exactly.

5470
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:00,941
Like,

5471
02:32:00,941 --> 02:32:01,090
look,

5472
02:32:01,090 --> 02:32:01,510
come on man.

5473
02:32:01,510 --> 02:32:02,890
That doesn't make you want to fuck again.

5474
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:04,030
Look at that.

5475
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:04,780
Look at that picture.

5476
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:05,470
Her name is,

5477
02:32:05,470 --> 02:32:06,550
her name is jade Bryce.

5478
02:32:06,551 --> 02:32:06,851
But anyway,

5479
02:32:06,851 --> 02:32:08,710
she's got like a gap between her teeth,

5480
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:09,461
but she's so hot.

5481
02:32:09,461 --> 02:32:09,761
It doesn't,

5482
02:32:09,761 --> 02:32:10,660
well that's Bella,

5483
02:32:10,661 --> 02:32:11,240
Donna.

5484
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:11,431
No,

5485
02:32:11,431 --> 02:32:11,601
no,

5486
02:32:11,601 --> 02:32:11,771
no,

5487
02:32:11,771 --> 02:32:11,900
no,

5488
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:12,041
no,

5489
02:32:12,041 --> 02:32:12,131
no.

5490
02:32:12,131 --> 02:32:12,964
Good gap.

5491
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:13,421
Yeah.

5492
02:32:13,421 --> 02:32:18,130
But her gap is filled with like shitty
covered dicks that came right out of

5493
02:32:18,131 --> 02:32:19,420
butts right in her mouth.

5494
02:32:19,570 --> 02:32:21,610
This girl's a little bit
cleaner and it's a little,

5495
02:32:21,611 --> 02:32:22,810
little cleaner situation.

5496
02:32:23,050 --> 02:32:23,950
Dawna then,

5497
02:32:23,951 --> 02:32:26,550
then does jade price girl Bella,

5498
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:26,951
Donna,

5499
02:32:26,951 --> 02:32:29,410
we've always had very
different tastes in women.

5500
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:29,680
Well,

5501
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:30,850
was Bella Donna dirty?

5502
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:31,751
She's a little dirty,

5503
02:32:31,751 --> 02:32:32,230
right?

5504
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:33,130
Not that it's bad.

5505
02:32:33,430 --> 02:32:33,640
Oh,

5506
02:32:33,640 --> 02:32:34,131
I like her.

5507
02:32:34,131 --> 02:32:36,190
She seems this other girl,

5508
02:32:36,191 --> 02:32:39,640
just jade price check is just
simply a girl holds up ring cards.

5509
02:32:39,641 --> 02:32:42,700
She's not like getting
like ass to mouth all day.

5510
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:44,830
Different sort of a situation.

5511
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:45,430
What's wrong?

5512
02:32:45,430 --> 02:32:46,990
I don't know why you have
to compare that girl.

5513
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:49,510
This girl I'm talking to you about one
girl and you've got to bring up another

5514
02:32:49,511 --> 02:32:50,344
girl that you'd go.

5515
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:51,071
I was like,

5516
02:32:51,071 --> 02:32:51,910
this is confusing.

5517
02:32:52,570 --> 02:32:55,810
I tried to give some girls some props
and she doesn't get fixed her teeth,

5518
02:32:56,050 --> 02:32:57,280
but she's got a ridiculous ass.

5519
02:32:57,281 --> 02:32:57,731
Look at that ass.

5520
02:32:57,731 --> 02:32:58,030
Brian.

5521
02:32:58,030 --> 02:32:58,330
Please.

5522
02:32:58,330 --> 02:32:59,070
Can I get a witness?

5523
02:32:59,070 --> 02:32:59,580
Yeah.

5524
02:32:59,580 --> 02:33:00,480
That's a nice ass.

5525
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:01,830
That's about as good as it gets.

5526
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:02,130
No,

5527
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:03,220
I don't like that ass.

5528
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:05,550
You don't like that ass right there.

5529
02:33:06,630 --> 02:33:07,310
Shut up.

5530
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:08,160
Fuck up.

5531
02:33:08,161 --> 02:33:08,820
God dammit.

5532
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:10,080
That's where babies come from.

5533
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:12,650
That's maybe still come out of the yes.

5534
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:13,990
No,

5535
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,130
no,

5536
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:14,311
no.

5537
02:33:14,311 --> 02:33:17,520
That's well that fat is there to
protect the cells or something.

5538
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:18,630
Let's see.

5539
02:33:18,630 --> 02:33:19,291
Eggs grow.

5540
02:33:19,291 --> 02:33:24,291
You must have a big ass like that means
I'm only getting half of mine in it

5541
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:26,940
because the other half of the
gas is going to hold me up.

5542
02:33:26,970 --> 02:33:29,850
It's like an Anaconda with a
metal pipe shoved through it.

5543
02:33:29,851 --> 02:33:30,684
That's what it's like.

5544
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:35,040
Stuffed the fat and tied off like a ham

5545
02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:40,860
with white string.

5546
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:42,510
Okay.

5547
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:43,650
That's what my Cox like.

5548
02:33:43,651 --> 02:33:44,484
God dammit.

5549
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:45,750
We're all different.

5550
02:33:45,751 --> 02:33:48,600
Doug's Dan hope don't hate
me for actually lucky pussy.

5551
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:50,340
Jesus Christ.

5552
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:51,991
I like pussy.

5553
02:33:51,991 --> 02:33:54,690
I've always had a different idea.

5554
02:33:54,691 --> 02:33:55,010
Idea

5555
02:33:55,010 --> 02:33:56,870
of what fucking beautiful is.

5556
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:57,561
Oh yeah.

5557
02:33:57,561 --> 02:33:58,250
Well listen,

5558
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:00,770
it's all subjective and beauty's
in the eye of the beholder.

5559
02:34:01,090 --> 02:34:01,580
Yeah,

5560
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:02,001
for real.

5561
02:34:02,001 --> 02:34:03,230
I mean there's like a lot of dudes,

5562
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:05,360
there's websites dedicated
to guys who love,

5563
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:07,550
like really overlooked overweight women.

5564
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:11,840
They love like rolls of fat and I think
a lot of that has also has to do with

5565
02:34:11,841 --> 02:34:15,650
what you were first introduced
to when you were becoming sexual.

5566
02:34:15,890 --> 02:34:17,120
Like if you have a girlfriend,

5567
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:17,801
if you start getting,

5568
02:34:17,801 --> 02:34:17,980
not

5569
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,930
even talk sexual attractive.

5570
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:20,310
Okay.

5571
02:34:20,310 --> 02:34:24,880
I literally attract like
attracts like yours.

5572
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:25,511
Stunning.

5573
02:34:25,511 --> 02:34:29,950
There's something about you that I want
to keep looking at as far as porn goes.

5574
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:30,963
Jacking off.

5575
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:31,481
Yes.

5576
02:34:31,481 --> 02:34:36,430
That probably ruined a lot of my sex
drive is I was so in a porn than,

5577
02:34:36,431 --> 02:34:37,720
and it's never like that.

5578
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:39,940
It's never perfectly cleaned.

5579
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:41,050
Trimmed,

5580
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:43,060
sanitized.

5581
02:34:43,061 --> 02:34:47,630
Chlorine with Brian [inaudible]

5582
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:53,980
smokes tear when it smells
wins over your guy once again.

5583
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:56,560
Just one one more time.

5584
02:34:56,561 --> 02:34:57,394
God Damn it.

5585
02:34:57,730 --> 02:34:58,001
No,

5586
02:34:58,001 --> 02:34:58,870
I know what you're talking about.

5587
02:34:58,871 --> 02:34:59,300
It's like,

5588
02:34:59,300 --> 02:35:02,890
well I had a girl when I first started
dating and I was in high school,

5589
02:35:02,891 --> 02:35:06,070
had like very unusual
feat shed weird feet.

5590
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:06,871
She had like,

5591
02:35:06,871 --> 02:35:07,200
like,

5592
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:07,760
like,

5593
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:11,650
like kind of like are we talking
jerking off or just what you want?

5594
02:35:11,651 --> 02:35:14,950
You're sexually tried to ops
and makes you honey honey.

5595
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:20,130
That girl I think is fucking phenomenally
beautiful because she's engaging,

5596
02:35:20,891 --> 02:35:25,891
she's attracting you see or you see like
I see a commercial with a supermodel

5597
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:27,880
and I look at her going,

5598
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:30,010
how boring would she be?

5599
02:35:30,190 --> 02:35:33,940
Like she wouldn't want to eat a thing
like the all the things that race through

5600
02:35:33,941 --> 02:35:36,020
your head as she would be sold.

5601
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,240
No.

5602
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:38,073
How dare you?

5603
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:41,820
Earliest headshot.

5604
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:42,191
That's my,

5605
02:35:42,191 --> 02:35:45,670
I was 20 years of garden.

5606
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:52,210
How do you say a link to that
as a Twitter fan of the show?

5607
02:35:54,311 --> 02:35:57,700
I get really upset when you're
doing stuff that only you,

5608
02:35:57,760 --> 02:35:58,840
us are enjoyable.

5609
02:35:58,920 --> 02:35:59,471
Red Band.

5610
02:35:59,471 --> 02:36:02,520
We'll put that on his Twitter
red ban and you can see it.

5611
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:05,340
That is my 20 I was 21 years old.

5612
02:36:05,341 --> 02:36:06,370
It was an open miker.

5613
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:07,290
That was my headshot.

5614
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:07,660
I don't.

5615
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:08,560
Nice head of hair.

5616
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:09,610
It was really nice.

5617
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:11,250
You were worried about there.

5618
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:13,200
You've got me on fucking Rogaine for,

5619
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:18,100
I should have shaved my
head a long time ago.

5620
02:36:18,101 --> 02:36:18,950
It was like what first?

5621
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:19,970
When I first started doing it,

5622
02:36:19,971 --> 02:36:20,590
I was like,

5623
02:36:20,590 --> 02:36:21,970
it's like so freeing.

5624
02:36:21,971 --> 02:36:25,600
It was like a feels good or
scar and not nearly as bad.

5625
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,850
We have our friend Billy bad who's like,

5626
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,190
he's the to Alaska,

5627
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:32,500
but he is.

5628
02:36:32,501 --> 02:36:33,400
He's the fucking,

5629
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:33,760
yeah.

5630
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:35,230
How was he in that way in the world?

5631
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:35,930
He's,

5632
02:36:35,930 --> 02:36:36,763
he's you.

5633
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:38,410
He's the U of Alaska.

5634
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:40,170
If I go up there and without the fun,

5635
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,560
he's just cool.

5636
02:36:41,561 --> 02:36:42,460
Like the coolest,

5637
02:36:42,461 --> 02:36:43,294
nicest,

5638
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:45,400
but he did the same thing you did.

5639
02:36:45,401 --> 02:36:50,401
But he has this Charlie Brown Frankenstein
scar that goes in a triangle pattern

5640
02:36:52,601 --> 02:36:53,770
around us and,

5641
02:36:53,950 --> 02:36:54,910
and now he's shaved.

5642
02:36:54,911 --> 02:36:55,630
His head is,

5643
02:36:55,630 --> 02:36:57,700
he got to the age are like fuck and fuck.

5644
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,110
It was the last,

5645
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:00,670
I don't give a fuck left.

5646
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:01,481
I didn't have any,

5647
02:37:01,481 --> 02:37:02,620
I don't give a fuck sloughed.

5648
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:04,450
So shaving my head was the last,

5649
02:37:04,451 --> 02:37:07,600
I don't give a fuck and what had
happened as soon as I did and I was like,

5650
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:08,440
ah,

5651
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:12,460
that was Jesus and your scar to me.

5652
02:37:12,461 --> 02:37:16,010
Cause like you definitely you would
talk about that for a year is about like

5653
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,441
your scar.

5654
02:37:16,441 --> 02:37:19,190
Like I wish I could shake my head but I
don't want to because the scar must have

5655
02:37:19,191 --> 02:37:22,850
been like three or four years and once
he shaved it was like Brody Stevens scar

5656
02:37:22,851 --> 02:37:26,930
on his face that he always talks about
it and that I never see Brody Stevens

5657
02:37:26,931 --> 02:37:27,890
crazy where you're like,

5658
02:37:27,930 --> 02:37:28,281
all right,

5659
02:37:28,281 --> 02:37:28,851
I'm crazy.

5660
02:37:28,851 --> 02:37:29,270
All right,

5661
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:30,103
now it's out.

5662
02:37:30,450 --> 02:37:31,283
Yeah,

5663
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:32,870
it was like fucking,

5664
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:34,370
you know Charlie Sheen going,

5665
02:37:34,371 --> 02:37:34,611
yeah,

5666
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:35,600
I fucked hookers.

5667
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,553
I'm in court.

5668
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:36,921
Yeah.

5669
02:37:36,921 --> 02:37:38,450
I made them dress up like cheerleaders.

5670
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:39,513
Okay.

5671
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:40,870
Once you stopped and I hit,

5672
02:37:40,871 --> 02:37:41,830
no one cares.

5673
02:37:41,831 --> 02:37:42,161
Yeah.

5674
02:37:42,161 --> 02:37:43,360
Once it's out there,

5675
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:46,180
it's out there and until it's out there,

5676
02:37:46,181 --> 02:37:47,850
it's always something you
want to fucking hate them.

5677
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:52,960
Baldness is like considered a disease
on some levels where like that kids with

5678
02:37:53,451 --> 02:37:54,284
cancer,

5679
02:37:54,520 --> 02:37:56,330
I'm going to shave her
head to give them a hair.

5680
02:37:56,331 --> 02:37:56,780
Like,

5681
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:57,051
wait,

5682
02:37:57,051 --> 02:37:58,490
I don't have fucking hair mine,

5683
02:37:58,730 --> 02:38:01,340
so I'm supposed to be as
embarrassed as a child.

5684
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:04,580
Like I'm some kind of Google to a child.

5685
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:05,683
That's funny.

5686
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:06,950
I know.

5687
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:10,850
Some health care we'll
cover baldness like what?

5688
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:12,950
I'm supposed to feel bad.

5689
02:38:12,951 --> 02:38:13,760
I don't give up.

5690
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,451
I know,

5691
02:38:14,451 --> 02:38:14,751
right.

5692
02:38:14,751 --> 02:38:15,650
It's a weird thing.

5693
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:16,221
It's a,

5694
02:38:16,221 --> 02:38:16,800
it's a,

5695
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:17,121
well,

5696
02:38:17,121 --> 02:38:18,350
you know what a part of it is,

5697
02:38:18,351 --> 02:38:20,450
it's like a lack of control thing.

5698
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:24,080
Have you don't have control over something
like eyebrows are important to people

5699
02:38:24,330 --> 02:38:25,850
who know why they're important to people.

5700
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:29,120
If they fell off you'd be like,

5701
02:38:29,121 --> 02:38:30,620
where's my fucking eyebrows?

5702
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:32,460
But if you shave my eyebrows,

5703
02:38:32,470 --> 02:38:36,980
my life wouldn't change at all except
for the fact that people would realize I

5704
02:38:36,981 --> 02:38:37,940
don't have eyebrows anymore,

5705
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:41,180
but they have no fucking purpose and
they wouldn't want to talk about it.

5706
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:45,060
That's why the inch will be the men
like a Mexican gang banger check.

5707
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:55,290
The Internet will change how we
feel about honesty across the board.

5708
02:38:55,681 --> 02:38:56,620
I think it already has,

5709
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:57,240
isn't it?

5710
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:57,870
Well,

5711
02:38:57,870 --> 02:39:01,830
to the point where it now you will
be open about things because you know

5712
02:39:01,831 --> 02:39:04,530
someone's going to say it about
you on Facebook beyond your,

5713
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:04,831
oh,

5714
02:39:04,831 --> 02:39:09,290
the guy next to me has the
fucking weirdest died prowess
in the cubicle next to

5715
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,200
it and he's going to be,

5716
02:39:10,380 --> 02:39:11,490
I'm going to hit on the chicken,

5717
02:39:11,491 --> 02:39:12,540
the cubicle next to me.

5718
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:13,021
Oh wait,

5719
02:39:13,021 --> 02:39:14,130
she's talking about me.

5720
02:39:14,310 --> 02:39:15,960
I'm the only one with no eyebrows.

5721
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:18,480
People will be open about stuff.

5722
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:22,200
That whole level of politeness that
has nothing to do with civility.

5723
02:39:22,590 --> 02:39:23,700
It's not being rude.

5724
02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:24,570
Oh,

5725
02:39:24,570 --> 02:39:24,721
Oh,

5726
02:39:24,721 --> 02:39:24,891
you,

5727
02:39:24,891 --> 02:39:25,080
oh,

5728
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:26,280
you have a flipper arm.

5729
02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:27,330
What's that like?

5730
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,300
Right?

5731
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:28,400
Yeah,

5732
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:28,561
yeah,

5733
02:39:28,561 --> 02:39:28,850
yeah,

5734
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:29,001
yeah.

5735
02:39:29,001 --> 02:39:31,310
It's just absent actually
asking a question.

5736
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:33,020
Of course you're different.

5737
02:39:33,021 --> 02:39:34,910
People are going to be intrigued.

5738
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:35,811
Like,

5739
02:39:35,811 --> 02:39:36,644
did you remember that?

5740
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:37,880
I don't know if she paid attention to all,

5741
02:39:37,881 --> 02:39:38,571
but the Olympics,

5742
02:39:38,571 --> 02:39:40,640
that guy that was running
who I'd fake legs.

5743
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:41,020
Yeah.

5744
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:42,620
It was really running really fast.

5745
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:44,120
So like these prosthetic,

5746
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:45,373
sorry.

5747
02:39:45,470 --> 02:39:45,650
Yeah,

5748
02:39:45,650 --> 02:39:47,150
but steroids or illegal,

5749
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:48,530
right?

5750
02:39:48,530 --> 02:39:49,490
Bionic man,

5751
02:39:49,491 --> 02:39:50,324
fine.

5752
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:51,740
Well,

5753
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:53,900
we had this guy on the podcast,

5754
02:39:54,050 --> 02:39:54,890
Daniel Wilson,

5755
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:56,300
he's a robotics experts.

5756
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:59,210
He's written some books and
robotics and he was talking once,

5757
02:39:59,240 --> 02:39:59,630
he goes,

5758
02:39:59,630 --> 02:40:04,190
how long before the first guy cuts his
legs off and puts bionic legs on him.

5759
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:06,490
And what he said in my
whole body is swelling.

5760
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:09,321
No,

5761
02:40:09,321 --> 02:40:10,310
that's not what I thought of.

5762
02:40:10,311 --> 02:40:14,130
I thought of the actual guy lying
there with a tube down his throat,

5763
02:40:14,150 --> 02:40:18,240
gene of shutting them off while
they're sawing is fucking legs off.

5764
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:19,560
And I was terrified.

5765
02:40:19,561 --> 02:40:22,830
I literally like cuddled up
with myself like thinking about,

5766
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:27,240
I know someone one day is going to cut
off their perfectly good legs for some

5767
02:40:27,241 --> 02:40:30,870
thug Mike Lang or even if
it's not to win a medal,

5768
02:40:30,871 --> 02:40:32,460
it's just to have bionic legs.

5769
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:34,950
Oh Two oh recognition and what?

5770
02:40:35,230 --> 02:40:37,200
We're going to be his mother
front of its recognition.

5771
02:40:37,201 --> 02:40:38,220
Just the ability.

5772
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:39,010
How about if somebody,

5773
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:39,241
okay,

5774
02:40:39,241 --> 02:40:43,270
listen how fast you need to run
it in a world full of cars living.

5775
02:40:43,350 --> 02:40:43,921
Let me ask you this.

5776
02:40:43,921 --> 02:40:47,640
If they came out with fucking legs
and these are these bionic legs,

5777
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:49,770
allowed you to jump over buildings,

5778
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:53,880
literally allowed you to go incredible
hulk style and just leap like a fucking

5779
02:40:53,881 --> 02:40:54,571
airplane.

5780
02:40:54,571 --> 02:40:55,890
Fly through space.

5781
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,050
Why wouldn't you want to do that?

5782
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:03,090
But you would have to sit there while
they saw your hip off and try to cut your

5783
02:41:03,091 --> 02:41:06,360
bleeding off at the fucking
arteries around your legs.

5784
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:09,870
The femoral artery that if
they cut that with a knife,

5785
02:41:09,871 --> 02:41:11,720
it's sprays out and you bleed out.

5786
02:41:11,730 --> 02:41:15,690
Understand what are the worst ways
to die is getting shot in the thigh.

5787
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:17,610
You get shot in the thigh,

5788
02:41:17,611 --> 02:41:18,750
it blows out your artery,

5789
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,130
your debt.

5790
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:20,610
It's just,

5791
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:21,443
you're just like

5792
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:22,820
got from the Redskins.

5793
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:24,020
The Redskins.

5794
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:25,760
Someone just died getting shot.

5795
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:27,051
Fucking thigh.

5796
02:41:27,051 --> 02:41:27,470
Yeah,

5797
02:41:27,470 --> 02:41:28,460
getting shot in the thigh.

5798
02:41:28,461 --> 02:41:29,241
Car Accident.

5799
02:41:29,241 --> 02:41:32,420
I have to back off like we're saying
sandy hook cause it wasn't overly

5800
02:41:32,421 --> 02:41:33,320
publicized.

5801
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:34,303
Ha.

5802
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:34,781
Yeah.

5803
02:41:34,781 --> 02:41:36,400
If it was overly publicized,

5804
02:41:36,430 --> 02:41:39,070
we apologized and somebody has
something they put on Twitter.

5805
02:41:39,071 --> 02:41:42,010
That was so fucking poignant when
that sandy hook thing was going on.

5806
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:47,220
They said 20 kids on a 20 kids die in
Connecticut and it is a national outrage.

5807
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:52,200
150,000 die from starvation.

5808
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:53,133
No

5809
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:57,870
die from drone strikes
and no one and Brca one.

5810
02:41:57,871 --> 02:41:58,650
I retweeted.

5811
02:41:58,650 --> 02:41:59,480
Yeah,

5812
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:01,050
well then I bet there was a lot of those.

5813
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:05,520
I mean it wasn't one person who made that
obvious conclusion of the PA cracy of

5814
02:42:05,521 --> 02:42:06,510
the way we look at things.

5815
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:09,510
We have a really crazy way of
looking at things that we don't look,

5816
02:42:09,511 --> 02:42:11,970
there's a lot of innocent
children that have died.

5817
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:13,360
Let me ask you this,

5818
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:15,000
as a father now,

5819
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:17,520
which I tried to avoid that thought,

5820
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:23,010
not nearly as much as the idea
that Joey Diaz is a father,

5821
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:28,260
which I actually did the calculations of
today out front waiting for you to show

5822
02:42:28,261 --> 02:42:28,471
up.

5823
02:42:28,471 --> 02:42:29,070
It's like,

5824
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,903
okay,

5825
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:31,830
got Joey Diaz and the death pool,

5826
02:42:31,831 --> 02:42:35,760
but he's about to be a father that's
going to give them more reason to live,

5827
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:36,530
and I'm,

5828
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:37,180
I'm like,

5829
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:37,810
uh,

5830
02:42:37,810 --> 02:42:40,410
I'm like a prognosticator
at the horse track.

5831
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:41,650
Why is it he's a,

5832
02:42:41,651 --> 02:42:42,210
he's,

5833
02:42:42,210 --> 02:42:43,860
he's good on a wet track,

5834
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:47,100
but that's funny.

5835
02:42:47,130 --> 02:42:48,630
But you as a father,

5836
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:49,493
do you do,

5837
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:52,110
did you feel anything about Sandy Hook?

5838
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:53,253
Like

5839
02:42:54,500 --> 02:42:55,670
I felt two things.

5840
02:42:55,730 --> 02:42:59,510
One thing I felt is for the actual
kid who did that emotionally,

5841
02:42:59,530 --> 02:43:00,170
yes.

5842
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,270
I'm talking emotional.

5843
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:01,510
Yeah,

5844
02:43:01,510 --> 02:43:01,970
yeah,

5845
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:02,570
yeah.

5846
02:43:02,570 --> 02:43:03,050
I felt,

5847
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:04,340
I felt for two for,

5848
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:05,960
for in two situations.

5849
02:43:05,961 --> 02:43:06,650
One,

5850
02:43:06,650 --> 02:43:11,000
I felt for the actual child that became
that fucking monster that's gunning

5851
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:12,123
children

5852
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:13,090
and you know,

5853
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:15,790
his mother and whoever else
he killed his teachers.

5854
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:21,180
I felt for that guy because you don't
get to the point where you're showing up

5855
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:24,820
at a school and just shooting children
unless you're in horrific pain.

5856
02:43:25,090 --> 02:43:28,060
I don't know what was going
on with him psychologically,

5857
02:43:28,061 --> 02:43:32,320
and there's a lot of people that they
really shy away from having any empathy

5858
02:43:32,321 --> 02:43:34,270
towards someone who does horrific things,

5859
02:43:34,271 --> 02:43:37,840
but everyone who does horrific things
does horrific things because they're in

5860
02:43:37,841 --> 02:43:38,290
pain.

5861
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:39,250
There's no other way to do it.

5862
02:43:39,251 --> 02:43:39,700
There's no real,

5863
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:41,350
there's no other reason to lash out.

5864
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:47,310
There's no way that guy did that for
the reason I would want to kill a lot of

5865
02:43:47,801 --> 02:43:48,250
people.

5866
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:50,530
Mine is completely out of logical.

5867
02:43:50,550 --> 02:43:50,800
Yeah.

5868
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:52,630
Sheer focused anger.

5869
02:43:52,870 --> 02:43:53,500
He,

5870
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:55,390
you don't shoot a bunch of children.

5871
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:56,950
Real eugenics,

5872
02:43:56,951 --> 02:43:58,000
like the idea of Eugenics,

5873
02:43:58,001 --> 02:44:00,430
like just weeding out all the
people that want to kill people,

5874
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:03,160
weeding out all the people who are
sociopaths weeding all the people who are

5875
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:03,910
psychopaths,

5876
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:07,720
which is what you do in any
other natural like ecosystem,

5877
02:44:07,721 --> 02:44:08,860
whether it's with animals.

5878
02:44:09,010 --> 02:44:13,150
If you have a bunch of animals and you
have some goats running and one goat

5879
02:44:13,270 --> 02:44:14,830
keeps killing the baby goats,

5880
02:44:14,831 --> 02:44:15,101
you like,

5881
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:17,800
you shoot that goat and then you
don't have that problem anymore.

5882
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:18,940
But with human beings,

5883
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:23,500
it's like this ethical consideration of
who this person is and makes no sense.

5884
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,790
It does make no sense.

5885
02:44:24,820 --> 02:44:25,301
It's there.

5886
02:44:25,301 --> 02:44:25,491
There,

5887
02:44:25,491 --> 02:44:30,491
there does need to be some sort of a
pragmatic like a like removing people like

5888
02:44:31,871 --> 02:44:32,500
that from,

5889
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:34,000
from the population but also,

5890
02:44:34,030 --> 02:44:35,230
but here's realize what,

5891
02:44:35,410 --> 02:44:37,510
what takes a baby when you have children.

5892
02:44:37,511 --> 02:44:41,770
One of the things about having children
that changed me is just the realization

5893
02:44:42,210 --> 02:44:44,050
ducks down on made me smoke
a cigarette last night.

5894
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:45,173
Oh that's right.

5895
02:44:45,610 --> 02:44:46,680
I took two hits off that.

5896
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:49,630
He choked like I did on his weed.

5897
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:50,793
So gross.

5898
02:44:52,030 --> 02:44:52,863
But it did give me,

5899
02:44:52,890 --> 02:44:54,100
I was totally head Russian,

5900
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:56,570
but having a child when,

5901
02:44:56,600 --> 02:44:57,880
when when you have a baby,

5902
02:44:57,881 --> 02:45:01,600
one of the things you realize is the
massive responsibility that you have

5903
02:45:01,601 --> 02:45:06,400
because this is a bundle of potential
that this child like could turn out

5904
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:11,490
completely fucked up or completely
beautiful and amazing and I don't mean

5905
02:45:11,591 --> 02:45:12,460
beautiful looking.

5906
02:45:12,460 --> 02:45:13,900
I mean like the way they behave,

5907
02:45:13,901 --> 02:45:15,370
the way they communicate with people,

5908
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:17,270
that people are going to be enriched and,

5909
02:45:17,271 --> 02:45:22,271
and like their life is going to be better
because they come in contact with the

5910
02:45:22,361 --> 02:45:27,361
parents of this sandy hook shooter have
the same expectations of that child.

5911
02:45:27,761 --> 02:45:28,594
Of course they did.

5912
02:45:28,610 --> 02:45:29,440
But that's the,

5913
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:34,440
that's the main Hubris of parents
thinking that because your bright,

5914
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:35,950
you can,

5915
02:45:35,950 --> 02:45:38,020
you have control over your child.

5916
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:40,420
You can have the best intentions.

5917
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:41,470
This is what Todd,

5918
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,600
I did Todd glasses,

5919
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:47,290
podcasts and this whole conversation
spiraled out of control because he was

5920
02:45:47,291 --> 02:45:47,640
miss.

5921
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:48,470
Uh,

5922
02:45:48,470 --> 02:45:52,990
he wasn't understanding what I'm saying
because you're a parent doesn't mean

5923
02:45:52,991 --> 02:45:56,890
that you have any control over
what your child's going to be calm.

5924
02:45:57,460 --> 02:45:58,330
Well that's a,

5925
02:45:58,331 --> 02:45:58,571
it's,

5926
02:45:58,571 --> 02:46:02,110
I don't think it's an either or situation
and I think that's the real problem is

5927
02:46:02,111 --> 02:46:07,111
that just because some people have
this idea that you have this bundle of

5928
02:46:08,321 --> 02:46:09,154
potential,

5929
02:46:09,710 --> 02:46:10,100
this

5930
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:13,850
child that's essentially a blank slate
in front of you and you would like them

5931
02:46:13,851 --> 02:46:14,990
to be a productive citizen.

5932
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:17,000
That doesn't mean that the,

5933
02:46:17,001 --> 02:46:21,830
the people who create a sandy hook
person have those same intentions in mind

5934
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:25,940
because a lot of people have babies and
they just have a fucking baby and they

5935
02:46:25,941 --> 02:46:29,900
just live and they fuck the kid up with
whatever they're fucked up with and they

5936
02:46:29,901 --> 02:46:33,470
don't have a lot of objectivity and they
don't have a lot of self awareness and

5937
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:38,300
they don't have a lot of understanding
of the greater picture of what it is to

5938
02:46:38,301 --> 02:46:39,080
take a,

5939
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:41,660
essentially a bundle of
potential and in neurons,

5940
02:46:41,661 --> 02:46:42,790
which is a baby and,

5941
02:46:42,791 --> 02:46:44,720
and turn it into a full
functioning human being.

5942
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,640
It's a massive responsibility.

5943
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:49,910
And people don't look at it like
the massive responsibility that is.

5944
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:55,240
But what you're saying is you still think
you have control if you do not know.

5945
02:46:55,490 --> 02:46:56,000
I do not.

5946
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,833
I do not.

5947
02:46:57,010 --> 02:46:58,400
Cause I know that first of all,

5948
02:46:58,680 --> 02:46:59,420
as wall bit,

5949
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:01,220
I fucking love from it.

5950
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:02,450
He had a bit about,

5951
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:03,433
uh,

5952
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:04,430
uh,

5953
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:06,500
kids always rebelled
against their parents.

5954
02:47:06,501 --> 02:47:08,450
So I'm going to be the
worst parent in the world.

5955
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:10,040
I'm going to be the biggest douche.

5956
02:47:10,041 --> 02:47:11,780
I'm going to have Phil Collins,

5957
02:47:11,781 --> 02:47:15,590
no jacket required album
framed on the mantle piece.

5958
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:16,071
They did.

5959
02:47:16,071 --> 02:47:17,270
So my kids are cool.

5960
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:18,530
They don't always rebel.

5961
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:19,423
I know people,

5962
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:22,400
it made me think of that bit.

5963
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:25,520
I think human beings rebel against
someone who tells him what to do.

5964
02:47:25,790 --> 02:47:30,590
And the only time kids
tell you what to do where,

5965
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:32,630
or rather a person tells a kid what to do,

5966
02:47:32,631 --> 02:47:34,600
where it makes sense is where the,

5967
02:47:34,601 --> 02:47:36,050
the kid is,

5968
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:36,933
uh,

5969
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:42,040
explained is explained to them in a way
that alleviates all of their concerns,

5970
02:47:43,311 --> 02:47:45,770
that you're trying to control
them all of their concerns,

5971
02:47:45,771 --> 02:47:47,270
that you're insensitive to their,

5972
02:47:47,271 --> 02:47:49,090
their own individual lights.

5973
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,810
You now not if they're like you,

5974
02:47:50,811 --> 02:47:51,770
if they're a bundle,

5975
02:47:51,771 --> 02:47:53,480
I'm saying if they are like you,

5976
02:47:53,481 --> 02:47:54,620
then you can explain this.

5977
02:47:54,621 --> 02:47:57,620
But if they reject that and they
have [inaudible] don't understand,

5978
02:47:57,621 --> 02:47:59,360
they don't reject that from the start.

5979
02:47:59,361 --> 02:48:00,490
Because children have,

5980
02:48:00,590 --> 02:48:04,580
they don't really have a set of morals
and you can explain to them as time goes

5981
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:08,090
on what is wrong or right
about certain situations.

5982
02:48:08,091 --> 02:48:12,080
They will absorb a certain amount of
it and you can continue to provide good

5983
02:48:12,081 --> 02:48:13,460
examples there.

5984
02:48:13,490 --> 02:48:18,490
The real issue and is that raising a
kid is not as simple as people like to

5985
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:20,150
pretend it is.

5986
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:22,010
It's a massive amount of work.

5987
02:48:22,011 --> 02:48:22,910
Fuck you Joe,

5988
02:48:22,911 --> 02:48:23,481
or inside,

5989
02:48:23,481 --> 02:48:25,760
just wanted to throw in some kind of cool.

5990
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:27,380
It's just something,

5991
02:48:27,380 --> 02:48:29,240
something to keep the listener engaged.

5992
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:30,021
Oh,

5993
02:48:30,021 --> 02:48:31,040
this is going somewhere.

5994
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:31,933
Fuck you.

5995
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:34,160
It's just the look.

5996
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:37,070
It's what what a kid is is like,

5997
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:41,540
it's like having a phd thesis and you're,

5998
02:48:41,541 --> 02:48:44,240
you're giving it to any retard and say,

5999
02:48:44,241 --> 02:48:44,421
hey,

6000
02:48:44,421 --> 02:48:44,991
fill this out.

6001
02:48:44,991 --> 02:48:45,560
Figure it out,

6002
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:45,981
and they don't.

6003
02:48:45,981 --> 02:48:46,814
You don't tell him what to do.

6004
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:47,703
Like fill this out.

6005
02:48:47,720 --> 02:48:52,430
Some people are just naturally going
to write some incredible thesis.

6006
02:48:52,710 --> 02:48:55,490
You're going to have some new points that
haven't been considered by science and

6007
02:48:55,491 --> 02:48:55,730
send.

6008
02:48:55,730 --> 02:48:58,580
Some kids are going to shoot up sandy
and some people are going to wipe their

6009
02:48:58,581 --> 02:49:01,910
ass with it and they're going to like
put sand in it and they're going to throw

6010
02:49:01,911 --> 02:49:02,540
it in the ocean.

6011
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:03,460
It's like Eh,

6012
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:08,160
there the amount of room for

6013
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:13,160
error and the amount of possibility and
raising a child is so monumental that

6014
02:49:13,411 --> 02:49:15,450
most people are going to get it wrong.

6015
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:17,190
Just like most people going to get wrong.

6016
02:49:17,191 --> 02:49:19,710
Their own objective
perceptions of themselves,

6017
02:49:19,890 --> 02:49:20,460
how few,

6018
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:23,610
how many people were really see themselves
the way the other people around them.

6019
02:49:23,611 --> 02:49:28,290
So I feel like the only listeners now
are the same people who listened to art

6020
02:49:28,330 --> 02:49:30,750
about your Ra.

6021
02:49:31,430 --> 02:49:35,100
I'm telling right now your work
because people that have kids,

6022
02:49:35,101 --> 02:49:35,381
Doug,

6023
02:49:35,381 --> 02:49:36,214
Stan hope.

6024
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:40,770
I just feel like right now we've
delved into fucking up all night.

6025
02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:41,071
No,

6026
02:49:41,071 --> 02:49:43,710
we have it because what we're talking
about some really important shit when

6027
02:49:43,711 --> 02:49:44,850
we're talking about is what,

6028
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:46,930
that's why people turn to and out.

6029
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:48,150
But it's fascinating.

6030
02:49:48,370 --> 02:49:50,520
What is it that makes a person a psycho?

6031
02:49:50,521 --> 02:49:52,050
What does it makes a person awesome.

6032
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,980
What do you mean?

6033
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:53,460
Look,

6034
02:49:53,460 --> 02:49:56,610
you and I both had very
different childhoods,

6035
02:49:56,611 --> 02:50:00,690
but we essentially found our own
path instead of being guided.

6036
02:50:00,810 --> 02:50:02,490
That's what I was going to say is,

6037
02:50:02,670 --> 02:50:03,190
uh,

6038
02:50:03,190 --> 02:50:03,601
I,

6039
02:50:03,601 --> 02:50:08,460
I'm basing a lot of this on intervention
is one of our favorite shows and

6040
02:50:08,461 --> 02:50:12,750
hoarders does the same thing to an extent
where they start out with the problem

6041
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:17,960
and then they coast into a montage of
their childhood and they try to at least,

6042
02:50:18,961 --> 02:50:21,900
if not pinpoint a allude to,

6043
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:27,050
well then their parents get divorced and
she missed her father or then she was

6044
02:50:27,351 --> 02:50:29,760
tired of buying uncle became comforting.

6045
02:50:29,761 --> 02:50:30,091
Fuck,

6046
02:50:30,091 --> 02:50:34,950
but they try to find something in the
childhood that's responsible with no

6047
02:50:34,951 --> 02:50:39,951
science whatsoever that is responsible
for why now they're fucking shitting in a

6048
02:50:39,991 --> 02:50:41,630
dumpster and a fucking crime.

6049
02:50:41,631 --> 02:50:42,660
When you say science,

6050
02:50:42,661 --> 02:50:46,380
that's really important
because it's purely anecdotal
evidence you would have to

6051
02:50:46,381 --> 02:50:47,430
take to people,

6052
02:50:47,550 --> 02:50:49,370
make them live fucking a strong,

6053
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:50,730
it is.

6054
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:51,520
It absolutely is.

6055
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:52,350
That's a very good point.

6056
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:55,920
The way you just said that I had to be
to really would love to fucking meet

6057
02:50:55,921 --> 02:50:57,180
doctor drew a face to face.

6058
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:00,780
I would love to set that up because that
was one of my favorite bits about that

6059
02:51:00,781 --> 02:51:00,960
bit,

6060
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:01,530
that uh,

6061
02:51:01,530 --> 02:51:02,970
turning the gun on himself as well.

6062
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,620
It's like you fucking nailed it.

6063
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:06,030
Like what is your cure?

6064
02:51:06,031 --> 02:51:07,080
And it's God,

6065
02:51:07,570 --> 02:51:08,900
it's a higher power mean.

6066
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:09,790
That's all they saw.

6067
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:14,840
Biggest breach of separation of church
and state is where people get a Dui and

6068
02:51:15,061 --> 02:51:19,320
they're forced to go to Aa for two or
six weeks where they have to pretend to

6069
02:51:19,321 --> 02:51:20,280
believe in God.

6070
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:21,870
You mother fuckers,

6071
02:51:23,790 --> 02:51:27,260
it's absolutely again in raging,

6072
02:51:27,261 --> 02:51:29,130
yes and not on the language.

6073
02:51:29,131 --> 02:51:31,020
Fuck is a bad word level,

6074
02:51:31,021 --> 02:51:31,860
but still,

6075
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:34,930
but here's the thing is they
always try to blame the Po.

6076
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:35,600
I my,

6077
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:36,630
my parents were great.

6078
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:37,860
I'm a fuck up.

6079
02:51:38,490 --> 02:51:38,941
Hold up.

6080
02:51:38,941 --> 02:51:39,630
Stop,

6081
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:40,440
stop it.

6082
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:41,190
Stop it.

6083
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:42,070
You're not a fuck up.

6084
02:51:42,071 --> 02:51:42,904
But

6085
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:46,950
in the eyes of all of
those types of shows,

6086
02:51:47,130 --> 02:51:48,870
I would be seen as some,

6087
02:51:48,871 --> 02:51:49,141
no,

6088
02:51:49,141 --> 02:51:49,291
no,

6089
02:51:49,291 --> 02:51:49,461
no,

6090
02:51:49,461 --> 02:51:49,621
no,

6091
02:51:49,621 --> 02:51:49,831
no.

6092
02:51:49,831 --> 02:51:50,281
You won't.

6093
02:51:50,281 --> 02:51:52,200
You're going to die if
they're misinformed.

6094
02:51:52,201 --> 02:51:53,034
You know what that's like.

6095
02:51:53,310 --> 02:51:58,050
The eyes of that show is like if someone
gets brought in and the person happens

6096
02:51:58,051 --> 02:52:01,220
to be a person who has asthma and you,

6097
02:52:01,221 --> 02:52:02,760
you don't have a doctor present to say,

6098
02:52:02,761 --> 02:52:03,960
well what causes asthma?

6099
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:05,003
Okay.

6100
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:07,390
If you were on a show
and they were saying,

6101
02:52:07,391 --> 02:52:08,410
well there's something
wrong with his Doug,

6102
02:52:08,411 --> 02:52:08,861
Stan Hope,

6103
02:52:08,861 --> 02:52:09,730
Doug Sahm have likes to drink,

6104
02:52:09,731 --> 02:52:10,670
he drinks almost every day.

6105
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:12,490
I would have to step
in because I was like,

6106
02:52:12,491 --> 02:52:13,740
well you understand comics.

6107
02:52:13,741 --> 02:52:13,841
He,

6108
02:52:13,841 --> 02:52:14,990
I'm an expert on comments.

6109
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:17,380
This is a comic and this is how it works.

6110
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:20,470
And you don't get comics like that unless
you get all the other shit as well.

6111
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:20,860
Okay.

6112
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:21,550
Are we cool?

6113
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:21,881
All right,

6114
02:52:21,881 --> 02:52:22,270
good.

6115
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:27,270
Now go back to judging fucking mailroom
workers and fucking insurance salesmen

6116
02:52:27,550 --> 02:52:28,750
because when it comes to comics,

6117
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:29,950
that's where I'm an expert.

6118
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:31,300
So you're not a fuck up.

6119
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:35,080
You're not a fuck up cause you put out
a good solid hour every year and a half

6120
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,060
and there's only one
way to fucking do that.

6121
02:52:37,061 --> 02:52:37,690
Okay?

6122
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:39,520
It's to do a Doug Stan hope style.

6123
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:42,010
The way you're doing it is the
exact correct way to do it.

6124
02:52:42,130 --> 02:52:44,230
And if you took those
assholes and you said,

6125
02:52:44,231 --> 02:52:44,620
hey,

6126
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:44,981
listen,

6127
02:52:44,981 --> 02:52:45,740
I want to take,

6128
02:52:45,740 --> 02:52:50,500
we take time away from working
at La Fitness and being that the,

6129
02:52:50,501 --> 02:52:53,110
the guy who recruits new
people to be personal trainers.

6130
02:52:53,230 --> 02:52:54,160
And what I want you to do,

6131
02:52:54,220 --> 02:52:55,090
I just want to push you to get her.

6132
02:52:55,091 --> 02:52:58,570
I want you to put together an hour
of solid subversive standup material.

6133
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:03,720
We really analyze to society's woes and
a break it down a in a way that's not

6134
02:53:03,821 --> 02:53:04,601
just going to be pulling it,

6135
02:53:04,601 --> 02:53:07,150
but it's also going to elicit a reaction
out of people is going to make them

6136
02:53:07,151 --> 02:53:07,660
laugh,

6137
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:08,350
belly laugh.

6138
02:53:08,350 --> 02:53:11,320
How will I want you to take points
to the point where you think it's

6139
02:53:11,321 --> 02:53:16,321
uncomfortable and socially unacceptable
and go about a hundred yards past that

6140
02:53:16,830 --> 02:53:19,210
and do some horrible place
where you long for the,

6141
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:22,480
the moment where you thought that
he was out of line in the beginning,

6142
02:53:22,481 --> 02:53:23,830
which was four minutes ago,

6143
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:25,960
that guy can't do that.

6144
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:28,690
So that guy would be a fuck
up if he tried to do your job.

6145
02:53:29,150 --> 02:53:29,950
Oh,

6146
02:53:29,950 --> 02:53:30,230
you,

6147
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:30,520
you,

6148
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:30,820
you,

6149
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:31,120
uh,

6150
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:34,630
you turn the forklift in the
wrong direction and hit some cans.

6151
02:53:34,970 --> 02:53:36,400
You need to be on intervention.

6152
02:53:37,870 --> 02:53:38,650
Yeah,

6153
02:53:38,650 --> 02:53:40,900
we got you miss three tags,

6154
02:53:40,901 --> 02:53:42,130
like standing up in that hour.

6155
02:53:42,131 --> 02:53:44,950
We got seven minutes ago before
recording turns into a pumpkin.

6156
02:53:44,951 --> 02:53:45,784
We hit the four hour,

6157
02:53:45,790 --> 02:53:46,690
the three hour mark.

6158
02:53:46,890 --> 02:53:47,150
Right.

6159
02:53:47,150 --> 02:53:47,651
You have the shit,

6160
02:53:47,651 --> 02:53:47,950
man.

6161
02:53:47,950 --> 02:53:48,701
I wish you lived here,

6162
02:53:48,701 --> 02:53:50,680
but I don't because every
time you come back here,

6163
02:53:50,681 --> 02:53:51,290
it's like Christmas.

6164
02:53:51,290 --> 02:53:51,970
Exactly.

6165
02:53:51,970 --> 02:53:53,500
When someone shows up in Bisbee,

6166
02:53:53,501 --> 02:53:54,334
I hugged them.

6167
02:53:54,570 --> 02:53:55,750
I listen to this show that we did.

6168
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:56,410
Like I said,

6169
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:56,771
Bingo.

6170
02:53:56,771 --> 02:53:57,670
Said the other day,

6171
02:53:57,710 --> 02:53:58,040
I,

6172
02:53:58,040 --> 02:53:59,020
I'm ready to get out of it.

6173
02:53:59,050 --> 02:54:01,390
We were off work for two
weeks and she's like,

6174
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:02,560
I'm ready to get out of town.

6175
02:54:02,561 --> 02:54:03,430
Let's go on the road.

6176
02:54:03,670 --> 02:54:04,061
I go,

6177
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:08,290
we're going to be on the road for fucking
one night for the Rogan thing of we're

6178
02:54:08,291 --> 02:54:09,124
going to be,

6179
02:54:09,130 --> 02:54:11,680
I can't wait to get back home right now.

6180
02:54:11,681 --> 02:54:12,514
You can't wait already.

6181
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:14,530
I'm always fucking greener pastures,

6182
02:54:14,531 --> 02:54:14,920
man.

6183
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:17,500
Everything I'm not in is better with that.

6184
02:54:17,501 --> 02:54:18,580
So it makes you a comic man.

6185
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:19,693
People don't understand.

6186
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:20,620
They don't understand that.

6187
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:23,170
We all have our own place in
this crazy spectrum of life.

6188
02:54:23,210 --> 02:54:23,690
Yeah.

6189
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:23,951
Your,

6190
02:54:23,951 --> 02:54:24,191
your,

6191
02:54:24,191 --> 02:54:24,430
your,

6192
02:54:24,430 --> 02:54:25,263
your place.

6193
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:28,030
Let me plug Superbowl in.

6194
02:54:28,031 --> 02:54:31,360
Bisbee you have to fucking
get your own place.

6195
02:54:31,361 --> 02:54:32,980
I already have fucking,

6196
02:54:32,981 --> 02:54:34,480
the houses are full,

6197
02:54:34,810 --> 02:54:37,540
but you just can't stay
at the shady Dell will.

6198
02:54:37,541 --> 02:54:38,410
You're gonna first of all,

6199
02:54:38,411 --> 02:54:41,410
let's just let people come to
your house and watch the game.

6200
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:41,890
Yes.

6201
02:54:41,890 --> 02:54:42,520
Okay.

6202
02:54:42,520 --> 02:54:42,940
Listen,

6203
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:44,020
we're putting this on the Internet.

6204
02:54:44,021 --> 02:54:49,021
1 million people will listen
to this coming so far away.

6205
02:54:51,310 --> 02:54:53,260
I can't get you to come to my house.

6206
02:54:53,750 --> 02:54:55,040
I said crazy per se.

6207
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:55,660
Can't.

6208
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:56,530
That's incorrect.

6209
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:57,130
The correct.

6210
02:54:57,130 --> 02:54:59,140
The correct is haven't gotten me.

6211
02:54:59,200 --> 02:54:59,740
I will.

6212
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:01,840
The point is I live so far away.

6213
02:55:01,841 --> 02:55:04,580
Crazy people have to be really fucking

6214
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:05,510
crazy.

6215
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:08,210
The ones you've got to worry about
and there comes a point is no,

6216
02:55:08,211 --> 02:55:08,901
we have a show.

6217
02:55:08,901 --> 02:55:10,580

6223
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:24,651
Oh,

6224
02:55:24,651 --> 02:55:25,250
beautiful.

6225
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:26,960
How many followers does he have?

6226
02:55:26,961 --> 02:55:27,860
Let's check right now.

6227
02:55:27,861 --> 02:55:29,990
So when you said that I
was just about the check.

6228
02:55:29,991 --> 02:55:31,370
Hold on one second.

6229
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:32,880
Go with all of the Biz.

6233
02:55:40,401 --> 02:55:42,220
I just followed them at junior stop.

6234
02:55:42,221 --> 02:55:42,470
Go.

6235
02:55:42,470 --> 02:55:42,770
Okay,

6236
02:55:42,770 --> 02:55:43,071
hold on.

6237
02:55:43,071 --> 02:55:44,550
So that's Friday night.

6238
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:46,610
The show is that the Bisbee Royale,

6239
