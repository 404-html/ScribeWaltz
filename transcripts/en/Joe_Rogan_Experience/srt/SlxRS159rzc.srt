1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,111
Try My day,

2
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:03,810
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,500
Well they a Khabib and Tony are
going to fight again though,

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:07,801
right?

5
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,590
Aren't they totally wants
to do to the culture.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,850
But here's the thing that makes a bead
might not be able to make that weight,

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,070
that and,

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,390
and you know,

9
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,530
since Kelvin Ms,

10
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,040
wait a couple of times and
Dana forced him to find it.

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,430
One 85 and I mean,

12
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,600
it makes sense that Dana goes,

13
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:21,811
dude,

14
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,880
you got to do one 70
at least once or twice,

15
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,140
but miss,

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
we'll go up in weight to fight him.

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,841
Well,

18
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:28,950
he only missed weight once.

19
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,790
Twice,

20
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,161
twice,

21
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:30,521
twice,

22
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,320
twice.

23
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,080
Tonia huge against,

24
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,740
no,

25
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,281
he's tall,

26
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,114
but he's not,

27
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,160
how tall is he?

28
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,221
He's like,

29
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,960
Tony is like five ten five 11 Tony's
bill perfect for the division.

30
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,980
He's torn.

31
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,001
He's got,

32
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,200
he's got a lot of muscle.

33
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,220
Even though he's long.

34
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,510
He's very strong.

35
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,620
He's excellent in the clinch.

36
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,250
I was looking forward
to that fight so much.

37
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,133
My heart,

38
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,990
how big it could be.

39
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,280
It could be got a huge frame.

40
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,970
It's a tank.

41
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,181
No,

42
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,530
he doesn't have a nutritionist.

43
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,190
He doesn't talk.

44
00:00:59,190 --> 00:00:59,551
He's not,

45
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,670
you're not being professionals.

46
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,690
He's thick.

47
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,640
Could you hear what Tony Tony to get
done when they're like doing media?

48
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,420
Yeah.

49
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,690
And it could be with saying something
like why do you get your sunglasses on?

50
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,840
It's like 27 months.

51
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah and he's like good luck or their
weight cut breathing cause your cardio's

52
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,960
sucks cause your go songs
that's said Tony said to him,

53
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,010
do they have to make it at 55 because
what do you do with that fucking bet?

54
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,420
That interim title

55
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,630
fight Floyd.

56
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,320
What the,

57
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,040
we can't just fucking happened the five
but don't you think that that's the

58
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,690
fight that has to be
made in that division,

59
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:33,900
right.

60
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,690
That's [inaudible] tone.

61
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,100
If it's,

62
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,740
but if he can't make one 55 can,

63
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,790
he needs to get real and get a fucking
digression and we know what happened to

64
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,000
him.

65
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,860
We don't eat Tiramisu the week of,

66
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:48,630
I know that he did a corn on an bed and
Tony even tweet out like for sure when

67
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,070
fucking eat Tiramisu,

68
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,430
he really ate Tiramisu.

69
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,860
That it was on the embedded video.

70
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,623
Whoa.

71
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,650
That's how he smelled it.

72
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,250
He was like,

73
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,270
have fun making weight.

74
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,460
Why are you helping him toughen?

75
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,220
You have to make that fight and could be,

76
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,761
you can do it.

77
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,120
He's just,

78
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,810
he's made it before killing himself.

79
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,860
But we don't know what happened when
he had to go to the fucking hospital.

80
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,861
They said he was in massive pain
like day Rockhold you're right.

81
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,760
But Luke Rockhold said something.

82
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,650
There was some quote that I had read.

83
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,790
God Damn it.

84
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,040
What did,

85
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,500
see what,

86
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,130
what they said about what,

87
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,551
what did,

88
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,384
uh,

89
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,750
uh,

90
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,550
bebes corner list as the official
issue that was happening to him.

91
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,140
He was six pounds overweight,

92
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:28,974
right?

93
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,910
Yes.

94
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,230
When he went to the hospitals.

95
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:31,600
And that's,

96
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,610
that's huge.

97
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,810
That's so heavy.

98
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,320
You're so heavy when your
body's your body shutting down,

99
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,140
like you're six pounds away
and your body's shutting down.

100
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,880
You know that come in
the week of the fight.

101
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,421
Yeah.

102
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,220
But obviously fucked up with his,

103
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:44,550
uh,

104
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,890
his discipline if he's eating Tiramisu.

105
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,791
If that's true,

106
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,900
that's even more disappointing.

107
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,950
Maybe you just had a bite,

108
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,920
but either way you don't have a,

109
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,940
and I'm not saying it's the answer.

110
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,610
You don't have a mic dolce or one of
these guys who are helping you with your

111
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:56,911
diet,

112
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,744
right?

113
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,811
Tony's down.

114
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,160
They go up and wait to find them.

115
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,860
You can't do the sense sense for Tony.

116
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,930
It makes sense for Tony
mean that wants a fight,

117
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,321
this guy.

118
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,460
But for the division,

119
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,091
it's so weird.

120
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,301
It's like,

121
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:07,421
well,

122
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,710
what is it sucks the division.

123
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,460
What is this guys?

124
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,150
He puts the entire fights bigger
than what the division looks like.

125
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,660
That fight,

126
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,680
that fight needs to happen.

127
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,543
I agree.

128
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,001
I agree.

129
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,834
I agree with that.

130
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,180
I have is all this other shit's going on.

131
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,740
Mayweather and Garner all this other
shit and that's the GSP Bisbing it goes

132
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,070
here it goes medical,

133
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
it says a weight.

134
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,410
La,

135
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,930
um,

136
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,561
weight management,

137
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,161
medical issues.

138
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,720
He was treated and it's been discharged.

139
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
That doesn't say what the issue is.

140
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,260
This the official us.

141
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,770
See,

142
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,790
see if you could find out.

143
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,690
I feel like I read an article that
was interviewing Luke Rockhold.

144
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,550
Rockhold was talking about what happened
to [inaudible] Dot Gov did you see Dana

145
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:42,731
though?

146
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,061
He goes,

147
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,391
if you,

148
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,080
if you would to,

149
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,610
we maybe could have safe drinking.

150
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,570
He gave him a beer.

151
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,433
This isn't beer.

152
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,230
What is it?

153
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,340
It's a real bear

154
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,600
fruit.

155
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,890
Someone gave the Gremlin water after men.

156
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,500
No,

157
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,330
but Dana was saying was panic.

158
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,593
He goes,

159
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,913
oh,

160
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm having one.

161
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,053
That's one

162
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,000
damn it.

163
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,570
I knew that the cow.

164
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,783
I got a coffee.

165
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,171
You can't leave.

166
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,520
We guy drinking by himself.

167
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,160
That was the moment the
wheels fell off the podcast.

168
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:15,461
Okay,

169
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:15,881
here it is.

170
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,714
This is what I read.

171
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,420
Habib wasn't getting
any blood to his liver.

172
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,640
Oh,

173
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
this is what Luke Rockhold says.

174
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,010
Look,

175
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,580
that is fucking real bad.

176
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,260
So scroll down and let's,

177
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,870
let's see what Luke Rockhold says.

178
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,610
The weight cut wasn't going very well.

179
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,330
Khabib was complaining about a pain in
his side and we had to cut short the

180
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,320
weight cut and sure enough,

181
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,390
it gets worse over night and
had to go to the hospital.

182
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,960
Unfortunately this is the fight
was really fucking four Bababa.

183
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,050
From what I understand,

184
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,600
he wasn't getting any blood to his
liver and something went wrong with his

185
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,170
weight cut.

186
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,850
It's very similar to his last fight.

187
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,070
What I understand and
just something went wrong.

188
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,390
You never know what these weight cuts,

189
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:49,811
I guess.

190
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,280
But I think he's ready to
go and we can rebook this.

191
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,200
That what is,

192
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,053
he was,

193
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:56,860
no,

194
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,940
he's the training partner.

195
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,030
He's a AK cause to a hundred
pounds heavier training partner.

196
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,043
Yeah.

197
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,110
Well from the same gym.

198
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,560
Yes.

199
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,190
I mean it obviously
ain't a hundred pounds.

200
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,790
He's a big deal to walk around.

201
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,660
That could be,

202
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,440
yeah.

203
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,273
Shit.

204
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,383
I Dunno.

205
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,410
I don't wanna miss speak.

206
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,870
I'd assume high seventies yeah.

207
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,621
It looks like it,

208
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:17,860
right?

209
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,070
Yeah.

210
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,000
And he ain't fat.

211
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,570
No.

212
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,830
They got to make that fight,

213
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,510
man.

214
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,343
That's the fight.

215
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,610
I say that's the Madison ever
been when a fight fell through,

216
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,440
like when John and a jail thing.

217
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,360
I really wasn't that math.

218
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,420
There's been other fights.

219
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,780
Uh,

220
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,060
John D C I wasn't that upset.

221
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,661
This one.

222
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,530
I was pissed,

223
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:32,920
man.

224
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,060
I was really upset.

225
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,350
Tony was on fire,

226
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,363
his camp,

227
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,630
everything was perfect.

228
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,420
It was on such a good fighter.

229
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:49,740
Okay.
