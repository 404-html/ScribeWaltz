1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,340
It's been three years since he texts 
back.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,480
We are live right now and our brother 
Joey,

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,314
Coco Diaz is in Chicago tonight.
If you are lucky to get tickets to his 

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,560
show.
Adzenys in Rosemont,

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,030
Illinois.
Not Technically Chicago.

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,890
Right.
How far away is 20 minutes.

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,950
Twenty minutes just outside.
That's where Joe.

8
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:19,840
He is.
And he's a,

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,970
he's filming tonight for CSO.
CSO is some.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,933
Yeah,
exactly.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,893
Some new thing that uh,
Doug Stan hope has a special on seeso 

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,263
now.
Joey has a special on Seeso and 

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,000
apparently it's like NBC is doing 
something.

14
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,370
Some something that NBC is doing.
Well.

15
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,220
Netflix is giving apparently $40 million
to Chris rock.

16
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,054
So what did you hear that?
But $40 million dollars for two 

17
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,220
specials.
Jesus.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,880
That's fucking insane.
Jesus.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,650
That's $20.
Million special.

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,923
Um,
that's a record I should say they're 

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,030
going to do a bidding war with hbo 
apparently for like a wow.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,060
It makes me.
I went up to $30 million and then flicks

23
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:58,531
that.
Fuck you.

24
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:00,180
Here's 40.
Holy Shit.

25
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,920
Netflix is balling.
Yeah.

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,010
But now I feel jipped Netflix is out of 
control right now.

27
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,100
But.
So as HBO,

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,320
I've been watching westworld.
You Watch westworld on Hbo?

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,360
Yeah,
it is good.

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,333
I've heard about it,
but I thought it was like on CBS or 

31
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,460
something.
Yeah,

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,530
it's good.
Yeah.

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,010
That's where they go into that weird,
uh,

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,420
like a fake world and yes.
Yeah.

35
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,303
It's like,
it's based on that 1973 movie with a 

36
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,610
Yule Brenner.
Westworld.

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,850
Good old you'll.
Yeah.

38
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,830
Which was basically the same kind of 
movie.

39
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,813
It was basically the same as the show.
How many times I can say basically in 

40
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,150
the first five minutes.
Uh,

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,130
but what it was is,
uh,

42
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,761
it's,
you know,

43
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:42,000
so people can go and have like a fantasy
and live in the wild west,

44
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,560
but obviously the robots don't play and 
they start malfunctioning.

45
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,550
And that's where I'm in episode two.
It should start to kind of like a cowboy

46
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,530
logan's run logan's run.
Why don't even remember that?

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,710
Really?
Don't remember Logan's run,

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,810
barely.
Remember.

49
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm trying to remember when I was a kid,
what did was logan's run?

50
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,480
Was it a series or it was a series.
I think it was a moving then it became a

51
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,314
series.

52
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,453
Yeah,
there it is.

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
Oh Wow.
I remember the poster.

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,020
Welcome to the 23rd century.
Isn't that weird?

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,753
That is weird.
It's so weird what they thought we were 

56
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,900
going to be living life like.
Do you remember space?

57
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,490
Nineteen 99.
I remember.

58
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,324
Everything was.
I remember when I was break dancing in 

59
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,144
1994.
There was a move called the 1990 where 

60
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,790
you jumped on.
You remember that movie?

61
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,624
You jumped on one hand,
you flipped up upside down on one hand 

62
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,270
and spun the move that I'm Cuba gooding 
Jr.

63
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,820
Did in go back.
Go back to those pictures.

64
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,560
Go back to the first one you went to.
Look at that.

65
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,663
They got one thing right?
People are going to be wearing pre 

66
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,610
rippeD pants like assholes and girls are
going to be showing their vaginas.

67
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,560
Yeah.
They got both of those things right.

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,713
And that hairstyles back.
So both harris tazobactam chicks are 

69
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,390
wearinG hairstyles like that too.

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,890
So what did the,
what was the move the 1900,

71
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,750
1990 and it was good stuff.
Is that real cost play,

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,980
but I could keep causing girl.
Yeah,

73
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,960
whatever you're doing for.
See,

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm so happy that girls still dress like
that.

75
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,310
All this crazy talk of women,
you know,

76
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,144
like not,
not dressing sexy or a luring like that 

77
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,370
is just disturbing to me.
Russell peters.

78
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,690
I don't,
I don't want that to change.

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,620
I mean,
you know,

80
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,150
it depends on when and where they're 
doing it.

81
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,130
Right?
No.

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,890
Do it whenever you want.
Given the green light office buildings,

83
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,850
everything.
The office buildinGs will be great fun.

84
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,093
I remember going into office buildings 
is getting a hard on looking at the 

85
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,530
secretaries and the yields full heart 
on.

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,280
It was in my early twenties,
late teens.

87
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,770
You know,
you got a madman.

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
He was a lunatic with a different kind 
of guy.

89
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,640
Knocking shit over with my car.
He didn't grab any pussy though.

90
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,020
Did you?
I was not a pussy grabber.

91
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,310
I'm not either.
I have no.

92
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:48,130
I don't even know how you'd grab a pussy
without actually fingering it.

93
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,620
Yeah.
Like how do you grab it on the outside?

94
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,290
that's the benefit of having those 
little hands,

95
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,363
little hands.
Congrats.

96
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,340
you could just fully grab a lunch,
like one of those,

97
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
uh,
like folder holder things that used to 

98
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,690
paperclips.
Oh,

99
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,460
I know those ones.
Clamps,

100
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,540
clamp plants,
steel donald,

101
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,740
clamp running for president.

102
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,260
CLamp and pinch.
There's a fucking hilarious,

103
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,690
a meme that I saw that somebody put 
online.

104
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,763
It's so funny.
It shows different presidential quotes 

105
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,394
throughout history.
Like the only thing we have to fear is 

106
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,704
fear itself.
Franklin delano roosevelt ask not what 

107
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,644
your country can do for you,
but ask what you can do for your 

108
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,050
country.
China of counTry.

109
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
John f kennedy grabbed them by the 
pussy.

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,320
Donald trump.
This is where we are.

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,170
This is really where we are.
We,

112
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,360
we turned reality into reality.
Young.

113
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,780
Do you think that that's what started 
it,

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,800
all that like reality tv,
like from survivor on exposing the world

115
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:54,760
to instead of,
instead of two people that we've created

116
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,550
like magnum pi or,
you know,

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,990
fill in the blank,
you know,

118
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,450
they gave us,
they gave us things that we used to have

119
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,760
things to strive to want to be.
Yes.

120
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,860
Um,
and then they took it down to the lowest

121
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,700
common denominator made.

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,500
It made us go,
oh,

123
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,530
thank god they took away all that.
Now we can just be normal again.

124
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,030
We can,
we can be hopeless.

125
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,770
Yeah.
They brought it down a snuggie.

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,270
Yeah.
You know,

127
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:20,230
they went from,
it went from people that you could never

128
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,810
guys like macgyver.
Yeah.

129
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,770
Gets out of every situation.
But that's confusing too though,

130
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
right?
Because People start thinking that they 

131
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:32,680
can be macgyver or that they can get 
your brain moving.

132
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,010
It kind of gives a little jog.
It makes you think sideways,

133
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,844
you know,
and it gives you the opportunity to 

134
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,124
think laterally.
but when you've got a dummy just saying 

135
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,340
things that you want to hear,
you go,

136
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,540
oh,
okay.

137
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,403
I can turn it off now guys.
That's the one thing that confuses me 

138
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:47,524
the most about Donald Trump.
I didn't know there were that many 

139
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,760
assholes out there.
Like I kind of knew,

140
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,810
but I didn't know they were going to 
organize it.

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,420
It was,
it's weird to me that,

142
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,254
you know,
when you meet people that you're 

143
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,544
getting,
you thought were levelheaded thinking 

144
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,770
people.
Is that eric?

145
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,060
Be like eric b and rakim.
Nice.

146
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,543
Everybody.
Everybody's actually living at my house 

147
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,840
in vegas right now.
Shut the fuck up.

148
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,450
Really?
Yeah.

149
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,900
Damn dude.
You know I keep it hip hop son.

150
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,020
Do you do?
Yeah,

151
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,050
you do.
What about rakim?

152
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Rakim is not living in the house.
No,

153
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,740
no,
they're,

154
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,573
they're a secret.
I think they may be getting back 

155
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,480
together secretly.
He just keeps saying I don't,

156
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,020
I can't say that they are.
So there may be.

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,801
I mean,
will.

158
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,220
You're starting rumors.
That's the way to go to god.

159
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,143
That's the way to go.
To get that one started trying to get 

160
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,380
everybody paid.
Oh,

161
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,223
I love those guys.
We were just talking about them 

162
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:34,990
yesterday.
Where you.

163
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

164
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,830
We were talking about yesterday.

165
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,510
Was that jesse?
Jesse,

166
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,650
ventura,
and then red band.

167
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,080
But we were talking about,
uh,

168
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,910
eric b and rakim.
We're talking about epmd.

169
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,773
Yup.
I'm friends with dj scratch from apmt 

170
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,160
from all sides of the dj of the group.
Have you noticed that?

171
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,210
Yeah,
well you were a dj.

172
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah,
that makes sense.

173
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,420
Yeah.
So like us being friends with comedians.

174
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,250
Yeah.
we happen to know one or two of them.

175
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,113
Yeah.
isn't it funny thing about being a 

176
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,814
comic?
Like you run into another comic 

177
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,130
somewhere and you're like,
aw,

178
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:01,964
you come here,
you were around regular people kit over 

179
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,610
here.
We're all left brain thinkers.

180
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,350
We need to be together.
is that what it is?

181
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,450
Yeah,
that's the left brain.

182
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah,
that's what I've heard.

183
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,980
We're not real.
I don't know.

184
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,950
I'll give You a kick.
Somebody left side of the head is a fuck

185
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,784
up.
Their jokes.

186
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,550
I don'T know what somebody else.
Somebody sent me something that says,

187
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,560
uh,
uh,

188
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,720
uh,
uh,

189
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,550
it's in my,
it's on my whatever,

190
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:29,630
but it was about some sort of head 
trauma can make your brain,

191
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,570
uh,
relate everything to a joke after.

192
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,450
Well,
there's a book that sam kinison,

193
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,890
his brother wrote,
brother sam,

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,290
and uh,
it's all about how sam.

195
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,370
Well,
it's all about sam,

196
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,070
but it's all.
A big part of it is how sam changed when

197
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,880
you got hit by a car.
He was a little kid and he got nailed by

198
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:51,881
a car and really fucked up and from that
point on he became this maniac,

199
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,690
this wild,
crazy,

200
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,524
reckless motherfucker.
Like before that he was like a normal 

201
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:57,104
kid and bang one hard shot to the head 
and all of a sudden he's like all the 

202
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,493
crazy ranting and the sermons he used to
give when I guess when you get close to 

203
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,140
death,
you look at it one of two ways,

204
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:09,510
right?

205
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,430
Yeah.
ThAt's it.

206
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,220
I think it's traumatic brain injury.
That's what I'm saying.

207
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,180
But like,
again,

208
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,170
your brain goes,
oh,

209
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,700
fuck,
well we didn't suffer through that.

210
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,140
Now let's just enjoy the rest of this.
That would be nice if that was,

211
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,730
if that made sense,
if there was a fact.

212
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,130
I don't know,
but I like making up my own.

213
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,490
I think what it is,
wikipedia damage,

214
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,520
I think damage to the brain,
like actual physical damage effects,

215
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:35,900
impulse control,
and it has something to do with that and

216
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
getting angry quicker.
There's,

217
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,123
there's a bunch of factors that come 
into play that you see with football 

218
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,284
players to.
Yup.

219
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,430
Um,
that,

220
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,190
uh,
you're,

221
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,700
you're hilarious after all those times 
now,

222
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,870
right?
Maybe they are.

223
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,710
Maybe we need to find one right before 
they become too stupid to talk.

224
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,120
YeS.
Ask him like,

225
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,020
what?
What do you find?

226
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,500
I mean they weren't that bright to begin
with.

227
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,393
So How dare you say that they can be 
bright if they were big and giant and 

228
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,070
they wanted to make money is The way to 
go.

229
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:02,904
Right.
What else could it do to be a strong 

230
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,680
man?
I don't know.

231
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,010
I mean you could fight strong.
Me.

232
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,160
You can fight if you that big because 
like at 265 pounds,

233
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:14,070
that's the weight limit for mma.
There's a limit on.

234
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,080
This is so weird.
So weird.

235
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,140
Because remember emanuel yarbrough,
was he 600 pounds?

236
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,220
Yeah.
We'll look what happened to him.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
Keith hackney,
bitch slapped coma.

238
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,710
It's true.
Did he break his wrist on that bitch?

239
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
Slap upside.
Weird.

240
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah.
Well once he got them down,

241
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,874
he was hammer fist and he was like one 
of the first guys to do the hammerfest 

242
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,050
in a fight.
I remember seeing that going,

243
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,690
that's a terrible punch.
It's effective.

244
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,460
You know what's cool about a hammer 
fist,

245
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,294
it's like you can do this to the table 
like this oak table and doesn't hurt 

246
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,850
your hand at all,
but if you did that with your knuckles,

247
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,850
you'd be like,
ah,

248
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,703
yeah,
but it's weird that we punched with our 

249
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,330
knuckles.
Well,

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,950
if know we just associate this soft 
padded part is not going to hurt you.

251
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,810
Exactly.
It fucking hurts a lot.

252
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,210
Like hammer fists are very effective.

253
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,070
Have you hammer fisted anybody?
No.

254
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,890
No.
It never hammer fist anybody.

255
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,260
Not that I can remember.
We went into fisting real quick.

256
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,430
When you spinning back fist somebody,
there's two ways to do it.

257
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:14,460
You could do it with the actual back of 
the hand that hurts.

258
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,380
Like if you hit someone's very tender 
there.

259
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,243
Yeah.
If you hit someone's chin with the very 

260
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,774
back of your hand,
you could fuck your and you could break 

261
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,424
your hand for sure.
But the right way to do a spinning back 

262
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,640
fist is with the hand down with the palm
of the hand facing down with the fist.

263
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,420
So in that way you are hammerfest 
summit.

264
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,363
You really,
it's really offended him more than a 

265
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:33,690
spinning back fist.
That's the way to do it,

266
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,490
right?
I've never done a spinning back fist.

267
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,353
No,
no.

268
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,480
It's a brutal move.
And you got a really time.

269
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,440
That one right?
Yeah.

270
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,080
You do.
You gotta you gotta be you gotta.

271
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,360
Be very confident knowing that you're 
turning your back on the guy real quick.

272
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,080
It's weird how the different ways people
figured out how to fuck people up.

273
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,170
I was watching a street fight today 
between these two checks here for.

274
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,631
No,
no,

275
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:55,021
no,
no.

276
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,400
It was on.
It was on instagram.

277
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,600
Somebody said.
Was it the one where the girl said,

278
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,890
kicked my ass,
bitch.

279
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,080
Kick my ass.
You said you were gonna kick my ass.

280
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,070
Kicked my ass.
Bitch.

281
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,130
I two white girls sounded really good to
black girls listened because my wife was

282
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,300
there.
I just watched two,

283
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,880
a blonde girl and she,
her head,

284
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
she even know.
Yeah,

285
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,330
it uh,
she throws her to the ground.

286
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:19,480
She kinda like kinda curves are a little
bit too.

287
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,370
Just beats the fuck out of her.
And she got attacked.

288
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,330
She got attacked.
She totally turned around,

289
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,203
beat that girl's ass,
and she kept chasing her and that girl 

290
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,490
kept talking shit.
Yes.

291
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,020
While I was getting the fuck out,
I'm like,

292
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:30,411
well,
you know,

293
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:31,244
if he hit her on the jaw,
maybe she'd go to sleep and wouldn't 

294
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,550
have to hear her talk anymore.
But the girl.

295
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,413
My point was when she had her down,
she's hammerfest and people know that's 

296
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,164
a legit move now.
Like mma has changed street fighting 

297
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,190
forever.
It really has.

298
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,070
People know,
they know what to do now,

299
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,900
you know,
and you could see like,

300
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:48,734
especially with kids,
there's a ton of videos of trained kids 

301
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,543
who actually know how to fight and they 
get by someone who doesn't know how to 

302
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,780
fight and they wind up arm barnum or 
getting him in a month.

303
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,170
It's like the kid that did that,
a cat williams.

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,610
Oh yes.
Yeah.

305
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,780
Well it was a wrestler.
Yeah.

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,830
Yeah,
it was 17.

307
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,120
I thought he was only 15,
15,

308
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,400
whatever it was.
He was a teenager.

309
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,650
Yes.
He got and he got him in a nice seat,

310
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,640
stretched them out and everything.
He got his back and just stretched.

311
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,470
What the fuck is wrong with katt 
williams?

312
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,590
I don't know,
man.

313
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,050
He's one of us.
What's he doing?

314
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,430
I don't know.
He's one of us,

315
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:20,170
but he's also one of those guys.
It seems like.

316
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,004
Who's,
uh,

317
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,960
who's hitting that pipe every now and 
then?

318
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:23,794
I don't know.
I can't confirm nor deny those 

319
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,610
allegations.
Definitely some stimulants involved.

320
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,460
There's something going on.
Something's gone awry.

321
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,883
I'm fascinated by him because I think 
he's one of the best comics alive in 

322
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,670
bursts,
like in moments,

323
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,623
but then he'll have these horrible 
wretched shows where there's class 

324
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,930
action lawsuits or money back and he 
ends up leaving,

325
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,230
but then he gets it back together and 
have some amazing stories.

326
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,063
Like he'll put together a special and 
have amazing stories based on all the 

327
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:54,280
fucked up shit he did.
It's almost like he does it on purpose.

328
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,210
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

329
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,330
But I don't think he does,
but it seems like he could read,

330
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,340
he could write the ship.
Like he just like,

331
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,174
fuck it.
I'm staring into the wind steer steers 

332
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:03,910
into the wind and that he's like,
all right,

333
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,450
that did not work out.
We gotta,

334
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,680
we gotta get the cat williams boat back 
online.

335
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,050
We've got to turn this around as an 
iceberg coming and he figures out how to

336
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,940
right the ship and then he comes back 
around.

337
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,923
But man,
when he's on he's fucking funny because 

338
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,720
he's fearless.
Yeah,

339
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,100
absolutely.
Fearless.

340
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,350
Yeah,
he definitely does not give a fuck.

341
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,513
And with his hair is the something about
that conked out hair and the sweat 

342
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,240
profusely sweat.
That'S that molly sweat.

343
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,963
Sweating that mtma I guess system.
did you ever see the time where him and 

344
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,970
steve harvey,
they,

345
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,250
uh,
they did this thing together.

346
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,940
It was real weird.
It was like they were touring together.

347
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,123
It doesn't make any sense to me at all.
Steve harwood go on first and then kat 

348
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,004
williams would go on second and uh,
I guess they were like talking shit 

349
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,294
about each other leading up to the show.
So steve harvey goes on and then kat 

350
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:06,961
williams spends the first 10 minutes 
mocking him and it is fucking brutal and

351
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:10,720
hilarious.
Well,

352
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,310
I'm on,
I'm with cat on that one.

353
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,300
It's hard to not be that.
Steve harvey guys.

354
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,940
A weird dude.
I've never met him actually,

355
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,290
you know,
27 years in this game.

356
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,120
I never met steve harvey.
Well,

357
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:22,954
I met him a long time ago back when he 
was essentially doing a richard pryor 

358
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,990
impression when I met him in the 
nineties.

359
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,230
He was doing richard pryor on stage.
I mean,

360
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
it was crazy.
Like if you didn't know,

361
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,343
you would think like [inaudible] this 
guy like auditioning for richard pryor 

362
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:38,824
movie or something.
I don't remember his standup at all 

363
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,184
from.
It wasn't like he was doing priors 

364
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,410
material,
what he was talking as if he was richard

365
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:48,970
pryor,
you know,

366
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,430
there was there the whole thing guys,
there's the,

367
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,450
you know,
how it is.

368
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,320
There's like you get influenced.
Uh,

369
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,800
did you ever do that?
Um,

370
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,380
there was no,
I mean I was always into like carlin and

371
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,900
stuff like that.
So I was not smart enough to copy carla.

372
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,460
Like I knew my intelligence level was 
far lesser than carlin.

373
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:09,690
So I would,
uh,

374
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,524
I would just do what I did.
I caught myself on stage once sounded 

375
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,590
exactly like richard,
jeni and I was like,

376
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,400
jesus.
Oh wow.

377
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,303
Exactly.

378
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,620
You went in.
Yeah.

379
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,480
Yeah,
I mean I was open miker,

380
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,830
but now there's,
you know,

381
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:25,640
there's a whole slew of comics that try 
to sound like mitch.

382
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,290
Really?
Yeah.

383
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,124
There's a few of them out there and It 
freaks me out and everyone's on their 

384
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,100
dick and I'm like,
wait,

385
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,660
you know,
that's mitch,

386
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,520
right?
That they're doing well,

387
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,160
like,
okay,

388
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,710
can't tell me names,
but yeah.

389
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,970
Well hedberg had such a distinct style 
that would be kind of crazy.

390
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,804
But you hear what the tell.
I mean in New York there's like five or 

391
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:48,710
six guys that I could name right now.
Everybody at the seller has the same way

392
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,740
of speaking there all a towel babies.
yeah.

393
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,800
Yeah.
Or that shut up stupid.

394
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,221
You know,
it's,

395
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,560
everybody wants to be Keith Robinson 
too,

396
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,394
right?
Yeah.

397
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,230
Yeah.
But It's interesting,

398
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,273
you know,
that's one of the reasons why everybody 

399
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,010
went to with the uh,
what's that?

400
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,870
Uh,
that's,

401
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,050
that's a,
that's a seller thing.

402
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,970
What are you doing?
I get it.

403
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,670
What do you,
uh,

404
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,770
are always everything makes them,
uh,

405
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,103
when it does that,
when you go to the seller next time you 

406
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:18,260
talked to everybody and be like,
oh my god,

407
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,230
that's the fucking seller talk.
I like it clicks.

408
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,660
It is a bit cliquey,
but he did,

409
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,130
but I get sucked into it when I'm there 
too.

410
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,010
I just do it because I'm around them.
I mean,

411
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,150
I'm like,
I guess this is what we're doing guys.

412
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,301
Yeah.
It's,

413
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,630
it's interesting how little clubs like,
uh,

414
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,473
like the seller just spawn.
They just take off and it becomes the 

415
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,114
spot.
When you think about how many spots 

416
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,210
could be the spot in New York city?
Yeah.

417
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,820
Does New York city like have 100 comedy 
clubs or something?

418
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:44,631
Crazy?
Ton of them.

419
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:45,464
And then there's new ones opening all 
the time and then there's people try 

420
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:51,830
doing a nice one or class two year one 
and that shit never works.

421
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,050
Yeah,
you need the nice grimy seller.

422
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,730
I mean it's just,
it is what it is.

423
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,564
Low ceiling.
Everybody packed in real tight and then 

424
00:16:58,731 --> 00:16:59,880
you get like the,
the,

425
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,090
the,
a list of comics walking through there.

426
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,260
Yeah,
just to pr.

427
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,880
Isn't that funny that it's also funny 
too,

428
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:09,800
that like to practice the best place to 
practice is a little tiny place always.

429
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah.
You don't want to practice in front of a

430
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,500
room full of people and three of three,
400 people.

431
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,543
Have you ever thought about doing a 
special in front of a tiny group of 

432
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,840
people?
Um,

433
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,160
I have,
but then,

434
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:22,994
you know,
sarah did the one in front of like 12 

435
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,790
people or something like that.
She did,

436
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,610
yeah.
She did one,

437
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,480
lIke really small audience.
It wasn't at largo.

438
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,343
Yeah.
How big is largo if you're one of the 

439
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:34,190
small rooms at largo?
Oh really?

440
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,670
Yeah.
Huh.

441
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,470
But I mean if anybody can make that 
work.

442
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,370
Sarah silverman.
Ken?

443
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,710
Yeah.
She's fucking funny.

444
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,823
She doesn't do enough.
She doesn't do enough and she doesn't 

445
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,020
get the respect she deserves.
I don't think so either.

446
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,220
Yeah.
I mean she's,

447
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,330
she's not funny on a curve.
Like,

448
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,830
oh,
she's a funny woman.

449
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,590
You know,
she's,

450
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,810
I told her that once.
I said,

451
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:55,250
you know,
sarah,

452
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,690
you're one of my favorite comics,
not one of my favorite female comics,

453
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,360
one of my favorite comics as a human 
being comic.

454
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I saw her at the store maybe a year ago,
and she was murdering just murdering.

455
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,380
And I was like,
man,

456
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,190
sometimes I forget how good she is.
You forget how good she is,

457
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,140
how great her jokes are written.
And uh,

458
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,280
you know,
I get through this.

459
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,230
I go through this little phase when I 
like,

460
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,123
now I'm back at the zero point with no 
material and I've been going out every 

461
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,270
night,
but I might.

462
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,650
My trick is to go and host so that way 
there's not too much expectation on.

463
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,240
Right.
So I'd move.

464
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,070
Yeah.
So I can get my confidence back and then

465
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:29,904
I could see,
know the level of talent around me and 

466
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,200
in what way everybody's thinking and uh,
you know,

467
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,143
then I,
then I can figure out if I want to tell 

468
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,670
stories if I want to tell jokes,
you know?

469
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,870
Right.
Yeah.

470
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,153
When do you write,
do you write in front of a computer or 

471
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,584
do you write on.
I know physically write anything ever 

472
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,610
really ever.
A lot of guys are like that.

473
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,960
They'll burdens neither.
Yeah.

474
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,010
Yeah.
We had that conversation about that.

475
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,560
I can't.
I feel like it's a.

476
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,731
Well,
first of all,

477
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,260
I'm too lazy.
That's the real issue.

478
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,213
It has nothing more to do with anything 
that I don't want to sit down to write 

479
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,050
this.
I don't even want to watch my sets.

480
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,110
My almost famous specialist out now.
I haven't watched it.

481
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,220
No,
it was good.

482
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,620
It was sent to me months ago and I was,
like I said on netflix.

483
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,420
Yeah.
When,

484
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,780
when did you film it?
In april and did.

485
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,830
How many times did you watch it?
Not once.

486
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,750
You didn't wAtch it all day?
Not even once.

487
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,673
My brother was sat in on the edits and 
then my mom was watching it and my mom 

488
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,330
was in town.
My mom's in town,

489
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,490
so she was watching in the living room 
the other day and I walked past like,

490
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:27,010
what are you watching?

491
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,843
She goes,
you and then I was listening here and 

492
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:30,960
they're like,
why did they keep that in?

493
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,110
Why that sucks.
Why would you keep that in?

494
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,393
Yeah.
I just watched the trailer for my 

495
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,090
special today and I was just.
I don't like watching myself either.

496
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,943
Oh,
you're just coming on like in a week or 

497
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,640
two?
October 21st in a week basically.

498
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,770
Yeah.
Next friday.

499
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,810
Twenty first I opened for you.
You just last week my special aired,

500
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:52,914
so.
Oh,

501
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,013
I'm like,
what?

502
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,630
I know I smoked a lot of pot,
but you have now we know.

503
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,270
We've never done a show together.
I don't think we've done the ice house.

504
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,110
Oh,
that's true.

505
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,350
I hosted that.
Yeah,

506
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,050
we'll do it again then.
Fuck yeah,

507
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,250
dude.
I like hosting.

508
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,540
It's fun for there.
Again,

509
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,960
on the 28th,
the friday,

510
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,670
friday the 28th.
I think I am in san jose that weekend if

511
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,504
I'm not mistaken.

512
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,310
Oh really?
San jose improv.

513
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,500
I love that place.
Yeah.

514
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,730
That fucking improv is this shit.
It's great.

515
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,480
But again,
I have no act so you know,

516
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,150
if anybody is coming out to see me,
just understand that I don't have an act

517
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:27,984
right now.
So.

518
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,823
Well,
you've got a little bit of an act like 

519
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,270
how much you have zip.
Literally fucking nothing.

520
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:35,640
I haven't done one joke and I could say 
it now,

521
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:36,474
but then it's over.
know how much time do you give yourself 

522
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:42,300
before you started doing theaters again?
I wait till I got jokes.

523
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:45,540
Actual jokes.
I waited till I got at least 40 minutes.

524
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,660
So do you like just keep banging it out 
and then just go,

525
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,650
okay,
we're good.

526
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,693
Start booking shit or do you get in like
a few months and you go all right and 

527
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm going to give myself a deadline.
Deadlines are good for us.

528
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,550
Yeah.
Because otherwise we're just,

529
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,840
you know,
just keep coasting.

530
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,570
That's how for me,
writing a new specialist,

531
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,433
very importantly to putting a special 
out and then chuck in it and then 

532
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,004
writing all new shit.
It's so important because otherwise we 

533
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,840
all know those guys that had been around
forever doing the same material.

534
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,390
Oh I know some comics in Canada.
Hilarious.

535
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,463
They're acts are funny as hell,
but they've been doing the same act for 

536
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,040
30 years.
That's so crazy.

537
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,010
And then they give me shit or new.
The last special wasn't very good.

538
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:24,491
I go,
yeah,

539
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,324
well you know what?
You haven't done new material in 30 

540
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,920
years that you cannot get people to get 
a little brave.

541
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,400
Brave on the internet.
They're a little jealous bowls.

542
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,253
And josh russell national,
they'll make their little facebook 

543
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,800
statuses.
Mr.

544
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,940
Worldwide.
Like pit bull.

545
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,140
That's it.
I'm shit.

546
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,493
It's a fucking problem.
Was killing joe with the puns that 

547
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,323
killed him was I was trapped in a pun 
sandwiched between tony hinchcliffe on 

548
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,790
one side of Russell Peters on the other 
side.

549
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,590
It depends.
We're flowing like water.

550
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,453
Would you like to sun bread or a pun?
I had to start doing puns myself and I 

551
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:04,484
rarely do parties.
I was throwing them in myself just to 

552
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,740
keep up with these fucking guys.
So.

553
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,370
Well,
it's such a specific style of joke,

554
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,260
the pun,
you know it is it.

555
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,160
It takes you back to your father's.
Father's always did.

556
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,070
Yeah.
That's like the silly,

557
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:25,060
clever thing to say.
My father.

558
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,080
Or you have an uncle who had the puns.
What have you.

559
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,850
Yeah,
what have you,

560
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,570
dude,
you chose,

561
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,590
you tour everywhere man.
Like you were in dubai and Saudi Arabia.

562
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,170
Holy shit.
What is that like?

563
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,030
You do the show.

564
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,560
His men on one side.
Women on the other.

565
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,780
Good.
So I play over there.

566
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,170
Yeah,
I was asking them like why?

567
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,063
Like why,
why don't like and honestly the guys 

568
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:53,170
would tell him and he's like normal.
It's supposed to be normal level headed.

569
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,570
Men telling me this and these weren't 
like,

570
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,730
you know,
any high ups are just normal guys.

571
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,953
Oh [inaudible] the women,
they'll go crazy and don't want to 

572
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:02,560
attack us.
So I'm like I look at you,

573
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,650
but dude look at them.
They're not trying to attack you.

574
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,280
They'll want to attack and have sex with
them in the streets.

575
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,900
That's what they've been brainwashed 
into.

576
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,510
Believing that if these women aren't 
separated,

577
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,880
they'll just come and attack you and 
want that dick.

578
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,510
Maybe that is the case though,
when you keep them separated,

579
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,013
if you keep them from men all the time 
when they finally get around that maybe 

580
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,014
they just jump on tick like a hero on 
the guys are a little too friendly with 

581
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,670
each other as far as I'm concerned.

582
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,680
Gay stuff.
Yeah,

583
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,500
but I don't even think they recognize it
as homosexual because they're like,

584
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,663
I'm not attracted to men.
It's just get horny and they just start 

585
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,960
jerking each other off.
I don't know that for sure,

586
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:38,794
but you know,
I could see that as as a possibility if 

587
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,710
you're just around dudes all the time 
just repressed.

588
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,053
Well,
I know dudes who have been in the 

589
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:51,251
military who've done tours and they go 
overseas to the middle east and they say

590
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:53,900
that guys,
fuck young boys all the time.

591
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,073
It's weiRd to me.
Well you think that that's a like a 

592
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,980
consequence of the separation between 
the men and the women?

593
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,590
Yeah,
I guess I don't know what it is.

594
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:06,230
It's weird to me,
but when I did the show,

595
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,064
I played right down the aisle.
I stood where the aisle was when I was 

596
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,550
on stage and stood where the hail was so
that I didn't really Pick a side.

597
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,520
Can you turn like a sprinkler?
I kept turning like that.

598
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,160
Like I was just trying to water half the
lawn.

599
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,203
Now when you do shows lIke that,
do you ever worry about doing something 

600
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,314
that get you in trouble?

601
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:25,983
Um,
it's not so much that I worry about 

602
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:28,884
doing stuff that'll get me in trouble.
It's doing stuff that they may deem as 

603
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:32,874
offensive because I know what is 
offensive and then then you gotta worry 

604
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:40,080
about people's sensitivities.
So I'll always ask the promoter,

605
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,010
lIke straight up,
I'm like,

606
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:44,420
what can't I talk about?
I'm like,

607
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,580
no,
religion dimension,

608
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,500
the royal family and try to keep sex to 
a minimum.

609
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,650
I'm like,
all right.

610
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,210
wow.
No religion can just mock.

611
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,370
Mormons can make fun of mormons.
It probably could.

612
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,950
Yeah.
They wouldn't give a fuck.

613
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,760
they would again wouldn't know what a 
mormon was.

614
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:02,820
They would think of as a sect really 
know.

615
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,663
I don't know that.
I'm sure they wouldn't know what a 

616
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,000
mormon is.
Mormons very specific to this

617
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,060
part of the world wasn't created here.
Yeah,

618
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,980
yeah.
It was created in.

619
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,063
Well,
they,

620
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,200
they took over Utah essentially.
It's interesting.

621
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,350
Do you perform in Utah lot?
Once or twice?

622
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,270
Not very often.
It's real interesting club.

623
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,290
It's great.
Yeah.

624
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,020
Yeah.
Well,

625
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,500
wiseguys in salt lake,
they have two of them now,

626
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,000
right?
They have a larger one.

627
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,130
They had the original one that I think 
they opened the larger one,

628
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,010
the one down from the mall.
I don't remember the address but,

629
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,400
but um,
they have.

630
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
It's utah's interesting because you have
like these mormons but you have a lot of

631
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:39,554
like really cool people that are sick of
the mormons bullshit and they surround 

632
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:44,504
him too.
But then it's marvins mean it's a wacky 

633
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:47,954
cult.
Right.

634
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,390
It's very bizarre.
But they're really nice.

635
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,820
They're like some of the nicest cult 
members ever.

636
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,961
Yeah,
it's,

637
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,630
it's a,
it's a,

638
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,040
it's a

639
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,090
tough line to walk because you're not,
I'm not sure what their deal is.

640
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,590
You're not sure if they're trying to 
convert you,

641
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,210
but then I as a brown guy,
I'm like,

642
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,373
well,
they only just started letting us 

643
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:05,840
believe their shit about 20 years ago.
Right.

644
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,090
Then they only let black people in like 
20 years ago.

645
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,720
Is that what happened?
I didn't even know.

646
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:10,554
This ain't black mormons.
There's got to be like a clan of black 

647
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,660
mormons.
Please find that jamie.

648
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,800
It's got to be some sort of a group 
where they get together called more than

649
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:24,750
men's jesus christ.
and it'll be good.

650
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,584
Joe mentioned that didn't happen,
but they have a great spot like salt 

651
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:33,540
lake city's got damn gorgeous.
You know,

652
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:34,820
they have the mountains there.
I just.

653
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,780
Nice areas.
Nice up there.

654
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,250
yeah.
I love Utah.

655
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,130
I walked a lot when I was there.
I would walk from the hotel to the gig.

656
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,510
Why?
Why not?

657
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,250
Okay.
It was nice.

658
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,110
Nice air.
Needed.

659
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,720
The exercise.
Yeah.

660
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:49,790
Salt lake city is uh,
it's,

661
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,793
it's just,
it's weird when you associate a place 

662
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,730
with something like san francisco used 
to be gay.

663
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,653
Yeah.
So like even the gaze can't afford it 

664
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,110
anymore.
It's not Really gay anymore.

665
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,850
Yeah,
they out price the gaze.

666
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,580
Yeah,
they did.

667
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,580
They did.
They did.

668
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,710
I mean there's definitely some rich gay 
folk out there,

669
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,310
but as far as like having a community of
specific people,

670
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,610
it's more tech tech millionaires and 
shit.

671
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:20,910
It's a lot of that and a lotta.
There's a lotta and there's a lot of old

672
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,810
money there too,
you know,

673
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,000
people have just been there forever.
There's that.

674
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:27,960
But as far as like the amount that 
things cost in san francisco,

675
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,220
that's the most obscene I've ever seen 
in terms of like real estate and what it

676
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:33,880
costs to buy a house.
Yeah.

677
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:35,610
Because if you want to be in the city,
right?

678
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

679
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,253
But that's pretty much aNy city if you 
want to be in it's gonna cost you a lot 

680
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,530
more.
It will cost you a lot more.

681
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,200
But in west hollywooD it new york's 
insanity,

682
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,110
but you could live in west hollywood and
it kind of makes sense.

683
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,480
But you know,
I rent in west hollywood.

684
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,973
It's hard to own in west hollywood 
because I feel like everything has been 

685
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:57,410
purchased by somebody and they just rent
everything out at a absorb.

686
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,840
Extremely high rent.
Yeah,

687
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,120
I guess that makes sense,
but there's stuff for sale,

688
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,283
but it just doesn't.
It's California so strange because of 

689
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,640
the earthquakes.
Everything's all spread out,

690
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,950
like nothing stacked on top of each 
other.

691
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:13,590
I mean you have downtown but downtown.
So rare.

692
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,020
It sounds so new.
Yeah.

693
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,140
Well it is now.
It's becominG new again.

694
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah,
and they're.

695
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,030
They're real estate downtowns.
very expensive now too.

696
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,190
I remember when they started doing it 
about 10 years ago,

697
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,500
it was cheap and now you're like,
wow.

698
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,900
It's like almost like New York pricing.
Yeah.

699
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,420
They're were turning it into an actual 
real city.

700
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,430
Johnny.
Johnny depp is selling some.

701
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,630
Were you telling me about that?

702
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,123
Johnny depp is some sound,
some preposterous chunk of real estate 

703
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:44,820
there where he's got like five floors 
and some gigantic.

704
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,080
Well,
you know he's getting divorced.

705
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:46,914
Yeah.
So he's got to him and start dumping 

706
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:49,230
shit.
The kids getting fucked.

707
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,450
He's getting fucked.
Johnny.

708
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,313
Yeah.
He's going to have to give up a ton of 

709
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:55,320
cash.
That dummy didn't even get a prenuptial,

710
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,890
or at least i got a prenup this time.
Good for you this time.

711
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,030
This time.
First time.

712
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,291
First time.
No,

713
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,270
but I was only married for 14 months,
so it didn't matter.

714
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,240
They can't fuck you if you're only 
married for 14 months.

715
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,710
No.
Look at this.

716
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,203
Seven months.
Just listed his five los angeles 

717
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,890
penthouses for 12 point seven.
Eight dollars million.

718
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,370
He's got five.
Which he just sold one of them.

719
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,830
Is it 12 point seven each or in total?
Total for all five.

720
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,060
Oh,
that's not too bad then.

721
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
No,
it's not stacked.

722
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,193
I thought it was just they are there.
I'll take the top couple floors of one 

723
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:27,800
of those buildings.
Five units.

724
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,180
It's all him.
What is he doing?

725
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:32,190
Buying all this stuff.
It looked pretty cool.

726
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,323
I think you guys buy all that stuff 
because the money starts flowing in and 

727
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,540
he said,
whoa,

728
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,510
he's got some baller fucking houses.
Holy shiT.

729
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,040
Yeah.
That's some cool shit.

730
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,490
Wow.
That is amazing.

731
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,590
What a cool looking place.
Three of them are connected.

732
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:47,080
The other two I guess are separate.
Oh,

733
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:47,914
I see.
So we selling those two and the other 

734
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,250
thing,
but the problem with apartment living is

735
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,084
man,
you wind up paying all that money and 

736
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,840
then the neighbor,
right next door has a party.

737
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,060
Yeah.
And you listen to his bullshit.

738
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,660
That's probably why he bought all those.
So that way he was his own neighbor.

739
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,250
Yeah.
That's a good move.

740
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,503
But you're still an also then if you're 
in downtown la one day the earth is 

741
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:11,170
going to shake.
Yep.

742
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,350
And that building,
your end's going to be useless.

743
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,140
You're not gonna be able to fix that 
thing.

744
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,040
To get a break.
There's going to be structural issues.

745
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,053
They're going to have to vacate the 
entire thing and you're going to get 

746
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,280
fucked out of all your hard earned cash.
All that jack sparrow money.

747
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,560
Well,
he's getting fucked out of it anyway.

748
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:35,140
His earth is shaking already,
but she's hooked up with elon musk.

749
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
Has she really?
Yeah.

750
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:39,940
Maybe she'll leave me alone.
Maybe she'll cut them some slack.

751
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,670
I understand that she was with elon 
musk.

752
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,730
Now I'm a smarter than that.
No,

753
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,820
you would think that guy's a fucking 
genius.

754
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:51,760
He's a.
He's a thinker.

755
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,450
He's a thinker.
I think he likes pussy.

756
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,593
Yeah.
we all liked posting while he was 

757
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:58,684
dating.
He was married to some actress before 

758
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,780
that apparently didn't have a prenuptial
with her.

759
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,583
Oh,
terrible billionaire and the baby elan 

760
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,390
musk relentlessly pursued and was 
infatuated with amber.

761
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:13,870
Heard sending repeated emails requesting
to meet the actress.

762
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,973
Okay.
I don't like the way that's phrased 

763
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,830
because that's the work of some asshole.
Yeah.

764
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,460
It sounds like he wanted to grab her 
pussy.

765
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,720
Who wrote that?
Is that a girl,

766
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:27,590
a girl or guy wrote that,
chris.

767
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,840
So it could be either.
Yeah.

768
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:29,860
Ryan.
I liked how you did that.

769
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,110
It was written by pat.
Remember?

770
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,270
It's pat.
You couldn't do that today.

771
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,410
Today.
They would call you transphobic.

772
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,890
Yeah,
there's every phobic now.

773
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,030
She's not gender binary or zs,
not gender binary.

774
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,450
There's a from your part of town,
university of toronto.

775
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:50,110
There's this embattled professor who's 
a.

776
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,860
He's like standing his ground against 
political correctness in,

777
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:54,740
in,
in,

778
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,993
in toronto,
and the kids are going crazy to try and 

779
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,260
get him removed.

780
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,650
He just refuses to use the 28 different 
gender pronouns.

781
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,920
He refuses to let people choose what 
gender pronouns they want to be called.

782
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,621
He's like,
no,

783
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:11,410
I'm going to call men men.
I'm going to call women women like,

784
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,244
this is ridiculous and this is 
censorship like you're trying to change 

785
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:15,934
people's behavior with the pr.
Here's the problem is that people now 

786
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,550
with with all these free,
this new liberty,

787
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,470
they are just choosing to do things as 
opposed to actually being a certain way.

788
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,830
And I saw this story about this kid 
gavin something or another,

789
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,280
I think it's in North Carolina,
if I'm not mistaken.

790
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,010
And uh,
and it was born a girl,

791
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,830
but when you see it,
is it 14 or 15 year old?

792
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,130
Now he identifies as a male and when you
see it,

793
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:46,940
you're like,
oh yeah,

794
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,200
he's a boy lead.
There's,

795
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,323
there's no reason for me to not believe 
that this is the right way for this 

796
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,880
person to be.
But it should be case to case.

797
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,960
You know what I mean?
It shouldn't be.

798
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,820
He can't just blanket statement,
oh,

799
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:00,110
whatever you want to be,
you can be.

800
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,280
No,
fuck that you,

801
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,443
it has to be genuine.
You can't just do it because that's the 

802
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:04,600
thing to do,
right?

803
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,880
And does have to be genuine,
but when you opened it up like that,

804
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:11,780
then it gives people who legitimately 
feel like during the wrong gender,

805
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,620
it gives them the opportunity to express
themselves in a different gender.

806
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,830
What's fucked up is that you're born a 
boy and you're a fucking boy.

807
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,210
Alright,
you're born a girl,

808
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,210
you're a girl.
But if you were born a girl and he feels

809
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,460
like you're a boy,
you'd never really going to be a boy,

810
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,623
you know?
So if I call you a boy and he'd take a 

811
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,200
bunch of hormones and everything,
you're still not a boy,

812
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,430
what would it be?
Nice.

813
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:33,200
And what's probably eventually going to 
happen?

814
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,930
There's going to be a way that they can 
change your sex,

815
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:36,764
like literally change your sex.
There's going to be some way where they 

816
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,093
interfere with your dna.
they get in there and Russell Peters 

817
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,930
becomes russell ina.
Peter's a little,

818
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,691
uh,
a little,

819
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,190
uh,
hacking on your system there.

820
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,800
If you a girl,
what would you change your name to rose?

821
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,230
Who I get?
I think I'd still want to be rp.

822
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,370
Beautiful.
You'd be beautiful.

823
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:58,610
You'd be like a flower.
I'd be beautiful flower.

824
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,503
Russell rose pedals.
I like be two that I'd be to lift 

825
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,130
brogan.
I've always wanted to be a to that.

826
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,990
I feel like they're an under appreciated
flower.

827
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,480
They're to be rose because rose is like 
the king of the flower.

828
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,470
So It's a lot of pressure.

829
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,693
Um,
but then you don't to be orchid because 

830
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,140
that's the more expensive work.
It's more expensive than roses.

831
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:17,881
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,

832
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:19,170
they're very expensive.
Really?

833
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,320
How do you know this?
Because my fiance loves orchids.

834
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,770
Oh,
but the good thing with those is you buy

835
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:29,090
one and they last for a long time.
you can keep those alive really?

836
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,630
How's that?
Uh,

837
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,523
the way they are,
you wrap them around the stick and they 

838
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:35,790
just keep growing.
Oh,

839
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,340
okay.
So when you ask them,

840
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,040
are they in dirt?
Yeah.

841
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,050
You got them in dirt?
Yeah.

842
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,780
Okay.
So rosa is you buy them and they're in a

843
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,060
bush,
so they died quick.

844
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

845
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:47,840
It's that life support system thing they
do when they put it in water,

846
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,000
like kci throw some water to keep them 
fresh.

847
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,760
We pulled,
we pulled them.

848
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,480
Should we pull the plug on these houses 
yet?

849
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,110
You know what I found out recently,
we were talking about this the other day

850
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,830
that you can take the stem of one plant 
and plant it on another plant.

851
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,993
I goes at this ranch and theY had 
pistachio trees and the arms of the 

852
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:08,120
pistachio trees are grafted onto an 
avocado tree.

853
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,110
So that stem cell.
No,

854
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
it's not.
Just try to make a pun out it.

855
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,590
I betcha.
It can't all be good,

856
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:18,424
joe.
You got to spit them out so that way 

857
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,440
they get out there and you find out if 
they're good or not,

858
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,560
but you can't take a rose like when 
someone gives you a rose has been cut.

859
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,450
You can't make that thing stay alive.
Kenya,

860
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,270
can you plan it in dirt?
No.

861
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,163
No.
It needs.

862
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,130
It needs the roots.
It's not going to grow roots right now.

863
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,700
It can't.
I don't think it can grow roots.

864
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,370
It's over.
I think the,

865
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,240
the,
the top of the bud,

866
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,850
the,
uh,

867
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,590
can,
can flourish still.

868
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,690
The flower,
the flower itself can do what?

869
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,690
It can still flourish for a little 
while,

870
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,290
but the body is dead basically in the 
stems.

871
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,991
Dead.
Yeah.

872
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,200
The stems dead.
So,

873
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:53,130
but you can't take the flour and 
somebody dies like,

874
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:53,960
you know,
an increments.

875
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,400
It's dead from tHe,
from the cut point I would imagine.

876
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,443
Oh,
is that what it is?

877
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,361
I don't know.
I'm,

878
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:59,194
I'm,
I'm assuming it'd be dead from the cut 

879
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:03,390
point and then it just slowly dies.
It's way up that.

880
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,860
That makes sense,
right?

881
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,023
You can.
Yeah.

882
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,920
So I'm an idiot.
No,

883
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,790
you can regrow a rose once you cut it 
off the stem for real.

884
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,670
I'm just not a horticulturalist.
well,

885
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,533
it's,
it's interesting to watch people who 

886
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,260
know flowers,
they know what to trim and whatnot.

887
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,113
The trim,
they're constantly like cutting pieces 

888
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,004
off of it.
That's why they do what they do and we 

889
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:25,740
just pay them to do.

890
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,683
Okay.
I have nothing.

891
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,600
I got nothing for that.
What's that?

892
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,810
Use it doing it using potatoes.
Oh,

893
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,610
I've seen that before.
Oh shit.

894
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,910
Yeah.
Rose stems,

895
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,130
you stick it in a potato and what does a
potato do?

896
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,040
It probably helps give it a root base,
I would imagine.

897
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,790
Are you.
I'll make it again.

898
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,330
People hear you right now in that.
Yeah,

899
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,263
I mean you guys can hear me right,
but they won't do that in la because 

900
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,630
people tend to avoid potatoes and carbs,
so they do.

901
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,370
Now.
It's the newest thing.

902
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,560
Have you been on that yet?
What?

903
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,390
Avoiding carbs?
No,

904
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,433
clearly.
Look at me.

905
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,470
It looked like.
Avoided the fuck did I do I just fucking

906
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,150
like food?
I do too.

907
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,790
I give myself cheat days.
Yeah.

908
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,480
When I had,
when I was for the special ed,

909
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,950
hired alex,
a reason to train me.

910
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,120
Alex,
the guy who trained out really and hired

911
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:19,380
him for you get you on steroids.

912
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,220
No,
no,

913
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,810
no,
he didn't.

914
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,310
It's famous for that.
That's what everybody thinKs he does,

915
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,990
but I,
I didn't see it.

916
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,720
He just works.
You fucking incredibly hard.

917
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,820
Like.
Yeah.

918
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,521
And I waS like,
alex,

919
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,050
you know,
I don't have a fight coming up.

920
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:32,730
Right?
Like literally,

921
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,564
I'm not exaggerating when I say this.
I would spar 12 rounds boxing and then 

922
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,430
1212 with 32nd breaks.
Yeah.

923
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,140
And then after that an hour and a half 
of corp comm on my god,

924
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:46,974
I'm dying and I would let it really get 
home and just be in bed for the rest of 

925
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:50,934
the day.
That was it.

926
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,220
So all that core stuff that pack out 
does.

927
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,540
Do you think you've got all that from 
him?

928
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,300
I would imagine so because I was just 
wondering.

929
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:58,134
I was like,
I've never seen a figHter work more on 

930
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,070
their core then pack.
Yeah.

931
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,060
He was telling me though that that 
packet was addicted to that though.

932
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,540
We would have to tell pacbio don't do 
fucking sit ups today.

933
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,040
Why?
Because you know,

934
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,960
you take a day off,
let your muscles rest.

935
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,281
and he was like,
no,

936
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:15,114
he would just catch them.
Just doing them all the time and he 

937
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:18,210
would do like a thousand sit ups.
Something stupid.

938
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,153
I was,
I couldn't get him to stop doing sit 

939
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:23,100
ups.
He couldn't stop.

940
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,010
He was addicted to doing sit ups.
That's so bizarre.

941
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:27,510
That's the one thing that most people 
hate.

942
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,570
yeah.
I,

943
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,680
I,
I hated these weird planking things.

944
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:33,330
He made me do hate them.
Oh,

945
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,410
look on your elbows.
Not even on my elbows,

946
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,330
on the medicine ball.
A half ball,

947
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,300
you know,
he'd turn it upside down and I would,

948
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,630
I would be on that and then my feet 
would be on a medicine ball,

949
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,464
so I'd be at that angle is struggling 
the whole time and they just make you 

950
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,720
stand there for 30 seconds,
10 seconds,

951
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,530
15 seconds.

952
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,530
It's a long time now.
How'D you get in touch with that guy?

953
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,200
Uh,
from,

954
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,390
you know,
ellie sec back?

955
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,250
No.
does ess news?

956
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,660
He's a boxing kitty.
oh,

957
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:02,890
I know the name.
Yeah,

958
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,090
he,
uh,

959
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,923
put me in touch with them.
That's a weird guy to get as a trainer 

960
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:08,854
though,
isn't it?

961
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,180
Because I wanted to get what the problem
was.

962
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,770
I wanted to get skinny,
I wanted to lose weight,

963
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,900
I wanted to get small,
but he's a,

964
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,880
you know,
alex is one of those guys who's like,

965
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,013
no,
I want to make sure you're fit and 

966
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,180
you're in shape.
And I'm like,

967
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,320
dude,
I just got.

968
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,640
I looked the same,
but my,

969
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,770
like I was more fit,
you know what I mean?

970
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,663
Like we hadn't lost any weight.
I know I lost a fat percentage and gain 

971
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,060
muscle mass,
but that's not what I wanted.

972
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,270
What I want.

973
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,690
I don't have a fucking fight coming up.
I just wanted to get skinny.

974
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,400
I just want to slim down.
Yeah.

975
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,560
Give me aids perhaps.
Could you really say that?

976
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,880
How dare you right now?
Easy east spinning in his grave.

977
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,223
Well,
I don't know.

978
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,760
Do you think you really had eight?
Uh,

979
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,500
I would.
Uh,

980
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,281
it would,
it would appear.

981
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,990
So I don't think anybody would want to 
fake that one.

982
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,643
Usually.
Now when somebody dies of aids and they 

983
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,420
don't want to say it,
they just say he had pneumonia.

984
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,310
Well how few heterosexual people got 
aids.

985
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,660
That's what's Interesting.
You know,

986
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,090
it's true.
It is a difficult way to get it.

987
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,480
Will chamberlain didn't get aids.
How does anybody have aids?

988
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,720
Yeah,
right.

989
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,110
And magic johnson and all this.
Well he did.

990
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,250
He got the hip,
but apparently he read.

991
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,153
He reads clear now.
That's what the word on the street Is 

992
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:15,574
that his tests.

993
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,920
Yeah.
I don't understand that.

994
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,070
Um,
apparently you can get the hiv to such a

995
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:24,070
level that your body doesn't detect it.
Yeah.

996
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,400
It's all very confusing.
DIseases are very confusing.

997
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,910
Commenting on any of that stuff.
Like where's the aides were,

998
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,560
where did it go?
Come on.

999
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:35,190
Everybody thought by the time this 2016 
rolled around,

1000
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,280
we don't have it yet with all of aids 
were.

1001
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll be dead,
right?

1002
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,120
Yeah.
And then chris rock did the job 20 years

1003
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:40,840
ago.
I remember.

1004
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,350
What was that?
You're aids is acting up.

1005
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:43,184
It's.
He said aids is just going to get to a 

1006
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,520
point where just manageable with 
medications as well.

1007
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,363
That's right.
And it's basically where we're at right 

1008
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,990
now.
What's even crazier than manageable?

1009
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:50,824
It's nonexistent.
Do remember when sam kennison had that 

1010
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,670
bit about it?
Sam kennison.

1011
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,540
I like the most controversial bed.
Is she?

1012
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,840
He's like sam,
they say it's a,

1013
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,020
it's a,
it's a communicable disease.

1014
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,110
Heterosexuals can die from it too.
He goes,

1015
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,930
name one name one fucking god.
Damn.

1016
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,450
why?
Because it's not dance.

1017
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,680
Maybe had that thing about rock hudson.
Oh,

1018
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,431
I remember that.
You know,

1019
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,170
rockets had had to be on his deathbed.
Gone.

1020
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,460
It was her last fucking dick.

1021
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,320
What was that last day?
Why don't I suck at dick's?

1022
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,790
Nothing ever went wrong.
dictate.

1023
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,890
What was that last big.
Oh,

1024
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,390
that guy,
man.

1025
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,850
That's the guy that you can't.
That's,

1026
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,940
that's a,
that's a real revolution in comedy.

1027
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,170
It's only been like a few,
like real revolutions.

1028
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,620
There's a.
Yeah,

1029
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,720
there's that distinctive voice that 
people get,

1030
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,390
right?
There's the mellow guys.

1031
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:48,450
Then there's the,
uh,

1032
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,143
if anybody does try to go that route,
it's always trying to do sam and now 

1033
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,790
there's the people that want to be mitch
and then there's the,

1034
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,400
uh,
people that want to be bill or louis.

1035
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,773
The bill one was awesome because there 
was so many people that were trying to 

1036
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,800
be like hicks.
There was a,

1037
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,800
there was so many.
There's so many like hicks clones,

1038
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,200
especially after he died and everybody's
like,

1039
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,043
I'm going to pick up the mantle.
I'm going to be that tortured road 

1040
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,540
warrior writes poems.
Yeah.

1041
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,630
See to me hicks.
I always read to me as an angry,

1042
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:18,950
dorky guy,
angry nerd.

1043
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,310
That's how I always.
Yeah.

1044
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,860
I never looked at them going,
okay,

1045
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,110
so cool sam.
I looked at it,

1046
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:23,930
but like,
it's kind of cool.

1047
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:24,763
He's very rock and roll.
You know what's hilarious is ari should 

1048
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,210
fear like challenges people.
He goes,

1049
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:30,680
he wasn't funny.
He goes,

1050
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,370
show me one joke or hicks was funny and 
people get crazy.

1051
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,590
They get so mad.
They attack him.

1052
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,590
they go after him.
He's like,

1053
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,790
Yeah,
good point.

1054
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,040
You made a good point but not funny.
Next,

1055
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,840
I'm with ari on this.
I was never a hicks fan,

1056
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:50,330
but I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.

1057
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,640
ALways will be.
I'm a fan of what he did,

1058
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:55,670
like the style.
I was very fascinating to me to watch,

1059
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,010
but he definitely wasn't the most 
hilarious guy.

1060
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,113
It wasn't like joey diaz,
like you watch them and you can't stop 

1061
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,090
laughing.
You're just crying.

1062
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,760
I think kettler is a better version of 
hicks.

1063
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,920
tendler how?
How so?

1064
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,980
I mean ken lawyers got that fucking 
sharpness to them and.

1065
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,250
But he's a lot of sticky stuff and he 
does some sticky stuff.

1066
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,810
But you almost know he's doing it on 
purpose.

1067
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,920
Oh,
he definitely is.

1068
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,783
Yeah.
So.

1069
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,163
But again,
he's also one of those guys that only 

1070
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:21,560
comics know about our love.
Yeah.

1071
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:22,394
That's weird.
Those I always felt like kindler would 

1072
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,990
catch on.
He wasn't you.

1073
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,390
He was on somebody's sick.
Come from and it was he.

1074
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,313
Yeah.
What's it come to kindler and thinking 

1075
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:36,140
about patent?
No,

1076
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,500
because I was on a siTcom.
Patent was on kevin.

1077
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:43,130
James had come to think andy kindler 
dropped in on that every now and then to

1078
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,950
diddy or was it drew carey's?
One of them.

1079
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,110
Do you got that info?
bob's burgers.

1080
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,630
What's bob's burgers cartoon?
I did a voice on bob's burgers.

1081
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,763
He's on marin.
He's on marin as a guest every now and 

1082
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,510
then.
Or was he on anything else?

1083
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,780
Hmm.
Comedy bang

1084
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,741
comedy.
Bang.

1085
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:05,574
Bang.
What is that?

1086
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,350
That's.
I'm reggie watts.

1087
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:08,184
This thing,
wasn't it?

1088
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,930
Reggie watts is on that new show where 
he's the bad guy for that.

1089
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:17,850
James corden?
Yeah.

1090
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,910
Yeah.
Have you watched that show?

1091
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,020
I haven't.
No.

1092
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,780
Good for you.
Stay away from that tv.

1093
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,370
Go read a book.
That's what I'm saying.

1094
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,520
Oh,
he was.

1095
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,353
Oh,
okay.

1096
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,250
Everybody loves raymond.
the sitcom is a sitcom.

1097
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,540
A sitcom is dead as we know.
What I think.

1098
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,010
Yeah.
Seems like it.

1099
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,880
Well,
the,

1100
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,930
the uh,
the traditional sitcom is dead.

1101
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,123
Do you sit around thinking about things 
you can do or do you just do one more 

1102
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:47,010
time?
Yeah,

1103
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,750
I think about all the time.
Rubin,

1104
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:52,350
paul and I have an idea for a show,
but we don't know which way to go.

1105
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,630
That's the thing that want you to say it
on the air so someone could steal it.

1106
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,493
I mean,
I know that's what I'm not saying it to 

1107
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,500
my life.
So you can't steal my life.

1108
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,370
You could try as ease and sorry,
I start gaining weight.

1109
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,310
He was son of a bitCh.
I'm outta here.

1110
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,540
I went there motherfucker.
I don't give a shit.

1111
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,520
I'm smoking a joint even though you 
don't smoke pot.

1112
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,470
How come you don't smoke?
Pot was talking about.

1113
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,660
Uh,
I didn't like the way I felt on it.

1114
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,550
I didn't like feeling slow makes you 
feels low.

1115
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,950
Yeah.
I also like just dopey.

1116
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,980
I felt like hmm.
Like to mellow,

1117
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,130
which I didn't want to feel.
Are you sure you smoking the right shit?

1118
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,151
I mean,
I,

1119
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:34,170
you know,
this was the,

1120
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,240
there was the nineties when I tried it,
the nineties.

1121
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,910
TheY hadn't figured out sativa yet.
No.

1122
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,360
Maybe they did know where they figured 
out back then.

1123
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,590
Back then it was either a,
you either had a cess or.

1124
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,650
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1125
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,460
Or,
or,

1126
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,100
or,
uh,

1127
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,890
or fucking little g kush chronic.
Not even.

1128
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:56,724
I was in toronto,
so it was like either jamaican stuff or 

1129
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,650
hydro stuff.
What about edibles?

1130
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,380
That's what fucked me up.
Oh,

1131
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,780
I didn't have a bowl 11 or 12 years ago.
Yeah.

1132
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,813
One of those little two bite brownies.
But I did not know he was supposed to 

1133
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:14,010
only have one bite.
Oh,

1134
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,510
that's,
that's fucked up.

1135
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,210
More people like eating too much 
edibles.

1136
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,283
As fucked up.
More people with pot than probably 

1137
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:21,900
anything ever.
Yeah.

1138
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,340
I ate the whole brownie and wanted to 
fucking die.

1139
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,170
I'm sure you've seen the nine slash 11 
video.

1140
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:34,171
That was on a youtube of the cops that 
called nine slash 11 because there was a

1141
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,210
guy they pulled over.
He had some pot,

1142
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,373
they stole the pot from him and made 
brownies with it and ate the brownies 

1143
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:43,750
and thought the brownies were poisoned 
and thought they were dying.

1144
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,390
I thought they were dead.
Were like times moving really slow.

1145
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,960
I never seen that.
No.

1146
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,900
Oh,
fire that up jamie.

1147
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,710
If I find that please.
It's hilarious.

1148
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,600
It's fucking hilarious because this is 
what happens.

1149
00:46:55,601 --> 00:46:58,210
like marijuana.
I've said this before,

1150
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:00,820
so please forgive me if you've heard 
this and you're listening.

1151
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,860
Marijuana,
when you eat it,

1152
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,753
it's processed by your liver and it 
produces something called 11 hydroxy 

1153
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:11,650
metabolite that's five times more 
psychoactive than thc.

1154
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:12,723
Right?
So there's thc which you get when you 

1155
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:16,690
smoke it and then when you eat it,
it's a totally different drug.

1156
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,310
So when people go,
oh my god,

1157
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:20,140
this is not pot,
somethings in this.

1158
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,060
Now that's pot.
When you eat it pot,

1159
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:24,550
when you need it,
it's like a totally different dimension.

1160
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,940
You open a different door,
you go down a different hallway,

1161
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,650
you're in a different.
You like,

1162
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,040
this is

1163
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,570
not pot pot that's partly eat.
I was stuck to the bed,

1164
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,720
literally like laying in a,
you know,

1165
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,120
put spread eagle.
oh,

1166
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:42,100
the nine one.
One call for the cops.

1167
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:45,520
The cops called nine slash 11 for the 
was calling.

1168
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:46,750
I was literally.
My nails were.

1169
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,820
Yeah.
I thought I was going to like,

1170
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,190
the bed was going to fly.
Yeah,

1171
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:53,500
I've been there dude.
And I was all I could do as mumble.

1172
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,150
I couldn't even muster words out of 
mouth.

1173
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,610
My tongue was dead.
It was so my favorite way to be scared.

1174
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,444
The shit out of me.
What I like about being there is that 

1175
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:06,370
you always come back like you really 
think you're going to die,

1176
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:09,970
but you always come back and you're 
always fine and you come back here.

1177
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,833
Listen to this

1178
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,143
two

1179
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,010

1180
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,780
an overdose.
And my wife.

1181
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,670
Have you and your wife overdose of what?
Marijuana.

1182
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,530
I don't know if it had something in it.
Oh,

1183
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,260
okay.
Can you please send rescue?

1184
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,430
Okay.
How old are you?

1185
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,323
I'm 28.
Twenty nine years old and my wife is a 

1186
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,490
26.
Please call them?

1187
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,013
Yes,

1188
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,140
Hey.

1189
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,570
what have you guys been drinking

1190
00:48:41,571 --> 00:48:43,180
You know,
that's it.

1191
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,230
And is there any weapons in the house?
No,

1192
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,670
please come on.
You guys like you guys have anything?

1193
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,383
No,
I'm just,

1194
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,230
I think we're dying.
How much did you guys have?

1195
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,340
A.
I don't know.

1196
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:01,400
We made brownies and I think we're dead.
I really do.

1197
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,490
Okay.
And what,

1198
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,970
how much did you put in the brownies?
I don't know.

1199
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,910
I hit him back.
Um,

1200
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,780
my wife and I did two book.
Come here.

1201
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,720
Get her.
She's on the.

1202
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,490
She's on the living room ground right 
now

1203
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,480
on the grant

1204
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,920
breathing.
Is she awake?

1205
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,560
Think so.
Okay.

1206
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,480
Can you log?
pardon?

1207
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,613
Can you,

1208
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,060
can you just

1209
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,720
down in front of the time is going by 
really,

1210
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:30,411
really,
really,

1211
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:35,411
really slow and putting the brownies.
Pardon?

1212
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah.
How much did you buy?

1213
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,273
I don't police and rescue.
I'm trying to think of how much you 

1214
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:44,454
bought and put it into the brownies.
PrObably like a quarter on total from 

1215
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,780
the brownies and you guys eat all?
Yeah,

1216
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:56,781
we dId.
It wasn't a big patch.

1217
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:00,970
A little bad.
It was,

1218
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,040
it was a quarter ounce.
Okay.

1219
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:03,893
But brownie wise,
how many pieces do you guys think you 

1220
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:07,170
guys had?
I don't know.

1221
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,810
I probably had like a small child.
Please tell them it's.

1222
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,480
What time is it?
Nine 37.

1223
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,290
When did you last eat the brownies?
Probably like an hour and a half ago.

1224
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,360
Okay.
Is your wife,

1225
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:22,440
so he.
Is your wife still brina?

1226
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,020
Yes.
Yes.

1227
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,100
She's sitting,
kneeling down in front of me.

1228
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,990
She's moving.
I know.

1229
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,160
Have to wait.
Okay.

1230
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:32,480
And she says yes.
What's your name?

1231
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:37,360
My name is edward edward fansa.
Okay.

1232
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,360
And did you guys have any?

1233
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,970
We get it.
It goes on for awhile.

1234
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:45,740
But what's hilarious is the lady who um,
who answered the phone,

1235
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,800
she didn't even bother.
Like she didn't rush,

1236
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,650
she knew they were fine beCause she was 
sober.

1237
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,170
like that's my favorite thing.
She just keeps asking questions.

1238
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:57,140
Like if that was a gunshot wound when 
she'd be asking so many questions,

1239
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,570
where are you?
Have somebody like blacked out.

1240
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,404
They think they had a heart attack.
Shouldn't be asking so many questions 

1241
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,380
for these dummies.

1242
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,833
One of my friends had one a couple of 
years ago when he came out here to see 

1243
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:11,040
us.
He had a cookie and when it hit him,

1244
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,460
he,
he turned fucking so pasty,

1245
00:51:14,461 --> 00:51:19,020
white and any.
He thought he was dying is the same.

1246
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,883
Same exact same reaction.
I even called my doctor for him because 

1247
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,040
you know,
I'm like,

1248
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:23,880
anything I could do.
He goes,

1249
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,530
no,
just tell him to relax.

1250
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:27,810
He's got to wear off.
That's all.

1251
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,040
You can drink some water

1252
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,690
if you really feel like you're done 
though,

1253
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,640
you really do.
You really feel like,

1254
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:35,050
man,
I really fucked up.

1255
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:35,920
Yeah,
this is.

1256
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,200
It's over,
man.

1257
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:39,160
He was done.
What'd you get back?

1258
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,150
So what should I try?
Shouldn't try anything.

1259
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:45,490
If you don't want to mean you're a happy
guy,

1260
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,890
american guy.
I would not look at you and say,

1261
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:48,724
Russell Peters needs anything in his 
life other than what he's enjoying me 

1262
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,230
some tequila.
I do too.

1263
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,143
Yeah.
It's just the health consequences of 

1264
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:56,524
that stuff are just so different than 
what happens with pot when I was with 

1265
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,710
pot is drum roll.
Nothing.

1266
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,680
That's nothing.
You get high as fuck.

1267
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,630
The next day you go to the gym,
you feel great,

1268
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,950
like there's no health consequences.
If I get drunk and had been drunk,

1269
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,410
I feel like shit.
The next day man.

1270
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:16,390
I just feel like shit.
But what are you drinking?

1271
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,510
Anything.
If I drink too muCh wine,

1272
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,720
I feel like shit the next day.
Yeah,

1273
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,720
if I drink too much whiskey,
I feel like shit.

1274
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:24,310
The next day.
If I drink too much beer,

1275
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,860
I feel like shit.
The next day I work out,

1276
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,230
I could feel it.
I feel like weakened

1277
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,730
tequila.
I feel fine.

1278
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,800
The next day you're a maniac.
That's open.

1279
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:33,790
That's all.
Just just drink.

1280
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,950
drink it straight.
Whoa.

1281
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,430
That's terrible advice.
You don't have to give it in.

1282
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:41,140
This terrible event is you don't have to
have like fucking,

1283
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,530
you know,
10 of them.

1284
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,960
You just have,
you know.

1285
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,600
I have maybe two glasses.
I sip.

1286
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,350
I'm all night.
Brian painting

1287
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,910
two shot before every show.
He does one shot before every show.

1288
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:52,803
That seems like a damn good idea.
It's not a bad idea because your body 

1289
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:57,670
really doesn't have a hard time 
processing one shot of whiskey,

1290
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,100
like one shot of whiskey is like no big 
deal.

1291
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,220
IT's when you go like three,
four,

1292
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,740
you have a beer.
Whoo.

1293
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,040
I don't.
I don't mess around like that.

1294
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:14,070
It's just straight tequila.
I'm a huge hunter s thompson fan and one

1295
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:15,184
of the saddest things to me is watching 
thompson from the time he was a really 

1296
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:19,204
young man when he first started making 
it as a journalist and a writer to the 

1297
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:25,980
way was as he older and

1298
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,460
I think a big,
big part of it was the alcohol.

1299
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,540
Like he just drank so much booze that at
the end he was almost incoherent.

1300
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:35,843
He would go on letterman and conan 
o'brien and you've barely understood 

1301
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,860
what he was saying.
He just saw it.

1302
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:43,080
It's like,
that stuff will fuck it.

1303
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,093
Get you.
You know who almost sounded drunk with 

1304
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:47,130
hitchins?
Yes.

1305
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:47,964
Well he was drunk a lot drunk.
He was drunk a lot and he smoked 

1306
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:52,224
cigarettes as well,
which is just so unfortunate for such a 

1307
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,090
brilliant guy.
Yeah.

1308
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,050
You know he did smoke cigarettes,
right?

1309
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,320
No,
he sounded like he did.

1310
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,580
Doug stanhope.
What does it say?

1311
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,643
See him.
A boost suit he had when he got on the 

1312
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:03,070
cruise.
No,

1313
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,560
he snuck on all thIs.
How hottest smell this alcohol.

1314
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:08,410
Smuggle booze on the cruise ship he's 
wearing,

1315
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,543
I don't know,
leaders of whiskey and vodka and mixers 

1316
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,013
in those things.
He had it all in bladders and tucked 

1317
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:16,864
into small plastic bag and hopes are 
skinny now because you can't take this 

1318
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:20,860
stuff on a cruise ship.
I guess.

1319
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:21,694
I've never been on one.

1320
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:22,450
Yeah,
you can't.

1321
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,283
Hilarious.
You can't because they want you to buy 

1322
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,290
their booze.
Is that what it is?

1323
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,330
Yeah,
but they always have shit.

1324
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,810
Booze on board.
They do.

1325
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,990
So look at this.
He's got a suit on.

1326
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,310
Oh my god.
Bags of whiskey.

1327
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,290
This is so ridiculous.

1328
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,240
Yeah,
tuck.

1329
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,820
It's like someone in like a movie when 
they're making jokes about like,

1330
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,450
give me all your guns and they haven't 
talked to.

1331
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,080
Everybody

1332
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,870
got everywhere,
but he's ruined it for everyone now.

1333
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,630
Oh,
he's got it in his dick is got a tequila

1334
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:54,570
tucked into his jockstrap.
Are you playing this volume of,

1335
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,360
oh my god,
this is insane.

1336
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,670
Socks.
Socks.

1337
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,020
A flask.
Oh my god.

1338
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:13,090
it's enough for a party of 25 people.
Not for 20 fIve stan hope.

1339
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:16,180
So that's the difference.
I love him.

1340
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,320
That's what it looks like.
A norwegian cruise lines.

1341
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,260
Impractical jokers.
Hilarious.

1342
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,100
Smuggled.
Alcohol drop.

1343
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,480
Drop,
drop,

1344
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:27,291
drop,
drop.

1345
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,240
Trout.
Chickens,

1346
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:32,060
cats down.
I should have announced this.

1347
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:35,330
We're doing an end of the world election
night,

1348
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,050
um,
comedy podcast from the comedy store and

1349
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,270
it's going to be stan hope and myself 
and fitzsimmons is going to do it.

1350
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,100
And we're probably goIng to have some 
other people too.

1351
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,720
And maybe Russell Peters.
I'll drop.

1352
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,230
He's in cabbage in the date.
whatever the election day is.

1353
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:56,800
Is that the third 70 elections on the 
eighth?

1354
00:55:56,801 --> 00:56:00,070
So it will be the day.
God,

1355
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,960
this election's weird,
man.

1356
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,710
It's a,
it's a good time to be american guy.

1357
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,530
This is a weird one.
This is a weird one because like,

1358
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:10,364
um,
I think people just want to see it play 

1359
00:56:12,351 --> 00:56:14,120
out.
Somebody tweeted,

1360
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,560
I forgot who it was,
but it was hilarious.

1361
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:16,394
I said,
I can't wait for them to see the series 

1362
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:22,820
finale of of America.
Wow.

1363
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,730
It really almost feels like it.
You know you're going to vote,

1364
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,910
right?
Yeah.

1365
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,200
I guess we'll vote for Gary Johnson.
I think even though he doesn't know what

1366
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,034
aleppo is,

1367
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,080
you know,
when you know,

1368
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,140
even though you know.
Here's the thing,

1369
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:37,310
when I heard him ask,
when they,

1370
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,930
when I heard them ask them that 
question,

1371
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:44,090
it sounded like they wanted to know what
he thought about something called leppo.

1372
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:46,520
Oh,
what do you think about aleppo?

1373
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,620
I think he said,
what are you going to do about it?

1374
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:50,150
What are you going to do about aleppo?
And he was like,

1375
00:56:50,151 --> 00:56:50,984
I'm sorry.
Like I think the question just confused 

1376
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:53,703
them.

1377
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,980
It's a really important thing to know if
you want to be elite.

1378
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,080
I mean,
what has he been doing?

1379
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,930
He's running for president now.
That takes up all of his time,

1380
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,530
but how much was he doing when he was 
the governor of New Mexico?

1381
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,740
As far as like paying attention to world
issues,

1382
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,400
I don't know how much you have to want 
to know more than a regular person.

1383
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,150
it's always weird that,
you know,

1384
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,310
we'd get these,
uh,

1385
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,960
these people running for president that 
are from states where you're like,

1386
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,660
do they think about the rest of the 
world there right now?

1387
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,360
You know,
Arkansas and New Mexico.

1388
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,283
Yeah.

1389
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,363
WeLl some.
I think more people do now than ever 

1390
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,944
before.
More people definitely think about the 

1391
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:37,310
rest of the world now than they did say 
a 20 or 30 years ago.

1392
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,950
Just because we're in,
we're in contact with people more,

1393
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,340
you know,
the internet is given people more ideas,

1394
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:45,680
more things to look up,
more things to think about.

1395
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,580
But man,
not knowing aleppo,

1396
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,503
you got to know all that.

1397
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,700
And it's funny,
as I didn't know it,

1398
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,300
I didn't know what at the time I didn't 
know it.

1399
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:58,720
I knew that there was tremendous issues 
in Syria.

1400
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,540
The name of the city was,
it sounded like a nickname for something

1401
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,420
leppo and then I would,
you know,

1402
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:06,290
being indian.
I was like,

1403
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,990
how long it was the other one,
other

1404
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,430
one though where he,
uh,

1405
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,430
didn't know any world leaders and that's
a problem.

1406
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,323
That's a big problem.
So that's a bigger problem than not 

1407
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:16,920
knowing aleppo.
Yeah,

1408
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,050
you've got to be careful there.
Dude.

1409
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,160
You gotta have some people that you 
admire,

1410
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,040
but I think it's up to somebody in your 
business.

1411
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,490
Yeah,
I think he said angela merkel right?

1412
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,290
Is that what he said?
I don't even think he's.

1413
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,690
I think his vice president threw that 
out for him.

1414
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,793
Yeah,
but that woman who's running for as his 

1415
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,670
bride,
who's his running mate,

1416
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,490
some other dude,
bill weld,

1417
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,550
former governor bill weld.
Oh,

1418
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:43,941
building.
Oh,

1419
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,400
that's his vice president.
I should know that.

1420
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,310
I've almost given up.
It's like I'm a cubs Fan.

1421
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,220
It's like they're not going to win and 
not going to win and not.

1422
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,080
You know what I mean?
It might witness here.

1423
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,330
They might've heard bob newhart's all 
excited.

1424
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:58,580
He's 87.
He saiD he was too old for this shit.

1425
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,190
I love bob,
but those cubs fans,

1426
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:01,881
man,
they hang in there.

1427
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:04,940
No matteR what.
I gotta support toronto,

1428
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,900
you know,
it's my city.

1429
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,720
I understand even though I don't know a 
damn thing about baseball,

1430
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,583
but doesn't this seem like a,
it seems like a ridiculous sporting 

1431
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,280
event.
We really almost does.

1432
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:18,460
It's almost like an who who can.
I demean an insult more to diminish them

1433
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:21,230
more contest.
Like if you really thought

1434
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,873
like that about like part of it is like 
they'd go for the worst aspects of each 

1435
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:31,670
other and they try to like do it on live
tv.

1436
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,640
It's an ugly precedent to set for the 
country,

1437
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,630
you know,

1438
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,530
especially,
you know,

1439
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,603
when they try to justify it.
I think by looking at the rest of the 

1440
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:40,574
world when they have elections in how it
gets really violent and all these other 

1441
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,600
parts of the world.
And you know,

1442
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,520
you remember,
remember when some leaders,

1443
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,440
I forget what country it is,
but somewhere in europe,

1444
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,970
the leaders get into fights with each 
other at the end and they're a

1445
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,180
in their government offices.
Oh yeah.

1446
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:58,000
They have fucking crazy gang fights.
Yeah.

1447
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:58,820
There's one in

1448
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,740
parliament or something like that.
I was in China.

1449
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:03,500
Was it in China or there might've been 
China or Korea.

1450
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:05,330
I think it was curriculum again.
I saw the guy throw a cow.

1451
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,400
I think so.
And they went nuts on each other.

1452
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,440
He started fucking crane member.
And Ukraine is not the place you want to

1453
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:13,644
do it.
And what if fatality clips goes to 

1454
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:15,920
running,
you're running,

1455
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,050
you're running against him,
you know,

1456
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,010
Ukraine people are

1457
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,133
cut from a different cloth.
All those people from that part of the 

1458
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:23,914
world are.
So there's something like extra strong 

1459
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:28,000
about them,
you know,

1460
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:28,610
the,
the,

1461
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,240
the,
just the robustness of the people there.

1462
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,090
A survivors.
Fuck yeah man.

1463
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:35,710
It's Cold as shit up there.

1464
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,490
Cold as shit.
And they were more.

1465
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,300
They were oppressed for so many years.
Yeah.

1466
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,180
You could take some dude who lives in 
siberia,

1467
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,100
some man and his wife from siberia.
Nigga russell.

1468
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,070
I'm providing a coffee.
So.

1469
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,330
Exactly.
Yeah.

1470
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,410
Oh,
he may not be the best at it,

1471
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:51,730
but he sure is the toughest edit.

1472
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,680
Well,
la wasn't corel and from siberia as well

1473
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,400
as alexander karelin the wrestler.
Uh,

1474
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,170
I could not confirm or deny this,
you know,

1475
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,013
that is,
I do not do maybe the scariest guy of 

1476
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:06,440
all time in the history of russian 
athletes.

1477
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,633
There's one guy who stands out.
The only wrestling match he lost in the 

1478
01:01:11,031 --> 01:01:11,864
olympics was to rule on gardner.
I think that was the only in his entire 

1479
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,970
amateur career.
And I,

1480
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,250
I might be wrong about that,
but I know he lost to in the olympics.

1481
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,203
And the only reason why I lost to him,
it was like some new rule where if you 

1482
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:26,444
separated the hands it would be a point.
It was the first time that was ever in 

1483
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:32,540
the olympics.
So if you're [inaudible] the greco roman

1484
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,720
cable grip and greco roman,
they do a bunch of shit,

1485
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:39,050
but it's mostly upper body grappling and
collar ties.

1486
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:39,883
They don't shoot doubles.
It's like it's a different style of 

1487
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:45,800
wrestling and corella and excelled at it
because he was a freak specimen.

1488
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,380
But he's from siberia.
But he was like six foot,

1489
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:50,540
three,
300 pounds.

1490
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,553
Just a ridiculous guy.
And there's a picture of him hoisting 

1491
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:56,990
this guy in the air and I have it in my 
gym.

1492
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,410
I just stare at it all the time.
Like iF I ever,

1493
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,110
if I ever taKe myself seriously,
this picture right here,

1494
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,060
if ever want to know,
have really,

1495
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:05,894
truly understand what a pussy I am.
I need to look at this picture of 

1496
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:14,801
chlorella and he's gritting his teeth 
and he's hoisting this guy dude.

1497
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:18,350
No mouth guard.
Look at the size of his fucking quads.

1498
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,320
I mean he was a freak.
Giant calves.

1499
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:29,330
He was for rick and he fucking rag doll 
dudes now.

1500
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,510
Well he's a,
he's a wrestling coach now,

1501
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,050
I believe.

1502
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,500
If I had a guess,
I would say he's probably 55.

1503
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:42,450
See how do he almost got went to mma in 
the 19 nineties.

1504
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,340
How old is he?
40 nine.

1505
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,293
Something close.
And he almost went into mma in the 19 

1506
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:48,774
nineties.
It may have been the early two 

1507
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,063
thousands.
I think he was thinking about doing it 

1508
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,683
because there,
I know there were some offers and he 

1509
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,390
feel like he did some Pro wrestling 
thing.

1510
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,590
I think he might've done some like fake 
wrestling thing,

1511
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:04,350
like for money or something like that 
with dude,

1512
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,184
he was a four week,
just a freak and he would throw guys 

1513
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:13,050
around and this really ridiculous way 
where they just,

1514
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,153
they were like little children because 
he was a big giant do like the size of 

1515
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:21,180
that mother guy,
but he was also really agile,

1516
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,193
like he said,
like these roles that he could do these 

1517
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,043
dives.

1518
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:29,430
He was so gentle anD a lot of his 
movements but freakishly strong.

1519
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,264
So he had achieved this spectacular 
balance of incredible technique but 

1520
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,790
ridiculous freakish human athletic 
ability.

1521
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,253
So he had like the combination of those 
things like look at his technique and 

1522
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,890
everything is perfect,
but he's also tremendously strong.

1523
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,263
Like The russian wrestling coach.
It's rustling a russian wrestling is 

1524
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:55,014
incredibly technical.
While they're just the eastern bloc 

1525
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:58,944
countries,
like they have a super high level of 

1526
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:01,860
wrestling,
technical,

1527
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,570
um,
technical skill.

1528
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:04,783
Like a.
That's one of the reasons why george st 

1529
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,533
pierre.
So good because he was Training with 

1530
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,710
these russian nationals that came over 
and lived in montreal.

1531
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,050
That's where st pierre learned how to 
wrestle.

1532
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,450
He has a solid base to have these 
incredible.

1533
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,523
For a guy that is coming back,
I don't know that he keeps thinking 

1534
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:20,454
about it and talking about it,
but I think I'm sure you've heard the 

1535
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:23,064
rumors.

1536
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:23,963
Yeah.
well they're talking about like a super 

1537
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:26,940
fight with anderson.
I don't knoW.

1538
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:27,801
In toronto.
Uh,

1539
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:30,600
no one's told that to me.
I have not heard that.

1540
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,270
I heard it,
but I've not heard it from a human.

1541
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,060
If I was,
if I was george and I was thinking right

1542
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:37,410
now,
I think george st pierre is.

1543
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:38,763
I mean there's only a small handful of 
people as famous in the world of mma as 

1544
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:44,610
a fighter.
As george st pierre.

1545
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:48,510
There's connor who's the most famous.
There's rhonda who's right up there.

1546
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:51,840
Rhonda and connor.
Almost interchangeable in my eyes as far

1547
01:04:51,841 --> 01:04:52,674
as like how famous they are.
Maybe more conor because he's famous 

1548
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,240
worldwide.
I don't know,

1549
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,560
man.
It's super close.

1550
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,260
I think rhonda affected her legacy by 
taking that year off.

1551
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,030
Well,
that doesn't matter.

1552
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:05,690
She comes back with a storm.
She beats Amanda Nunez,

1553
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,200
get to the belt.
She's bigger than ever.

1554
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:09,120
That's a tough one.
It's a verY tough one,

1555
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,800
but if she does do it,
she's bigger than ever.

1556
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,890
She's,
she's got that whatever it is,

1557
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,560
that Dynamic personality that people get
attracted to and there's about

1558
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,320
her losing and maybe even losing like 
that,

1559
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,200
that could even make it more attractive 
to some folks,

1560
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:24,620
you know,
it's,

1561
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,400
it makes her more human,
makes them more vulnerable.

1562
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,253
You know,
one of the things that people didn't 

1563
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:31,330
like about her was how confident and 
strong she was.

1564
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,570
Very invincible at the time.
Well,

1565
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,830
and she was also like really aggressive 
about it with other girls,

1566
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,820
but you ain't,
you know,

1567
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,833
in her eyes,
those girls will try and take something 

1568
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:41,540
from her when she was the Mike Tyson of,
uh,

1569
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,870
of,
of mma.

1570
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:47,020
That's the only way you get to be a 
champion is if you have like that insane

1571
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:47,854
belief in yourself.
But when you lose the way she lost to 

1572
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:51,041
holly,
which is,

1573
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,450
you know,
a devastating knockout.

1574
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,230
It's always inTeresting to see how 
someone rebounds.

1575
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,363
Some people rebound that become better.
They come back tougher and stronger and 

1576
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,860
that's what we're hoping,
let's you're hoping for.

1577
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,420
But that was,
or some people come back,

1578
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:07,390
they fight smarter.
That was george st pierre when george st

1579
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:11,230
pierre got beaten up by matt serra.
Matt serra clobbered them,

1580
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,630
just collaboratiVe,
clipped him,

1581
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,464
heard him,
got on top of a mountain and punishment 

1582
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:16,600
of face,
bam tap.

1583
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:20,860
And he'd beat the shit out of him.
And george came back better than ever.

1584
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:21,993
He just regrouped.
But george also didn't take a year off 

1585
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:24,970
in between there.
It's true.

1586
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,330
It's true on tv and you know,
you know,

1587
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:30,720
list for sure.
And I just think was a different person.

1588
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:31,690
You know,
I love rhonda,

1589
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,720
but I,
I just,

1590
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,480
I,
I'm hoping,

1591
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:35,314
you know,
for her,

1592
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,243
for her,
I'm a big fan of taking a long time off 

1593
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,210
when you get knocked out.
I think I understand that and think it's

1594
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:45,070
real important.
It is very important.

1595
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,933
However,
what you do in that time and how you 

1596
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,770
present yourself in that time is also 
important.

1597
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,210
Well,
she really do much.

1598
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,340
She kind of laid low,
you know,

1599
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,560
which I mean.
Nah,

1600
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:58,810
nah,
I don't think so.

1601
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,970
I see your point.
But I disagree.

1602
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,010
I think she'd do whatever the fuck she 
wants,

1603
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,331
you know?
I mean,

1604
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:06,820
I don't know that it really affected her
brand so much,

1605
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,650
but he's telling me a marketing genius.
That's what I'm just thinking.

1606
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,500
You should.
You should have a startup.

1607
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,780
We should have a startup together.
Let's do it.

1608
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,430
What do you want to do?
We'd do.

1609
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:19,990
What do you think is wrong with taking a
year off?

1610
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,610
Like nothings wrong with taking a year 
off,

1611
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:22,444
but you know that allen interview where 
she was talking about contemplating 

1612
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,460
suicide.
Yeah,

1613
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:27,880
I forgot about.
I mean I think those are the things that

1614
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:28,714
showed the mental makeup and that's 
where I think that's what's putting the 

1615
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:32,890
doubt and everybody's mind now.

1616
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,130
If I had to do a brendan schaub right 
now,

1617
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:38,230
I'd say for sure.
Don't do your first interview with ellen

1618
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,260
on tv.
Yeah.

1619
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,870
And cry.
Yeah.

1620
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,620
I don't know man.
Like I think I think those,

1621
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,513
those tv formats,
although I've done them and I enjoyed 

1622
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:50,200
them.
When you do those things,

1623
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:53,200
you can't.
You can't be yourself in seven minutes.

1624
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:54,034
It's not enough time.
Especially if they don't know you and 

1625
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,030
the people you're talking to.
No,

1626
01:07:58,031 --> 01:07:58,864
no.
You either as a giant crowd of people 

1627
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:03,740
and their lights that say applause and 
there's a guy had left.

1628
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,633
Yeah,
the clapping instead of laughing at a 

1629
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:11,161
warm up guy walks around.
Guys who were coming back live.

1630
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:13,780
You guys are super excited.
We're excited to have you.

1631
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,370
Thanks for all your enthusiasm.
We're really appreciate

1632
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,300
it.
I'm just going to need it.

1633
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,490
Let's just 10,
10 percent more folks.

1634
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:20,690
Come on.
We can do this.

1635
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,320
So whatever you got and add 30 to it.
Now,

1636
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:25,154
rhonda,
tell us about your head trauma and all 

1637
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:27,141
these people,
which I mean,

1638
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,940
it's like.
It's bizarre.

1639
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,460
It's bizarre.
It's a bizarre way to talk to people.

1640
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:35,000
I think what you should have done was 
talk to somebody in the fight game.

1641
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,150
It would have been.
It would have been received a little bit

1642
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:38,984
better because then she would have been 
speaking to somebody knowledgeable 

1643
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:42,320
about,
well,

1644
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,460
you know what man?
She can do whatever she wants to do.

1645
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,323
I don't.
I don't know what was going on in her 

1646
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,650
head during that time,
but I don't think there's anything wrong

1647
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:52,723
with taking a year off getting your head
together and she also had some injuries 

1648
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:57,080
she had to take care of.

1649
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,210
Did you,
do you think she should have trained,

1650
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:02,030
changed her a training camp?
I don't know what she's doing.

1651
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,030
Honestly.
She's still right back at glendale fight

1652
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:05,800
club.
Listen,

1653
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,800
what whether or not that guy,
edmond has had success with some of his.

1654
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,310
Some of his students who like what 
issues they've had.

1655
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,760
You can't deny that he's worked wonders 
with her hands like her.

1656
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,820
Her striking ability when she was 
warming up for that batch code,

1657
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:22,654
hey,
a fight,

1658
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,503
and they were in Brazil,
they were on the sand and they're doing 

1659
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:29,210
these pad drills together.
Just look fantastic.

1660
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:30,044
Right.
You look at her when she first started 

1661
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,000
striking,
you look at it until now.

1662
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,750
That's a big percentage of that.
Is those two working together so there's

1663
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,960
no denying there's some merit to what he
does.

1664
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,060
Unquestionably.
He's definitely helping her.

1665
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,120
You would have to examine the whole 
camp,

1666
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,190
like a scientist.

1667
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,290
You'd have to sit down to do this,
right,

1668
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,320
like you've got a world class world 
championship level racehorse and a woman

1669
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,490
like rhonda rousey,
right?

1670
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:59,480
Or any fighter for that matter.
And if you were the overseer,

1671
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:01,160
if you were someone who could say,
okay,

1672
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:03,650
what is the best course of this thing?
Like how do you,

1673
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,590
what?
You have to address technical issues.

1674
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,340
You got to address psychological issues.
You got address,

1675
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,690
comfort and attrition,
all these different things.

1676
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,310
You'd say,
okay,

1677
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:15,890
technically a,
what are we trying to achieve?

1678
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,783
Victory,
right?

1679
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,683
Like what is her best options?
Like is she training with the best kind 

1680
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:24,380
of sparring partners?
And the thing is you don't fucking know,

1681
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:28,130
like one person could do it one way and 
be super successful and everyone says,

1682
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:28,964
well that's the way to do it.
You don't spar and you only do drills 

1683
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,940
and then your ride bikes and that's what
donald cerrone has been doing.

1684
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:37,580
Or you could go the eddie alvarez route,
right?

1685
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,720
And y'all responded like a 150 rounds 
preparing for wholesale dos anjos.

1686
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,880
So he went the other route.
He just said,

1687
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,310
we're going fucking crazy.
We're going to go old school.

1688
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,680
Crazy.
We're going to go in there and brawl and

1689
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:49,514
just be comPletely prepared.
So ronnie doesn't continuously train 

1690
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:53,990
without sparring,
does he?

1691
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,110
yes.
Yeah.

1692
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,003
How long has he been doing that?
Since the fight with dos anjos he was 

1693
01:10:59,001 --> 01:10:59,834
talking about.
He said you take too much punishment in 

1694
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:02,384
the gym.
It's like you're taking too much 

1695
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:04,340
punishment.
Sparring.

1696
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,550
And he just,
he had some issues where I think he said

1697
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:08,384
he closed his eyes and the equilibrium 
was given out and he was falling and he 

1698
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:12,710
was like,
what the fuck?

1699
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,040
He realized it was he found out

1700
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,660
later.
Is he an inner ear issue?

1701
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:19,440
I think he was right here in like a,
like a vertigo type thing.

1702
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,453
Oh,
it was so good dose clogging one that 

1703
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,990
had affected his inner ear.
I think it was like an infection in some

1704
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:26,400
way.
but um,

1705
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:27,743
so he decided just let's just do drills.
I know how to fight and he's had 

1706
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,130
incredible results.
So I think someone else is doing that.

1707
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,670
The frequency that serone fights it as 
well.

1708
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,683
He,
he can probably get by without doing 

1709
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:41,904
that because he's in the ring enough 
where he doesn't need to be in the ring 

1710
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,180
extra.
I think you're right.

1711
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,360
I think there's that too.
It's like a comfortable balance and it's

1712
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:53,310
probably one of the reasons why he likes
to fight so much.

1713
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:54,144
He's probably,
he's easily the most active fighter in 

1714
01:11:56,371 --> 01:11:58,200
the game.
He definitely tries to be.

1715
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,390
Yeah.
But the problem also is like right now,

1716
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:03,390
like setting up the right fight for a 
guy like him is probably not that easy,

1717
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,700
you know?
I mean he's always ready,

1718
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:09,540
but he's always ready and um,
but setting up a fight for him,

1719
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:10,171
it's like,
you know,

1720
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:12,960
it's a high profile fight,
but it's also a dangerous fight.

1721
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,250
So you've got to say,
okay,

1722
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,740
well who do you set them up with?
[inaudible] after you see what he did to

1723
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:18,180
rick story,
you go,

1724
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:20,600
holy shit.
Like donald at one seventies,

1725
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,060
like some new thing.
Yeah.

1726
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:25,230
He's a new thing,
like he's away healthier cyst.

1727
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,580
It kills me to think that guy was 
starving himself for all those years.

1728
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,160
He's a big dude.
He's not small,

1729
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,173
but at 1:55
he just didn't have the durability and 

1730
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,350
one 70.
god damn.

1731
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,940
He's looking good.
It's amazing.

1732
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,220
It's crazy sport,
isn't it?

1733
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,293
You know,
I love it.

1734
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,373
So you know,
and I love being there at those things 

1735
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,420
and,
and,

1736
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,340
and,
and you know,

1737
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:48,174
when you get to know the fighters and 
stuff and you get a little inside 

1738
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,350
talking,
it's always interesting,

1739
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,910
you know,
I know it is man,

1740
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,350
because you know,
you realized when you,

1741
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,213
when you meet them and you and you talk 
to them that they're just guys doing a 

1742
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:01,260
job.
They're not looking at it as I just want

1743
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,880
to be the toughest guy in the world.
They're like,

1744
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,280
I got to get more money out of this.
Well,

1745
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:09,180
there's definitely that aspect of it,
but there's also the guys that just want

1746
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,150
to go in there and be the toughest guy 
in the world as well.

1747
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,430
Those are usually the new guys 
sometimes.

1748
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,050
Yeah.
The older guys are like,

1749
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:16,884
look,
I already know I'm tough and everybody 

1750
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:18,750
else knows I'm tough now.

1751
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,530
I got to monetize this.
Yeah.

1752
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,770
There's,
there's so many factors at play.

1753
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,810
You know,
and when it comes to fighting,

1754
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,540
there's genetics which plays a giant 
role.

1755
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,480
There's just,
there's certain guys that are,

1756
01:13:29,481 --> 01:13:32,040
is built better for it.
They just got a lucky roll,

1757
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:36,720
the dice and they have better.
Just the design of their bodies better.

1758
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,010
Yeah.
The shape is better.

1759
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,720
It works better.
They can hit you harder.

1760
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:41,970
their jaws bigger.
They can take more punishment.

1761
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,360
Genetics on their side.
Yeah.

1762
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,740
There's always gonna be guys like that.
So You're seeing guys like that now,

1763
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:49,560
but then you seem like the mental aspect
of it.

1764
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:52,800
How many gUys have mental coaches now 
and hypnotists and chet?

1765
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,960
It's such a weird game,
man.

1766
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:55,823
dude,
you're still in any fight sport now is 

1767
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,310
very different than it was,
you know,

1768
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,010
in the eighties when I was training 
boxing,

1769
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:04,080
there was no nutrition.
There was no.

1770
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,340
yeah,
I would to.

1771
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,840
I think I might have said it before my 
car get to the gym.

1772
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:10,430
I coach me like go run and I'm like,
yeah,

1773
01:14:10,431 --> 01:14:11,440
I just want to box.
He's like,

1774
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,040
no,
we gotta go

1775
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,380
run.
And then I would make all right and go,

1776
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,870
where do I run to?
And he goes running up to,

1777
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,570
you know,
tour bram and,

1778
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,220
and,
and seven and come back and I'm like,

1779
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:22,054
all right.
And right at that intersection was 

1780
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,690
mcdonald's just a little bit down.
So I would run to the mcdonald's and get

1781
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:29,524
a milkshake and then I would walk back 
because I made sure I ran there as fast 

1782
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,194
as I could to get a milkshake walk back 
and then they would run on the issue in 

1783
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:39,994
the last half.
So I would be sweating it out a little 

1784
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,423
better,
a little bit out of breath when I got 

1785
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:44,944
there.
What do you think about this Amanda 

1786
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,810
Nunez?
Ronda rousey fight man doesn't do.

1787
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,670
She's a beast.
She's bad.

1788
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,773
She's bad ass.
I mean I would feel more comfortable if 

1789
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:57,640
she was coming back against meesha or 
even a rematch against holly.

1790
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:58,680
But,
uh,

1791
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,010
amanda scares me dude.

1792
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:00,933
Before holly knocked out rhonda,
I had said that I just thought holly 

1793
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:09,190
holm needed more fights in the ufc,
like more people to know who she is.

1794
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:10,443
I'm like,
I go and I think Amanda Nunez the more 

1795
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:15,010
dangerous fight because Amanda Nunez is 
a black belt in jujitsu.

1796
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,380
Yep,
and she has fucking hard man.

1797
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:19,000
She looks like she hits like a dude.
Yeah.

1798
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:21,850
She had so much harder than most of the 
women in that division.

1799
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,823
She's super aggressive,
got shorter arms and she looks like she 

1800
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:26,530
can crank,
you know,

1801
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,440
um,
this whole cyborg thing,

1802
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,274
you know,
everybody wants cyborg to fight in the 

1803
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:36,250
ufc and trying to set up a fight.
I would like cyborG defined nunez.

1804
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,703
Yeah.
I was just thinking that like much 

1805
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:39,643
confide in my pack on some weight.
So thing about cyborg is she struggles 

1806
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:44,600
to get to 40.
Yeah.

1807
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,830
Like the,
she's so drained.

1808
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,380
Is there a way above that?
There should be.

1809
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:55,410
There should be a 1:45
or even give her the title at 1:45.

1810
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,710
Who is denying that she's the toughest 
145 pound woman on the planet.

1811
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:00,544
Who's denying that?
I think there's a shit ton of fights 

1812
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:05,890
waiting to happen at 1:45.
One 50.

1813
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:08,950
Even one.
Victor has a whole 145 pound division.

1814
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:09,784
A bunch of them were messaging me.
There were tweeting at me after we were 

1815
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:16,060
talking about bringing this still around
the ufc owns it.

1816
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,853
I thiNk the or the own part of it or 
something or it's on fight pass or 

1817
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:23,320
something like those science.
But um,

1818
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,760
yeah man,
she's a,

1819
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,190
she's a a destroyer,
you know,

1820
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,030
so I work as a destroyer.
Yup.

1821
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,260
She's so terrifying.
The way she attacks these chicks,

1822
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:35,800
like that's the 145 pound world champion
and she looks like mickey rourke.

1823
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,400
So I think she's a little prettier 
mickey,

1824
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,240
right bro,
you're being rude.

1825
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,970
I meant the lips.
I can't take this.

1826
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,240
I can't take this in a tweet tour after 
an apologize.

1827
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:50,780
Apologize for kicking the shit out of 
me.

1828
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:55,090
But what's interesting is I wonder if 
there is a 55,

1829
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,540
is there a 55 pound division to be had?
Maybe one.

1830
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,870
I'd go up to 1:48.
One 50 at the most I would say.

1831
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,330
Hm.
I wonder,

1832
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,901
because,
you know,

1833
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:05,734
I think cyborgs,
one of her coaches were saying that if 

1834
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:11,180
you really,
her the right division will be 1:55,

1835
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:15,170
I doubt would be the division where she 
would feel that the healthiest because I

1836
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:18,620
think she walks around at like one 70 
something probably she's,

1837
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:19,760
but she's all muscled,
you know,

1838
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,040
it's not like she's walking around like 
me.

1839
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,350
She's walking around.
She's yoked.

1840
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,280
Yeah.
But I'm Amanda Nunez is not that big.

1841
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,980
It's just not as big as her know.
So that would be,

1842
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,593
you know,
wouldn't be the wisest fight because 

1843
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:37,250
Amanda Nunez is like legitimate 135 
pounder,

1844
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:42,580
but she's a 135 pounder that hits like a
dude and she's very solidly built.

1845
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,520
She's very.
So it's all very compact.

1846
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,383
Did you see her fight with cat zingano?
I did not see how fucking ferocious cat 

1847
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:52,034
zingano is because she had cats and 
gunnel hurt in the first round and she 

1848
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:59,150
was getting beat up,
like real bad.

1849
01:17:59,151 --> 01:17:59,984
The first round was real bad for cat and
she made it out of that round and she 

1850
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:06,770
stopped her and either the second or the
third,

1851
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:07,604
I can't really remember.
See if you can remember that or you 

1852
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:11,894
don't remember it.
I Want to say she stopped her in the 

1853
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:14,174
third,
but it was just brutal fucking exchange 

1854
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,920
and she eventually beat Amanda Nunez.
Cats in Ghana is also knocked out.

1855
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:23,600
Me should take people.
Forget about that.

1856
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,920
Canceling jada's a beast.
I've.

1857
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,650
What's that third round?
Tko cat stopped amanda.

1858
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,680
But the first round did she had to 
survive.

1859
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,820
She was getting beat the fuck up and he 
saw and that's all stand up.

1860
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,610
[inaudible].

1861
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,520
Well I think she got cracked and the 
standup,

1862
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,363
but I think most of it was ground and 
pound on the ground if I remember 

1863
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:43,514
correctly.
But I'm amanda's just as far as like 

1864
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:49,970
her,
her punches from the outside.

1865
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:50,983
She's got amazing snap,
like she really knows how to be in the 

1866
01:18:53,841 --> 01:18:58,841
right position and she drops full,
like nothing punches on girls.

1867
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,150
Like she really turned over.
It was a distance.

1868
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,100
Oh dude.
She,

1869
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,650
she cracks people.
So she cracked Sarah Mcmahon.

1870
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,360
You see that fight?
I did not.

1871
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,590
Dude,
you know,

1872
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,424
a loT of times I catch I,
I jump in somewhere right around three 

1873
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:15,800
fights before the main event or two 
fights before the main event.

1874
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,200
yeah.
You're one of those cool guys.

1875
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,333
No,
I watched the prelims and then I get 

1876
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,520
fucked up when I have to change the 
channel because I'm like,

1877
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:23,210
where did it go?

1878
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,450
How am I finding this?
You know?

1879
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,780
Yeah.
When you're there live though,

1880
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:27,614
do you go for the whole event?
Do you get there very early after the 

1881
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:32,090
live event is a different animal.
Right?

1882
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:33,283
Everybody should see a,
a ufc live while I was trying to get 

1883
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:36,680
your attention.
Good.

1884
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,170
I'm on the wrong side of the octagon.
Just come over and grab me,

1885
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:40,100
man.
Oh that was.

1886
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:41,840
You can't go this way.
And I'm like,

1887
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:43,280
all right,
well next time come with me.

1888
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:45,430
I'll hook it up.
Um,

1889
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,850
but I see the seats,
I see the seeds.

1890
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:48,140
You get him.
and I'm like,

1891
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:48,800
where are you?
And they're like,

1892
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,670
I'm with joe.
And I'm like,

1893
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:50,600
fuck,
that's a good seat.

1894
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,280
You could do that.
We could do that.

1895
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,230
Will hook it up.
How about toronto?

1896
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,910
I'm not there for that one.
what is it?

1897
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:58,250
December 10th?
Um,

1898
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,850
something like that.
I'm doing a show with big jay oakerson.

1899
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:04,850
I love jay massey hall.
Can I host it?

1900
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,490
Fuck you.
That's it.

1901
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,040
Russell peters big jay

1902
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,873
and me.
You heard it here folks that a host 

1903
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,260
December 9th or whatever it is the day 
before the ufc.

1904
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:15,330
Yeah.
Tickets are not on sale yet.

1905
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:20,390
They'll be on sale like in a week.
December the three of us.

1906
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:24,720
That'll be a good old time.
Hell yeah.

1907
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,030
Would be real fun.
Um,

1908
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,190
but what we're just talking about.
Oh,

1909
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,290
the um,
Amanda Nunez.

1910
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:34,590
Ronda rousey fight.
But rhonda gets her to the ground.

1911
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:35,424
Man.
It can be good if he gets super 

1912
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:39,000
interesting.
I would just like to see one tune up.

1913
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,320
fight.
No,

1914
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:41,101
no.
Tune up.

1915
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:44,130
Finds this is not,
does not boxing.

1916
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,570
Ufc doesn't give you enough.
They don't.

1917
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:51,930
It's just a mountain.
You know what I will say though,

1918
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:55,770
that the women have proven to have far 
more resilience in the men.

1919
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,293
A lot of times they're just fucking.
Their willingness to not tap and their 

1920
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:00,534
willingness to get in there and I prefer
to not compare them gender to gender 

1921
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,443
because I'm not one of those people,
so I just wanna let you know that 

1922
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,560
objectified them in my own little wake 
up,

1923
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:15,420
not knowing,
no need to even compare them to the men.

1924
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,583
What I'll say is there's amazing 
athletes and amazing champions in both 

1925
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:26,490
the men and the women's division summit 
meeting legitimately now like there's.

1926
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,130
There's no denying that there's world 
class talent,

1927
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,720
but there's also no denying that the 
highest levels of male talent.

1928
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:34,554
There's a bigger pool,
but that's natural because there's more 

1929
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:39,420
men that are interested in competing in 
a male dominated sport,

1930
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:44,340
but the women's side is growing and 
you're getting a lot of like really high

1931
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:47,100
level moitai fighters like valentino,
chef chanko,

1932
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:47,934
so multiple time world champion who 
comes over and now she's fighting and 

1933
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:52,284
she just beat holly holmes.
She'd beat holly holm and she really 

1934
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:57,780
like outclassed or with standup.
Like that was a big aspect of that was a

1935
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,270
that I did see that and that was a.
Was a big shock for me.

1936
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:03,680
I thought hollywood outbox or no 
valentino's nasty dude.

1937
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,990
Just get that beautiful check right hook
and she's.

1938
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,600
She's real sneakY or their leg kicks.
She's got excellent timing.

1939
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,613
She's a really dangerous fighter for 
anybody in that division because if you 

1940
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:13,914
can't take her to the ground,
it's highly unlikely that you're going 

1941
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:18,640
to stand with her and not get cracked.
You're Gonna.

1942
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,493
You're gonna.
Start getting real apprehensive about 

1943
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:24,790
your movements because she throws that 
beautiful check.

1944
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:26,310
Right hook,
or at least she did with holly.

1945
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,220
She counters.
Well dude,

1946
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,093
she's just real high level striker and 
if you can't get into the ground and 

1947
01:22:31,711 --> 01:22:32,544
even if you can get to the ground like 
she's been working on her ground game 

1948
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:37,200
and she is very strong.
So there's suit like that.

1949
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:39,780
Fight for a title shot though.
Yes.

1950
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,501
Yeah.
Yeah.

1951
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:41,334
She has.
I'm sure who she's fighting me should 

1952
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:44,980
know.
Who the fuck is.

1953
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:45,813
She was writing me should I think me.
She was fighting someBody in mass note 

1954
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,470
and reaches fighting.
Raquel pennington.

1955
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:53,823
Oh yeah.
Raquel pennington and meesha are 

1956
01:22:56,761 --> 01:22:58,560
fighting in New York.
In New York city.

1957
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,320
Yeah.
What?

1958
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,310
Cal bennington's another one.
She doesn't get enough for respect.

1959
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,010
She's dangerous.
Super aggressive.

1960
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,980
Really good timing.

1961
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:08,780
Good timing with her hands.
Are you doing those ones?

1962
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,570
Yeah,
the math square garden one for sure.

1963
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,900
Msg and new year's eve.
Oh yeah.

1964
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,270
Like for me,
like a fight,

1965
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,340
like the misha tate,
holly holm fight.

1966
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,960
That's about as exciting a fight as 
you're ever going to.

1967
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,510
Fine.
That's exciting.

1968
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:26,590
Fight is you'll ever see.
And the fact that there was a round in,

1969
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:27,424
there were not much was happening around
her so we're not much was happening 

1970
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:30,694
where holly was trying to avoid nisha 
and just was just striking on the 

1971
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:33,634
outside that made the ending even more 
spectacular like the in that actually 

1972
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:41,320
made the fight better in the end because
it looked like holly was going to cruise

1973
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:45,310
to a [inaudible] and I didn't know him.
He should've dug deep.

1974
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,240
But uh,
so my all time favorite moments and then

1975
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,920
flicking,
holly not didn't fuck.

1976
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,240
She's like fuck you,
I'm not tapping.

1977
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:57,460
Went to out throwing punches and it 
looked like one of those puppets,

1978
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:59,710
you know,
ones gangster.

1979
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,110
So gangster,
the whole,

1980
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,670
the whole,
the whole fight.

1981
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,790
So gangster.
And that was on the same card where nate

1982
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:07,770
diaz beat conor.
Yeah,

1983
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:08,604
I mean that was,
that was one of the main reasons why I 

1984
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:14,050
decided to stay doing commentary that 
card because I was on the fence.

1985
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:14,761
I was like,
wait,

1986
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:15,594
no.
She just stopped doing it and then just 

1987
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,820
devote more towards.
Were you offered the uh,

1988
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,700
bisping handle fight?
No,

1989
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:25,360
I told him I'm not doing the ones that 
are overseas message could find.

1990
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,920
It was amazing.
I enjoyed it.

1991
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:28,870
I watched it at home.
I sit here,

1992
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,330
sit here.
We did a fight harder.

1993
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,260
You wish you could've Been there to 
commentate that one?

1994
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,490
Nah,
I mean the fight companions are great,

1995
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:40,540
but I'm saying no,
I'm just thinking brian stands awesome.

1996
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,433
I think brian stands great.
A lot of shit from people that just 

1997
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:44,884
don't like things that are different or 
they just pick a side or something like 

1998
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:48,040
that.
But I love.

1999
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,200
It's kind of like.
I like brian,

2000
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:50,700
I like kenny.
I like everybody does,

2001
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,350
but you know,
you're that thing.

2002
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,750
Yeah.
But they could be that thing too,

2003
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,760
you know?
It was really good as dominick cruz.

2004
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,310
Dominick cruz is very good,
very good.

2005
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:03,430
Especially from the technical aspect and
so daniel cormier,

2006
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:04,563
yeah,
I do like both of them when they do it 

2007
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,003
for,
for me is also spent so much time doing 

2008
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:09,334
the behind the desk stuff now that he's 
gotten real comfortable with expressing 

2009
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:15,610
himself and like poetic and interesting 
ways.

2010
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,841
You know,
like his,

2011
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:18,940
like when he's describing fights and 
fight,

2012
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:21,550
he gets hyped up about.
Has got great emotion to it.

2013
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,550
It's entertaining as well as isn't 
fighting anthony soon.

2014
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,550
Yeah.
He's fighting rumble rematch,

2015
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,140
excited,
rumble.

2016
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:31,990
Man's coming.
So scary.

2017
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,893
He is a very scary,
so scary at the fights in the audience 

2018
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:39,010
and I smiled because they're 
acknowledged like,

2019
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:40,290
hey man,
I need.

2020
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,124
Yeah,
he did not fucking smile but a bad 

2021
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,570
motherfucker that run.
It wasn't like,

2022
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:44,590
I hate you.
It was just like,

2023
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,420
fuck you smiling it.
Now he's a good guy,

2024
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:47,310
man.
Rumbles.

2025
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,850
A good guy.
Very good guy.

2026
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:49,684
And I'm like that.
But I gave him a smile and a nod and I 

2027
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:54,880
got to.
It's almost like he's got different kind

2028
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:59,010
of bones,
like everybody else has bones that bruce

2029
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:02,250
settled in the way he looks.
No,

2030
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,440
it looked like his face.

2031
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,680
I don't know why.
And just looking at and pick.

2032
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,760
I was picture bruce selden.
That's weird.

2033
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,100
Maybe of.
no.

2034
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:11,570
Absolutely.
You know I'm a racist.

2035
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:15,660
of course I am.
I hate everybody know.

2036
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,840
Well,
rumble is a unique specimen.

2037
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,273
It's just so hard to believe that he was
a 170 pounder for so long and it was 

2038
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:26,090
killing themselves to make that one 70 
goes up to two.

2039
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:28,310
Oh fIve.
And is one of the scariest guys

2040
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,710
ever.
Yeah.

2041
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,613
He said the scariest guys of all time 
and I don't even know how he made one 

2042
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:35,870
70.
How the fuck did he make one 70?

2043
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,600
I don't know that.
That's a young man's thing.

2044
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,320
There's anthony.
Yeah.

2045
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:45,320
He doesn't look anything like Bruce 
Bruce sound and let's see.

2046
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,510
Maybe not that picture.
No picture.

2047
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:51,050
Very seldom rate.
I'm not kidding.

2048
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:51,884
There's a picture.
There's a picture of bruce elden where 

2049
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:55,700
he looks really dark and that's not it.
Look,

2050
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:56,534
hey,
look at that picture up there on the 

2051
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,733
right.
Seldom see the one where he's wearing 

2052
01:26:58,401 --> 01:26:59,900
the red and white trunks?
Yeah.

2053
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:01,120
Oh,
okay.

2054
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,620
No,
you're racist.

2055
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:10,080
That's me guys.
But we've got to remember.

2056
01:27:10,081 --> 01:27:10,140
Yeah,

2057
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:12,120
rumble survived that storm the first 
time.

2058
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,673
You know,
the first fight that rumble and dc had 

2059
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:19,500
cormay survived.
Survived that storm and then put his own

2060
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,720
storm on rumble.
You know me a is a,

2061
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:25,260
he's such a world class wrestler and 
he's just,

2062
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,123
he's his,
his sparring partner is fucking cain 

2063
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,450
velasquez.
And the other one is luke rockhold.

2064
01:27:30,451 --> 01:27:31,284
So I'm going to daily.
He's sparrIng with those fucking guys 

2065
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:37,710
and they go hard and he's arguably one 
of the best wrestlers to ever compete in

2066
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:38,544
mma.
There's like a handful of guys you look 

2067
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:43,590
at as being in contention for being the 
best wrestler to ever competed in mma.

2068
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,510
Henry cejudo,
of course,

2069
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,460
olympic gold medalists.
Now there's a few guys,

2070
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:51,930
but cormier is in that mix,
like he's in the mix.

2071
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,700
I mean they all give each other 
something else.

2072
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:54,983
So that's uh,
and I think that fucking aka camp where 

2073
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,010
it's him and came and they just smashing
heads together all the time.

2074
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,870
You know,
it's funny when I'm up in northern cali,

2075
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:07,180
I'll call whoever and I'm like,
hey,

2076
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:07,820
I'm out here.
And they're like,

2077
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,950
you want to come train?
And I'm like,

2078
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,223
no,
no,

2079
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,290
they're going to come train at aka.
No thanks.

2080
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14,650
I'll call it called gill.
And he's like,

2081
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:16,010
you want to come by scrap pack and 
train.

2082
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:16,391
I'm like,
nah,

2083
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,224
I'm good.
But like my level is not anywhere near 

2084
01:28:20,321 --> 01:28:21,470
anybody's level.
Yeah.

2085
01:28:21,471 --> 01:28:22,304
I'm just trying to hold,
get someone to hold pads 46 year old 

2086
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:25,840
man.
I'm not trying to.

2087
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:28,060
I'm a chubby fucking indian guy.
I'm not trying to.

2088
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:30,100
it's fun to be around those places 
though.

2089
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,360
Yeah,
that's what,

2090
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,430
that's what does,
when you go and you see everybody go,

2091
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:34,360
yeah,
I'm not,

2092
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,070
I'm not built for this.
yeah,

2093
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,630
I'm,
I'm a hobbyist.

2094
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,130
These,
these guys are lifers.

2095
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,520
You have to have the most insane 
dedication,

2096
01:28:42,521 --> 01:28:43,354
I think for any athletic endeavor.
I think below 40 and I would have gone 

2097
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,610
and trained with them,
but I didn't know them then.

2098
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,473
So

2099
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:53,450
what's just a weird thing to dabble in?
Like dabbling in mma?

2100
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:56,830
It's be really can't do it.
You have to be.

2101
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,160
Unless you're some freak athlete.
There's always exceptions.

2102
01:29:00,161 --> 01:29:01,720
There's always people that just 
ridiculous.

2103
01:29:01,721 --> 01:29:05,490
F like apparently that's what jon jones 
was for the longest time before he moved

2104
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:06,324
to albuquerque.
He would take time off and go back to 

2105
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:09,390
New York and,
you know,

2106
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,550
train some out there but not trained 
with anybody.

2107
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,470
Like uh,
the people who's training with,

2108
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,360
you know,
forest fights.

2109
01:29:15,361 --> 01:29:17,280
Everybody's out there in albuquerque 
now.

2110
01:29:17,281 --> 01:29:18,180
Try it again.
Yeah.

2111
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,610
Well he moved there and then once he 
moved there,

2112
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:22,620
I mean I think everything went up to the
next level,

2113
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:23,873
but he's,
he was a guy that could take all that 

2114
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:27,060
time off,
come back and still fuck everybody up.

2115
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:30,770
Just just a freak athlete.
Is he as well?

2116
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:32,160
So they lifted his band or.

2117
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,480
I don't know,
man.

2118
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,320
I don't think you'd Be.
They sentenced him if he got sentenced,

2119
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:41,040
sentenced conner $150,000
for a fucking water bottle.

2120
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:42,240
Yeah,
that seemed a little access.

2121
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,270
A tiny bit,
huh?

2122
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,600
Why they do that?
Well,

2123
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:45,443
it's not like he's a habitual bottle 
thrower that we are finally punishing 

2124
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:50,670
you for this.
I'm sick of all of that bottle.

2125
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:55,200
Throwing row is a stupid thing to do 
though.

2126
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,940
And it was a.
I mean,

2127
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:58,013
come on.
Do you really think he going to hit 

2128
01:29:58,501 --> 01:29:59,700
them?
You know,

2129
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,710
it's too far away.
It wasn't.

2130
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,573
I thought it was just hyped for the 
fight and it's just how I ended up 

2131
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:06,020
finding a friend.
Like you threw a glass bottle.

2132
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:06,854
He threw a fucking water.
Refuses to fight in las vegas after 

2133
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,500
$150,000.
Fine.

2134
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:11,334
That's fair enough.
Well it's a good thing to get the vegas 

2135
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:16,260
people to recognize there's consequences
to this.

2136
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:21,260
But the ufc so big right now they sell 
out no matter who's fighting.

2137
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,350
But yeah,
the ones 50 hours of community service.

2138
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,480
Wow.
Fifty hours is a real weak.

2139
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,510
So weak were the work flux you got to 
do.

2140
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,650
Yeah.
I don't know.

2141
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,030
That's fucking ridiculous,
you know,

2142
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:36,243
flex and flex and they really shouldn't 
have thrown water bottles at each other 

2143
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:42,330
and monster energy drinks or whatever 
they did that shit stupid.

2144
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:45,570
You've got to fight eventually throw 
things at each other.

2145
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:47,123
You know,
you get a little amped up their young 

2146
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:49,224
kids,
you know,

2147
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,310
but ultimately I think $150,000
fine is worth it for them.

2148
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,070
The amount of money that they all made 
that everybody made,

2149
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,931
you know,
so the,

2150
01:30:56,931 --> 01:31:01,350
the government,
the athletic commission gets to step in,

2151
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:04,560
slapping a little bit,
take a little cash,

2152
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,180
make a,
make a stink out of it.

2153
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,560
They get to protest it.

2154
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,543
But the fact is that that press 
conference where he threw that water 

2155
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:14,850
bottle at nate diaz is probably worth 
$400,000

2156
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,390
as far as profit.
You know,

2157
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,990
how many more people got hyped up for 
it?

2158
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:21,150
People love a fight at a press 
conference.

2159
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:23,100
They love when someone throws.
Don't do it.

2160
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:24,060
Folks,
if you're listening,

2161
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,163
jon jones and daniel cormier,
that was one of the reasons why that 

2162
01:31:27,121 --> 01:31:29,440
fight became such a big deal because at 
the face off,

2163
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,200
did they have to pay any fines after?
Fuck yeah,

2164
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:32,460
they did.
Yeah,

2165
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,380
they did.
I don't know how much they paid.

2166
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:35,910
Well,
maybe that's what the problem is.

2167
01:31:35,911 --> 01:31:38,010
Maybe they want to discourage anybody 
from doing this further.

2168
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,640
Maybe they want to say it's as oldest 
fight at any fight game is and it's also

2169
01:31:42,641 --> 01:31:43,474
a real.
Like the John Jones one in particular 

2170
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:47,003
was fucking real.
When daniel put his hand on john's neck 

2171
01:31:49,981 --> 01:31:51,720
and pushed him back,
john was like,

2172
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:52,440
fuck that.

2173
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,000
That's just,
that's just not happening.

2174
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:58,540
He didn't give a shit if there was a 
million people around 50,000.

2175
01:31:58,630 --> 01:31:59,980
Yeah.
So john was fine.

2176
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:00,814
$50,000
and was ordered to complete 40 hours of 

2177
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:05,610
community service and cormier was fine.
$9,000

2178
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,290
in order to complete 20 hours of 
community service.

2179
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:12,710
So they made a distinction that core me 
a was less guilty than john,

2180
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:18,300
but cormier touched him first.
Did he?

2181
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,233
yeah.
He grabbed his neck and pushed him back 

2182
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:20,884
because john got face to face with them 
and touch bases with the fines 

2183
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,493
constituted 10th,
10 percent of each fighters respect 

2184
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:30,130
purse for the January 3rd fight.
Wow.

2185
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:32,110
That doesn't.
That doesn't even make sense.

2186
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,910
Little,
that's how little they made because that

2187
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:34,744
really makes sense.
Night 90 grand really for the title 

2188
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:39,760
fight it,
man.

2189
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,623
That sounds crazy.
I don't know what their deal is because 

2190
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,624
they get paid and then they have like 
they have like a reported pay and then 

2191
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:50,610
they have a different pay like 
percentage of paper views and a bunch of

2192
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:51,453
different stuff,
but they always show it in the papers 

2193
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,700
and they don't show locker room bonuses.

2194
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,520
I don't know what that means.
They do show get mad at me when you show

2195
01:32:57,521 --> 01:32:58,280
it.
Whereas if you go,

2196
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,240
if you go to a I fall,
we're going to have to go to yahoo news.

2197
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:04,390
It tells you the whole purse breakdowns 
for everybody and then the bonus for the

2198
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:06,510
nightly bonus and the percentage bonus.
No,

2199
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,160
they do performance of the night bonuses
that make that public,

2200
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:09,994
but they also do some weird locker room 
bonus thing that I don't know what the 

2201
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:14,344
fuck that's all about.
It's what did they do to private 

2202
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:18,580
companies?
The point,

2203
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,790
and it may just find roy as well.
Yeah,

2204
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,560
they going to find it.
What did he say?

2205
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,403
What'd you just put up

2206
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:24,913
is jones' attorney was arguing that they
shouldn't be paying off a percentage of 

2207
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:28,463
the,
of their purses and courtney a is 

2208
01:33:31,221 --> 01:33:35,240
scheduled to make a base pay of 90 for 
the fight and also possible $90,000

2209
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,330
bonus.
So

2210
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,280
seems like a really low amounT.
I don't know.

2211
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,870
It feels.
It feels like that's not right.

2212
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:42,713
It's 10 percent.
I know what it's so low to be fighting 

2213
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:49,440
for the world title seems wrong.
I mean it seems incorrect.

2214
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:51,800
Seems wrong to write it.
Seeing it all,

2215
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:55,140
it's always seemed wrong to me at the 
highest levels.

2216
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,980
Those guys are making some serious cash.
Now what's interesting is how many,

2217
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,710
how many people are going to reach that 
level and what you're seeing is a lot of

2218
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:02,544
people that are trying to sort of 
generate public interest the same way 

2219
01:34:06,091 --> 01:34:06,924
conor stone.
So there's like guys who really never 

2220
01:34:08,431 --> 01:34:09,740
really trashed,
talked before.

2221
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,120
We're really in a trash talking.
They're not good at it.

2222
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:12,850
What?
It's.

2223
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:17,400
It's awkward and it's uncomfortable.
And here's the thing is if you were,

2224
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,234
if your economy mcgregor and it comes 
natural and that's what you do and 

2225
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,720
that's one thing,
but if you're like you've got a strategy

2226
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,583
and your strategy is to be the 
controversial guy and you're going to 

2227
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,440
get everybody to pay attention to you.
Like,

2228
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:30,510
whoa,
that's a lot of work,

2229
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:31,410
man.
I mean,

2230
01:34:31,411 --> 01:34:33,550
nate is what nate is.
Yeah,

2231
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,553
exactly.
So in on one hand it's also not what 

2232
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:43,200
martial arts are at their best,
like at the very best,

2233
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:44,573
they're two guys who want to compete and
test themselves against each other at 

2234
01:34:49,831 --> 01:34:51,750
the very highest level.
RIght?

2235
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,613
And when we think of a martial artist,
we don't think of some dude who's 

2236
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,980
insulting and spitting

2237
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,813
on them and throwing water bombing they,
they're trying to take the thug aspect 

2238
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:02,630
out of it,
which is fair.

2239
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,210
When you think of,
when you think back to what it was,

2240
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:06,044
I was Bruce Lee,
everybody respecting and bowing and you 

2241
01:35:08,631 --> 01:35:09,770
know,
yeah,

2242
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:10,780
now it's just,
you know,

2243
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:12,710
a lot of meatheads who know how to 
fight.

2244
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,690
you know,
there's definitely that too.

2245
01:35:14,691 --> 01:35:18,680
But to achieve the level of like a world
class level,

2246
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:21,560
you have to have so much control over 
who you are.

2247
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:22,783
You have to be able to figure out where 
all your personality pitfalls are and 

2248
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:30,260
sooth out all the bullshit in your life 
and concentrate on the work.

2249
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,650
It's such a weird sport,
man.

2250
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:38,000
There's no sport that carries the 
consequences of Loss.

2251
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:43,270
Like mma does a boxIng as well.
Boxing is pretty close.

2252
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,153
But mma,
like I think in mma you can have a loss 

2253
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:54,020
and still come back and it doesn't 
affect you that much.

2254
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,210
You think it doesn't box and boxing 
because it's so fucking shady.

2255
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,390
Inboxing.
Oh,

2256
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:01,341
he lost.
No.

2257
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:02,480
Good.
we need somebody else,

2258
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:03,710
a,
a,

2259
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:05,960
a,
an undefeated record,

2260
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:09,110
and boxing means a lot more than it does
in mma.

2261
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:10,640
Well,
there's only been a few,

2262
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:11,300
right,
right.

2263
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:15,770
That's what everybody strives for.
They strive for that gennady golovkin.

2264
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:17,683
Perfect.
undefeated record as they go Into the 

2265
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:21,250
big fight,
you know,

2266
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:23,383
but that didn't harm canelo I think 
canelo stock rose in the floyd 

2267
01:36:26,631 --> 01:36:27,690
mayweather fight.
yeah,

2268
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:32,450
because he was so young and I honest,
I was at that fight as a matter of fact,

2269
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:33,284
and I think that floyd could have 
stopped canelo in that fight if he 

2270
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,190
really wanted to.
You think so?

2271
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,890
Yeah.
He was just hitting them at will and you

2272
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:40,724
could see canelo going back.
I mean all he had to do was just put a 

2273
01:36:42,561 --> 01:36:43,640
little bit more pressure on them.

2274
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:48,020
But I think floyd being somewhat 
compassionate was like,

2275
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:49,270
man,
if I stopped this kid a little,

2276
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:50,480
it might ruin his career.
So.

2277
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,770
Wow.
You really think that?

2278
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:52,940
I think that.
Wow,

2279
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:54,260
that's an interesting way of looking at 
it.

2280
01:36:54,261 --> 01:36:58,310
I didn't think so.
I thought he's not taking any chances.

2281
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:59,263
He's boxing smart and canelo can still 
pop and he carries that populate into 

2282
01:37:03,501 --> 01:37:04,334
the fight and he's dangerous.
So if floyd opened up to try to really 

2283
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,473
hurt him and stop him,
he ran the risk of being countered a 

2284
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,770
master.
He's very,

2285
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,520
he's canelo is not as fast as floyd,
but his timing's really good.

2286
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,373
He said it is,
but at that time he was still very 

2287
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:21,290
green.
Floyd really was in the,

2288
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,880
in the zone,
in that fight.

2289
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:24,320
He was just hItting them pop,
pop,

2290
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,243
pop,
pop,

2291
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,410
and then he would hit crank or right 
hand on them.

2292
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:29,660
You see canelo go back a little bit,
you know,

2293
01:37:29,661 --> 01:37:32,890
I think canelo's chin's a little 
overrated a really.

2294
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,230
we saw that when,
uh,

2295
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,910
who the fuck knocked them down and like 
the first or second round one fight.

2296
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:39,763
Yeah.
Somebody knocked him down fairly 

2297
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:41,324
recently.
Right now maybe about around four or 

2298
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:46,160
five fights ago,
maybe before three,

2299
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:47,660
four years ago.
Yeah.

2300
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:50,660
It was a younger canelo then.
But um,

2301
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:51,460
do you what I'm talking about?
No,

2302
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,293
I don't.
I definitely don't think he has a bad 

2303
01:37:53,061 --> 01:37:54,950
chin.
But anybody can get knocked down.

2304
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,320
Especially early in your career,
you know,

2305
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,163
especially progressive guys also heard 
that canelo sparred with golovkin 

2306
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:03,000
before.
Oh yeah,

2307
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,530
go off.
Can beat the piss out of him.

2308
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:07,380
Inspiring.
And that's why he's saying no thanks.

2309
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:09,530
Not interested in that.
Just trying to.

2310
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:10,403
I think he's just trying to sharpen up 
his skillset before he gets back in 

2311
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:13,120
there with him.

2312
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,120
Yeah man.
I don't know how many triple g knockdown

2313
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,410
kovalev inspiring diddy.
I had heard that.

2314
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:20,730
yeah,
he said it.

2315
01:38:20,731 --> 01:38:21,564
He goes,
you know,

2316
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,660
he hits really hard because I wasn't 
prepared that day.

2317
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:28,050
But wow.
Said there are also very good friends as

2318
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:30,900
well.
Golovkin scary guy because he looks like

2319
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:33,740
some cute little boy band.
He does not look like you can do.

2320
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:34,574
It.
Doesn't even look like a throws with 

2321
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:35,934
power.
It looks like he's from a russian boy 

2322
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:40,890
band.
So he just so goofy.

2323
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,570
Yeah,
he's adorable.

2324
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,660
And if you look at his body,
it's not the scariest body.

2325
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:49,470
It's just not chiseled.
It's just he's a thin guy.

2326
01:38:50,210 --> 01:38:52,470
She rumbled knocking people out.
You look at his body go,

2327
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,180
well that make sense.
You know,

2328
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,700
you see glove can knocking people out 
and you go,

2329
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:57,930
wow,
where's that coming from?

2330
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:59,790
I don't know that she doesn't have a 
huge legs.

2331
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,960
He doesn't have a particularly big 
traps.

2332
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,420
Sees.
he jumped there.

2333
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,520
He's got flawless technique though 
flawless.

2334
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:10,630
We had over 300 amateur fights,
you know,

2335
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:14,190
he's so aggressive to.
He so fucking,

2336
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:19,550
he's so aggressive and he keeps a pace 
on guys that's very difficult to handle.

2337
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,200
And he also,
you know,

2338
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:22,921
people go,
oh,

2339
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:23,940
he's beatable.
I'm like,

2340
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:27,600
I just think he does things for the 
fight game.

2341
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:30,330
Like I know I can knock you out.
I'm just going to let you.

2342
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:32,340
I'm going to extend this a little bit.
Just give people.

2343
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:33,480
Yeah.
It's almost sets the two,

2344
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:36,540
but you see him do it.
You can see like he basically just,

2345
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:38,010
you know,
I'm going to gEt,

2346
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:39,023
I'm going to make it look like a gun to 
comfortable with you when you know at 

2347
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:42,550
any point and just like,
all right,

2348
01:39:42,551 --> 01:39:43,710
good night,
good night.

2349
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:46,710
You know,
and he could do it at any point while he

2350
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:48,960
definitely,
if he wants to risk getting hit,

2351
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:51,180
but he bleeds guys,
you know,

2352
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,380
he stops them.

2353
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:55,290
He's a left hook to the body,
you know,

2354
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:56,124
he,
he stays on guys with combinations and 

2355
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,820
he's always pressing forward.
Like you never,

2356
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,500
you never rest with that guy.
Yeah.

2357
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:02,610
He doesn't,
he doesn't move back for it.

2358
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:03,444
Yeah.
It's a really interesting style because 

2359
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,380
uh,
another guy who's got a crazy style like

2360
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:09,220
that as was silly.
Lowman chenko oh,

2361
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,073
woman chank was probably one of the best
fighters in the game right now saying 

2362
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:14,850
he's fighting a nicky walters.
Is that his name?

2363
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:17,280
I don't know.
Started the jamaican kid.

2364
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:19,110
Yeah,
that's gonna Be a good fight.

2365
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:21,923
He's another guy that like if you wantEd
to see beautiful technical movement and 

2366
01:40:26,861 --> 01:40:30,410
defensive movement in boxing.
When I was training with a reason,

2367
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:32,490
we would go to training robert garcia's 
jim.

2368
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,473
Oh yeah.
And lowman chanko would Be there every 

2369
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:35,540
now and then.
TheRe he is like,

2370
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:36,374
look at a little guy too.
He's just standing right in front of 

2371
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:39,744
people,
beating them up and slipping everything 

2372
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:44,180
they throw at them.
God is so good,

2373
01:40:44,181 --> 01:40:45,014
slick and accurate.
Look at that moves just enough 

2374
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,170
[inaudible] look at this like knowing 
exactly what's coming and when.

2375
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,003
DamN,
he's

2376
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:57,820
a really interesting fighter as well 
because he's so hard to hit,

2377
01:40:57,830 --> 01:41:02,350
but he's also so aggressive.
It's wEird like that's not hands down,

2378
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,700
hands down,
but he's lost in boxing and pro boxing.

2379
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,820
He lost that mexican dude.
Fuck's his name.

2380
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:17,080
Hoodie moves to lose to a old old 
warrior veteran.

2381
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:23,140
Sully's omar orlando.
That's right.

2382
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,480
Leaders a warrior to.
Yeah.

2383
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,770
A guy's been around forever.
yeah,

2384
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:31,900
it is.
That's what hE's fighting next.

2385
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,870
And nicholas volunteers.
Well,

2386
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:38,470
he's definitely putting some attention 
on these.

2387
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:40,660
A lighter split decisions.
I mean,

2388
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:42,630
you know,
whenever it's a split decision,

2389
01:41:42,631 --> 01:41:43,870
it could be like.
It could have gone either way.

2390
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,573
Yeah.
It was apparently a crazy war and he 

2391
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:47,104
wants to fight him again.
Do you think hendo bisbing should have 

2392
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:53,110
been a draw or a split decision?
I think the scoring system sucks.

2393
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,093
Yeah.
Some people said that that first round 

2394
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:56,530
wasn't a 10,
eight round.

2395
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,240
That wasn't.
That was more than attending.

2396
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,040
That might've been a fucking 10.
Seven around.

2397
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,200
It's definitely a 10.
Eight for sure,

2398
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:04,870
because he knocked him down.
He had him,

2399
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:05,713
brock,
he's standing on top of it and bisping 

2400
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:11,560
survived for sure.
I mean bisbing showed true grit.

2401
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,510
He got through that.
He pressed on,

2402
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:16,950
but he was in a world of shit and I 
think he would admit it.

2403
01:42:16,951 --> 01:42:19,000
It's face shows it.
I mean there's all beat up.

2404
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:21,610
So that's a,
that's a significant round.

2405
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,690
And then there was another round where 
handle knocked him down again,

2406
01:42:25,691 --> 01:42:26,524
right?
yep.

2407
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:30,340
So that was the second or third.
It's hard to tell man,

2408
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:34,870
but the other thing that balance that 
out was that bisping was way more active

2409
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,483
and you got to take that into account.
It's not like bisping was landing all 

2410
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:42,320
those shots and attacking because 
handled.

2411
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:45,700
Let them know because he was imposing 
his game on henderson.

2412
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:50,350
Then the question is like,
is henderson's game more impactful?

2413
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,870
Maybe,
but there's less impacts.

2414
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:53,704
okay.
Well then what about damage or damage 

2415
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:59,530
wise was wiscat?
Gave bisping a first round.

2416
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,500
Who did the first judge white?
No,

2417
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,440
fuck why?
Yeah,

2418
01:43:04,441 --> 01:43:05,230
look,
they all.

2419
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,960
The first one is the top row is the 
second round right here.

2420
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:09,680
Oh,
okay.

2421
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,150
Second round.
There were.

2422
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:12,720
Look,
eVen that guy gave him the first part.

2423
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:14,890
Okay,
so you gave it to him around.

2424
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:15,610
That.
gave a.

2425
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:19,150
henderson was the second.
So then he made the first.

2426
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:22,180
The first two rounds he made the first 
night at 10.

2427
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:23,170
Nine.
Ten,

2428
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:25,020
nine.
Y'all made it a 10.

2429
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:27,250
Nine c.
That'S not smart.

2430
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,230
That's not smart.
That's not right.

2431
01:43:29,231 --> 01:43:30,700
The minute there's a knockdown like 
that,

2432
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:31,840
it's got to be a 10,
eight round.

2433
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:35,680
It's not just a knock down.
It wasn't like a knockdown in boxing.

2434
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:37,950
Makes a 10,
10 round 10.

2435
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,250
Nine route or a 10.
Eight round.

2436
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,020
Yeah.
I give them their evened up.

2437
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:42,940
It'll make it a nine,
nine round,

2438
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:44,620
but for the most part it's a 10,
eight round.

2439
01:43:44,621 --> 01:43:46,060
Right?
A guy knocks the guy down,

2440
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:47,530
knocked down.
You got the first one,

2441
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:48,590
the round,
then you've got the out,

2442
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:52,190
but it's a fact.
There's no facts in mma when it comes to

2443
01:43:52,191 --> 01:43:53,024
that.
There's no like one thing that happens 

2444
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,280
where you definitely take a point off.
We know that with boxing,

2445
01:43:58,281 --> 01:43:59,780
Right?
Well,

2446
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:04,730
with mma that wasn't just a knock down.
There was a knock down and then followed

2447
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:08,420
by some fucking for roche's hair raising
ground impound.

2448
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,640
He got elbowed.
He got punched,

2449
01:44:10,641 --> 01:44:12,690
he got beat up.
He got out of their faces,

2450
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,210
bleeding.
His eyes closed.

2451
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:17,420
You can't say that wasn't close to being
stopped.

2452
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:20,330
You've to you to be on the brink of 
being stopped.

2453
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:25,570
So that round I disagree with across the
board and then it's trying to figure out

2454
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:28,610
who won the other rounds.
There was the other one.

2455
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:33,230
We're hindou heard him.
What brand was that was the second round

2456
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,340
that he heard him again,
you know,

2457
01:44:34,341 --> 01:44:37,010
most things.
So yeah,

2458
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:37,993
the second round he heard them again.
And then do you have to argue about the 

2459
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:43,910
fourth and the fifth rounds?
You have to figure out who knows?

2460
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,210
It's a.
It was a close fight,

2461
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,073
but I could see.
I coulD see the way many people thought 

2462
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:54,590
that bisping lanDed more and even though
they weren't as impactful,

2463
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:55,573
you have to.
You have to add that up against the 

2464
01:44:58,821 --> 01:45:01,790
lower volume,
but more power by henderson.

2465
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:03,530
It's about effectiveness,
right?

2466
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,173
Yeah.
Well see henderson at the end of the 

2467
01:45:06,321 --> 01:45:10,940
fight looked like he just got done 
sparring and bisbing looked like he just

2468
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:12,200
got done with a fight with henderson.

2469
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,980
You know,
we really would have looked lIke he went

2470
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:18,530
through five rounds with one of the 
toughest fucking guys ever.

2471
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:23,090
The question is who want it?
I think the system is flawed.

2472
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:27,590
I could see under the system that we 
have today that bisping won that fight.

2473
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,930
I see it.
I have volume.

2474
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:30,853
Could see it as a draw.
I could see it as a fair draw and I 

2475
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:36,980
could see that too and that would have 
been a very fair outcome.

2476
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:37,963
I can see that too.
I definitely don't think there's been 

2477
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:43,610
good enough to beat dan and I don't 
think dan did enough to beat bisping.

2478
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:46,430
That's a good argument.
It's a real good argument and I think if

2479
01:45:46,431 --> 01:45:49,730
there's ever a fight where you could say
a draw might be justified,

2480
01:45:49,731 --> 01:45:51,200
that's one.
If you look online,

2481
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:54,410
like people think bisbing one versus 
people think henderson one,

2482
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:57,860
it's pretty much split down the middle 
except english people of course.

2483
01:45:58,580 --> 01:45:59,413
AnD even american people.
There's a lot of american people that 

2484
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:03,230
think bisbing one.
So,

2485
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,150
uh,
it's,

2486
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,710
it's a,
it's a flawed system.

2487
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,890
The system's going judge.
Uh,

2488
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:11,180
uh,
what's it called?

2489
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,150
Medical suspension.
Yeah.

2490
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:16,070
Fuck.
That ain't good for you online.

2491
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:17,580
Well,
they looked at fighting.

2492
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,050
Let's settle down.
Everybody relax for a little while.

2493
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:23,540
Was you just went to war with a fucking 
meat machine,

2494
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,333
like a cleaver who was telling me that a
henderson and we're hanging out and 

2495
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:33,950
having just punched him like as a joke 
because he hits a whole fucking hard.

2496
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,001
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2497
01:46:35,001 --> 01:46:35,751
It was like,
wow,

2498
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:38,840
what the fuck did.
I don't think it makes sense.

2499
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,160
He's just got one of those weird frames.
There's some people that just have power

2500
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:45,330
that just doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.

2501
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,870
Just like regular power and then,
you know,

2502
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:50,160
there's that henderson,
that rumble thing.

2503
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,193
Yeah.
I need to step in and crank the right 

2504
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:55,080
way in order to get power.
I don't have that.

2505
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:57,420
Just I'm going to hit you and you're 
going to feel power.

2506
01:46:57,430 --> 01:47:00,390
It's dino's got it.
That's scary that john linacre kid,

2507
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,940
that little guy,
he used to fight at 1:25

2508
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:03,931
and now,
uh,

2509
01:47:03,931 --> 01:47:05,670
he's fight.
He fought at 1:35

2510
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:06,504
in his last fight,
but ms dot weight and beat John Dodson 

2511
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:11,910
and literally close decision.
But he's a,

2512
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,620
he's got that weird,
spooky power for a little guy for 1:35.

2513
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:17,454
It's kind of read through the little 
guys that have that have some heavy 

2514
01:47:18,811 --> 01:47:19,644
hands and he's got the heaviest,
heaviest I've ever seen in this 

2515
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:22,884
division.
He's a clobber who just gets guys up 

2516
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:27,170
against the cage and just clobbered 
them.

2517
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,540
And it's one of those things where when 
they feel the power of the first time he

2518
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:34,290
could see in their eyes like,
holy wouldn't golovkin hits somebody see

2519
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:35,310
it in their face immediately.

2520
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,560
And I've never seen people wince until 
they got hit by him.

2521
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,140
Yeah,
he's something special for sure.

2522
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,003
People,
every time they get hit and you look at 

2523
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:42,361
her face,
oh,

2524
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:43,194
what the fuck do you know?
His boxing fights don't have much paY 

2525
01:47:44,721 --> 01:47:46,850
per view buys though,
because it's not,

2526
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,930
you know,
that's crazy to me though.

2527
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:50,490
He's,
he's so exciting.

2528
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:52,110
He's exciting.
But there,

2529
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,423
you know,
he's with tom loffler and who's tom 

2530
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:56,394
loffler?
That's his promoter and it was just 

2531
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:59,100
promoter fuck up.
No,

2532
01:47:59,101 --> 01:48:01,410
it just that tom Walker does not have 
the connections.

2533
01:48:01,411 --> 01:48:06,411
I think that bob arum or,
or a fucking floyd made with heR.

2534
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:07,710
Uh,
yeah.

2535
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:09,540
What's his name there?
Al haymon has.

2536
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:10,890
Well golden boy,
right?

2537
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:14,340
Golden boy and rochdale oscar de la 
hoya.

2538
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,253
And then there's ain't no,
but alan hayman's the guy really who's 

2539
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:21,330
got all the connects and I like how they
take in fighters there too.

2540
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:25,440
Like bernard hopkins is one of the 
partners over there and it's a.

2541
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:26,543
They seem to do a good job.
What's a crazy thing to go from being a 

2542
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:31,890
fighter to being a promoter.
Yeah.

2543
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:34,140
And then realizing you're making way 
more money as a promoter.

2544
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,071
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2545
01:48:35,071 --> 01:48:36,900
Not in the line of fire at all.
They're like,

2546
01:48:36,901 --> 01:48:37,734
this is bullshit.
I think hopkins is going to take one 

2547
01:48:39,001 --> 01:48:40,290
more fight though.
Yeah,

2548
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,213
I think so.
Just to get it out of the garden at 

2549
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:43,560
least 50,
right?

2550
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:47,160
He's 51 this yeaR now or the next year.
Incredible.

2551
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:51,750
Never been out of shape though.
I know he needs a super,

2552
01:48:51,751 --> 01:48:52,584
super disciplined guy,
but it's just amazing that he's willing 

2553
01:48:54,391 --> 01:48:56,690
to do one more fight at this age.
And,

2554
01:48:56,730 --> 01:49:00,840
and then of course,
being a successful promoter now you know

2555
01:49:00,841 --> 01:49:03,060
that you don't leave fighting,
fighting,

2556
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:03,993
you know,
hopkins or 52nd fight before my 52nd 

2557
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:07,170
birthday.

2558
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:10,470
January is who's gonna say how's he 
going to do that?

2559
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:11,990
Who is he going to say?
December.

2560
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,740
Somewhere in la.
Probably at the forum.

2561
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:15,390
December in la.
Dude,

2562
01:49:15,391 --> 01:49:16,880
we should go.
I man,

2563
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:19,340
it'd be the last time bernard hopkins 
ever fights.

2564
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,290
We should go telecast.
Dude.

2565
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:25,290
We got to go over.
I want to be there for that long is.

2566
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,230
Oh,
I was uh,

2567
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:29,520
I was at that sillitoe takashi.
More fight.

2568
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:31,860
So that's going to be.
What date is it?

2569
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:37,430
December.
Say it could take place at this one.

2570
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:40,160
It says it doesn't have a date on it.
Okay.

2571
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,880
No,
they're having a rematch again.

2572
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,650
Who?
Salito takashi moira.

2573
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,490
Oh really?
Right.

2574
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,390
Let's just start this fight.

2575
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:51,703
Orlando salido,
who's the first guy to beat low and 

2576
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:56,990
chanko yet this week,
so October 12th.

2577
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,760
INteresting.
Well,

2578
01:49:59,120 --> 01:49:59,953
you know,
I always look back to when bernard 

2579
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:02,600
hopkins fought tito trinidad.

2580
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:06,130
Oh yeah.
Through the flag down in puerto rico and

2581
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:09,310
they.
They wanted to kill him and I was like,

2582
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,140
oh,
I think I remember that time was a trend

2583
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:14,090
that is going to knock him out.
They stopped trinidad.

2584
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,960
He beat the shit out of trend dad.
He didn't just beat the shit out of him.

2585
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:19,290
He boxes face off before he beat the 
shit out of him.

2586
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:20,373
Wasn't at hopkins,
I think it was hopkins that I'm almost 

2587
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:26,470
sure it was hopkins.
He had a fight.

2588
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,593
This was in probably the late nineties.
The guy somehow got under him and body 

2589
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:38,350
slammed him and he dislocated his 
shoulder and they were like,

2590
01:50:38,351 --> 01:50:40,680
we could stop the fight and you could 
win by ignore decision because.

2591
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:42,390
Nope,
it was.

2592
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:44,590
He dislocated his right hand.
His right shoulder.

2593
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,130
Yeah.

2594
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:46,790
Well,
didn't eat.

2595
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:48,020
No,
I don't remember that.

2596
01:50:48,021 --> 01:50:51,320
I remember one time he wasn't gonna get 
thrown out.

2597
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:54,110
He dislocated his shoulder and they 
stopped the fight.

2598
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:55,993
No,
they stopped the fIght because of him 

2599
01:50:57,291 --> 01:50:58,124
getting thrown out of the ring.
Maybe you got thrown othering more than 

2600
01:50:59,391 --> 01:50:59,920
once.

2601
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,720
Yeah.
I think this was against antwan eccles,

2602
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,400
if I'm not mistaken.
Hm.

2603
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:06,650
Why knew he got thrown out of the ring 
against one guy?

2604
01:51:06,651 --> 01:51:11,080
I remember he showed shoulder dislocated
and then he still went next round and he

2605
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,640
stopped him with his left hand.
Really?

2606
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:13,391
Yeah,
man.

2607
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:16,180
I don't remember that at all.
It might not have been hopkins,

2608
01:51:16,181 --> 01:51:17,940
but I remember this one.
Was it?

2609
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,160
Was it Chad dawson?
The dawson do that against.

2610
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:22,541
No,
no,

2611
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:23,980
it was.
It was definitely not Chad,

2612
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,510
Chad dawson's and other guy.

2613
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:29,430
Well,
whoever it was

2614
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:33,650
for antwan echoes being in the mix and 
name is spelled a n,

2615
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:34,670
t w

2616
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:38,540
and hopkins shoulder hurt after dawson 
throws him down.

2617
01:51:38,541 --> 01:51:39,374
Fight ends in the.

2618
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,390
Okay.
Yeah,

2619
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,930
that's what it is.
So yeah,

2620
01:51:43,931 --> 01:51:44,950
it was Chad dawson,

2621
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,470
but I feel like.
No.

2622
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,550
See it said it was Chad dawson,
but it was.

2623
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:50,743
He'd also had this happen before.
Before this fight because Chad dawson 

2624
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:58,100
was fairly recently.
It was like in the later.

2625
01:51:58,130 --> 01:51:59,660
The late nineties.
Yeah,

2626
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:02,480
exactly.
When hopkins was not a

2627
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,960
just located.
Yeah,

2628
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,970
it was just.
If you just google hopkins record.

2629
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,093
Yeah.
this is not an exciting podcast to 

2630
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:15,484
listen to while we're googling bernard 
hopkins record so we can remember my 

2631
01:52:20,061 --> 01:52:21,670
shit.
THe bed on the joe rogan experience.

2632
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,440
I don't think it was a loss.
I think it was okay.

2633
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:27,750
It was a.
Did he fight antwan echols?

2634
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,700
See if you find the right there.
All right.

2635
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:32,690
Down there.
Antwan eccles tko 11 mm.

2636
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,290
Maybe that was the second fight

2637
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,330
because whoever,
whoever threw him down.

2638
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,790
He fought him twice.
Whoever threw him down.

2639
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,310
So it was back in the beat their ass.

2640
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,080
Yeah,
cdc it.

2641
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:48,200
What's wrong way?
Look it up a different way.

2642
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:50,900
Jamie's going to look it up a different 
way.

2643
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:55,220
I remember seeing it on espn.
Canelo and gennady.

2644
01:52:55,221 --> 01:52:57,560
Golovkin though would break the bank.
Oh yeah.

2645
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,633
Maybe go off.
Ken needs to get lIke one more big ass 

2646
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:03,140
fight.
He's supposed to be fun.

2647
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:04,700
Danny jacobs.
Oh really?

2648
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:06,770
In january and december.
There was a purse bed.

2649
01:53:06,771 --> 01:53:07,910
Just know.
Oh yeah.

2650
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,280
Purse bed.
Personally.

2651
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,320
Get.
Look at you,

2652

dj world.

2653
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:14,270
You know how I get down,

2654
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,550

Get down buddy.

2655
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:21,470
What are the good fIghts are happening 
right now in boxing?

2656
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,270
Oh,
andre ward.

2657
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:24,390
Andre ward.
Kovalev.

2658
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:27,050
Yeah.
And I'm in fucking toronto that night.

2659
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:29,090
God damn it.
You wanted to be there.

2660
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,700
Live that one through.
Is that one in vegas?

2661
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:32,720
Yeah.
T mobile.

2662
01:53:32,721 --> 01:53:37,010
I believe I'm going to cover up on that.
The good fight.

2663
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:38,570
Very good fight.
I don't think,

2664
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:39,404
uh,
I don't think andrea has the power to 

2665
01:53:40,221 --> 01:53:43,820
hurt kovalev do you think it's because 
he's going up to 75?

2666
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,610
One 75 and to me it's not.
Look that impressive.

2667
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:51,100
And once every five we only had one 
fight at one 75 to two at two.

2668
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:53,240
Oh,
I thought he just had one and uh,

2669
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:55,250
he doesn't hit very hard.
Who do you find it?

2670
01:53:55,251 --> 01:53:56,084
One 75.
Before that I found a dominican guy waS 

2671
01:53:59,301 --> 01:54:02,930
at that fight and that was in on 
ontario,

2672
01:54:02,931 --> 01:54:05,120
California.
And uh,

2673
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:07,910
I don't know,
maybe that was at one 68,

2674
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:08,744
but whatever it was,
he,

2675
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,040
he's fought twice now.

2676
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:11,323
Yeah.
It's hard when a guy has to figure out 

2677
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:16,610
what to do to order to make the big 
bucks and you've got to take a chance.

2678
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:18,920
And andrea is dominating.
It's 68.

2679
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,200
He's just such a good boxer,
man.

2680
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,120
They're smart dude.
You know,

2681
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:26,060
he fought a bIg portion of his career 
with a fucked up shoulder.

2682
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,710
I did not know that.
Yeah,

2683
01:54:27,711 --> 01:54:29,990
he had to get fucked up.
I or something.

2684
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:32,690
I don't know about that,
but he had to have been.

2685
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:34,580
The shoulder is getting mixed up with xy
maybe.

2686
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:38,510
But he finally had shoulder surgery like
two years ago.

2687
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:41,270
He had to take a full,
almost like a full year off.

2688
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:42,493
Yeah.
He took a lot of time off shoulder 

2689
01:54:44,121 --> 01:54:45,600
surgeries like that.
He,

2690
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:49,790
he's had a lot of years off.
He keeps getting too much time off.

2691
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:53,450
As far as I'm concerned.
I mean inferior like a mean boss.

2692
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:54,283
I am.
If you're at the concern as far as I'm 

2693
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:57,410
concerned that if you have the primary I
Korea,

2694
01:54:57,411 --> 01:55:00,760
you need to be in the primary career.
Yeah,

2695
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,440
but if you got a jack shoulders,
not goddamn thing you can do about it.

2696
01:55:03,441 --> 01:55:05,390
True little rotator cuff.
Never hurt.

2697
01:55:05,391 --> 01:55:08,570
Nobody heard.
A lot of people they boxers.

2698
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,880
It's really common.
They get shoulder injuries,

2699
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:15,390
but I'm from overextending from modern 
things,

2700
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:16,523
just sparring and I know guys that have 
had their biceps torn off because there 

2701
01:55:20,741 --> 01:55:24,080
were sparring and they threw a punch and
someone blocked the punch,

2702
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:24,943
like an got in the way and just the full
extension being caught like halfway and 

2703
01:55:28,551 --> 01:55:29,384
then pop.
TheY got a torn bicep tendon and that's 

2704
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:34,190
why I don't know guys.
Well,

2705
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,490
if you do a lot of curls,
you really should be careful because you

2706
01:55:37,491 --> 01:55:38,324
can break that thing and when it breaks 
it pulls up and not like you never seen 

2707
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,950
matt serra's harm.

2708
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,300
No.
That's hers.

2709
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:48,600
Got one bicep that broke and then curled
up.

2710
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:50,070
They can't fix it.
Well,

2711
01:55:50,071 --> 01:55:50,904
they could have right after it happened.
Like if you go to the hospital right 

2712
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:54,894
after it happened,
they reattach it and then you could fix 

2713
01:55:56,761 --> 01:55:59,700
it.
It's like an achilles tear almost.

2714
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,883
When your achilles snaps here,
doesn't your ankle just go loose like 

2715
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:06,510
that up like a rubber band?
Well,

2716
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:10,440
it's like that in a way,
but apparently it just looks bad.

2717
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,900
Like iT pulls up and it hangs up there 
and it looks bad,

2718
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:15,130
but it doesn't really affect the 
movement of your arm.

2719
01:56:15,131 --> 01:56:15,964
so a lot of guys don't do anything about
it and they just didn't even get it 

2720
01:56:18,331 --> 01:56:19,164
fixed.
They just leave it with that weird 

2721
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:21,210
lumping.
It doesn't,

2722
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:24,070
it's got to hurt on some level.
Um,

2723
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:25,020
no,
I guess it doesn't,

2724
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,390
not according to matt serra,
you know.

2725
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,880
Well he's the terror.
He is the terror.

2726
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:32,940
But um,
you know,

2727
01:56:32,941 --> 01:56:34,770
there's,
there's not a goddamn thing in the world

2728
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,620
that beats your body up more than mma 
and maybe football.

2729
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:41,260
She knows two thinGs.
I would much rather watch mma.

2730
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:43,440
FooTball,
I don't understand football on any day.

2731
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:45,420
It's because you canadian,
you're luckier here.

2732
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,990
Luckily we let you in.
I know,

2733
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:47,720
I,
you know,

2734
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,630
I really.
Where's that?

2735
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:50,120
Oh,
where's sarah?

2736
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:51,990
Is that it?
Yeah,

2737
01:56:51,991 --> 01:56:54,060
you can see he's missing a chunk of his 
arm,

2738
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:56,400
his bicep,
his right bicep.

2739
01:56:56,401 --> 01:57:00,560
It's like the front part of it from the 
elbow towards the shoulder.

2740
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:02,400
My bicep.
Yeah.

2741
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:06,210
I just got a chunk torn out of it,
but it doesn't affect his movement,

2742
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:07,800
you know?
It's weird.

2743
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,840
It just looks odd,
but that's a.

2744
01:57:11,841 --> 01:57:16,841
That's one that breaks.
The human body is very fucking soft when

2745
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:23,031
it comes to the of the durability of 
animals and they see how fucking goddamn

2746
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:24,540
flimsy.

2747
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,590
We are.
Russell peTers,

2748
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:28,440
they've got it figured out.
Animals.

2749
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:32,530
Do you think figured it out?
They figured out how the.

2750
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:34,470
They know exactly how to stay in their 
lane.

2751
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,450
Yes.
they definitely do that.

2752
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,850
Humans that are always like,
well,

2753
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,833
there's no renaissance animals.
There should be who didn't know 

2754
01:57:43,711 --> 01:57:45,240
everything.
You know,

2755
01:57:45,241 --> 01:57:46,490
they,
they can fly.

2756
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:49,570
They know how to swim like a water.
The renaissance and yeah,

2757
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:52,650
give a hoot.
I was a fucking creeps man.

2758
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,380
I remember when I first moved to 
California and island,

2759
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,850
they're super violent.
Well,

2760
01:57:56,851 --> 01:57:57,980
they're predators.
Yeah.

2761
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,093
When I first moved to California,
I saw an owl that was flying off with a 

2762
01:58:02,101 --> 01:58:06,390
rabbit and dropped the rabbit and a 
because I was,

2763
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:08,100
you know,
he had killed his rabbit,

2764
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:12,930
I guess real close to the road and as I 
was driving he tried to fly off with the

2765
01:58:12,931 --> 01:58:14,820
rabbit and then decided,
fuck this,

2766
01:58:14,821 --> 01:58:17,940
I'm not getting away fast enough and 
just drop the rabbit and then flew.

2767
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:19,073
SO I see him fly off with the rabbit and
his talents and then go fuck this and 

2768
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:27,030
just release it and then boom,
the rabbIt hits the ground.

2769
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,073
So I get out of my car and look at the 
rabbit and the rabbit is just 

2770
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:34,370
eviscerated.
he's just torn its guts out and I'm,

2771
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:38,370
I'm sitting there going like,
this is not what I think of when I think

2772
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:39,560
of an owl.
Yeah,

2773
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:41,883
I think

2774
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:45,730
I didn't even stunk.
I guess I knew they ate rats and rodents

2775
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:46,564
and stuff like that,
but I didn't think they literally will 

2776
01:58:48,341 --> 01:58:50,290
take out something that's their size.

2777
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:51,830
Are they?
They don't play.

2778
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:54,110
They got,
they got big old talents on them.

2779
01:58:54,111 --> 01:58:55,010
That's Why.
Yeah.

2780
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,480
Be in a bad attitude.
Yeah.

2781
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,353
They're fucking cunts.
I sea hawks circling my backyard a lot 

2782
01:59:00,981 --> 01:59:04,040
lately because I have a puppy.
Oh no.

2783
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:05,530
And uh,
and uh,

2784
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:08,510
so what we do is when we see these,
usually it starts with one,

2785
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:10,550
then you see two,
then you see three and four.

2786
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:11,443
jesus.
So I get my assistant to take out his 

2787
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:15,080
drone and he flies it up and scare some.
Oh,

2788
01:59:15,081 --> 01:59:16,440
that's a good mood.
Yeah.

2789
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:19,160
That's a very good move.
Aha.

2790
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:20,023
You fuckers were combating,
you know that they will eat a puppy 

2791
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,393
mill.
These,

2792
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:25,460
what is this macaques?
I think.

2793
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:26,353
Hey,
I'm not looking at your gut monkey's 

2794
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:30,590
mountains.
A small island in Japan where these,

2795
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:33,080
they have this relationship,
I guess where the monkeys.

2796
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:34,550
They're like,
ride the deer.

2797
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,060
Like humans would ride a horse,
shut the fuck.

2798
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:37,953
Kinda like this isn't real.
It definitely is a little humping it 

2799
01:59:40,641 --> 01:59:42,050
right now.
but this is definitely real.

2800
01:59:42,051 --> 01:59:43,070
I looked it up.
they,

2801
01:59:43,071 --> 01:59:45,770
uh,
this might not be riding around so much,

2802
01:59:45,771 --> 01:59:46,604
but they'll pick a like what little 
ticks and shit off parasites and they 

2803
01:59:50,301 --> 01:59:51,134
eat them.
Like they have this weird relationship 

2804
01:59:52,401 --> 01:59:54,350
where like out to happen.
They're like,

2805
01:59:54,351 --> 01:59:55,730
let them run with the rumors

2806
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:59,160

That's just macaque.

2807
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:03,040
My dad's amazing.
Wow.

2808
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,420
So what were were reading his monkey or 
watching other monkey?

2809
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:11,530
Dear mounting in japanese macaques.
I can't believe this man.

2810
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:14,140
I thought this was fake.
This is incredible.

2811
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:16,150
So,
um,

2812
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:18,570
favorite rapper,
tupac macaque fall.

2813
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:20,770
You motherfucker.
How dare you?

2814
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:25,720
he's grooming the deer.
There's another one that I saw.

2815
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:29,200
God damn it.
Now I forget what it was.

2816
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:33,310
I'll just get her shit now.
The one that had to do at the monkeYs.

2817
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:35,020
Oh,
baboons.

2818
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:39,250
Baboons have pet dogs.
I've seen this.

2819
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:42,010
Yeah.
They get dogs as poppy's.

2820
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,460
They raised them and they keep them 
around and security.

2821
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:48,250
And the dogs bark if anything comes 
near.

2822
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:51,340
They raised them like a Wild pat.
Yes.

2823
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:52,720
Deserts.
Pictures,

2824
02:00:52,721 --> 02:00:53,551
videos of this.
Yeah.

2825
02:00:53,551 --> 02:00:55,300
There's a video of it.
It's nuts.

2826
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:59,090
And like the dog doesn't start thinking 
it's a,

2827
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,840
a chimpanzee or a dog.
Acts like a dog.

2828
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:06,420
I go do this.
He's got him.

2829
02:01:06,421 --> 02:01:09,190
He,
he's like holding onto the puppy through

2830
02:01:09,191 --> 02:01:12,040
audio to this.
well,

2831
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:14,770
it,
the video is entitled,

2832
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,990
so he's got the little puppy,
he's holding onto it.

2833
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:18,700
Oh man,
he's rough.

2834
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:20,740
And the way drags that dog around.
Holy shit

2835
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:22,890
called baboons rape,
kidnapping.

2836
02:01:22,891 --> 02:01:24,630
Raised feral dogs as pets.

2837
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:27,670
Yeah,
but they literally raised them as pets.

2838
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:29,680
They beat him down.
They keep them around.

2839
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:30,813
they're holding onto him.
Look at sitting on him and hold it in 

2840
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:35,680
place.
Oh,

2841
02:01:35,681 --> 02:01:38,020
it's fighting against them.
It bites against him.

2842
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:39,760
So he's picking it up and

2843
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,873
forcing it to the ground.
He's holding onto its tail and he drags 

2844
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:48,920
it around like a toy.
Like he has no concern.

2845
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:50,133
There is such a Weird animal,
man that looks like a lion fucked a 

2846
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,640
person.
No,

2847
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:57,950
it doesn't.
It they're so weird.

2848
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,473
I mean is a baboon is one of the 
weirdest fucking animals you'll ever 

2849
02:02:02,181 --> 02:02:03,014
see.
That looks like us in a transitional 

2850
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:05,174
stage in the evolution chart.
Almost like a branch right at one went 

2851
02:02:09,321 --> 02:02:10,154
left,
one went right here because they have 

2852
02:02:12,171 --> 02:02:14,630
that lion tail and that main in the 
front.

2853
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:17,570
Like it's a strange,
strange appearance.

2854
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:22,110
I found this one dude's page.
Um,

2855
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:22,980
I don't know,
uh,

2856
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:23,590
his,
uh,

2857
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:25,380
pages all in arabic.
I don't know what it says,

2858
02:02:25,381 --> 02:02:26,214
but every day is a new and I'm all 
fucking off of an animal video like 

2859
02:02:31,861 --> 02:02:32,694
every day.
And it's overwhelming and following 

2860
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:35,340
them.
Yeah,

2861
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:38,430
see translation right there.
I don't want to know.

2862
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,630
I don't even want to know what they're 
saying,

2863
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,330
but I think the transitions are always 
off so bad.

2864
02:02:42,331 --> 02:02:44,010
That's actually kind of funny.
Oh yeah.

2865
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:47,010
Oh yeah.
And they're never dead out that on.

2866
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:50,580
I'm trying to think of what the fuck 
this dude's name is,

2867
02:02:50,581 --> 02:02:51,780
but I,
uh,

2868
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:55,470
I'll figure it out.
I'll put it up on instagram later.

2869
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:56,790
But his,
uh,

2870
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:58,890
the unemployment,
his page is on.

2871
02:02:58,891 --> 02:03:03,891
What the other day was these hyenas 
tearing apart this willdabeast like guts

2872
02:03:05,521 --> 02:03:06,354
first miss things,
trying to get away and get out of the 

2873
02:03:07,951 --> 02:03:10,080
water.
And these hyenas Just ripping it apart.

2874
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:11,730
Guts.
Fred savage.

2875
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:13,620
Oh,
it's so hard to watch.

2876
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:17,210
I can't watch that stuff were so soft.
Russell peters are.

2877
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:20,280
We have been here in America too much 
compassion.

2878
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,463
Well,
it's not just that we have too much 

2879
02:03:21,691 --> 02:03:22,524
compassion.
I'm saying that it's so easy for us to 

2880
02:03:23,671 --> 02:03:24,660
get by.
Yeah.

2881
02:03:24,850 --> 02:03:26,440
We don't have to worry about a hyena.
I get nothing.

2882
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,370
My dad grew up in the jungle.
What jungle in India.

2883
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,473
Oh,
jesus.

2884
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:37,540
So literally would he hunted tigers 
leopards a wild boar.

2885
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:41,360
Jesus christ.
Yeah.

2886
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:43,610
Your dad did that data a lot,
man.

2887
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:44,870
It was born 19,
25.

2888
02:03:44,871 --> 02:03:46,690
So you know,
back then it was,

2889
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:49,280
it's not like he would hunt them for 
fun,

2890
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:52,100
but yeah,
it was big game hunter.

2891
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:55,490
Wow.
We have a tiger skin with a head.

2892
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,020
Holy shit.
Yeah.

2893
02:03:57,110 --> 02:04:00,380
There's last one that he shot was in the
sixties when it was already.

2894
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:02,570
It was already banned.
You weren't allowed to shoot tigers in.

2895
02:04:02,571 --> 02:04:04,340
But the,
uh,

2896
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:09,260
this man manager went to a village and 
was killing people in the village.

2897
02:04:09,261 --> 02:04:12,320
So they had asked my dad to,
can you go get this?

2898
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:13,573
Can you go,
we know your family is a bunch of 

2899
02:04:15,021 --> 02:04:16,790
hunters,
can you go get this tiger for us?

2900
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,881
And he's like,
well,

2901
02:04:17,881 --> 02:04:18,440
what's in it for me?

2902
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:20,990
And they were like,
we'll give you $15.

2903
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:23,020
Like,
there was a lot like,

2904
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,060
it,
it,

2905
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:26,930
it was equivalent to that.
Somebody's saying to you today,

2906
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:29,160
I'll give you $15.
Whoa.

2907
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:30,410
And uh,
he said,

2908
02:04:30,411 --> 02:04:31,880
well,
how about you keep your money?

2909
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:32,714
I get to keep the skin.
So they made like an exemption and they 

2910
02:04:35,451 --> 02:04:36,050
were like,
yeah,

2911
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:36,883
because he's getting a man.
It wasn't like it was Just randomly 

2912
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:39,800
coming and telling you,
boy,

2913
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:43,500
that's a monster here.
I'll tell you exactly how he did it.

2914
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:44,940
I remember the story.
Clearly he would,

2915
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:46,013
he got,
he went to where there was two trees 

2916
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:51,150
side by side.
So he built up a little fort in this one

2917
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:51,984
tree and then he tied a bull,
a blu walks around the other tree and 

2918
02:04:56,731 --> 02:05:00,240
then he went and sat up in the tree at 
around fiVe,

2919
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,253
6:00
in the evening and he sat there and I'm 

2920
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:05,280
reading magazines and stuff.

2921
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:06,663
And uh,
and then he knew when the night falls 

2922
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:09,743
that tiger would come out.
and then as soon as the bull started 

2923
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:15,000
going crazy and running around the tree 
a lot because he knew he was scared.

2924
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,450
My dad was,
he had the shotgun with them,

2925
02:05:17,451 --> 02:05:18,610
a three or a three.
Oh wait,

2926
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:20,280
I think.
And uh,

2927
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:25,530
and he had his flashlight and the minute
his flashlight touched the barrel of the

2928
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:28,590
gun,
it made a metal noise.

2929
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:29,483
And then as soon as he did that,
the tiger looked up at him and instead 

2930
02:05:32,461 --> 02:05:35,490
of going for the ox leap,
straight up my dad and the tree.

2931
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:38,370
Oh my god,
my dad just fumbled and shot and hit him

2932
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:41,250
right here in the throat.
Oh my god.

2933
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,590
Flipped Back.
And then he,

2934
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:46,910
he flashed the flashlight on his eyes to
see if they were so glossy.

2935
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:52,330
Let me put another shot and just for 
safety and we have that skin to the holy

2936
02:05:54,511 --> 02:05:56,940
shit you're done with gangster.
It's uh,

2937
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,850
it's at my house in kits and not in my 
house.

2938
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:04,510
We have it in Canada and uh,
and I want to bring it here,

2939
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,830
but I don't know if we'll be able to.
No,

2940
02:06:06,831 --> 02:06:07,670
I don't think you will.
Well,

2941
02:06:07,690 --> 02:06:10,200
you might be able to get some sort of 
historical exemption.

2942
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:11,034
Yeah,
I mean,

2943
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:13,080
I don't know what paperwork I need for 
it.

2944
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:14,820
I guess it's hard to prove,
you know what I mean?

2945
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:15,090
So

2946
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:17,130
that seems like a.
Hmm.

2947
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:18,173
Maybe you'd have to.
I think what happens when they find 

2948
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:23,460
those things and they were illegal is 
they have to donate them to museums.

2949
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,441
Yeah.
See,

2950
02:06:24,441 --> 02:06:26,770
I don't want to lose that.
That's family heirloom because um,

2951
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:29,460
I remember reading about someone getting
arrested.

2952
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:30,983
It was a long time ago.
I want to say it was like the seventies 

2953
02:06:33,091 --> 02:06:37,080
or the eighties.
Someone got arrested with tiger skins.

2954
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:41,180
They had some tiger skins that were,
uh,

2955
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:44,490
obtainEd.
One of them was obtained illegally.

2956
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,290
right.
And you know,

2957
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:49,800
but it was illegally in like 1937 when 
they shot it in.

2958
02:06:49,801 --> 02:06:51,910
This person had,
had a couple of them,

2959
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,810
they were in trouBle because when that 
happens,

2960
02:06:54,811 --> 02:06:59,811
if someone sells you one,
it's apparently your responsibility.

2961
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,930
Since it's abandoned item.
Yeah,

2962
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:02,783
to bRing.
You have to bring it to like somewhere 

2963
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,450
and then they have to post it or 
something.

2964
02:07:06,451 --> 02:07:08,190
It's like you're not alloWed to possess 
it.

2965
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,150
So if you do possess it,
you can

2966
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:12,450
big trouble.
No,

2967
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:17,430
this was all properly gotten and 
properly imported into Canada.

2968
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,940
But what part of India did this take 
place?

2969
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:24,030
Um,
it was a part is a small railway village

2970
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:24,864
called boron poor.
It's kind of in the middle of the 

2971
02:07:26,641 --> 02:07:29,370
country.
Is that anywhere near the sunderbans?

2972
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,010
Uh,
cannot confirm nor deny that

2973
02:07:32,570 --> 02:07:33,403
that was the subject of this documentary
I saw where they were talking about of 

2974
02:07:37,321 --> 02:07:38,154
thE cinder benz is a very unusual 
section of the river system in India 

2975
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:47,440
because it's very brackish from like a 
long Period of tiMe.

2976
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:48,483
AnD these animals apparently drink the 
water and the water has a high salt 

2977
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:57,031
content and it was super irritable to 
the tigers and he thinks they make.

2978
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:57,993
That's one of the theories theY make the
tiger's more aggressive because they're 

2979
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:01,354
just in pain all the time from drinking 
salty water and they've killed some 

2980
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:09,010
insane amount of people over the last 
couple hundred years.

2981
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:13,510
I think it's somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 200 plus thousand people

2982
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:17,830
have been killed by tigers in the last 
couple hundred years in this area.

2983
02:08:18,050 --> 02:08:23,050
I remember going there when I was 11 or 
12 around that age anD my dad took us.

2984
02:08:24,170 --> 02:08:26,690
We went to my grandmother's who was 
still lived out there and uh,

2985
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,480
he took us for a walk.
We all had to carry guns.

2986
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:32,000
I was 11 walking around with a rifle.
Oh my god.

2987
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:34,540
And you,
everybody had to carry a gun because you

2988
02:08:34,541 --> 02:08:36,240
know,
he took us to like a,

2989
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:41,000
like a river and you could see fresh 
tiger prints in the mud and he was like,

2990
02:08:41,001 --> 02:08:41,870
look,
see.

2991
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,910
And you follow the prince and you go,
don't.

2992
02:08:43,911 --> 02:08:44,744
My dad was like,
don't go that way because that's where 

2993
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:47,300
you're going to go the other way.
Now.

2994
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,500
Big tiger sanctuary right next to it.
We're barranquilla here's brown pour and

2995
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:56,960
then I know I can't see it.
I'm sure you've seen.

2996
02:08:57,050 --> 02:08:58,220
Oh wow.
That's so wild.

2997
02:08:58,221 --> 02:09:01,010
I've never looked at that like that.
That's pretty cool.

2998
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:04,340
Can you see this on youtube?
That's all console.

2999
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,110
I know that.
That's pretty dope.

3000
02:09:06,111 --> 02:09:07,250
I know that area.
When I was a kid,

3001
02:09:07,251 --> 02:09:09,120
I'm trying to find a picture of my dad 
with a.

3002
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,033
We have some of the shots here.
Did you see that video from that wild 

3003
02:09:16,851 --> 02:09:18,870
animal park in beiJing?
My god,

3004
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:23,240
that was all I saw it on your instagram 
that I was like,

3005
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:24,500
what?
What was,

3006
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:27,890
why did you get out of your makes you 
think?

3007
02:09:27,891 --> 02:09:30,480
Yeah.
People just get mad or they began.

3008
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:31,910
That's what you wrote and that they 
were.

3009
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,500
She mad.
She got.

3010
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,030
She was mad and that's why she got out 
of the car.

3011
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:37,130
She apparently got mad at somebody in 
the car.

3012
02:09:37,131 --> 02:09:37,780
I don't know who,

3013
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:38,613
but she got out and she survived her mom
who got out to chase the tiger away 

3014
02:09:42,821 --> 02:09:44,020
after the tiger pulled her off.

3015
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:45,850
The mom got killed.
Oh,

3016
02:09:45,851 --> 02:09:47,380
so the one that got taken didn't get 
killed?

3017
02:09:47,381 --> 02:09:48,850
Yup.
Oh,

3018
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:52,530
woman mauled in beijing.
tiger attack to sue.

3019
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:56,100
So like a tiger.
I'm sure he doesn't have insurance.

3020
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:57,203
Oh my god.
She hadn't been fully a forerunner of 

3021
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:02,030
the dangers and left the vehicle because
she was car sick.

3022
02:10:03,180 --> 02:10:04,530
Well,
she was yelling at somebody.

3023
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:05,251
Oh,
here we go.

3024
02:10:05,251 --> 02:10:08,160
We're going to have to watch it.
I see.

3025
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,910
She was car sick bitch.
She was carjacked.

3026
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:16,580
This is so crazy.
She gets out,

3027
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:20,180
she storms over to the other side.
The other person gets out.

3028
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:20,580
Uh,

3029
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,020
and she's arguing,
she's like,

3030
02:10:22,021 --> 02:10:23,550
listen,
I'm telling you right now,

3031
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:25,110
you better shut the fuck up,
bitch.

3032
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,820
Come here.
The time we just ran out and grabbed her

3033
02:10:29,821 --> 02:10:30,654
dude.
And then someone else goes out after 

3034
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,213
tiger

3035
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,260
and then a park ranger.
Yeah,

3036
02:10:36,261 --> 02:10:40,060
park ranger runs in there anD that's all
we see it looked.

3037
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:42,890
It looked like a tiger and was the 
easiest lunch I've ever had.

3038
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:44,323
Tiger probably couldn't help himself.
Finally saw something they could jack 

3039
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:49,220
and best yet she wasn't paying 
attention.

3040
02:10:49,221 --> 02:10:51,110
So her back was turned.
Oh yeah.

3041
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,153
You ever see those videos of the tigers?
Like creeping up on people when they're 

3042
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:56,240
sitting with their back to the cage.
Crazy.

3043
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,930
They just dive on the back of them.
That can't help themselves.

3044
02:10:58,931 --> 02:11:00,680
It's wHat they do.
They're being tigers.

3045
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:01,723
They are being tigers.
Tigers too busy being tigers when you 

3046
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:05,160
don't check and tweets.
No.

3047
02:11:05,170 --> 02:11:06,800
I'm trying to find this picture of my 
dad.

3048
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:07,940
Oh,
the tiger rug,

3049
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:13,200
uh,
says you have to sign a piece of like a,

3050
02:11:13,530 --> 02:11:16,400
a waiver that says you will knock it out
of your car once you enter the park.

3051
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:19,760
And she thought it was,
wasn't that no one explained it to her.

3052
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:21,090
What does she think she's doing?
Well,

3053
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:25,700
she might've not been paying attention 
and not knowing that stuff.

3054
02:11:25,701 --> 02:11:28,700
But if somebody explains it to you,
how the fuck did they just let you drive

3055
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:30,500
around your own car where they have 
tigers?

3056
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:31,990
China doesn't give a shit,
You know?

3057
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,760
It's just such a ridiculous,
ballsy.

3058
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:38,480
They would never have that in America 
with the liability insurance that people

3059
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:41,460
have to carry over here in Canada.
They have a place called african lion so

3060
02:11:41,461 --> 02:11:42,294
far.
When I was a kid we used to go and you 

3061
02:11:43,441 --> 02:11:46,550
drive through with your own car and 
there was.

3062
02:11:46,551 --> 02:11:47,530
Yeah,
there was lions,

3063
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:49,233
there was giraffes and monkeys would 
jump on your car and fuck up your 

3064
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:53,774
antenna.
And there was a place like that in New 

3065
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:59,370
Jersey that I went to where the monkeys 
would jump on your car need?

3066
02:11:59,470 --> 02:12:00,303
Yeah.
They'd pull people's windshield wipers 

3067
02:12:01,371 --> 02:12:02,204
off and they were really Destructive.
But there's a big difference between 

3068
02:12:05,331 --> 02:12:08,240
that elian.
You guys had lions.

3069
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,090
It was called african lions for.
I don't believe I saw lion.

3070
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:13,603
Do you remember the monkeys fucking up 
the car and then my mom telling me that 

3071
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:21,440
recently when I was home that we should 
take my daughter to go see african lines

3072
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:23,810
of argument going in my fucking card.
African lions.

3073
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:28,920
Are you kidding me?
I saw a bobcat and a bunch of moms are a

3074
02:12:28,941 --> 02:12:31,610
bunch of babies.
Um,

3075
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:33,930
recently.
No,

3076
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:34,260
no,
no.

3077
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,093
I was in tone ranch.
We're driving on this road and this 

3078
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:40,640
bobcat and I think I want to say two or 
three babies,

3079
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,430
but I saw it so briefly and I knew that 
it was a cat.

3080
02:12:43,431 --> 02:12:44,264
I saw it so briefly and the guys I was 
with thought it was a cat that in my 

3081
02:12:47,001 --> 02:12:49,430
mind I had saw I'd seen a cougar.

3082
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:54,910
I'd seen a small cougar and some cougar 
puppies when they explained to me that,

3083
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:55,711
no,
no,

3084
02:12:55,711 --> 02:12:56,151
no,
no.

3085
02:12:56,151 --> 02:12:56,984
It was a bobcat.
Then I had to look into my memory and I 

3086
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:01,550
was like,
how much of my memory is concocted?

3087
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:06,910
How much of my memory in this situation 
is Just like a total falsification?

3088
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:07,880
I wanted it to be.
Well,

3089
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:10,880
I've just filled in the blanks,
like I knew it was a living thing.

3090
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:12,103
I knew some kind of a cat and I knew it 
ran awaY really quick and there was a 

3091
02:13:14,361 --> 02:13:17,390
couple of them.
So when we said it was a cat,

3092
02:13:17,391 --> 02:13:18,224
I was like,
oh well that must have been a mountain 

3093
02:13:18,951 --> 02:13:20,030
lion.
Very small mountain lion.

3094
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,630
And I was trying to figure it out.
Bobcats are just,

3095
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:25,970
uh,
they have really big pause.

3096
02:13:25,971 --> 02:13:26,804
Right?
And that what it is,

3097
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:28,130
some of them,
I know those are links.

3098
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:30,560
Links have really big pumps because they
walked through the snow.

3099
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:31,950
Yeah.
Those are weird to see.

3100
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,730
Men don't want to see one of those.
I saw one of those when I was in Canada.

3101
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:36,570
Did You?
Yeah,

3102
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:38,990
walk on the side of the road.
I'd Say nature of it.

3103
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:41,790
I never saw whenever.
Never saw a moose.

3104
02:13:41,791 --> 02:13:43,710
Elan what's.
And I know,

3105
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:45,870
I know.
Who are you?

3106
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:47,583
I don't know who I am.
Just not like the canadian animal or is 

3107
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:53,670
it like a duck or something?
The goose is ours.

3108
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:55,620
Is it for real?
The Canada goose?

3109
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:57,720
No,
that's your animal.

3110
02:13:58,010 --> 02:13:58,843
I don't know.
I think that's the only one that we 

3111
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:02,580
identify as canadian,
but moose is definitely part of our,

3112
02:14:02,581 --> 02:14:03,640
uh,
our,

3113
02:14:03,641 --> 02:14:04,474
uh,
heritage in a way that's kind of 

3114
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:07,044
appropriate that you guys are the goose 
and where the eagle county shitty mean 

3115
02:14:12,421 --> 02:14:13,920
bird doesn't give a fuck.

3116
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:18,950
Kills everything but can be tamed.
A eagle gimme.

3117
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,240
Yeah,
sure.

3118
02:14:20,241 --> 02:14:21,074
You can get them to sit on your arm.
was trying to one of them your eyes off 

3119
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:26,880
the leather.
I think you have a raise them,

3120
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:29,410
but people definitely raise eagles.
I'm,

3121
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:31,440
it's not like you can get a regular 
eagle and tame them,

3122
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:33,083
but if you raise him,
I'm sure he can get them to the point 

3123
02:14:34,831 --> 02:14:35,664
where they don't try to kill you all.
Don't like dave's house of eagles or 

3124
02:14:37,531 --> 02:14:39,870
something.
It's such an awesome animal though.

3125
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,040
It's just amazing that there's such a 
varietY of different things.

3126
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:44,903
That's my dad killed things.
That's your dad's sitting on a god 

3127
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:54,320
damned man eating tiger that he killed.
What a scary thing that is.

3128
02:14:56,230 --> 02:14:57,330
You know,
another thing about it,

3129
02:14:57,331 --> 02:14:59,580
they're so beautiful.
Oh yeah.

3130
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:00,473
It's weird.
Like you're going to be killed by 

3131
02:15:01,261 --> 02:15:03,180
something that's so amazing to look at.

3132
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:05,093
They don't.
They always say that if tigers were in 

3133
02:15:06,181 --> 02:15:07,530
africa,
they would be the king of the jungle.

3134
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:09,080
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3135
02:15:09,170 --> 02:15:11,280
Other way bigger.
Especially the big ones.

3136
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:12,143
Bigger,
meaner.

3137
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,390
Yeah.
They're,

3138
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:15,060
they're faster.
They're like,

3139
02:15:15,061 --> 02:15:15,894
they're out in the next level to align.
There was a video that I watched the 

3140
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:19,560
other day.
Ligers real.

3141
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:21,140
Yes.
Lions are real,

3142
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:23,910
but laggers tend to be like docile for 
some strange reason.

3143
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,670
You don't think anybody's ever been 
attacked by a lagger.

3144
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:27,833
They also have some weird growth thing 
going on where the whatever regulates 

3145
02:15:30,121 --> 02:15:31,740
growth,
they,

3146
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:32,790
it doesn't.
Wow.

3147
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:34,140
Yeah.
It doesn't work on them.

3148
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,460
That's a lagger.
Yeah.

3149
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:36,343
There are so huge.
They're like way bigger than regular 

3150
02:15:37,681 --> 02:15:39,450
cats.
Look at the belly on that guy though.

3151
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:41,160
Yeah,
they're fucking giant.

3152
02:15:41,161 --> 02:15:43,830
Dude.
That's an enormous,

3153
02:15:43,831 --> 02:15:45,750
enormous animal.
So,

3154
02:15:45,751 --> 02:15:46,584
uh,
whether it's the male tiger fucks the 

3155
02:15:48,301 --> 02:15:50,700
female lion.
I think that's how it goes.

3156
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:54,420
So when that happens,
apparently the,

3157
02:15:54,421 --> 02:15:55,920
um,
look at that.

3158
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:56,800
That's amazing.
Look.

3159
02:15:56,940 --> 02:16:00,870
And apparently when,
when it does happen,

3160
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,250
the uh,
cat,

3161
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:06,270
whichever side is the lie,
I don't lie to the tiger,

3162
02:16:06,271 --> 02:16:09,640
one of the sides is supposed to get,
it's a,

3163
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:13,080
the gene for regulating growth from the 
woman,

3164
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:14,363
but it doesn't get it from the woman or 
it doesn't get it from the man because 

3165
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:18,420
the man's a tiger or the man's elian,
however,

3166
02:16:18,421 --> 02:16:21,330
the combination works.
But because it's a male and a female,

3167
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:22,433
theY are a lion and a tiger.
They make this new thing that doesn't 

3168
02:16:26,071 --> 02:16:28,610
know when to stop growing.
So It just keeps drawing.

3169
02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:30,010
Yeah,
it just gives you bigger.

3170
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:31,850
These are fabricated,
these are like,

3171
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,113
well,
they think they can appear in the wild 

3172
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:36,250
but they don't live in the wild 
together.

3173
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:38,160
Two animals that are from different 
parts,

3174
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:39,580
different continents.
You know what I mean?

3175
02:16:39,581 --> 02:16:41,600
So somebody had to have put them 
together at some.

3176
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:43,180
Not only that,
they're not viable.

3177
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:45,760
So they're,
they're hybrids and it's a hybrid.

3178
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:47,170
It's not viable.
Like they can't.

3179
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:50,140
It's not like a dog,
like a wolf can fuck your dog.

3180
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:53,920
And those puppies are part wolf and they
could fuck a regular dog.

3181
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:56,800
And there'd be no problem,
they would just keep making puppies.

3182
02:16:56,801 --> 02:16:59,350
It probably good for the gene pool,
but with these things,

3183
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:04,380
even though a lion and a tiger probably 
look more similar than a german shepherd

3184
02:17:05,471 --> 02:17:07,120
and a poodle,
they do,

3185
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:08,350
right.
It probably looked more simply,

3186
02:17:08,351 --> 02:17:11,110
completely different.
They're not the same thing so that,

3187
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:12,400
that baby's a hybrid.

3188
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:16,510
So it was hybrid babies.
They can't reproduce so they can produce

3189
02:17:16,511 --> 02:17:17,950
more ligers.
Exactly.

3190
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:20,410
Yeah.
So it's there one litter animals.

3191
02:17:20,850 --> 02:17:21,683
But like wolf dogs will.
Dogs could fuck regular dogs and they 

3192
02:17:24,981 --> 02:17:25,814
can,
they can get fucked by regular dogs and 

3193
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:31,590
coyotes like crazy in my backyard and I 
fucking or screaming.

3194
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,490
They were screaming.
I ever killing something.

3195
02:17:33,491 --> 02:17:36,350
I'm sure there.
Interesting thing.

3196
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:37,780
Those are wolves.
Yeah.

3197
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:39,970
It's their actual wolves.
Skinny wolves.

3198
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:41,050
Yeah.
Little tiny wolves.

3199
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:43,230
They can mate with wolves.
They made with dough.

3200
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:44,460
We ran into a,
uh,

3201
02:17:44,461 --> 02:17:46,630
a litter once when I was doing fear 
factor.

3202
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:47,823
We're in this really rural area where 
we're doing the stunt and we ran into a 

3203
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:55,930
litter of coyotes and a labrador 
retriever.

3204
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:58,090
Coyote had,
fuck this guy's labrador retriever.

3205
02:17:59,020 --> 02:17:59,853
And the labrador retriever gave birth 
and then the puppies were all outside 

3206
02:18:02,261 --> 02:18:03,970
and we were trying to,
my name mangy looking,

3207
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:05,080
they will remain.

3208
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:07,040
She looked and it was real sad because 
uh,

3209
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:07,923
there were essentially feral and people 
were kind of trying to rescue them and 

3210
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:12,633
they're trying to give them to people on
the crew and people in the crew were 

3211
02:18:14,231 --> 02:18:17,450
like trying to get the cell phone 
service so they can call friends,

3212
02:18:17,451 --> 02:18:19,750
see if anybody want to take them because
you realize like,

3213
02:18:19,751 --> 02:18:20,980
wow,
these poor little things.

3214
02:18:20,981 --> 02:18:22,660
Like they're just,
they're going to die out here.

3215
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:24,790
But there was also the thought like,
whoa,

3216
02:18:24,791 --> 02:18:27,500
who wants a half coyote?
Nobody wants that.

3217
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:29,260
Ain't going to Listen to you,
man.

3218
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:30,500
Wiley.
That.

3219
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,110
Yeah,
that's a wild animal.

3220
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:35,440
A tricky little wild animal.
That fucking thing is not listening.

3221
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:37,563
But if you had like,
a lot of people were with the lab is 

3222
02:18:39,521 --> 02:18:42,700
like such a calm,
peaceful dog to like bounce it out.

3223
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,471
Yeah.
I don't know.

3224
02:18:43,471 --> 02:18:44,304
It might be too.

3225
02:18:44,330 --> 02:18:47,680
I might just make a really cunty lab.
I don't know.

3226
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:49,983
I'm having this guy on soon.
He's a wildlife biologist who's been 

3227
02:18:53,411 --> 02:18:57,340
studying all the coyotes that live in a 
urban los angeles.

3228
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:01,000
I was a big article about it,
about this ongoing research,

3229
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:03,670
but just how many coyotes live.
There's a ton of them,

3230
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:06,110
is incredible.
They've infiltrated in there.

3231
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:06,993
They're a part of this.
We think we'd like to think of our eco 

3232
02:19:08,831 --> 02:19:09,664
or,
um,

3233
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:14,820
our cities rather as environments that 
are free of anything alive other than us

3234
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:18,670
that's dangerous or anything other than 
us that's a predator.

3235
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:19,533
we don't,
we don't want to think that there's 

3236
02:19:20,081 --> 02:19:20,914
some,
some thing acting as a predator in our 

3237
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:25,670
midst like that.
For the most part.

3238
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:26,410
We,
you know,

3239
02:19:26,410 --> 02:19:29,000
we like to think of cities as being 
barren of wildlife,

3240
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:30,590
but it's not true at all.
No.

3241
02:19:30,591 --> 02:19:31,070
Well,
they were.

3242
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:33,410
They were here before.
We were not even,

3243
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:34,940
here's the thing.
They were,

3244
02:19:34,941 --> 02:19:35,774
but their ranges expanded there.
I'm reading a book right now called 

3245
02:19:38,691 --> 02:19:43,130
coyote America by this guy,
dan flores.

3246
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:47,090
And uh,
he was a wildlife historian,

3247
02:19:47,210 --> 02:19:48,043
turned author.
And you find out about the history of 

3248
02:19:51,141 --> 02:19:51,974
the coyote.
Apparently all dogs came from north 

3249
02:19:54,141 --> 02:19:56,180
America.
All dogs,

3250
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,820
all candidates,
including jackals,

3251
02:19:58,821 --> 02:20:00,710
including a bunch of shit that's an 
africa right now.

3252
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:03,050
All came from north America.
All horses,

3253
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:06,080
zebras.
Then all it all came from north America.

3254
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:07,333
They went extinct in north America and 
then we'll reintroduced later and the 

3255
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:12,680
coyotes are a weird.
They get around.

3256
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,840
How don't fucking know.
I guess pangea.

3257
02:20:14,841 --> 02:20:17,420
I think it was when,
when the continents were all connected,

3258
02:20:18,030 --> 02:20:18,863
you know,
when there was a different 

3259
02:20:19,011 --> 02:20:21,230
configuration,
but this fucking books,

3260
02:20:21,231 --> 02:20:22,064
amazing man talking about the history of
the coyote and how sneaky those fuckers 

3261
02:20:24,891 --> 02:20:25,400
are.

3262
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:29,450
The reason why there's so many coyotes,
they're all across every city in America

3263
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:31,910
today and that wasn't the case 100 years
ago.

3264
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:34,640
They've expanded their range due to 
persecution.

3265
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:35,713
So when anyone,
he shoots them when wolves come in and 

3266
02:20:37,881 --> 02:20:40,310
start killing them,
when anything happens to them,

3267
02:20:40,311 --> 02:20:43,670
they make more babies.
They do that roll call that screaming in

3268
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:45,200
the night and day when one of them's 
not.

3269
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:49,100
One of them's not calling back.
The females start producing more eggs.

3270
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:53,950
It's crazy shit that go from having like
for offspring to like,

3271
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:54,760
you know,
for,

3272
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,510
for pups in the.
I have like 15.

3273
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:58,460
Yeah.
That's pretty crazy.

3274
02:20:58,880 --> 02:20:59,713
You knoW?
Have you ever heard when a siren goes 

3275
02:21:01,781 --> 02:21:02,800
by?
It sets them off?

3276
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:05,140
Yeah.
I hear a siren and then fucking all of a

3277
02:21:05,141 --> 02:21:06,760
sudden you hear a shitload of coyotes 
and like,

3278
02:21:06,761 --> 02:21:07,594
wow.

3279
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:10,080
Have you ever heard Turkey do that?
No.

3280
02:21:10,170 --> 02:21:12,240
When you slammed your car door,
right?

3281
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:14,430
If you're out in the woods and he 
slammed your car door,

3282
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:17,160
you'll hear.
Yeah,

3283
02:21:17,161 --> 02:21:20,280
it's crazy.
They have this instinctive reaction,

3284
02:21:20,281 --> 02:21:23,220
like turkeys will gobble if you make a 
Turkey call,

3285
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:24,083
like,
you know they have the,

3286
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:27,240
they make a call like a Turkey and a 
Turkey calls back,

3287
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:29,370
but they'll also do it if you just 
slammed a car door.

3288
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:33,480
The very sensitive to sound.
They just freak out.

3289
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:35,310
And when they freak out they can't 
handle themselves.

3290
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:39,450
What does that meet you are cooking the 
other day on instagram?

3291
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:41,490
Yeah.
I wasn't good.

3292
02:21:41,610 --> 02:21:42,450
Yeah.
You ever had?

3293
02:21:42,870 --> 02:21:43,710
No.
Do you cook?

3294
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:45,060
Uh,
I,

3295
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:46,110
my,
my lady coach,

3296
02:21:46,111 --> 02:21:47,100
she does.
I'll give you some.

3297
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:48,590
I have some ell care.
Do you really?

3298
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:49,560
Yeah.
I'll take a little.

3299
02:21:49,561 --> 02:21:54,561
I'll call them like a cow.
Fuck.

3300
02:21:54,631 --> 02:21:58,180
The deere made sweet,
sweet love to a deer,

3301
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:01,560
but more delicious.
It's like my favorite meat.

3302
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:06,420
It's really good and I'd never thought 
I'd ever say this to you,

3303
02:22:06,421 --> 02:22:11,421
but I really Want to taste your meat and
you can't help yourself.

3304
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:15,600
I can't just who you are.
You've got to accept it.

3305
02:22:15,630 --> 02:22:16,463
It's true.
When you were telling me about the 

3306
02:22:16,741 --> 02:22:18,300
coyotes and you're sending her reading 
the book,

3307
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:19,890
what's the name of the book?
How god America.

3308
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:23,810
I was like,
have you read coyote ugly stuff?

3309
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:25,980
I fucking to her it me to

3310
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,800
stop myself from saying it.
Some kids,

3311
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:29,610
they don't even know a coyote.
Ugly means.

3312
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:31,313
Let me explain to you a little fucks.
Coyote ugly is when someone fucked 

3313
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:42,000
someone that's so ugly that your arm is 
underneath them.

3314
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:42,834
When you wake up and you chew your arm 
off lIke a coyote caught in a trap just 

3315
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:49,650
so that you don't have to wake them up 
and deal with them.

3316
02:22:50,690 --> 02:22:51,523
it's true.
That's what the term coyote ugly comes 

3317
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:53,820
from.
Right?

3318
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:58,000
That's true.
That's a brutal goddamn term that's.

3319
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:59,940
I've had a few of those in my time.
Have you?

3320
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,830
Yeah.
It's main road.

3321
02:23:01,831 --> 02:23:06,050
Coyotes,
some of the old road guy,

3322
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,820
the travels.
There's some spots in this country where

3323
02:23:11,870 --> 02:23:13,890
you know,
you stop in and you go,

3324
02:23:13,891 --> 02:23:14,724
man,
I wish I could get all of you guys out 

3325
02:23:15,481 --> 02:23:16,314
of here.
but then you talk to them and they love 

3326
02:23:18,661 --> 02:23:18,780
it.

3327
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:21,610
They're sure people love where they are.
Do you know,

3328
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,690
I get to some spots where I'm like,
you know,

3329
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:25,543
you're driving through these really 
small towns and you're looking around 

3330
02:23:27,740 --> 02:23:29,070
and I,
I always think to myself,

3331
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:31,950
I wonder if I just fucking stop the car 
here.

3332
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:34,860
Bought a house and then never called 
anYbody again.

3333
02:23:35,430 --> 02:23:37,620
Just lived here in this little small 
town.

3334
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:41,790
You know what that is?
That's a longing for nostalgia.

3335
02:23:42,390 --> 02:23:44,520
It is like this.
It's like you think,

3336
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:46,050
and I'm going to go back to being a 
regular guy.

3337
02:23:46,051 --> 02:23:49,350
I'm tired of being Russell Peters,
mr international.

3338
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:50,110
Mr.
Well,

3339
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:50,671
you know,
it's funny.

3340
02:23:50,671 --> 02:23:52,860
When I go to,
when I go home to toronto,

3341
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:56,670
I always drive through my old 
neighborhoods like uh,

3342
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:57,504
the,
the three or four neighborhoods that I 

3343
02:23:58,141 --> 02:23:58,990
did grow up and I,
I.

3344
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,980
Do you hang your rolex out the window 
with some,

3345
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:03,120
you know,
I'm almost tempted.

3346
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:05,670
Always tempted to knock on the doors of 
the houses I lived in.

3347
02:24:06,290 --> 02:24:08,410
Yeah.
But I'll do it at these ungodly hour.

3348
02:24:08,411 --> 02:24:10,080
So it'd be really creative and he 
probably drunk.

3349
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:10,840
No,
no,

3350
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:11,550
no,
no.

3351
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:13,270
don't drink and drive.
Yeah.

3352
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:15,420
People don't Want you knocking on their 
door and saying,

3353
02:24:15,421 --> 02:24:16,500
hey,
I used to live here.

3354
02:24:16,830 --> 02:24:17,840
Yeah.
You don't need more.

3355
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:19,470
nice to see ya.
take it easy.

3356
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:20,740
I want to just be like,
hey,

3357
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,140
I,
I grew up in this house.

3358
02:24:22,141 --> 02:24:24,000
Can I,
can I just come in and look around?

3359
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:25,141
Like,
no,

3360
02:24:25,141 --> 02:24:26,880
you fuck.
I'm hanging meat in the basement.

3361
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:27,980
Can out here.
There was a house.

3362
02:24:27,981 --> 02:24:30,090
I was a.
I grew up in.

3363
02:24:30,091 --> 02:24:32,340
That was for sale recently.
I could see online.

3364
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:34,350
It's weird.
Should've bought it.

3365
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:36,210
No,
no.

3366
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:39,060
Learn mastered in newton.
Newton,

3367
02:24:39,061 --> 02:24:41,760
upper falls.
What is interesting to see it did.

3368
02:24:41,761 --> 02:24:43,380
You knew dana back then?
No,

3369
02:24:43,450 --> 02:24:43,981
no,
no,

3370
02:24:43,981 --> 02:24:44,814
I didn't know dana.

3371
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:48,990
I didn't know dean until 2001 or 
something like that.

3372
02:24:48,991 --> 02:24:52,050
Like whenever they bought the ufc.
Yeah,

3373
02:24:52,051 --> 02:24:54,420
he uh,
he lived in south boston.

3374
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:57,970
I used to work in south boston at one 
point over the southeaster.

3375
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,670
yeah,
I think he lived there.

3376
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,050
I think you said he lived in south 
boston,

3377
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:05,090
but I lived in newton,
newton upper falls now.

3378
02:25:05,091 --> 02:25:07,860
I lived all over the place.
Once I moved down to my parents' place,

3379
02:25:07,861 --> 02:25:08,694
I moved to in a lot of shitty 
neighborhoods and pursuing my comedy 

3380
02:25:11,101 --> 02:25:11,861
dream.
Russell peters.

3381
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:14,010
I never had that accident.
I did.

3382
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:15,053
I did.
I found myself on tv when I won the bay 

3383
02:25:17,911 --> 02:25:22,911
state games in 1986 86 or 87 like that.
They had this thing called the bay state

3384
02:25:26,381 --> 02:25:29,790
games and it was like this big thing.
Um,

3385
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:31,773
it waS his,
it was his big tournament that they 

3386
02:25:33,341 --> 02:25:35,020
would do like an olympic style 
tournament.

3387
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,750
And um,
it was a taekwondo.

3388
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:40,420
Yeah.
And they've televised this fight or they

3389
02:25:40,421 --> 02:25:41,254
televise.
They'd fucked up the camera in the 

3390
02:25:42,321 --> 02:25:45,410
camera missive.
I won by knockout in the first round and

3391
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,680
like 30 seconds and then,
um,

3392
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:51,520
they had this big a tv report where they
had these,

3393
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:54,220
these tv people interview me because,
uh,

3394
02:25:54,221 --> 02:25:55,054
I had won the state championship a 
couple of years in a row and they were 

3395
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:59,380
interested in coverage of the bay state 
games.

3396
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,693
Anyway,
I listen to myself on tv and I sound 

3397
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:05,560
like such a fucking idiot.
I had a vh tape,

3398
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:10,240
vhs tape myself and I realized it was 
the first time I heard myself.

3399
02:26:10,241 --> 02:26:11,740
No,
I don't know where it is.

3400
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:12,603
There's,
I never realized how canadian I sounded 

3401
02:26:14,411 --> 02:26:17,050
until I saw an interview of mine from 
like 97,

3402
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:22,051
96 and I was just so earnest and,
and canadian.

3403
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:26,260
I was just at the boat.
Did you say if I did,

3404
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:28,300
I fucking did.
Do you don't say it anymore?

3405
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:30,370
No.
Say about say about.

3406
02:26:30,670 --> 02:26:31,241
Yeah,
that's right.

3407
02:26:31,241 --> 02:26:32,190
You're troubling.
I think,

3408
02:26:32,191 --> 02:26:33,024
feel the struggle.
The only thing I say that's still very 

3409
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:35,680
canadian of.
Sorry.

3410
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:37,953
Ugh.
I listen to myself when I was 19 and 

3411
02:26:39,841 --> 02:26:42,460
this,
this video and I was saying hide like we

3412
02:26:42,461 --> 02:26:44,400
worked out really hard for this.
Oh.

3413
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:46,030
I was like,
oh,

3414
02:26:46,290 --> 02:26:47,610
that's so funny to me.
He said,

3415
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,943
oh,
well it was just counseling out there 

3416
02:26:50,921 --> 02:26:52,720
too in boston.
Callen wasn't boston,

3417
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:54,040
but again,
I didn't know him either.

3418
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:57,880
Account was apparently in boston,
any was also doing taekwondo,

3419
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:01,570
but I didn't know him,
but he was born in India.

3420
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:04,450
Cowen was born in Philippines.
Philippines.

3421
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:06,280
His sisTer was born in India.
Yeah.

3422
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:07,860
He was a military child.
Yeah.

3423
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:09,790
So he.
He lived all over the place.

3424
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:13,420
He lived in Saudi Arabia.
He lived everywhere.

3425
02:27:13,850 --> 02:27:15,820
Fucking weird way to grow up,
man.

3426
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:16,773
Yeah.
I can't imagine that living in a bunch 

3427
02:27:17,831 --> 02:27:20,700
of strange foreign countries,
but to be like,

3428
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:25,420
I mean to be as well rounded as he is 
today is a testament to him.

3429
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:26,373
Yeah.
Well he's super well rounded as far as 

3430
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:29,820
kids interests.
Yeah.

3431
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,663
He's.
Yeah,

3432
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:33,310
he's a guy.
He knows a lot of shit.

3433
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:34,870
Yeah.
He knows a lot of shit about.

3434
02:27:34,890 --> 02:27:36,640
Very interesting in different.
Like,

3435
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:38,600
he's one of the few guys that I can call
up,

3436
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:40,690
like some bizarre thing that's in the 
news,

3437
02:27:40,691 --> 02:27:41,360
I can call.
Hey,

3438
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:43,540
I'm filming on this,
like what the fuck's going on with this?

3439
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:45,003
And he'll,
he'll be able to most likely have some 

3440
02:27:48,041 --> 02:27:48,874
insight.
He's kinda like a pretty broad range of 

3441
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:53,763
topics in his head that he knows quite a
bit about like don't ever talk to him 

3442
02:27:56,321 --> 02:27:57,700
about wine.
You'll get stuck.

3443
02:27:58,030 --> 02:27:58,890
Oh yeah,
I can drink wine.

3444
02:27:59,230 --> 02:28:00,760
I got acid reflux,
no wine for me.

3445
02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:01,923
What has acid reflux to your body 
telling you you're a fat fuck and you 

3446
02:28:04,661 --> 02:28:07,450
need to change your diet.
Is that what it is?

3447
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:09,270
But what does it mean?
Does it mean like you,

3448
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,810
like you burps come up?
Um,

3449
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:17,600
bert burns just burns to here.
So your digestive juices kicked back up?

3450
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:18,880
Yeah.
You.

3451
02:28:19,010 --> 02:28:19,843
Oh,
it's horrible.

3452
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:21,160
But you know,
I'm must constantly.

3453
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:23,900
I've had it since I was a kid,
so you know,

3454
02:28:23,901 --> 02:28:26,070
since I was,
I remember being a six,

3455
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:28,300
seven year old having it now.
Is there anything,

3456
02:28:28,301 --> 02:28:29,590
there was no.
What?

3457
02:28:29,630 --> 02:28:31,550
Did they give you?
Something for it back then?

3458
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,570
No,
now now,

3459
02:28:32,571 --> 02:28:34,370
yeah,
I take a stuff called protonix.

3460
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,430
And what does that stuff do?
Um,

3461
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:39,830
it just stops it.
I don't know what it does exactly,

3462
02:28:39,831 --> 02:28:41,840
but I know I don't feel any pain when 
I'm on it.

3463
02:28:41,841 --> 02:28:44,150
So I'm good with it.
You don't feel any pain,

3464
02:28:44,151 --> 02:28:46,370
like you can whack your deck with a 
hammer if that kind of thing.

3465
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:47,600
So I'm numb,
numb to the world,

3466
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:49,080
to the world.
That's what you look at.

3467
02:28:49,490 --> 02:28:53,240
Pizza and not worrying.
I drank a whole mountain dew.

3468
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:57,470
I don't give a fuck.
Do you think there's a dietary?

3469
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,200
Absolutely.
When I cue and I eat properly,

3470
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:01,070
it doesn't bother me at all.

3471
02:29:01,070 --> 02:29:03,560
I could not take medication then.
That'S interesting.

3472
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:05,920
So you choose to eat like shit.
So you know,

3473
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:08,000
I just do it.
I do it preventatively now.

3474
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:08,923
Uh,
just in case I don't know what the 

3475
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:11,870
fuck's going to trigger it.
Wow.

3476
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,973
So when it triggers that,
it just kicks in and you start getting 

3477
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:17,090
that burning feeling like it's kind of 
like a.

3478
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,940
Yeah,
it's like a burn in your eye.

3479
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,260
You're burping your eyes,
water and like we'll do it to you.

3480
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:22,920
Like lasagna,
lasagna,

3481
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:24,890
kick you down?
No pizza would take me down.

3482
02:29:24,891 --> 02:29:25,724
Pizza,
french fries for anything greasy 

3483
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,260
recently.
A wine is the worst for me though.

3484
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:32,150
Really?
Oh my god.

3485
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:35,690
Right now we busted out a glass of wine.
Started clinking glasses.

3486
02:29:35,691 --> 02:29:36,880
you just start throwing up.
No,

3487
02:29:36,881 --> 02:29:37,071
no,
no.

3488
02:29:37,071 --> 02:29:38,660
It wouldn't hit me.
I'd feel I'd be like,

3489
02:29:38,661 --> 02:29:39,620
oh,
it's all right now.

3490
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,750
And then when I go to bed the minute I 
lay down.

3491
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:43,161
Oh,
that's what you feel like.

3492
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:44,210
Shit.
That's when it happens,

3493
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,980
man.
Stay up.

3494
02:29:46,070 --> 02:29:48,060
That's what I'd say.
I'd just rather don't be a pussy.

3495
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:50,690
Don't know.
I'm not committing to this more.

3496
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:52,760
Yeah man.
You just got to keep partying bro.

3497
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:54,080
I don't know.
Side effects.

3498
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,540
Can you see what the side effects to 
protonix are?

3499
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:58,730
Because I'm pretty sure you got to have 
some.

3500
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:03,760
I heard probably short term memory.
I forget why I was a pilot lady.

3501
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:07,020
That was the.
What was that shit?

3502
02:30:07,290 --> 02:30:08,150
Shit.
Shit.

3503
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,550
Shit.
How would you categorize that?

3504
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:14,480
If you're a professional weight changes.
See when he changes.

3505
02:30:15,050 --> 02:30:16,400
Vomiting,
diarrhea,

3506
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:17,683
stomach pain.
Tired feeling of it's always to get off 

3507
02:30:20,091 --> 02:30:20,924

3508

a class of acid stopping drugs called 

3524
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:14,160
proton pump inhibitors.
Okay,

02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,980
so this is the shit band.
Oh my god.

3526

saying,
holy shit,

3529
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:33,990
there's so much money in drugs.
That's what we should have got into.

3530
02:31:33,991 --> 02:31:35,460
Russell.
Why are we.

3531
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:38,470
Why are we telling jokes?
We can be selling drugs lower.

3532
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:43,200
You're busy taking them.
So why don't why I take the good ones?

3533
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:44,760
What's it?
That stuff though,

3534
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:47,040
doesn't seem like a good one.
And you take that stuff.

3535
02:31:47,330 --> 02:31:49,200
Take it to day,
dude.

3536
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:50,034
Stop taking that place and to take it 
when I wake up and I'd take it before I 

3537
02:31:51,841 --> 02:31:52,674
go to bed.
Can I connect you with a diet guy that 

3538
02:31:54,561 --> 02:31:55,650
could change your life?
Yes.

3539
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:57,060
Would you do it?
Hell yeah.

3540
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:57,913
Yeah.
Okay.

3541
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:00,690
I'm going to connect you with a guy.
I know a guy that can change your life.

3542
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:01,770
Yeah.
I need that.

3543
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:06,330
Change your la live changing lives.
Would you listen?

3544
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:08,090
Would you only eat the stuff that he 
told you to?

3545
02:32:08,230 --> 02:32:09,270
If he.
Yeah,

3546
02:32:09,390 --> 02:32:12,720
I mean if I'm not an expert so I would 
have to listen to what he says.

3547
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:15,600
Now you're a wealthy man.
How come you haven't already done this?

3548
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:17,530
Um,
I,

3549
02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:19,950
I do.
I try to paper.

3550
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:22,110
You got to have a try.
I try.

3551
02:32:22,111 --> 02:32:23,340
I,
I just enjoy food.

3552
02:32:23,341 --> 02:32:25,500
I enjoy listening to man.
I was the problem.

3553
02:32:25,501 --> 02:32:26,340
I'm like,
you know what?

3554
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:27,623
I feel like going off sometimes.
Maybe right now like going and getting 

3555
02:32:29,971 --> 02:32:33,720
like a gigantic fucking mushroom 
pepperoni pizza.

3556
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:35,083
Not give a fuck about what you just did.
You plant that seed in my head just 

3557
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:45,020
perfect right off the fucking oven.
They slide it out of that oven with that

3558
02:32:45,571 --> 02:32:49,050
giant bachelor and they drop it down to 
that box.

3559
02:32:49,300 --> 02:32:50,133
The drop him like a ton.
He just start pulling slices apart and 

3560
02:32:52,441 --> 02:32:53,274
that cheese is hanging you all gooey and
you dig and taste tomato sauce and that 

3561
02:33:00,061 --> 02:33:00,894
grease and the spices and you're just 
chilling on the carbs too and you're 

3562
02:33:05,701 --> 02:33:08,360
just going,
fuck yeah.

3563
02:33:08,790 --> 02:33:12,420
Like I don't need a six pack.
I don't need to be shredded.

3564
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:15,720
Fuck all that kimmy,
this pizza right now.

3565
02:33:16,650 --> 02:33:18,210
That's my problem.
That's a problem.

3566
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:19,980
The problem is the way you sold it just 
now.

3567
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:22,900
It may stop on the way home.
Yeah.

3568
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:24,710
I hate a bunch of boring shit today.
All right.

3569
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,130
I ate nuts.
Eggs ate a bunch of boring ass shit.

3570
02:33:29,131 --> 02:33:32,760
I certainly didn't have a fresh pizza.
my head multigrain cheerios.

3571
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:36,210
That's good.
If you like sugar and things that aren't

3572
02:33:36,211 --> 02:33:37,044
really good for you,
but appear to be good for you on the 

3573
02:33:38,201 --> 02:33:40,330
box.
Multigrain,

3574
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:44,670
they were delicious.
You know what I like?

3575
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:48,480
Pineapple and anchovy pizza you've ever 
had like pineapple on.

3576
02:33:48,481 --> 02:33:48,940
Uh,
on,

3577
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:50,070
on,
on intro.

3578
02:33:50,071 --> 02:33:51,990
Rosanna.
See the two of them together.

3579
02:33:51,991 --> 02:33:54,630
I know it seems nasty.
I know people are listening to me.

3580
02:33:54,631 --> 02:33:57,720
They like joe.
You to mask the anchovy.

3581
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:58,653
It doesn't mask.
It gets busy together telling you it's 

3582
02:34:01,081 --> 02:34:01,914
fantastic.
I mean I can't do country smelling 

3583
02:34:03,481 --> 02:34:05,790
thing.
Not only that I go double pineapple.

3584
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:07,090
Double anchovy.
Yeah.

3585
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:08,340
Can't do that.
Give a fuck.

3586
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:13,420
You're just shit on my pizza.
Dreams that.

3587
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:15,510
Guess what?
You just talked me out of eating pizza.

3588
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:18,160
So it was another one.
Maybe this be more up your alley.

3589
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:21,830
Jalapenos and sausage?
No.

3590
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:24,850
See the triggers for me.
Oh,

3591
02:34:24,851 --> 02:34:25,684
don't be a pussy or taking drugs.
I knoW if it's on your lap and l's and 

3592
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:34,080
they take care of the animal all.
Fuck me sideways.

3593
02:34:34,090 --> 02:34:34,923
And extra medicine.
Can you take like four of those fuckers 

3594
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:38,740
didn't want to do that.
Now what happens?

3595
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,753
I don't know yet.
No more ass lying down and cleans out 

3596
02:34:41,231 --> 02:34:42,910
all your assets.
What's happening?

3597
02:34:42,911 --> 02:34:44,380
Like what is it?
How's it stopping that?

3598
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:47,720
I don't know.
What's it doing it good.

3599
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:48,773
But if you had it since I was a kid and 
my parents were just telling me drink 

3600
02:34:50,861 --> 02:34:52,160
milk.
Hm.

3601
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:55,120
That's a good thing to tell people.
My mom was like,

3602
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:56,770
go drink.
Some milk will go away.

3603
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:59,140
It's almost like nothing you should 
drink milk for other than,

3604
02:34:59,141 --> 02:35:01,330
than you want milk and drinks.
Milk.

3605
02:35:01,331 --> 02:35:02,160
It'll cool down.
Well,

3606
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:04,450
indians evan,
because despite foods or spicy,

3607
02:35:04,750 --> 02:35:06,910
they serve a yogurt dish with it and 
yogurts to.

3608
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:08,180
Oh,
okay.

3609
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:09,550
To calm.
You're calm everything down.

3610
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:12,820
And I never liked the yogurt as a kid so
I would have to just drink milk.

3611
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:16,450
I went to a kid's party recently and uh,
we uh,

3612
02:35:16,451 --> 02:35:20,930
we pulled up and it was this thing at 
this roller skating place and I'm hungry

3613
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:22,300
and I was like,
I gotta get something to eat,

3614
02:35:22,570 --> 02:35:23,830
find something.
Yeah.

3615
02:35:24,070 --> 02:35:28,870
So right around the quarters is just 
like super authentic indian,

3616
02:35:29,310 --> 02:35:34,310
like deli slash,
like lunch place where everything was in

3617
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:37,150
indian and everything was.

3618
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:39,760
There was a few things that were in 
english.

3619
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:42,520
No one there was american except for me 
or no one.

3620
02:35:42,521 --> 02:35:43,580
There was a,
you know,

3621
02:35:43,581 --> 02:35:46,150
your standard english speaking person,
except for me.

3622
02:35:46,151 --> 02:35:49,160
No one knew what the fuck I was saying 
like I was like,

3623
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:50,223
had to tell this lady that didn't want 
the nan bread and she just wanted given 

3624
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:54,500
it to me anyway.
Yeah.

3625
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:57,970
But it was.
The food was sensational.

3626
02:35:57,971 --> 02:36:00,940
It was really good.
All vegetarian indian food,

3627
02:36:00,941 --> 02:36:01,774
but I really felt like I had somehow or 
another like teleported into another 

3628
02:36:05,171 --> 02:36:07,240
country.
I waS hanging out with these people.

3629
02:36:07,241 --> 02:36:08,074
They're all wearing indian clothes,
clothes that would totally identified 

3630
02:36:12,031 --> 02:36:14,380
them as being from India.
Everything was in.

3631
02:36:14,381 --> 02:36:17,170
They had indian music playing.
Indian tv shows it.

3632
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,810
Sometimes they went deep,
they missed the motherland,

3633
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:23,620
liKe a time capsule,
but the food is so distinct.

3634
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:24,813
it's like all the curries and the 
different spices and the tumeric and 

3635
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:32,950
it's a really interesting type of food 
man.

3636
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:33,993
It depends on which part of India you 
are eating food from two very different 

3637
02:36:37,181 --> 02:36:40,300
everywhere.
There's a place on south east,

3638
02:36:40,301 --> 02:36:41,740
west.
Everybody has their own stuff.

3639
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:43,360
Yeah.
There's a place on ventura.

3640
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:44,223
Where's the.
Where's the best indian restaurant in 

3641
02:36:45,431 --> 02:36:48,850
la?
Is there a one spot that I used to go to

3642
02:36:48,851 --> 02:36:49,684
in studio city called.
It used to be called great India cafe 

3643
02:36:52,330 --> 02:36:55,570
and they just changed the name and I 
forgot what the change the name to,

3644
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:58,380
but the restaurant's still there.
There's one in.

3645
02:36:58,430 --> 02:37:00,790
It's pretty damn good.
Woodland hills on ventura.

3646
02:37:00,791 --> 02:37:01,624
That's really good.
I might have been to that one under 

3647
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:07,000
barack or something like that.
Down closer to the one on one area.

3648
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:08,590
Yes.
Closer to like calabasas.

3649
02:37:08,591 --> 02:37:09,221
Yeah.
Yeah.

3650
02:37:09,221 --> 02:37:11,600
I think that place is really good.
A little strip plaza.

3651
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

3652
02:37:12,810 --> 02:37:15,560
I mean it's not bad to me.
It's really good.

3653
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,100
I don't

3654
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:16,701
know.
Shit though.

3655
02:37:16,701 --> 02:37:17,534
I want.
I want you to school me in the ways of 

3656
02:37:18,321 --> 02:37:21,680
the authentic.
My mom taught my fiance.

3657
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:26,630
How do I make her food her way?
And she makes it fucking amazingly.

3658
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:27,830
So,
uh,

3659
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:28,910
if you're into it,
I will.

3660
02:37:29,090 --> 02:37:32,450
Have you have you in wifey over.
Let's do it.

3661
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:33,510
Come on.
Um,

3662
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:34,363
there was the place that I went to that 
I told you that was super authentic 

3663
02:37:36,981 --> 02:37:38,480
indian,
but it was all vegetarian.

3664
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:40,070
Is that common?
Yes,

3665
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:43,460
because there'S a sagittarius is big 
over there.

3666
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:46,400
The second place that I've found that's 
like a super authentic,

3667
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:47,413
uh,
there's another one in canoga park 

3668
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:49,620
that's real similar.
It's like a,

3669
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:51,350
like a super market

3670
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:53,490
rather than.
And then they also serve food there,

3671
02:37:53,491 --> 02:37:57,290
but it's all vegetarian is more common 
than not in India really,

3672
02:37:57,350 --> 02:37:58,820
you know,
you have to specify they'll,

3673
02:37:58,821 --> 02:38:01,330
they'll put on the outside vege and non 
vege.

3674
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:05,850
So why don't airplanes when they order 
their food and then they screw it up.

3675
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:06,960
Um,
I am,

3676
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:09,010
I am a vegetable and my wife is also a 
vegetable.

3677
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:09,920
oh,
that's what they say.

3678
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:10,920
Yeah.
So that's true.

3679
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,220
But it's good to hear.
Why is that that indian so predominantly

3680
02:38:14,221 --> 02:38:17,670
vegetarian.
I'm just alwayS has been historically.

3681
02:38:17,671 --> 02:38:18,151
I mean,
you know,

3682
02:38:18,151 --> 02:38:18,984
they,
I think they revere animals quite a bit 

3683
02:38:20,821 --> 02:38:24,330
and they also don't have the uh,
can't really facilitate.

3684
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:27,320
I'm storing meat,
you knoW?

3685
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:29,300
Right.
We don't have refrigerators and stuff.

3686
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:30,930
Right.
That makes sense.

3687
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:36,240
It's easier to hang onto the vegetables,
but there are some dishes like a,

3688
02:38:36,870 --> 02:38:39,000
like there's one that has rogan in it.
lamb,

3689
02:38:39,001 --> 02:38:40,050
rogan,
joe rogan,

3690
02:38:40,051 --> 02:38:40,830
josh.
Oh yeah.

3691
02:38:40,830 --> 02:38:42,690
That shit is good.
That is good.

3692
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:44,100
Oh my god.
That place in woodland hills.

3693
02:38:44,101 --> 02:38:45,770
I've had it there.
Extra spicy.

3694
02:38:46,050 --> 02:38:48,030
Oh my god.
Joe says damn good.

3695
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:50,220
You say josh does josh.
Josh,

3696
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:52,480
yeah.
Yeah,

3697
02:38:52,890 --> 02:38:53,723
but that's a meat dish.
Is that is just a small amount of thoSe 

3698
02:38:56,251 --> 02:38:56,980
meat dishes?
Yeah.

3699
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:57,350
No,
no.

3700
02:38:57,350 --> 02:38:59,060
There's a lot of meat dishes.
It's just,

3701
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:01,180
you know,
more often than not you'll find,

3702
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:02,053
you'll find it's probably easier to find
a vegetarian indian restaurant than it 

3703
02:39:04,431 --> 02:39:06,800
would be to find a meat one.
I wonder if,

3704
02:39:06,801 --> 02:39:07,634
unless you go from like north India,
north indians tend to eat a lot more 

3705
02:39:09,651 --> 02:39:10,484
meat.

3706
02:39:10,660 --> 02:39:12,220
One,
if there's a direct connection.

3707
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:14,890
I mean India has always had like an 
issue with Pakistan.

3708
02:39:14,891 --> 02:39:16,720
They'd been involved in conflicts 
before.

3709
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:19,750
But overAll when people think about 
indian people,

3710
02:39:19,751 --> 02:39:20,584
people from India,
they think of them as not being like 

3711
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:23,160
war,
like to think of being.

3712
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:24,223
It's being pretty peaceful people.
I wonder if there's a correlation 

3713
02:39:27,070 --> 02:39:30,820
between that and the massive amount of 
people you plants only.

3714
02:39:32,030 --> 02:39:34,830
I'm a wonder.
I don't know.

3715
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:37,030
it's a possibility.
They are,

3716
02:39:37,031 --> 02:39:37,411
uh,
very,

3717
02:39:37,411 --> 02:39:38,244
uh,
you know,

3718
02:39:38,530 --> 02:39:43,380
there have alwayS been big on meditating
and yoga obviously is ours and yeah.

3719
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:48,600
And centering yourself and eating hash 
eating hash

3720
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:49,760
when you go deep,
deep,

3721
02:39:49,761 --> 02:39:50,241
deep,
deep,

3722
02:39:50,241 --> 02:39:51,074
deep into the records.
They had some really crazy ancient 

3723
02:39:54,321 --> 02:39:56,990
writings,
man on vmr news,

3724
02:39:57,020 --> 02:40:01,420
this flying saucer talk and shit.
And some of the sand skirts.

3725
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,263
The anger of all

3726
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:04,280
european languages.
Is it [inaudible]

3727
02:40:06,460 --> 02:40:07,790
from a pretty cool place,
huh?

3728
02:40:07,930 --> 02:40:09,970
That's not too shabby.
It's pretty bad ass.

3729
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,440
Have you started thinking about all the.
No.

3730
02:40:11,570 --> 02:40:12,380
Oh,
you'd love it.

3731
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:14,100
All the cool shit that's been from 
India,

3732
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:15,990
like that's a very unique part of the 
world.

3733
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:19,590
Yeah.
I think you'd really enjoy it out there.

3734
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:21,540
You got to get rid of those tigers for.
I go visit.

3735
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,700
Not into that.
Your dad can do that.

3736
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:25,593
I'm not,
not going to be there for that for the 

3737
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:27,773
time.
I used to have this bit in my act about 

3738
02:40:29,611 --> 02:40:31,350
a,
a real thing that happened on the soon.

3739
02:40:31,351 --> 02:40:34,080
Depends wHere this tiger jumped into the
river,

3740
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:35,093
swam up to a boat that had five 
fishermen in it and killed one at a 

3741
02:40:39,811 --> 02:40:41,400
time.
Killed three guys,

3742
02:40:41,430 --> 02:40:42,450
grabbed them,
bid them,

3743
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,820
drag them into the water,
pulled him to shore,

3744
02:40:44,850 --> 02:40:46,980
killed him,
jumped back in the water,

3745
02:40:47,010 --> 02:40:49,170
swam back out to the boat,
grabbed the next guy,

3746
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:50,153
pulled him to shore,
and these guys thought about they 

3747
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,060
couldn't do anything.
They were trying to row.

3748
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:55,850
They couldn't roll fast in the entire 
swim.

3749
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:56,993
They swam faster than five guys can row 
and then then for grad can row and then 

3750
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:02,690
three gaskets,
rail.

3751
02:41:02,770 --> 02:41:03,603
So it's two guys left,
two guys survived on three out of the 

3752
02:41:06,601 --> 02:41:07,434
five were killed by the same fucking 
tiger who's kept swimming out to the 

3753
02:41:11,191 --> 02:41:14,280
boat and jacking them and then swimming 
to shore with them,

3754
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:15,613
you know,
to him it was like being at a party and 

3755
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:20,480
the order of trade was coming.
I'll get another one of those police.

3756
02:41:20,510 --> 02:41:23,790
He chased it down with a 10 or third 
when he was like,

3757
02:41:23,791 --> 02:41:24,660
you know,
I really shouldn't,

3758
02:41:24,690 --> 02:41:25,523
but oh,
I really wish I saved that video of the 

3759
02:41:28,201 --> 02:41:32,210
tiger running at the guy because it 
turns off at the last minute.

3760
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:36,780
I think they fire a gun and scare it,
but it's running at him at an impossible

3761
02:41:36,781 --> 02:41:38,670
rate of speed.
Like you see it running.

3762
02:41:38,671 --> 02:41:39,504
He just,
it forces your brain to reprocess how 

3763
02:41:42,601 --> 02:41:43,860
fast you can get out of the way.

3764
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:45,850
Like I think we like to think like,
oh,

3765
02:41:45,851 --> 02:41:47,190
if something's coming at me,
bro,

3766
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:51,310
a fucking get out of there.
I run so fast here.

3767
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:51,841
I,
you know,

3768
02:41:51,841 --> 02:41:52,674
I always think about like a dog or 
something or even if a coyote came at 

3769
02:41:55,351 --> 02:41:56,940
me,
I'm like a punch in the face.

3770
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:00,330
It's not just going to sit there and let
you punch it in the face.

3771
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:01,620
You know,
you start,

3772
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,513
you started,
your tough guy kicks in and then your 

3773
02:42:04,051 --> 02:42:05,550
reality kicks back in,
you know,

3774
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:07,730
well that's what people think they could
do to each other too.

3775
02:42:08,090 --> 02:42:09,240
You know?
Guys are always thinking,

3776
02:42:09,241 --> 02:42:10,980
yeah,
this fucking goes looking at you.

3777
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:13,170
I saw him looking at you.
I'm just going to go over there.

3778
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:16,110
Fuck a guy up and you think in your 
head.

3779
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:16,993
I got a plan here and I'm going to say 
something that I'm going to hit it with 

3780
02:42:19,231 --> 02:42:22,140
one of these and that's going to be the 
end of that and then when it's not,

3781
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:26,060
when the guy moves his head and hits you
with a jab and kicks you in the balls,

3782
02:42:26,061 --> 02:42:27,810
you're like,
oh no.

3783
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:29,820
What have I done?
Always.

3784
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:31,033
Then you get beat up by his friends,
but you have in your head you have this 

3785
02:42:34,831 --> 02:42:37,680
thing that tiger's going to run at me 
and I'm going to get the fuck out of the

3786
02:42:37,681 --> 02:42:38,514
way.
Like the guys that tried to fight nick 

3787
02:42:39,931 --> 02:42:42,390
diaz and the guy in the bathroom.
Yeah.

3788
02:42:42,391 --> 02:42:44,670
What a great idea.
Fucking smart plan.

3789
02:42:44,671 --> 02:42:45,504
Stupid.
In the next time you're going to mouth 

3790
02:42:46,651 --> 02:42:48,210
off to someone to look at their ears 
first.

3791
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,370
Let's just look in his eyes,
man.

3792
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:52,950
Just get scar tissue all over his 
eyebrows.

3793
02:42:52,951 --> 02:42:55,810
Wouldn't you just assume that that guy 
has been into wild?

3794
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:58,380
They're just drunk dummies.
You got a lot of those in this world.

3795
02:42:58,560 --> 02:42:59,940
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.

3796
02:43:00,410 --> 02:43:01,243
Even when I'm drunk,
I'm not that stupid and that's why 

3797
02:43:02,581 --> 02:43:04,230
you're Russell Peters,
you not one of those dummies.

3798
02:43:06,810 --> 02:43:07,643
We need those guys to russell.
It's true that we need to balance out 

3799
02:43:09,781 --> 02:43:10,614
the ecosystem for now.
We've just got to raise the level of 

3800
02:43:13,841 --> 02:43:14,800
dummy,
you know,

3801
02:43:14,801 --> 02:43:17,650
because the level of dummy today,
if you take the average jami,

3802
02:43:17,651 --> 02:43:20,830
like even those guys that got in a fight
with nick diaz,

3803
02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:23,560
we take those guys and drop them off in 
the caveman days.

3804
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:26,170
They'd be running shit to be the 
smartest guy in the room.

3805
02:43:26,670 --> 02:43:27,690
They'd be able to take.
Listen,

3806
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:28,930
listen,
you guys don't know shit.

3807
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,190
You don't know what you're doing.
First of all,

3808
02:43:30,191 --> 02:43:32,560
we got to make some shelter.
We can't rely on this cave.

3809
02:43:32,561 --> 02:43:34,420
The bears know where the cave is.
Okay,

3810
02:43:34,421 --> 02:43:35,350
come on guys.
Come with me.

3811
02:43:35,810 --> 02:43:38,530
They'd figure out tools like you guys 
haven't even figured out tools yet.

3812
02:43:38,531 --> 02:43:40,350
We gotta make foreman's.
they'd be the performance.

3813
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:43,990
You could get one of those dummies and 
bring them back to the point before.

3814
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:47,530
Monkey peopLe invented tools and he 
could start making tools.

3815
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:49,030
He'd be the king.
Right?

3816
02:43:49,690 --> 02:43:50,030
Well,
that's.

3817
02:43:50,030 --> 02:43:51,250
That's what's happening.
It's just.

3818
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:55,840
That was only a million years ago.
So evolution is not like all of a sudden

3819
02:43:55,841 --> 02:43:57,460
now we're at point 10.
No,

3820
02:43:57,550 --> 02:44:00,130
there's still people at point six that 
guys at point six,

3821
02:44:00,780 --> 02:44:02,860
that's whatever.
People really think.

3822
02:44:02,861 --> 02:44:06,370
Evolution is a even playing field.
Everyone's like,

3823
02:44:06,371 --> 02:44:08,530
well then how come I'm like,
because you're an idiot.

3824
02:44:08,531 --> 02:44:12,290
That's why it's an even playing field.
While people don't want to admit that,

3825
02:44:12,530 --> 02:44:15,010
that life isn't fair,
you know,

3826
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,630
in,
in a bunch of different ways.

3827
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:18,273
It's definitely not fair physically have
you think it's fair to fair physically 

3828
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:22,541
go,
go,

3829
02:44:22,541 --> 02:44:24,580
try wrestling.
Lebron james.

3830
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:28,030
Just grab them.
Just want to feel helpless.

3831
02:44:28,031 --> 02:44:31,840
You are just feel,
feel what it feels like if a fucking nfl

3832
02:44:31,841 --> 02:44:35,290
lineman grabs you by your neck,
just feel,

3833
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:38,580
feel how vulnerable you actually are in 
relationships.

3834
02:44:38,630 --> 02:44:42,040
How you appear that you are or how you 
think that you are.

3835
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,350
Yeah.
What you envisioned for yourself.

3836
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:46,090
This is more align.
Fair at all.

3837
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:47,190
People have that.
Uh,

3838
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:49,480
and,
and uh,

3839
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:51,070
what's,
what's the fucking word?

3840
02:44:51,071 --> 02:44:52,810
I'm looking for with her,
the way they,

3841
02:44:52,811 --> 02:44:55,150
the way they see themselves as not 
really the way they are.

3842
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,533
You know when I look in the mirror,
I still see a 25 year old Russell 

3843
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:02,650
Peters,
but then when I get honest with myself,

3844
02:45:02,651 --> 02:45:06,940
I got the fuck happened there kid.
You got to stay drunk and stay drunk and

3845
02:45:06,941 --> 02:45:09,040
keep moving.
Sometimes that's the answer.

3846
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:12,040
A lot of people will tell you,
introspection,

3847
02:45:12,041 --> 02:45:12,874
yoga tank,
you can go that way or stay drunk and 

3848
02:45:18,611 --> 02:45:21,190
keep moving.
Like I love people to do both.

3849
02:45:21,410 --> 02:45:24,490
Like let's stand hopes.
One of my favorites stays drunk.

3850
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:27,160
Keeps moving.
Same with hunter thompson.

3851
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:28,810
Stayed drunk,
kept moving.

3852
02:45:28,930 --> 02:45:30,460
You still got your isolation tank?
Yes,

3853
02:45:30,461 --> 02:45:34,570
I do often want to go in it.
I do when I really do say the word.

3854
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:37,390
Any you tell me whenever you're home.
Come on over,

3855
02:45:37,391 --> 02:45:38,620
dude.
We'll make it happen.

3856
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:40,060
You're not far from me.
Know.

3857
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:41,020
We'll make it happen.
Dude.

3858
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:42,190
It's you.
You'll love it.

3859
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:44,680
So relaxing and you get out of.
There you go.

3860
02:45:44,681 --> 02:45:45,670
Whoa.
That's it,

3861
02:45:45,671 --> 02:45:46,181
huh?
Yeah.

3862
02:45:46,181 --> 02:45:47,014
Yeah.
That's it.

3863
02:45:47,290 --> 02:45:48,070
I really want to do.
It.

3864
02:45:48,070 --> 02:45:49,870
Feels real good.
Loosens up everything.

3865
02:45:50,010 --> 02:45:52,300
Yeah.
I need that just to shut off.

3866
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:53,193
Shut off the world.
Do you have a spot in your house where 

3867
02:45:54,461 --> 02:45:56,420
you can put one?
Um,

3868
02:45:57,990 --> 02:45:59,320
no.
No.

3869
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:02,680
Can you go?
Can you build a little shack?

3870
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:03,530
I could,
yeah.

3871
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:06,400
Should do that.
Just going to wait until I move and then

3872
02:46:06,401 --> 02:46:08,950
I'll do it because then I'll have a man 
cave that I can.

3873
02:46:09,090 --> 02:46:10,870
Another man can.
Yeah.

3874
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,943
You want.
Ideally the best move would be if you 

3875
02:46:14,721 --> 02:46:17,240
had a bathroom that you could sacrifice.
If you had a house.

3876
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,173
I know you're a baller so you're going 
to get a nice house if you have a house 

3877
02:46:22,371 --> 02:46:24,380
and you could sacrifice one of your 
bathrooms.

3878
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:28,310
Set it up in there so that you have the 
shower that's right there.

3879
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,233
It's already set up for plumbing and all
that jazz and I have like the guys from 

3880
02:46:32,451 --> 02:46:35,720
float lab set it up.
You will value it so much.

3881
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:38,900
It's so.
It's such a nice place to just chill and

3882
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:41,990
think about shit and reflect.
How long do you do it?

3883
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:43,993
The least I do is an hour usually,
but I will jump in if I only have 40 

3884
02:46:47,391 --> 02:46:49,160
minutes and I said I just want to get in
there right now.

3885
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:49,550
I'll,
I'll,

3886
02:46:49,550 --> 02:46:52,280
we'll jump in and do like 40 minutes if 
I know I have to go somewhere.

3887
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:56,210
But honestly that is contrary to what 
it's good for.

3888
02:46:56,211 --> 02:46:58,220
What it's good for is like the end of 
the day for me.

3889
02:46:58,460 --> 02:47:01,070
Like everybody's asleep and I can get in
that thing.

3890
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:02,383
I can just

3891
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:07,270
just totally removed myself.
Do you fell asleep in there?

3892
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:08,133
No,
never.

3893
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:10,840
I don't think so.
Maybe when a jerk I don't do that.

3894
02:47:11,410 --> 02:47:13,390
um,
but the salt gets us.

3895
02:47:13,420 --> 02:47:13,961
Thanks.
Thanks.

3896
02:47:13,961 --> 02:47:14,794
Thanks.
Thanks.

3897
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:17,440
Um,
you can for sure.

3898
02:47:17,441 --> 02:47:18,274
I have a hard time falling asleep laying
on my back though because I got sleep 

3899
02:47:20,771 --> 02:47:21,910
apnea.
So if I,

3900
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:26,200
you know,
I know snore like a motorcycle now.

3901
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:27,550
Yeah,
it's super common.

3902
02:47:28,210 --> 02:47:29,043
Super common.
A lot of people have it really fucks 

3903
02:47:30,371 --> 02:47:33,130
with your sleep man.
Should do somethIng about that.

3904
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:36,970
Sometimes I'll take an advil cold and 
sinus if I go to bed to help.

3905
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,870
Yeah.
Because it opens up my airways.

3906
02:47:38,871 --> 02:47:40,120
So you want them to take a pill guys?
Huh?

3907
02:47:40,690 --> 02:47:42,580
not really.
Actually we got to fix you.

3908
02:47:43,150 --> 02:47:44,470
This is what we're going to do with god.
Damn it.

3909
02:47:46,090 --> 02:47:48,610
First of all,
no working out with that manny pacquiao.

3910
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:49,500
Train anymore.
Guys,

3911
02:47:49,501 --> 02:47:50,334
get a break.
You need to go to equinox and get a 

3912
02:47:52,181 --> 02:47:54,010
goddamn regular training.
Like a gentleman.

3913
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:57,070
I just want to get small.
He was making me big.

3914
02:47:57,071 --> 02:47:59,200
I got like,
I was way healthier,

3915
02:47:59,201 --> 02:48:00,280
I guess.
I don't know.

3916
02:48:00,281 --> 02:48:01,450
But uh,
you know,

3917
02:48:01,451 --> 02:48:03,940
and now when I laugh I could feel my 
core is really good in there.

3918
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:06,220
But there's a lot of shit on top of this
core right now.

3919
02:48:06,670 --> 02:48:08,200
Well,
I can help you with that.

3920
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:09,970
I got to go.
I'm going to connect you with,

3921
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:11,680
with that.
If you follow his diet,

3922
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:13,450
it will without a doubt.
Clean you up.

3923
02:48:15,070 --> 02:48:16,540
We're going to make that happen.
Russell peters,

3924
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:19,780
a lady loves to cook for me.
So she'll cook whatever we tell it,

3925
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:21,310
man.
It's going to be hard though.

3926
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:24,790
The real way to get your body to lose 
weight is you got to get off the fucking

3927
02:48:24,791 --> 02:48:25,900
carbs and the sugar.

3928
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:27,073
Yes.
Those are the most addictive things in 

3929
02:48:28,570 --> 02:48:29,560
the world.
I know.

3930
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:31,173
The key is don't torture yourself 
relentlessly like every now and then 

3931
02:48:34,691 --> 02:48:37,900
you've got to give yourself a break.
Give yourself a little reward.

3932
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:42,550
When I was training with a raise,
I would get a one day treat cheat day.

3933
02:48:42,690 --> 02:48:43,523
Yeah,
I would go fucking nuts on that day 

3934
02:48:45,401 --> 02:48:47,560
though.
What'd you have to have?

3935
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:49,000
Pizza.
I would go to.

3936
02:48:49,090 --> 02:48:49,923
I went to tommy's,
I had chili cheese fries and a double 

3937
02:48:53,471 --> 02:48:55,360
cheeseburger.
So like,

3938
02:48:55,361 --> 02:48:56,600
this is an one day,
you know,

3939
02:48:56,650 --> 02:48:58,390
I was going in cake,
ice cream.

3940
02:48:58,391 --> 02:49:01,360
I went in on everything,
you know my friend eddie bravo.

3941
02:49:01,361 --> 02:49:02,194
Right?
And of course when eddie bravo used to 

3942
02:49:02,981 --> 02:49:07,980
be on the atkins diet and then he went 
from the atkins diet everY day too,

3943
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:10,440
who would have like a sunday and sunday 
would be as cheat day.

3944
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:11,723
And Then sunday started,
started kicking in around saturday at 

3945
02:49:14,371 --> 02:49:16,040
midnight.
That's it.

3946
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:18,480
And so then he saId,
well fuck it man.

3947
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:20,850
If it's saturday at midnight,
why don't I just do the whole weekend?

3948
02:49:20,851 --> 02:49:22,320
I don't want to.
I don't want to worry about this.

3949
02:49:22,321 --> 02:49:23,610
Let me start.
I'll start it,

3950
02:49:23,930 --> 02:49:26,280
I'll,
I'll start the cheat day on friday,

3951
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:30,590
so he went friday,
so it was basically four days atkins,

3952
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:34,320
but when he did one day,
when he did one day,

3953
02:49:34,350 --> 02:49:37,740
he was legendary with what he would 
throw down.

3954
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:40,410
I mean he would eat stacks of fucking 
pancakes.

3955
02:49:40,411 --> 02:49:43,110
He would eat bowls of ice cream,
cheese,

3956
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:44,220
burgers,
pizza.

3957
02:49:44,221 --> 02:49:45,054
He would go off,
I mean just go off and he would do it 

3958
02:49:47,581 --> 02:49:48,414
with such lust,
like a guy who had been depriving 

3959
02:49:50,281 --> 02:49:51,650
himself for six days.

3960
02:49:51,740 --> 02:49:52,910
Exactly how it was.
It was.

3961
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:58,040
It was very therapeutic.
Like what is the most disgusted you ever

3962
02:49:58,041 --> 02:50:00,550
felt yourself on a cheat day?
Oh,

3963
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:01,220
I did.
It was.

3964
02:50:01,220 --> 02:50:02,053
That was the first cheat days when I 
went in because I went to ihop for 

3965
02:50:06,081 --> 02:50:09,440
breakfast and had the country fried 
steak with scrambled eggs and cheese and

3966
02:50:09,441 --> 02:50:13,550
then I had the pancakes and then later 
on I had pizza as a snack.

3967
02:50:13,940 --> 02:50:16,520
Oh my god.
When I had went to tommy's,

3968
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:17,373
because like,
because five guys was too far because I 

3969
02:50:18,741 --> 02:50:20,250
really wanted five guys.
I'd say,

3970
02:50:20,660 --> 02:50:21,493
dude,
I had chicken fried steak in Montana 

3971
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:24,223
where they really know how to make it 
like rancher style with the country 

3972
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:28,420
countries.
No.

3973
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,940
Yeah.
Oh,

3974
02:50:30,310 --> 02:50:33,280
it's just so good though.
It was a glorious cheat meal.

3975
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:37,660
It was smothered in this,
this delicious gravy.

3976
02:50:39,730 --> 02:50:42,220
See,
you don't get that from healthy food.

3977
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:43,390
No,
I know.

3978
02:50:43,390 --> 02:50:44,223
You don't get that feeling.
There's just a crazy car billowed 

3979
02:50:47,201 --> 02:50:49,540
feeling that you get.
It's a.

3980
02:50:50,380 --> 02:50:53,400
It's a weird warmth.
it's a good warmth.

3981
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:57,460
A bowl of spaghetti with meatballs,
like when you're sucking down that

3982
02:50:58,400 --> 02:50:59,233
fan of the fettuccine alfredo with 
chicken and they usually use pen a 

3983
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:03,433
noodles because I don't want to be 
slapped in the face with fucking 

3984
02:51:05,961 --> 02:51:07,910
fettuccine [inaudible].
That's a good move.

3985
02:51:08,310 --> 02:51:09,143
That's a good move as well.
I'm particularly fond of linguine with 

3986
02:51:11,661 --> 02:51:13,160
clams,
with white sauce.

3987
02:51:13,640 --> 02:51:15,210
Done correctly.
No,

3988
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:16,063
ken defend.
There's no takedown defense to the 

3989
02:51:19,761 --> 02:51:21,890
linguine with clams.
You know what else is really good,

3990
02:51:21,891 --> 02:51:26,630
man?
I'm lobster fried diablo with linguini.

3991
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:29,300
I do not know this.
Oh my goodness.

3992
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:32,090
Your appetite and you know,
three quarters,

3993
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:33,200
three quarters,
one quarter,

3994
02:51:33,201 --> 02:51:33,810
irish.

3995
02:51:33,810 --> 02:51:34,141
Uh,
yeah.

3996
02:51:34,141 --> 02:51:39,141
It's a spicy spicy tomato sauce with 
lobster and spaghetti,

3997
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:46,260
jesus christ,
jesus christ,

3998
02:51:46,261 --> 02:51:47,550
Russell Peters.
It's so.

3999
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:51,330
I think you're going to have a cheat day
to day gather with garlic bread and you,

4000
02:51:51,331 --> 02:51:51,930
uh,
you,

4001
02:51:51,930 --> 02:51:54,780
you put some parmesan cheese on top of 
it.

4002
02:51:54,781 --> 02:51:57,090
JusT some grated parmesan on the top of 
that bitch.

4003
02:51:59,810 --> 02:52:02,630
God damn,
that's so good.

4004
02:52:02,631 --> 02:52:05,030
People tell you they,
you never should put cheese on.

4005
02:52:05,830 --> 02:52:08,710
Like if you get linguine with clams,
they tell you not to put the cheese on.

4006
02:52:08,711 --> 02:52:12,010
And oftentImes if you go to a proper 
italian restaurant won't give it.

4007
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:12,933
They get mad at you.
If you try to put cheese on that 

4008
02:52:15,371 --> 02:52:17,920
linguine clam sauce,
those people are assholes.

4009
02:52:18,310 --> 02:52:21,440
They don't know shit.
Attends clams,

4010
02:52:22,550 --> 02:52:25,640
protective of the way things are done in
toronto.

4011
02:52:25,641 --> 02:52:29,570
The italians are first generation,
so everyBody speaks italian and they are

4012
02:52:29,571 --> 02:52:30,404
very italian and I love italian 
sandwiches and they get so mad when I 

4013
02:52:33,681 --> 02:52:37,070
walk into the fucking italian store,
they're happy to see me at first.

4014
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:37,933
Hey.
And then I picked the bread and then 

4015
02:52:39,950 --> 02:52:40,880
like,
what do you want on it?

4016
02:52:41,010 --> 02:52:41,843
I go,
ah,

4017
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,650
no.
I go,

4018
02:52:43,700 --> 02:52:45,380
you're going to get mad.
I need butter on the bread.

4019
02:52:46,510 --> 02:52:47,343
Thank you.

4020
02:52:47,970 --> 02:52:48,803
And then I go and then,
then I picked the mates and they're 

4021
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:51,690
like,
all right,

4022
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:52,890
that's it.
And I go,

4023
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:54,530
can I get some manet's on that?

4024
02:52:55,210 --> 02:52:57,410
Oh for fuck's sake.
You want me to shit on the bread,

4025
02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:58,593
but I get so mad.
They literally asked me if you want me 

4026
02:53:02,331 --> 02:53:05,060
to shit on your sandwich too because 
you're fucking it up kid.

4027
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:07,340
Well how can they do that when they're 
asking you what,

4028
02:53:07,420 --> 02:53:08,930
what they lock on it.
That's one way.

4029
02:53:08,931 --> 02:53:09,764
Subway superior.
So it is not giving you a hard time for 

4030
02:53:12,231 --> 02:53:13,250
your choices.
You know,

4031
02:53:13,251 --> 02:53:15,290
you could just say salami with hot 
peppers.

4032
02:53:15,291 --> 02:53:16,124
They're like,
okay.

4033
02:53:16,490 --> 02:53:20,920
And that's white subway.
Not a subway old guy.

4034
02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:22,243
But uh,
Kevin James and I went to this italian 

4035
02:53:24,801 --> 02:53:27,200
restaurant once and we both wanted 
linguine with clams,

4036
02:53:27,201 --> 02:53:29,600
with the cheese and it was like a big.
You can ask for the cheese.

4037
02:53:29,780 --> 02:53:31,280
I'm going to ask for the cheese.
Okay.

4038
02:53:31,370 --> 02:53:32,203
I'll ask for the cheat if you asked for 
the jeans because they don't want to 

4039
02:53:33,801 --> 02:53:34,550
give it to you.

4040
02:53:34,550 --> 02:53:35,383
They want to give you the linguine with 
clams and if you have a dish training 

4041
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:38,991
with eddie,
kevin,

4042
02:53:38,991 --> 02:53:40,160
james.
Uh,

4043
02:53:40,161 --> 02:53:41,000
no,
not right now.

4044
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:43,310
Why?
I know he was training for a bit.

4045
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:45,800
Then he's done a lot of training with 
bas rutan.

4046
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:46,820
Oh,
that's right with boss.

4047
02:53:46,821 --> 02:53:47,654
And he did some stuff with ray longo.
Kevin's actually really accomplished 

4048
02:53:50,901 --> 02:53:52,280
martial artists.
He's actually,

4049
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:54,710
he's got really good hands.
Very good kicks.

4050
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:56,650
Like he's a real martial artists,
you know,

4051
02:53:56,660 --> 02:53:59,450
he's a big guy but he,
he can fucking hit hard.

4052
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:00,553
Like it's kind of surprising if you ever
see him hit the bag or a hit the pads 

4053
02:54:03,621 --> 02:54:05,930
with mark [inaudible].
It's pretty impressive.

4054
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:07,090
Like,
you know,

4055
02:54:07,090 --> 02:54:08,540
he doesn't look like a professional 
fighter,

4056
02:54:08,541 --> 02:54:09,374
but he's a very confident and competent.
Rather a martial artist but didn't want 

4057
02:54:14,271 --> 02:54:17,240
to ask for that cheese.
Needed a got to keep that she's coming.

4058
02:54:17,420 --> 02:54:20,930
But if you were right next to me and it 
was in red sauce and meatballs,

4059
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:21,793
they would offer you the cheese cheese.
So you would make somebody ordered that 

4060
02:54:24,231 --> 02:54:25,620
oN the side.
Just know you.

4061
02:54:25,630 --> 02:54:26,463
You would be right next to me and he 
would offer you the cheese and they 

4062
02:54:28,101 --> 02:54:30,110
would walk away and I'd be like,
what about me?

4063
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:30,800
And like,
sir,

4064
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:35,120
we do not recommend the cheese for this 
because it will be two delicious.

4065
02:54:35,370 --> 02:54:36,740
Yeah,
if you wouldn't be able to handle it.

4066
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:39,570
We don't want you to euphoria.
Well,

4067
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:42,140
they have very specific taste that you 
want to take in.

4068
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:44,300
They want you to take in the taste of 
the noodles,

4069
02:54:44,570 --> 02:54:49,010
the olive oil spices and the clams.
That's perfection.

4070
02:54:49,100 --> 02:54:50,690
Take it in.
Take it in like that.

4071
02:54:51,240 --> 02:54:52,073
Like,
nah,

4072
02:54:52,130 --> 02:54:55,320
I need to add my own perfection to this 
perfection cheese on this motherfucker.

4073
02:54:55,330 --> 02:54:58,610
You got to catch up on my daughter.
My daughter loves the cheese too,

4074
02:54:58,611 --> 02:55:01,160
so she'll be like,
when I make her a little pasta,

4075
02:55:01,161 --> 02:55:01,731
she was like,
daddy,

4076
02:55:01,731 --> 02:55:02,564
can I put the cheese?
And then she it and dumps it on their 

4077
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:06,710
kids.
Love cheese tastes good.

4078
02:55:07,510 --> 02:55:10,430
It's rewarding you.
Some sort of weird lactose way.

4079
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:11,293
It's giving you some weird,
very slow trouble helping the bones was 

4080
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:16,070
supposedly right.
Calcium,

4081
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:19,880
but cheese.
Cheese is way better when it's raw.

4082
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:22,240
You remember raw cheese?
No,

4083
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:24,260
I have not.
I've been getting into rochester herds.

4084
02:55:24,261 --> 02:55:25,710
You made now raw.
He's like,

4085
02:55:25,790 --> 02:55:28,220
get cheese from place that uses raw 
milk.

4086
02:55:29,630 --> 02:55:32,180
Um,
I've been getting into that and drinking

4087
02:55:32,181 --> 02:55:34,250
raw milk.
Been drinking a lot of raw milk lately.

4088
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:36,080
You'd only goat's milk.
I'm not have,

4089
02:55:36,081 --> 02:55:38,090
I have drinken raw goat's milk,
but no,

4090
02:55:38,091 --> 02:55:41,510
you just raw cow's milk.
You can get it from some,

4091
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:46,720
some sustainable farms and um,
some like erewhon gary's cold though,

4092
02:55:47,001 --> 02:55:47,330
right?

4093
02:55:47,330 --> 02:55:48,500
Yeah.
Tastes delicious.

4094
02:55:48,501 --> 02:55:49,910
Dude.
It's so much better.

4095
02:55:50,150 --> 02:55:53,870
It goes down easier.
Like regular milk feels weird and one of

4096
02:55:53,871 --> 02:55:55,470
the reasons why regular milk feels 
weird.

4097
02:55:55,471 --> 02:55:56,304
It's because it's homogenized and 
pasteurized and apparently there's 

4098
02:55:58,101 --> 02:56:03,101
enzymes in milk that when you're boiling
the milk to treat it and make it sort of

4099
02:56:03,381 --> 02:56:06,950
lasts longer and so it doesn't have any 
ds and you're killing all the good stuff

4100
02:56:06,951 --> 02:56:07,784
too.
So your body is drinking this weird 

4101
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:10,273
liquidy protein.
It doesn't exactly know what to do with 

4102
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:14,570
like during chemotherapy on milk because
everything,

4103
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:15,770
a lot of it.
Yeah.

4104
02:56:15,860 --> 02:56:17,120
In a lot of ways it is,
yeah,

4105
02:56:17,570 --> 02:56:21,050
it's just boiling the fuck out of it.
But when you don't have it that way,

4106
02:56:21,051 --> 02:56:22,820
when you just have cold,
raw milk,

4107
02:56:22,850 --> 02:56:25,220
it's way better.
It tastes better.

4108
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:28,340
It feels smooth when it goes down.
So one thing that people,

4109
02:56:28,341 --> 02:56:29,890
uh,
um,

4110
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:31,610
comment on when they drink it,
they're like,

4111
02:56:31,611 --> 02:56:32,660
wow,
it's really smooth.

4112
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:33,993
Like,
because it's got all the stuff that 

4113
02:56:35,170 --> 02:56:39,390
you're supposed to drink and people tell
you you're not supposed to drink milk.

4114
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:41,540
No.
They taste a little different.

4115
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:44,330
His better to me.
To me,

4116
02:56:44,331 --> 02:56:45,620
I think it tastes better.
I mean some people,

4117
02:56:45,621 --> 02:56:48,740
like some people like low fat milk.
I think that shit's disgusting.

4118
02:56:49,100 --> 02:56:53,210
I'd rather just drink water or low fat 
milk tastes weird and coffee.

4119
02:56:53,211 --> 02:56:55,490
I like to put half and half.
I like that too.

4120
02:56:56,150 --> 02:56:58,220
This is getting to a.
What do I like show?

4121
02:56:58,650 --> 02:56:59,483
I do like mason.
Welcome to the joe rogan experience

02:57:01,431 --> 02:57:03,110
where we're talking about coffee and 
things.

4123
02:57:03,111 --> 02:57:06,280
We liken it back when there was a 
milkman delivered milk everyday,

4124
02:57:06,290 --> 02:57:08,800
whether it had been fucking your wife.
that's what I was doing.

4125
02:57:08,801 --> 02:57:09,510
I said,
well,

4126
02:57:09,510 --> 02:57:10,343
that's the big milk,
because they had to do it all the time 

4127
02:57:12,340 --> 02:57:14,180
because it was 100 percent raw mouth 
probably.

4128
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,790
I wonder when they came up with the 
homogenization process,

4129
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:18,493
imagination,
once they did come up with the 

4130
02:57:20,271 --> 02:57:22,400
pasteurization.
That's louie pastor.

4131
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:24,230
You got to find it.
That's interesting.

4132
02:57:24,231 --> 02:57:27,920
I wonder how much of that was raw and 
how much of it was pasteurized when they

4133
02:57:27,921 --> 02:57:30,510
started doing that on a big scale,
but it's.

4134
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:32,630
It's imperative if you want to like keep
it on the shelf,

4135
02:57:32,900 --> 02:57:33,733
like you're not going to be able to keep
raw milk on the shelf for very long 

4136
02:57:36,470 --> 02:57:37,303
because I've had it in my house for just
a couple of days and it noticeably goes 

4137
02:57:39,561 --> 02:57:42,620
bad in the refrigerator.
Not bad where you can't drInk it,

4138
02:57:42,621 --> 02:57:44,000
but to wear it.
It's like,

4139
02:57:44,001 --> 02:57:44,834
wow,
this is on the door of getting funky 

4140
02:57:48,390 --> 02:57:51,590
text after text my ex wife because I got
to pick up my daughter.

4141
02:57:53,740 --> 02:57:54,573
What do you got there?
Jamie found that weird milk milestones 

4142
02:57:57,021 --> 02:58:01,280
of milk history of us in 1950 there was 
milk vending machines.

4143
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:02,453
Whoa.

4144
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:03,950
When did they start?
Okay,

4145
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:04,833
find out.
There's a lot of first compulsory 

4146
02:58:06,341 --> 02:58:09,280
pasteurization law in chicago applying 
the milk,

4147
02:58:09,281 --> 02:58:14,281
except that except that from to burke.
Kulin tested cows 19.

4148
02:58:15,101 --> 02:58:15,934
Oh,
eight

4149
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:21,060
tuberculin hm.
What Is that?

4150
02:58:22,110 --> 02:58:23,490
Is that,
is that tuberculosis?

4151
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:28,530
Brucellosis.
Is that brucellosis is.

4152
02:58:28,531 --> 02:58:30,990
Brucellosis is something that cows get 
that I know.

4153
02:58:30,991 --> 02:58:33,150
Um,
it's like,

4154
02:58:33,151 --> 02:58:33,984
uh,
one of the main concerns about a 

4155
02:58:36,570 --> 02:58:40,950
different wildlife populations mingling,
especially buffalo,

4156
02:58:40,980 --> 02:58:44,730
like some buffalo have brucellosis and 
they can get it to cows.

4157
02:58:44,990 --> 02:58:45,823
So 19,
19 and milk was sold successfully for 

4158
02:58:48,091 --> 02:58:48,924
the first time in Connecticut.
And then a couple more years passed by 

4159
02:58:52,981 --> 02:58:54,300
before.
Uh,

4160
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:56,520
let's see.
First farm belt,

4161
02:58:56,790 --> 02:59:01,230
first farm bulk tanks for milk began 
replacing milk cans in 1938.

4162
02:59:01,231 --> 02:59:02,064
And then every other day milk delivery 
started in 42 and then it was added to 

4163
02:59:05,341 --> 02:59:06,690
school lunches and 46.

4164
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:07,633
Yeah.
But when It was in 42 is that 

4165
02:59:09,201 --> 02:59:12,980
homogenized and pasteurized milk when 
they started initially as a conservation

4166
02:59:12,981 --> 02:59:15,890
measure,
I wonder if they do it every day and you

4167
02:59:15,891 --> 02:59:18,170
have an ice box in your house,
you probably don't have to.

4168
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:19,973
That's kind of crazy though.
They relied on a guy to come by with a 

4169
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:22,304
milk,
like that's how everybody got their 

4170
02:59:22,881 --> 02:59:24,140
milk.
Also,

4171
02:59:24,141 --> 02:59:24,974
people's lifespans.
Life expectancies were a lot shorter 

4172
02:59:26,601 --> 02:59:27,680
back then.
It was.

4173
02:59:27,710 --> 02:59:29,780
So is this a good thing or bad thing 
that we did?

4174
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:32,770
Um,
they were shorter than.

4175
02:59:32,780 --> 02:59:34,150
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

4176
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:35,150
Yeah.
Well,

4177
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:36,433
let's.
Because people dIdn't understand 

4178
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:39,230
medicine or vitamins.
True target.

4179
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:40,073
Nineteen 30.
They just knocked you over the head 

4180
02:59:41,631 --> 02:59:42,464
with.
They had to do surgery when he was a 

4181
02:59:45,281 --> 02:59:47,090
kid.
No way for real.

4182
02:59:47,320 --> 02:59:48,081
Yeah.
No,

4183
02:59:48,081 --> 02:59:49,760
not scurvy or ricketts.
He had rickets,

4184
02:59:50,540 --> 02:59:53,090
rickets.
Where does that come from?

4185
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:54,920
I don't know.
Nutrition or something.

4186
02:59:54,950 --> 02:59:57,530
He's had it when he was a baby and then 
a stunted his growth.

4187
02:59:57,531 --> 03:00:00,320
So you only became like five.
I was tallest.

4188
03:00:00,321 --> 03:00:01,041
Maybe five,
three,

4189
03:00:01,041 --> 03:00:01,874
five,
four.

4190
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,940
I think when we get older in our 
lifetimes,

4191
03:00:04,941 --> 03:00:06,690
there's gonna come a point in time where
they,

4192
03:00:06,750 --> 03:00:11,750
they laugh at people being sick or 
people being injured.

4193
03:00:12,081 --> 03:00:14,750
I think they're gonna be able to repair 
our bodies perfectly.

4194
03:00:14,780 --> 03:00:15,613
They're gonna be able to regenerate 
limbs within the next 50 a hundred 

4195
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:19,303
years.
It's probably going to be so many crazy 

4196
03:00:20,301 --> 03:00:24,780
advancements to medical science.
We're going to look back on injuries and

4197
03:00:24,781 --> 03:00:26,600
the treatment of injuries,
the way we do it today,

4198
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:27,841
you know,
that's,

4199
03:00:27,841 --> 03:00:28,580
I think,
you know,

4200
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:30,980
once they get the stem cells shit.
Right.

4201
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:33,440
Have you had any of that yet?
No.

4202
03:00:33,441 --> 03:00:33,891
I,
you know,

4203
03:00:33,891 --> 03:00:37,130
when I was in India last year on tour,
this guy gave me some,

4204
03:00:37,530 --> 03:00:38,363
um,
like a face stuff that gives you a 

4205
03:00:41,751 --> 03:00:42,740
facial.
Yeah.

4206
03:00:42,741 --> 03:00:43,574
He was really friendly and I just stood 
there always some sort of oil to rub on 

4207
03:00:48,561 --> 03:00:51,230
my face that had stem cells in it.
probably bullshit.

4208
03:00:51,290 --> 03:00:52,310
yeah.
And he was like,

4209
03:00:52,311 --> 03:00:52,790
oh,
you're gonna.

4210
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:55,430
See it's gonna have an immediate effect.
and they call me bro,

4211
03:00:55,431 --> 03:00:56,264
I love to do business with you.
and then I did it for like two months 

4212
03:00:58,251 --> 03:00:59,020
and I was like,
nope.

4213
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:00,070
Nothing.
All it did was give

4214
03:01:00,070 --> 03:01:01,480
me a couple of pimples.
It's with it.

4215
03:01:02,020 --> 03:01:03,100
Yeah.
It's probably bullshit,

4216
03:01:03,130 --> 03:01:04,600
man.
The real stem cell shit,

4217
03:01:04,601 --> 03:01:06,880
they're going to inject in you.
They have to keep it cold.

4218
03:01:07,110 --> 03:01:08,770
It's.
Yeah.

4219
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:09,521
I didn't,
didn't,

4220
03:01:09,521 --> 03:01:12,160
didn't do anything for me.
We're going to be,

4221
03:01:12,161 --> 03:01:17,161
I think the first group of people to see
people live like deep into the hundreds.

4222
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:19,143
I think it's going to be real weird.
Like what is a 200 year old healthy 

4223
03:01:22,301 --> 03:01:25,120
person going to be like,
how strange is it going to be if they're

4224
03:01:25,121 --> 03:01:25,954
really figure out a way to regenerate 
tissue and keep someone in a relatively 

4225
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:34,540
healthy state and you get to see like 
the wisdom of someone that's two,

4226
03:01:34,541 --> 03:01:35,910
300 years old.
He's like,

4227
03:01:36,190 --> 03:01:37,510
you're 40.
What'd you say?

4228
03:01:37,511 --> 03:01:39,070
Over 46.
40 six.

4229
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:41,650
How much smarter you than when you were 
26.

4230
03:01:41,830 --> 03:01:43,540
Whole lot.
Lot,

4231
03:01:43,570 --> 03:01:44,570
right?
Hold that.

4232
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:48,130
If you live to be 146,
how much smarter would you be?

4233
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:49,143
pretty good.
Now,

4234
03:01:49,750 --> 03:01:52,300
as long as you're coherent.
What if you looked exactly the same?

4235
03:01:52,540 --> 03:01:54,370
That'd be pretty awesome.
That'd be strange.

4236
03:01:54,460 --> 03:01:55,350
It'd be strange.
But also,

4237
03:01:55,660 --> 03:01:57,820
did you feel guilty if you're getting 
pussy at 1:46?

4238
03:01:57,850 --> 03:01:58,683
Nope.

4239
03:02:00,470 --> 03:02:02,470
I was getting busy when I was fighting 
at 1:47

4240
03:02:03,610 --> 03:02:05,970
back in the day.
I uh,

4241
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:09,240
um,
I think if they can,

4242
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:12,640
they can get the hgh thing right.
Make it cancer free.

4243
03:02:12,730 --> 03:02:13,563
I think that there's a possibility,
there's no correlation between hgh and 

4244
03:02:16,681 --> 03:02:17,514
cancer.
The correlations between abuse of hgh 

4245
03:02:21,101 --> 03:02:26,101
and some issues and also cancer with a 
bunch of different factors.

4246
03:02:26,890 --> 03:02:31,630
Environmental factors,
factors like diet factors like heredity.

4247
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:32,793
There's a bunch of different shit,
but there's a concern that if you are 

4248
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:41,020
supplementing with human growth hormone 
and a cancer grows in your body,

4249
03:02:41,021 --> 03:02:44,140
that it could grow more.
that is a concern,

4250
03:02:44,410 --> 03:02:45,243
but I don't think there's any real 
evidence to support that concern that 

4251
03:02:47,651 --> 03:02:50,980
I've ever read.
But what's interesting about cancer that

4252
03:02:50,981 --> 03:02:54,430
I've been reading a lot about is when 
you get your body to,

4253
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:55,693
if you get your body to a place where 
it's used to a bunch of different 

4254
03:03:01,301 --> 03:03:04,150
chemicals that are,
that are in the environment,

4255
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:07,180
whether it's pollutants or whether it's 
uh,

4256
03:03:07,181 --> 03:03:07,930
you know,
and uh,

4257
03:03:07,930 --> 03:03:09,910
something that you work with,
like,

4258
03:03:10,330 --> 03:03:10,780
like,
uh,

4259
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:14,140
people that work around like really 
strong chemicals.

4260
03:03:14,140 --> 03:03:14,973
People that work like with automotive 
stuff like all the bondos and epoxies 

4261
03:03:20,981 --> 03:03:22,750
and all that.
Like those people,

4262
03:03:22,751 --> 03:03:23,584
their cancer numbers.
Whenever you work with a lot of 

4263
03:03:25,391 --> 03:03:28,030
chemicals and cancer numbers get crazy 
high,

4264
03:03:28,570 --> 03:03:31,060
like that seems to be where the big risk
is.

4265
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:34,540
His diet and people that work around 
chemicals.

4266
03:03:34,990 --> 03:03:35,823
There's a lot of people that are out 
there that they just took a job because 

4267
03:03:38,471 --> 03:03:39,304
it's a good job and it pays well,
but you're in like a slow death 

4268
03:03:42,281 --> 03:03:44,590
sentence.
Absolutely.

4269
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:47,200
That fucking sucks,
man.

4270
03:03:47,430 --> 03:03:49,140
That's got to be the weirdest way to 
make a living,

4271
03:03:49,150 --> 03:03:53,210
to be trapped in a,
in a gig where you're very job itself,

4272
03:03:53,211 --> 03:03:54,400
uh,
slowly chew in a way.

4273
03:03:54,401 --> 03:03:57,160
Your body while you were doing comedy in
the nineties as well.

4274
03:03:57,230 --> 03:03:58,160
And remember going

4275
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:01,310
to clubs on the for the whole weekend 
and be full of fucking smoke.

4276
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:02,420
Oh yeah.
I remember.

4277
03:04:02,421 --> 03:04:04,370
I remember just leaving gigs.
I just,

4278
03:04:05,270 --> 03:04:06,103
it fucking rick.
You couldn't wear the same clothes 

4279
03:04:07,401 --> 03:04:10,340
twice.
He couldn't had the shower as soon as he

4280
03:04:10,341 --> 03:04:11,174
got back home.
And oftentimes he didn't realize it 

4281
03:04:12,771 --> 03:04:14,150
until you open up your bag,
right?

4282
03:04:14,460 --> 03:04:15,740
Yeah.
You clothes,

4283
03:04:15,770 --> 03:04:17,150
take your clothes out.
When you got home you're like,

4284
03:04:17,151 --> 03:04:20,660
what the fuck?
He just stunk like cigarettes.

4285
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:23,780
But cigarettes,
if you're a waitress,

4286
03:04:23,810 --> 03:04:25,340
it's the worst,
like a lot,

4287
03:04:25,341 --> 03:04:26,900
directly in the line of fire with them 
then.

4288
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:27,793
And you're there all the time.
Like in the days when they used to be 

4289
03:04:29,121 --> 03:04:29,954
able to smoke in bars.
I bet a lot of chicks got a lot of 

4290
03:04:32,481 --> 03:04:35,390
waitresses got a cancer from secondhand 
smoke.

4291
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:37,220
Yeah.
I just remembered.

4292
03:04:38,070 --> 03:04:40,670
And the worst the gig,
the more the smoke for some reason.

4293
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:42,590
It's just crazy.
That wasn't that long ago.

4294
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:43,943
Really wasn't,
wasn't I remember when they banned 

4295
03:04:46,311 --> 03:04:47,630
smoking.
Must've been around 2000,

4296
03:04:47,631 --> 03:04:51,860
maybe 99 maybe at the latest.
Yeah.

4297
03:04:51,861 --> 03:04:52,694
The weird improvements that that 
happened that are pretty goddamn 

4298
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:57,970
significant at the time.
People are protesting.

4299
03:04:58,360 --> 03:05:01,590
We willing to smoke in bars.
We knew there was a,

4300
03:05:01,591 --> 03:05:03,980
I remember people complaining saying 
that pool halls,

4301
03:05:03,981 --> 03:05:04,814
we're going to go out of business 
because they wouldn't allow people to 

4302
03:05:05,931 --> 03:05:08,680
smoke in them anymore.
People had to stand outside to smoke.

4303
03:05:08,681 --> 03:05:11,970
And then the old days everybody smoked 
indoors too.

4304
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:15,050
Fucking weird.
Gross habit planes,

4305
03:05:16,620 --> 03:05:17,600
you know fitzsimmons,
right?

4306
03:05:17,660 --> 03:05:20,970
Yeah.
Fitzsimmons parents were um,

4307
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:24,080
chainsmokers when he was a kid and they 
lived in boston.

4308
03:05:24,081 --> 03:05:27,140
So it's the winter and the windows are 
closed,

4309
03:05:27,260 --> 03:05:30,640
locked down,
and they are smoking in the house chain,

4310
03:05:30,641 --> 03:05:32,930
smoking with the kids.
Greg gets asthma.

4311
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:33,980
He's got asthma from this.

4312
03:05:34,610 --> 03:05:36,350
They'd be in the car going on a road 
trip,

4313
03:05:36,410 --> 03:05:40,000
smoking in their car windows.
My friend's father smoked.

4314
03:05:40,001 --> 03:05:40,834
They would do that shit in the car.
Wintertime wouldn't roll down the 

4315
03:05:42,411 --> 03:05:43,010
window.
Fuck.

4316
03:05:43,010 --> 03:05:46,790
It's too cold.
Make everybody breathe your smoke.

4317
03:05:47,780 --> 03:05:51,110
Is there any habit like that where you 
forced the consequences of your habit on

4318
03:05:51,111 --> 03:05:53,270
other people?
Maybe alcoholism.

4319
03:05:54,020 --> 03:05:57,380
Imagine if you dated someone and they 
farted on you so much.

4320
03:05:57,710 --> 03:05:59,960
Your clothes smell like farts.
He'd be like,

4321
03:06:00,380 --> 03:06:03,560
god jusT keeps farting.
She's always farting on me.

4322
03:06:03,620 --> 03:06:05,090
I like that.
We blamed it on her.

4323
03:06:05,360 --> 03:06:07,280
Well,
I'm saying if you dated someone,

4324
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,350
I'm saying if you dated someone,
I mean,

4325
03:06:09,351 --> 03:06:10,820
I'm assuming you're not dating any 
dudes.

4326
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:11,350
No,
no.

4327
03:06:11,350 --> 03:06:14,420
But if you were dating a dude and the 
dude just farted all over you,

4328
03:06:14,490 --> 03:06:15,440
like you'd come home,
be like,

4329
03:06:15,441 --> 03:06:17,000
mike,
we can't fuck anymore.

4330
03:06:17,240 --> 03:06:19,070
Every time I take my clothes out of the 
bag,

4331
03:06:19,460 --> 03:06:20,690
I smell farts.

4332
03:06:20,990 --> 03:06:23,600
I bring it home.
People go somebody 40 on you?

4333
03:06:23,660 --> 03:06:24,493
Yeah.
Mike was farting all over me and 

4334
03:06:25,701 --> 03:06:27,260
surprised.
I'm surprised my lady.

4335
03:06:27,261 --> 03:06:30,080
It doesn't smell like farts.
I rip on her sleep.

4336
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:35,800
He's addicted to foreign on her leg to.
She doesn't even flinch when you fart on

4337
03:06:36,651 --> 03:06:37,890
her.
Don't let her live.

4338
03:06:37,891 --> 03:06:38,780
Huh?
Wow.

4339
03:06:38,781 --> 03:06:42,470
You just fart on her.
But it not like I'm trying to talk about

4340
03:06:42,471 --> 03:06:46,010
it because he come up.
He kind of giggled about it.

4341
03:06:46,011 --> 03:06:46,760
So.
Wow.

4342
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:48,260
She's a trooper.
she is a trooper.

4343
03:06:48,261 --> 03:06:49,940
Thug life.
Yeah.

4344
03:06:50,630 --> 03:06:51,463
that's not good for on people but it.
But it's essentially what people were 

4345
03:06:55,651 --> 03:06:55,980
doing with

4346
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:57,000
cigarette smokes.
Right?

4347
03:06:57,450 --> 03:07:00,210
Which is getting into your clothes and 
you were smelling like cigarette smoke.

4348
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:04,740
You were making people smell like what 
you were into.

4349
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:05,783
Yeah.
and then whatever disease you were x a 

4350
03:07:09,060 --> 03:07:11,500
susceptible to.
So are you now you,

4351
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:13,950
it,
it doesn't smell as bad as a fart,

4352
03:07:14,910 --> 03:07:17,250
but it's just,
it's as obnoxious.

4353
03:07:17,430 --> 03:07:18,870
It's in the neighborhood.
Right.

4354
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:22,580
It's like a hard left from a fart,
but it's still gross.

4355
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:24,040
So.
Yeah.

4356
03:07:24,570 --> 03:07:26,710
But it doesn't smell like shit right 
now.

4357
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:28,470
A fart is my,
as george carlin said,

4358
03:07:28,471 --> 03:07:29,370
shit.
Without the mess,

4359
03:07:29,940 --> 03:07:32,220
is that what you're saying?
What's ended on that?

4360
03:07:32,590 --> 03:07:33,900
That's the perfect way to end this 
thing.

4361
03:07:34,530 --> 03:07:37,620
Powerful george carlin from beyond the 
grave gets the best line of the show.

4362
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:41,250
Hilarious photo.
Powerful.

4363
03:07:41,251 --> 03:07:43,140
Russell peters.
Thank you very much for coming in here.

4364
03:07:43,141 --> 03:07:43,950
Dude.
It was phonics.

4365
03:07:43,950 --> 03:07:44,783
Joe.
Appreciate it.

4366
03:07:44,970 --> 03:07:46,380
And uh,
indian food,

4367
03:07:46,410 --> 03:07:47,310
we're going to make it happen,
right?

4368
03:07:47,580 --> 03:07:49,530
Definitely the real deal.
Real deal.

4369
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:50,730
OkaY.
Bread,

4370
03:07:51,150 --> 03:07:51,961
garlic,
naan bread.

4371
03:07:51,961 --> 03:07:53,480
Is that the real deal?
Is that american shit?

4372
03:07:53,550 --> 03:07:54,510
But no,
that's north.

4373
03:07:54,540 --> 03:07:56,940
North India.
And you need to make that right.

4374
03:07:57,060 --> 03:07:58,350
Otherwise it's just,
you're.

4375
03:07:58,351 --> 03:07:59,750
Otherwise you're getting the north 
american one.

4376
03:08:00,030 --> 03:08:01,770
Okay.
You need a special oven for that.

4377
03:08:01,890 --> 03:08:04,950
This podcast is over cnx week fUckers.

4378
03:08:09,170 --> 03:08:10,460
Well,
we did what we could.
