1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,640
Now recording to server.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,460
We're now playing girl talk all day.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,630
All Day bitches.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,883

this is the rag.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,460
It was just a temp way.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,180
Him plays my eight hits at the side just
to hold the Gucci Bucket with the flap

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,820

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,191
Nigga.

12
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,380
This ain't no go on pal.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,250
I'm starting to slaughter.

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,770

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,150

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,674
Angela said,

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,151
no doubt.

19
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:45,510
We don't speak in a blink.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,430
Compose can have good sleep and in the
clinic and only cause they begin on the

21
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,980
seat is the Nigga be id.

22
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,060
I trying probably people in
the club and Tom to cut a rug.

23
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,643
I'm double

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,880
double visiting people in the club.

25
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,940
It's under Coteau Bro.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,260
We can't hold us up in this guy.

27
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:06,591
Just thought.

28
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:07,424
Does

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,730
it make you can grab a club stop.

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,593
I'm just playing.

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,390
Go talk to all my plays in the back.

32
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:14,760
Sipping,

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,593
Yak.

34
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,730
Is this the same dude?

35
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,270
Yeah.

36
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,990
This is a mash up a bunch of
songs by girl talk and who's the,

37
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,270
who's the wrapper that was,

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,631
you know,

39
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,464
I have no idea.

40
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,491
Damn,

41
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,324
that guy's good.

42
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,870
Yeah,

43
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,740
it has really good.

44
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:28,610
He's original too.

45
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:29,600
Like the way flows.

46
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,260
It's original.

47
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,041
I tell you girl talk.

48
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,251
It's a,

49
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,640
it's a,

50
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,890
it's a guy that matches songs
and if you go to his website,

51
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,720
it's been hammered since
he released this yesterday,

52
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,750
but he just released a new CD and the
best thing about girl talk where I trying

53
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,580
to find a lot of my music from it's,

54
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:43,190
I'll listen to that and he'll
match mash so much music.

55
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,330
And I like a part of a song.

56
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:44,541
I'm like,

57
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:44,781
all right,

58
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,460
who song the original part of this song?

59
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,413
Find out who that is.

60
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,810
New,

61
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,110
new,

62
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,621
new artists.

63
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,130
I like.

64
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,130
So girl talk is great for
finding out about new bands.

65
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,590
This is a weird time for music,

66
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:54,831
man.

67
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:58,970
They can just get famous by getting online
and having cool people find out about

68
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:01,430
it and they tell other cool people
and it spreads through email.

69
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,900
So much shit get,

70
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,340
there's just so many bands,

71
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:04,491
man.

72
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,080
It's impossible to follow
them all right now.

73
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,943
Yup.

74
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,050
It's the fucking Internet
bitches sticking over flashlight.

75
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,950
That's Brian.

76
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,790
That's him doing his professional duties
to alert me that we're supposed to say

77
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,000
that we are sponsored by
the flashlight and uh,

78
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
it's uh,

79
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:20,990
uh,

80
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,550
masturbation tool,

81
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,473
implement.

82
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,340
We've talked about it a million times.

83
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:27,200
I don't think there's any
other ways to describe it.

84
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,010
Uh,

85
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,180
I support the product.

86
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,290
It's effective.

87
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,101
It's,

88
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:31,934
uh,

89
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,850
it's quite embarrassing
if you cry it using it,

90
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,080
but whatever,

91
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,381
man,

92
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:37,340
you gotta get over that Shit.

93
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,540
I have successfully trick to people
and to putting their finger in my used

94
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,280
fleshlight in the last week.

95
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
That's not a trick,

96
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,993
man.

97
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,070
You ain't Lance Burton motherfucker.

98
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,990
You just an asshole.

99
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,330
But I did it live.

100
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,410
It's a trick.

101
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,250
I did it live on.

102
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,820
Why would you do that man?

103
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,580
Because they just test my dick.

104
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,710
You know how everyone's pulling out
their dicks and putting on your,

105
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,131
you know,

106
00:02:58,131 --> 00:02:59,060
at like all the comics,

107
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,291
Hey,

108
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,010
look at my dick.

109
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,770
Oh Hey,

110
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,270
you know,

111
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,050
all that stuff.

112
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,070
I found a way around it.

113
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:03,821
That's even worse.

114
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:07,660
You're touching my dick and
come to what is wrong with you?

115
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,700
Why would you want anyone to do that?

116
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,090
Yeah,

117
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,170
that's like a salt.

118
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,570
You can go to jail for whatever you do.

119
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,240
You could ruin a person's
night and ruin their sleep.

120
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,680
Ruined their performance at work.

121
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,270
It could lead to them getting fired.

122
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,110
They get fired.

123
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,460
Their wife is a lot of
pressure in the house.

124
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,251
She gets divorced,

125
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:23,230
their kids grow up.

126
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,040
Fucked up.

127
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,730
Why?

128
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,500
Because you decided one day on a
critical night to make this guide,

129
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:32,230
touch your use fleshlight and he's
fucking steaming all night fucking poured.

130
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,230
They go home and finger their girlfriends
and wives and I get them pregnant and

131
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,120
I start knocking up
bitches left and right.

132
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,220
Wow.

133
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,630
Could you imagine if that was possible?

134
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,950
Just stop and think for a second.

135
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,131
I mean,

136
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,570
I know that's a ridiculous notion,

137
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,890
but what would that be?

138
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,300
The saddest fucking way to get po?

139
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,760
Did you hear about that one
woman that got pregnant?

140
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,250
She blew a guy and she got stabbed.

141
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,060
Okay.

142
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,100
And somehow or another in the knife wound,

143
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,750
the fucking sperm got into her
uterus and fertilized her egg.

144
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,880
That is the or her ovaries.

145
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,420
Right.

146
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,830
What kind of wherever,

147
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,510
wherever the eggs are positioning kid,

148
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,300
is that going to turn
into a mansion that well,

149
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,571
the,

150
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:09,820
the crazy thing is I think
there was something nutty.

151
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,650
Like she was born with no vagina.

152
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,480
It was like the whole
thing was a freak show.

153
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,240
It was in Africa and I think
I might be making this up.

154
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,590
I think she was born with,

155
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:17,770
no,

156
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,431
I remember this.

157
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,010
I was born with no vagina
and she just run around.

158
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,740
I just guess given Dude's head,

159
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,160
the poor young thing,

160
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,480
it sounds like the birth
of a comic book heroes,

161
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,780
he was born in Africa to a woman would
know vagina from a gash in her over at

162
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,160
the bottom.

163
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,380
Is that the most like
no one can talk shit.

164
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,360
If you're from that situation
when you're at school,

165
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,141
you know you could,

166
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:41,351
you know,

167
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:41,861
kids can be like,

168
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:42,694
my dad's a cop,

169
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,320
you know,

170
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,931
and the guys would be like,

171
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,630
my dad is a fireman and he be like,

172
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't,

173
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,930
no one knows.

174
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,070
She was just sucking dicks and some
loads survived and someone stabbed her.

175
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,770
She shouldn't even have a vagina.

176
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,770
There was no exit for that.

177
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,140
Learn God.

178
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,390
What a fucking shitty roll the dice.

179
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,590
If you really believe in Karma and you
really believe that you are the product

180
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,020
of your past lives and
who you are and what you,

181
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,120
what you learned in those
lives and it's carrying over.

182
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,520
And that's why I know
not everyone is equal.

183
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
What the fuck did that guy do?

184
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,641
Well,

185
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:12,881
no,

186
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,190
and also like who is this vaginalis,

187
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,710
blowjob port girl.

188
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,173
Exactly.

189
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,260
The poor girl.

190
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,110
What a shit roll the dice man who is,

191
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,441
you know,

192
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,430
who is that girl?

193
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,780
What was she in another life?

194
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,221
Yeah,

195
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,641
I know.

196
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,300
It's like it,

197
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,660
it,

198
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,970
that's one of the big questions is
because if you do believe in Karma,

199
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,180
then you have to like,

200
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,960
it's almost like people use
that as a way to like not,

201
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,290
not accept the universe as being
like a really brutal place.

202
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,130
I get mad when people pretend that they
think they know how this thing works.

203
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,031
You know,

204
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:49,450
someone was trying to talk to me about
Karma and he was talking to me about how

205
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,040
he doesn't worry about crime ever.

206
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:51,851
I go,

207
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,091
why?

208
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,301
He goes,

209
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,100
because I just feel like if
you don't put that out there,

210
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,060
it doesn't come back at you.

211
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,271
I go,

212
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,104
that's ridiculous.

213
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,381
I go,

214
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,040
babies and bys explain it.

215
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,840
All right.

216
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,020
The baby putting that out there,

217
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,123
is that what's going on?

218
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,260
The babies putting that out
there and the baby gets shot.

219
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,250
Listen motherfucker,

220
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,630
this random shit that goes down.

221
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,291
Okay.

222
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:06,670
This,

223
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,670
just because you might have control over
your immediate environment most of the

224
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,600
time doesn't mean it's not,

225
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,291
you know,

226
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,400
the world's chaos man,

227
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:16,911
he can't tell me,

228
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
you know,

229
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,570
and it's like why the secret was
so offensive to a lot of people.

230
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,220
You know what all that was going on.

231
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Like you're telling me that all diseases
and everything that people will,

232
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,440
those on themselves really for real.

233
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:27,651
Okay.

234
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,011
So much.

235
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,610
Someone wills having a foot grown out
of the fucking head so people will,

236
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,473
you know,

237
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,110
twins that are stuck together at
the brain and share one skull.

238
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,070
You know,

239
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,851
come on man.

240
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,650
It's such a weak thing because it kind of,

241
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,570
the end result of that is it's like,

242
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:45,440
so when I'm at the beach and I'm walking
down the beach and I turn and look at

243
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,960
the miserable woman pushing her baby,

244
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,490
who's obviously like severely mentally
retarded in that baby's got tubes in its

245
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:57,491
mouth and it's like [inaudible] like I'm
supposed to look at that kid and think

246
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,810
you're getting yours.

247
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,890
You getting what you deserve from
the universe because in a past life,

248
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,220
yeah.

249
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,053
What the fuck?

250
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,313
It's ridiculous.

251
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,330
Empathy and compassion for that kid.

252
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,380
You can kind of be like,

253
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,011
no,

254
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:10,844
he,

255
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,080
he deserved that.

256
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:12,620
Yes.

257
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,430
There there's,

258
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,320
there appears to be a lot of randomness,

259
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:15,620
man.

260
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,820
There's a lot of randomness.

261
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,360
It's,

262
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,861
I mean you,

263
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:19,880
you can't put your
finger on it either way.

264
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:20,151
I mean,

265
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:20,990
we might be wrong.

266
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,670
It might really be that simple.

267
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,310
It might really be that person did
something incredibly fucked up in another

268
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:25,520
life.

269
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,641
I mean,

270
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,474
we don't really know,

271
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,910
but it just doesn't seem like
that's a nice way to think.

272
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,871
No,

273
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,800
and I think it's awesome.

274
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,663
Kind of a real,

275
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,450
you know how like people who say if you
talk to someone is like I don't believe

276
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:35,821
in God.

277
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,600
And then you ask them what
their definition of God is.

278
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,670
Then quite often the god
they don't believe in,

279
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,520
you shouldn't believe in because it's
like the guy with the beard and the

280
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,990
whatever and the Toga.

281
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,250
But if you,

282
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,200
but for people who,

283
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,060
when they do the same
thing as reincarnation,

284
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:54,500
so it's like they turn it into this
like thing where you are an animal or a

285
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,370
person or whatever.

286
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,180
There's so many,

287
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,820
the thing we talked about once about
reincarnation and that's only one,

288
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,960
one version of it.

289
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,710
There can be a million different
versions of how the energy that your

290
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,290
consciousness is travels
through the universe.

291
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:06,591
You know?

292
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:10,790
It doesn't have to be through
reincarnation or through
through the normal sense.

293
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,400
Maybe you come from an alternate
dimension before this one,

294
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,140
someone completely different place.

295
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:20,141
Something where it's like octopuses
floating around in some ether that can

296
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,920
communicate telepathically.

297
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,330
Maybe that's what you came from.

298
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,490
Why does it have to be
from Earth or this planet?

299
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,393
I just it,

300
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,630
well,

301
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll tell you one of the
weirdest things about,

302
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:28,550
uh,

303
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,850
the biggest DMT experience
that I ever had was when I,

304
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,630
when I did it,

305
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,861
when I,

306
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:33,694
when it first,

307
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,420
when it first popped
over to the other side,

308
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,760
I said I've been here before.

309
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,030
It was like a very clear feeling
that I've been there before.

310
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,840
So the idea is like maybe there's
like a little waiting room,

311
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
a waiting room for the universe.

312
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,490
That's like everything all connected
and then every now and then you just get

313
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,710
stuck into some sort of a situation,

314
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,920
some confined existence or you're
working your way through this world,

315
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,160
trying

316
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,000
to make sense of it,

317
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:57,751
you know?

318
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:02,070
And then you'll end this one and pop
out into the main lobby area and the

319
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:02,731
waiting room.

320
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,110
And let's see what happens next time.

321
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,800
Something totally fucking completely
alien and different beyond your

322
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,640
imagination.

323
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,451
You know,

324
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,840
the confines of our imagination is
based to what we've experienced.

325
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,621
You know,

326
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:13,881
our,

327
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,620
our whole collective idea,

328
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,401
what the world is,

329
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,030
is based on what we've experienced.

330
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,190
Even photographs and things that we,

331
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:20,400
you know,

332
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,750
haven't experienced but can see,

333
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,071
you know,

334
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:24,270
like things that are in the
galaxy and planets and shit.

335
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,100
I mean we used these and we have this,

336
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,050
this whole map of our universe,

337
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,110
but that's just what we see right now.

338
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,100
There is just,

339
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,780
it's only limited by our ability to
think outside what we've already seen.

340
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,090
The universe could be infinitely fucking
bizarrely complicated to the point

341
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:47,961
where every different dimension has its
own laws and rules and every different

342
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,970
universe exists in the center of
every single black hole like that.

343
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,310
That might be all real shit.

344
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,610
I could might be self fucking infinite
and crazy and we maybe can't see it.

345
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,470
Well we shouldn't be able
to see it cause it's so big.

346
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:06,120
There's no way where these little tiny
little bits of of neurology down here on

347
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,980
this ball and we're
supposed to be able to,

348
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,180
there's no way we could,

349
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,910
we could reckon with infinity,

350
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,770
with the our limited minds.

351
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,150
It's weird that it's like a,

352
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,410
it's a statement that if you you,

353
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,221
if you talk about it,

354
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:17,610
people go,

355
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,421
oh yeah man,

356
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,890
space ma'am,

357
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
but you want to talk about space,

358
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,070
man wouldn't,

359
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,280
shouldn't we be thinking about the,

360
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,931
what am I doing?

361
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:28,290
I'm piloting this fucking
flesh vehicle around this,

362
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,710
this,

363
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,400
this.

364
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,310
There's some sort of a dimension
filled with other flesh vehicles.

365
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,380
If I didn't know what this was,

366
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:35,214
if I came from,

367
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,701
no,

368
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,400
no,

369
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,590
no judgment whatsoever.

370
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,250
It just a total neutral point and I looked
at just human behavior moving around

371
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,084
on the planet.

372
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,200
I want to be like,

373
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,090
this is the most psychedelic shit ever,

374
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,350
but just us.

375
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,410
We were like the craziest
character in a fucking movie.

376
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,030
When we landed into La the other day,

377
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,110
we flew in from Germany.

378
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,430
We got in a metal tube.

379
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,080
We flew from one side of
the fucking planet where it
was 10 hours ahead in time.

380
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,750
We flew all the way back to la,

381
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,380
landed on the same day to these lights
and shit and all these other metal tubes

382
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,460
are flying in from everywhere.

383
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:05,970
And I'm like,

384
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,550
we are in the future or at this.

385
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:12,180
This is some crazy fucking
science fiction shit.

386
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,410
It's going on right now.

387
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,620
We don't even realize it.

388
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,470
This whole world is psychedelic.

389
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,363
Yeah,

390
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,361
it really is,

391
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:18,571
man.

392
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,404
It is.

393
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,300
It's fucking crazy.

394
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,810
The craziest things of when you've
come across flowers or nature,

395
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
you look at it and you're like,

396
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,071
all right,

397
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,110
this is a fucking crazy.

398
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,420
If I had this thing
painted in my living room,

399
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,220
I would like have a panic attack and die.

400
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,570
You know,

401
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,560
it's like the most amazing
thing you could ever see ever.

402
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,410
Or it's also funny that
everyone on this planet are,

403
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,180
many people on this planet think they're
living their own individual lives and

404
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,290
they're completely free.

405
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,040
But then when you go and look at the
interstate and you look at the way people

406
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,670
like,

407
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,840
we'll move through the city.

408
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,111
You see,

409
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,450
it's just this like
bloodstream of like stop,

410
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,284
go right,

411
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,711
left,

412
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,170
stop,

413
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,980
go right

414
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,321
left.

415
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,330
And they're all there.

416
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,350
Every single person,

417
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,240
when you look at cars inside that car,

418
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,930
they're going to see their girlfriend or
going to their mom just died or they're

419
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,630
going to,

420
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,840
well,

421
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,060
they're all having these amazingly
complex experiences and they all think

422
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,830
they're the most important fucking thing.

423
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,270
And yet even in the midst of that,

424
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,070
they're all operating exactly according
to this bizarre technological pulsation.

425
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,761
Stop,

426
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:16,500
go left.

427
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,570
It's like flying at night.

428
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,880
It's like flying at night.

429
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,620
It looks like a circuit
board and you looked like,

430
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:20,801
you know,

431
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,980
just the light's going through surgeries
and stuff and it looks exactly like

432
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,270
beyond the mind's eye to,

433
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,141
it really is.

434
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:26,561
I mean,

435
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:27,790
the world is fractal.

436
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,151
You know,

437
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:31,000
we talked about when you were talking
about flowers and gorgeous flowers,

438
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,490
flowers and like beautiful
pine cones and shit.

439
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,290
They all follow the FIBONACCI sequence.

440
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,650
You know,

441
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,100
it's a mathematical sequence that is
like literally the order of the Earth,

442
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,953
right?

443
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,090
That's the golden mean,

444
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,200
I believe is what they call that.

445
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,011
I don't know what it is.

446
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,180
I don't understand math.

447
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm a math retard.

448
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,650
But this Fibonacci sequence they
use to describe all these fractals,

449
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,180
beautiful fractals in nature,

450
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:52,370
like,

451
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,430
like pine cones and like
certain flowers and trees.

452
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,360
And it's like,

453
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,200
just like,

454
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,940
it's a part of the structure of,

455
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:58,181
of,

456
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:59,014
of everything.

457
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,190
It's like literally like,

458
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,450
I mean if you look at what it is,

459
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,560
it's like there's a code like,

460
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:02,951
oh my God,

461
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,360
there's a code to this world.

462
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,740
And then what's the code to that?

463
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,930
What's the code to each
individual part of,

464
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:08,500
you know,

465
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,810
you know,

466
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,400
the,

467
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,540
what's the code to the pine cone?

468
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,380
What's the code to the tree?

469
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,340
What's the code of the planet?

470
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,670
It's eventually going to come down
to we're going to have the code to

471
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,181
everything.

472
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:16,721
We're going to stand,

473
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:19,180
understand everything and we're
going to be able to recreate it.

474
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,901
You know,

475
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,150
I read this thing that Ray Kurzweil said,

476
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,343
um,

477
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,400
about how,

478
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,000
and I,

479
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,560
it was really fucking intense.

480
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,400
He said that,

481
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,660
um,

482
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,240
matter itself is like code.

483
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,163
Like in the computer,

484
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,580
your computer right now is projecting a
US or whatever and it's coming via some

485
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,590
sort of code in the same way.

486
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,790
Like at the atomic level,

487
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,260
everything's just a code.

488
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,490
And once computers if
accelerated to a certain rate,

489
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,930
they will be able to send nanobots
out that we'll deconstruct Adams and

490
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,931
reassemble reality in the
same way computers deconstruct
and reassemble pixels

491
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:55,920
and um,

492
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,400
video and that sort of thing.

493
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,160
So matter in reality itself will become,

494
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,420
it's just like a,

495
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,910
I don't know what the word for it is a um,

496
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,691
uh,

497
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,140
just a raw material that you
can use to construct things.

498
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,740
All you have to do is get like a hydrogen
atom and a whatever Adam and another

499
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:13,030
item we just don't have,

500
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,430
well we don't have nanobots
and even if we did,

501
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,970
we don't have an advanced enough computer
that could run the swarm in that way

502
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,500
to do that sort of thing.

503
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,240
You know what I think the
next thing is going to be,

504
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,680
or one of the next things is going to be,

505
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,390
it's going to be the ability to print
things in your house that isn't paper to

506
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,100
make things out of nothing.

507
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,070
I think you're going to have machines at
a certain point in time that are going

508
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,400
to be able to actually
create something like Ipod,

509
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:36,671
right?

510
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:39,940
Like if you order an iPod and you turn
your machine on and this is going to be

511
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:40,541
the shit like,

512
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:40,721
look,

513
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,510
we're gonna make an iPod right now
and it's going to be a huge novelty.

514
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,890
Just like the VHS tape was the VHS tape.

515
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:46,421
Like Holy Shit,

516
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,860
we could record TV shows.

517
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,050
Nobody ever thought you could stop it,

518
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,190
take a leak,

519
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,340
come back and watch

520
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,580
it.

521
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,670
You remember what a pimp you were when
you first recorded your first TV show on

522
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:57,950
a VCR with a clock.

523
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,000
You use the clock and you came home and
there was a tape waiting for you and

524
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,421
you're like,

525
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,270
I'm a fucking genius wizard.

526
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm living in the fucking future.

527
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,010
Dude.

528
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,470
That was a big deal.

529
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:09,891
Oh,

530
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,470
I remember when my friend got
an answering machine to create.

531
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,520
That was a crazy deal,

532
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,150
right?

533
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,983
What's going to be crazy?

534
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,620
That's how they will,

535
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,530
they'll start selling things like they'll
have bigger ones for bigger things

536
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:18,770
like,

537
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,820
oh I want a car and stuff,

538
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,900
but then you're going to get the,

539
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,830
the hackers have it.

540
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,101
They're like,

541
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:22,501
what do you want?

542
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,960
It went 10 Camaro's right now.

543
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,690
Tin Camaro's should
imagine if we can just,

544
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,610
we have the just unhindered ability to
just start printing shit and making fans.

545
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,020
That's the possibility.

546
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,880
That's going to be what
time travel is somehow,

547
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,421
well,

548
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:35,730
you know,

549
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,700
maybe get printed dimensional travel,

550
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,520
do a changing of what Matt matter is.

551
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:41,900
If he could just recreate matter.

552
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,360
I mean you have to have something
to recreate it with though,

553
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:44,541
right?

554
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,660
You'd have to have raw materials
that you would put into a printer.

555
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,501
You would have to have,

556
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,250
I mean if you're,

557
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,690
if you're constructing reality,

558
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,620
you're just building,

559
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,150
that'd be dolphin or something.

560
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,580
It's going to be like we
have to use bunny rabbits.

561
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,020
Just wrap your head around that.

562
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:57,621
Could you imagine?

563
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,470
You would have to have like a certain
amount of minerals and a certain amount of

564
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:05,030
like carbon and all these different things
in your house and somehow or another

565
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:10,031
you would turn on this machine and
we'll just bang print up this TV for you

566
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:12,590
unless you could print the fuel for it.

567
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,281
You know,

568
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,600
like if it's some kind of mineral,

569
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,501
it got so good.

570
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,340
You a real pimp.

571
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,360
You would have like a room,

572
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,051
like a big room,

573
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,480
like a garage where you just
printed shit all the time.

574
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,150
Yeah.

575
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,310
My print me up a Jaguar.

576
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:23,144
Check this shit out.

577
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,871
Fuck that.

578
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,730
I'm printing up some ecstasy.

579
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,450
I met a cat.

580
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,590
I meant the actual cat.

581
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,680
I didn't mean a car that was saying
it while I was saying I was like,

582
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:36,880
what a poor choice of cat
because it's a shitty car.

583
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,750
That could be a bad miss
on a shitty caution.

584
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,690
That's a bad jaguar.

585
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,960
Jaguars actually looked pretty dope.

586
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:42,260
Now.

587
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,790
I like how you have grasshoppers in here.

588
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,480
That's cool.

589
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,210
I'll keep it like homeboy
has been with me for a day.

590
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:47,420
No,

591
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,751
that's cool.

592
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:48,740
It's like a little pet for you.

593
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,071
Well,

594
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm going to let them out eventually,

595
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,100
but I don't want to freak them out.

596
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,160
I want to go home and get comfortable.

597
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,050
He was all locked up for awhile.

598
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Now it looks like he's moving.

599
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:55,880
Have you fed them?

600
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,630
You should feed them.

601
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,231
What am I going to feed him?

602
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't even know what day he leaves.

603
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,260
I think they have to
eat the leaves of the,

604
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,940
you don't have to eat specific.

605
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,080
Yeah.

606
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,730
I think when bugs start eating leaves,

607
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,420
that's what they eat.

608
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,691
You know?

609
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,530
If the one type,

610
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,200
that's what the,

611
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,033
hmm.

612
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,310
I think it might be just
making that shit up.

613
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,070
You know what I missed?

614
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,940
They don't have out here is
those furry caterpillars.

615
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,940
Do you remember the ones that
they looked like little mustaches,

616
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,051
those things rule.

617
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,400
I know what they do have
out here a lot though.

618
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:23,270
Praying mantises when I see a lot of
those bad mother fuckers to a premiere

619
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,410
mantises are like,

620
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,870
if they were big we'd be fucked.

621
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,000
It's just that they're small.

622
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,410
That's it and we think it's cute.

623
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,101
I have.

624
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,430
There's a picture online of a praying
mantis is so big that it jacked a

625
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,264
hummingbird.

626
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:35,960
Why so I,

627
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,231
Oh yeah,

628
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,720
I saw the video of that
dude up fucking hummingbird.

629
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:42,800
Could you imagine this hummingbird is
cause they stand like super still and they

630
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,880
blend in with the twigs and this hump.

631
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,280
This fucker was so big.

632
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,233
This is hummingbird.

633
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,850
Got clothes like I'll fucking
giant alien monster from,

634
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,710
what's that movie star?

635
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,800
Quite alien was the movie
with the kids and the fucking,

636
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,020
what was it?

637
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,853
Goddammit.

638
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,430
But the one with the big bugs and shit.

639
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,360
Science fiction movies.

640
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,680
Very handsome man.

641
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,810
Denise Richards,

642
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,730
spaceship troopers or whatever.

643
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,010
Remember those big giant as bugs.

644
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah.

645
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,760
That's,

646
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,600
that's fucking praying.

647
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:10,434
Mantises man,

648
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,273
they're just small.

649
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,570
I heard that new movie.

650
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,650
What fallen or something like that is
the most cheesiest like next movie that

651
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,910
you watched as a comedy
are skylights guideline.

652
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,250
Yeah,

653
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,740
I heard it.

654
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,421
It's so bad.

655
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:24,630
Even beats that Dennis Quaid
one or hurts really bad too.

656
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,530
I want you to go see it.

657
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,490
Why can't people make it?

658
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,360
Why can't people make a good side?

659
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:28,890
Fine.

660
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,240
As long as I know it's bad.

661
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm good.

662
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,321
What?

663
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,720
I get upset with a bad
movies when I don't know.

664
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,380
It's bad.

665
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,820
When I think it's going
to be good then I go home.

666
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,520
You mother fuckers look
like paranormal activity.

667
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:42,890
I got mad at paranormal activity
two I collect you can get at first.

668
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:43,724
Yeah.

669
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,650
But there was um,

670
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,470
a girl in it.

671
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,940
It looks like a certain ex girlfriend
of yours or she added like 40 pounds.

672
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,051
Who,

673
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:53,070
which one can't tell you.

674
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,780
I can't tell you

675
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:56,551
what.

676
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:56,940
Anyway,

677
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,540
she told me

678
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,710
dog Brian

679
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,360
in your dog.

680
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,100
Duncan had a,

681
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:08,070
an awesome dog party at his
new house the other day.

682
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,030
And uh,

683
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,500
once you explain what happened,

684
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,310
so,

685
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,800
um,

686
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,020
a lot of my friends were there with their
dogs and other dogs are having fun and

687
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,200
bright.

688
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
What kind of dog do you have Brian?

689
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,240
He can ease.

690
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,740
Brian has this Pekinese dog looks like
that dragon from the never ending story.

691
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:23,520
It's,

692
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,420
it looks exactly like that.

693
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:25,254
That's awesome.

694
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,900
Sackler courts.

695
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,830
This is adorable dog.

696
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,040
And we look over and uh,

697
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,840
my friend's dog is like
humping it and you know,

698
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,280
whatever that happens at a dog party,

699
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:35,821
no big deal.

700
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,121
It's like,

701
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:36,331
you know,

702
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:36,961
I've stopped,

703
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:37,794
what are you doing?

704
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,230
That dog goes back and like,

705
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,501
you know,

706
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,790
as being really insistent.

707
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,020
So it's turning into the whole dog rape
thing and it's like digging it's fucking

708
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,570
things in.

709
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:46,790
Yeah,

710
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,210
that did it.

711
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,080
Like just

712
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,540
fucking a fucking his dog.

713
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,190
Not freaking out at all.

714
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:53,941
Relaxed.

715
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,400
Kind of looking over a boy or girl.

716
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,210
Okay,

717
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,830
so anything fixed.

718
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,100
Yeah,

719
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,230
but so she kind of thought it
was like massages or something.

720
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:01,471
No,

721
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,161
she's a whore.

722
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,360
Your dog's a fucking whore.

723
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,020
Whoa.

724
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,800
Listen,

725
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,850
every fucking dog at that
party started fucking his dog.

726
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,250
I've never seen anything like it.

727
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,640
They were fucking face and her,

728
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,120
they were fucking both sides.

729
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,070
Handoffs were fucking my time.

730
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,990
Dogs were standing in line.

731
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,880
I've never seen Doug stand in line.

732
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,250
There's a line of dogs humping,

733
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,881
fates,

734
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,770
humping background.

735
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,210
The two girl dogs to guard.

736
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,900
He's just screaming and heart.

737
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,150
God started taking the dogs away and my
dog and look like it was like wet and

738
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,850
like pre cum all over the place.

739
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,570
Like it just looked like
it was wet dog collars,

740
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,570
dog party turned into this orgy,

741
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,670
this weird gross amateur porn.

742
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,040
Okay.

743
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,701
Oh,

744
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:47,680
your dog or the no self man.

745
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,141
She was,

746
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:48,550
she didn't,

747
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,440
I don't think anyone successfully
got their Dick in her denial,

748
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,070
but they were,

749
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:55,270
all the dogs were freaking out.

750
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,104
Like what?

751
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,370
Really with a tragedy.

752
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:57,941
Denial.

753
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:58,900
This is the first stage,

754
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,500
but there was,

755
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,140
there was a lot of air hampers
that just like circled around.

756
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,960
The outside happens after
they come to grips with it.

757
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,940
That's stage two.

758
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,330
I thought it was acceptance,

759
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,110
anger,

760
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,590
anger,

761
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:08,921
anger,

762
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:09,760
denial,

763
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,080
anger to acceptance.

764
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,180
Going to get mad that
your dogs that tramps.

765
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,590
I made a Twitter profile of it now,

766
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,190
so it's a,

767
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,170
it's like a tramp Twitter dog.

768
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,940
This is Dee from the Geto boys
says you got to let a hobby.

769
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,793
Oh

770
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,453
Wow.

771
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,550
It can be out there,

772
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,001
captain.

773
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:28,834
Save a hoe.

774
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,820
Don't do it.

775
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,840
I ain't worth it.

776
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,310
It was really weird.

777
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:36,790
There was like your dog puffed out
some pheromone and we did look like she

778
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,950
sprayed stuff probably like dick bro.

779
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,820
That's what it is.

780
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,230
You know you don't give enough attention.

781
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:41,781
You fuck.

782
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:42,300
Wow.

783
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,170
If you were maybe pet in
her a little bit more.

784
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,540
I just wouldn't be out there trying
to get dick all over the place.

785
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,570
He was proud of myself though.

786
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,520
I didn't want to stop it.

787
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:48,970
I was like,

788
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,370
no,

789
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,630
she,

790
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:49,950
she,

791
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,890
she deserves it.

792
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:51,880
She's been a good dog.

793
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,391
You're proud.

794
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,120
And I was like letting her have
some ingrates raping and dangling.

795
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,400
It didn't go from everyone trying to
stop their dogs to everyone being like

796
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,370
fascinating.

797
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,541
Who Was it?

798
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,130
The party is a bunch of comments,

799
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,260
a bunch of comics and

800
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,100
imagine that you were a bunch of squares.

801
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,740
The one fade them comes
with his dog and he goes,

802
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,160
you know,

803
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,290
my dog has never humped
anything in the road.

804
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,420
You don't have to worry about my dog.

805
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:24,760
My dog went right to it cause it possible.

806
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,721
This is impossible.

807
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,620
I've never seen this happen.

808
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:27,940
I've had this dog for 15 years.

809
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,331
He's just like,

810
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,530
I can't believe the bitches,

811
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,610
this submissive.

812
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,730
Let me just check my Dick
Right in your face real quick.

813
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,080
No talking.

814
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,220
Just face mounting.

815
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,500
There's certain girls that give
you the green light for that.

816
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,030
There's certain girls there that crazy.

817
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,421
Twix.

818
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,010
He vixen is one of those puppies.

819
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:42,430
Well,

820
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,030
no,

821
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,800
we do want to talk about
the name of this dog.

822
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,610
No,

823
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:45,821
no.

824
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:46,061
Okay.

825
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:46,950
Let's not talk about that.

826
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,793
See vixen.

827
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,420
It makes my heart hurt.

828
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,253
Hurts my heart.

829
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,873
I heard them are,

830
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,450
it's just a character on Twitter,

831
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,810
but she had done it,

832
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,220
but my puppy now has an Amazon wishlist,

833
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:01,150
so if anyone wants to buy,

834
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,720
I'll do it.

835
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,640
Don't you do it right line or a Mac book.

836
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,860
Pros know you wonder
why your dogs or whore.

837
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,750
You're raising a whore and nicely.

838
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,593
A little whore dog.

839
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,520
Amazon wishlist letter
half dog toy whore dog.

840
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,570
Fuck that shit.

841
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,610
You have been an unexpected thing.

842
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,290
When Amazon had been at the wishlist,

843
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,340
they did not know that would turn it in.

844
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:19,031
By the way though,

845
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,810
that made it sound like I was not in
support of girls using the Amazon wishlist

846
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,170
with is,

847
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,370
which is absolutely not true.

848
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:29,320
I am 100% in support of that shit really
cause and for women you have to say it

849
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,750
but you also have to say it for math,

850
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,040
you got to let a whole be a Ho.

851
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,740
Right.

852
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,550
There's some guy who wants to go out
and buy this chick TVs and new shoes and

853
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:36,951
underwear.

854
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:37,620
I fucking,

855
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,340
I go get that money girl.

856
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,640
Yeah,

857
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,000
no there's no problem with it.

858
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,350
But the problem is is some of these
people on Twitter are saying things like,

859
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,080
hey,

860
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,100
you know you

861
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,280
should give me something here because
I showed you this and I did this.

862
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,343
You know what?

863
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,250
A lot of them are like
really pimping it out.

864
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,280
Kind of gross to do.

865
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,770
You don't have to give them anything.

866
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,821
Oh I know.

867
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,680
I know 80 it's would give them in a night.

868
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,700
It's okay.

869
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:58,971
No,

870
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:03,971
I'm not against it by them
shit and give them money.

871
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,940
Look Dude,

872
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,420
ever known.

873
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,991
Then what I do,

874
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,131
I'll,

875
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:07,010
I'll follow,

876
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,260
like if someone says something and,

877
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:09,560
uh,

878
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,891
like,

879
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,160
uh,

880
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,610
like a,

881
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,331
like a porn star.

882
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,390
Like I follow a bunch of porn stars.

883
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:13,580
So they say some fascinating shit.

884
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,720
And uh,

885
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
every now and then like a dude will
say something to them and they'll,

886
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,950
they'll our 10 and I go,

887
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,340
Ooh,

888
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,230
but that was fucking creepy.

889
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,681
You know,

890
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:21,861
like,

891
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,250
you know,

892
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,521
blah,

893
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:22,671
blah,

894
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,370
blah is the most amazing person ever.

895
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:26,540
And so beautiful.

896
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,374
My God,

897
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,030
our t o thank you,

898
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,943
lol.

899
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,321
And I'll go,

900
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:30,531
okay,

901
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,880
who's this crazy ass hole?

902
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,000
So I'll go to this crazy assholes
page and it'll be like he's having a

903
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,110
relationship with her.

904
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,920
He's talking about how ever since
she's been in communication with him,

905
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,590
he just feels so much
better and his life is more,

906
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,610
more meaningful and it feels like he
has a reason to go on and he feels like

907
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,210
she's an angel and she
sent to this call room zee.

908
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:50,960
Shit,

909
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
loneliness is so disgusting,

910
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,611
lonely.

911
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,990
Like when you get that lonely,

912
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:00,230
where you've gotten nuts and you
can wake up in the morning and,

913
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,560
and really feel normal about having a
relationship with an online porn star and

914
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:09,020
no one wants to hang out with you and
no one wants to talk to you and we saved

915
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,220
up enough money and you're like,

916
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,920
today I'm going to buy
a bottle of obsession.

917
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,450
When I think is crazy as the road of
Warcraft couples where they just play

918
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:18,350
together all day and all night
and that's their whole life.

919
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:18,981
They've never met,

920
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,150
ever hung out with each other,

921
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,120
but they're dating and
they play video games,

922
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,963
get married,

923
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,550
they get married inside the video games.

924
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,413
And then,

925
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,580
I mean we've discussed
video games to death,

926
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,420
but it is,

927
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:30,800
that is a fascinating thing.

928
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,780
This desire to exist in this,

929
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,740
this two dimensional online world
instead of the three d reality.

930
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,120
And it's a weird pull,

931
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:38,841
you know,

932
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,060
it's a weird pull to want to.

933
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,461
I mean,

934
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:40,641
look,

935
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,770
I'm guilty of being online all the time.

936
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,641
Like a lot of times,

937
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:44,780
even when I'm supposed to get work done,

938
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,290
I'm such a Douche bag that I'll just
turn on my computer and then I'll check

939
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,130
Twitter real quick.

940
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,130
How is this crazy winning?

941
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,580
Somebody sent me some crazy science
video and I look at that and I go,

942
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:52,851
wow,

943
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:53,600
they're fucking,

944
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,070
they found a new black hole.

945
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,940
Oh Shit.

946
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,790
And then it's two hours later and
not have even started writing.

947
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,390
Why?

948
00:25:59,390 --> 00:25:59,730
It's just,

949
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,430
she just get sucked into it,

950
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:01,731
man.

951
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:02,451
How can't you though?

952
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,051
I mean it's like you,

953
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,741
you tried to get off.

954
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:03,921
You're like,

955
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:04,071
oh,

956
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,090
Beatles on iTunes.

957
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
I can shit on them for saying,

958
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:07,971
you know,

959
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,530
why they into the world of Warcraft?

960
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,880
Why am I into my message board?

961
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:11,541
Why am I in the,

962
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:11,991
you know,

963
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:12,440
uh,

964
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,160
going online and reading a cool document
or watching cool documentaries and

965
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,290
reading weird fucking s
studies that they found.

966
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:18,980
It's a fucking,

967
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,281
to me,

968
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,114
it's a drug.

969
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,450
I got it almost like I was at badly
addicted to world of Warcraft.

970
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:23,931
Yeah,

971
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:24,741
we talked about that.

972
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:24,910
You,

973
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,431
you had,

974
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:26,080
um,

975
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,330
he would break the Games.

976
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,460
So just so you can't play him.

977
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,691
I would.

978
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,170
Yeah,

979
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,070
I would fucking,

980
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,851
well then,

981
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,310
I mean I had already gotten over my
quick thing when you were getting this

982
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:34,660
right.

983
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,280
It was,

984
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,800
I mean the draw,

985
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,831
the pull,

986
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:38,340
it's amazing.

987
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,700
Fucking game is so powerful.

988
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,930
I finally,

989
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:42,680
um,

990
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,490
I had a level 70

991
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,960
warlock and I had to fucking
delete the character.

992
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,890
Why didn't you sell it?

993
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,540
That's what everyone says
you should have sold it.

994
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,730
But it's like how much is
that worth and geek world?

995
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,810
I don't know.

996
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,920
You get your Dick sucked for that.

997
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,143
Yeah.

998
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,310
There's some crazy golf bitch.

999
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,620
So it's sucky level 70.

1000
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,790
[inaudible] what do you,

1001
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:04,320
what is,

1002
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
what exactly was your title again?

1003
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,851
You were a,

1004
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:06,684
what?

1005
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,550
It's called a warlock with
warlock level 70 level 70 huge.

1006
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,550
There's like you could just
fuck people over I think,

1007
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,200
but I think that the
levels are up higher now.

1008
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:16,920
But back then,

1009
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,390
I mean I was definitely fun.

1010
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Now if a chick bought this character
after she sucked your Dick,

1011
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,970
if she sucked your Dick
and got this character,

1012
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,660
what happens then?

1013
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,160
Does she get to be a warlock?

1014
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,450
Cause she would get to be a dude.

1015
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,070
Can anybody be whatever sex you want.

1016
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,360
I don't know where it is.

1017
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:31,021
And I think you want,

1018
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,340
you can change the way it looks,

1019
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,960
but I don't know if you
can change the gender.

1020
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,760
So she will be your character.

1021
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:36,900
She'll take over your character.

1022
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,010
You give her like the passwords.

1023
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,430
Yes.

1024
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,821
Yeah.

1025
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:39,041
And,

1026
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:39,631
and yeah,

1027
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,480
you would give her all the password and
all of a sudden she would be infinitely

1028
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:43,770
powerful without having earned it.

1029
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,750
You probably have to do with
the transfer of ownership,

1030
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,660
like go to a game stop and both signed
papers or if that's how you do it.

1031
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,520
I know you do like that.

1032
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,410
Oh my God,

1033
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,180
there has to be some kind of transfer
of ownership because then that person

1034
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:54,840
would just say,

1035
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,910
this is my character know.

1036
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,671
Let me ask you this.

1037
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,780
Do they allow that shit?

1038
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,200
They'll,

1039
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,640
they allow people to do this.

1040
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,950
I don't think you're supposed to do,

1041
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,290
but why didn't you get prepared
before you got on this podcast?

1042
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,390
I can't believe I'm kinda happy.

1043
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,740
I don't remember this.

1044
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:08,491
Why?

1045
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,840
Why do you think they would prevent that?

1046
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,070
I've wondered that.

1047
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:11,880
I think it's fair.

1048
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,120
I mean,

1049
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,070
it's just another
fascinating aspect of it.

1050
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,400
I guess maybe it could be because they
would say that they should get the money

1051
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,330
if somebody got the money.

1052
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,320
But I feel,

1053
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,620
I feel like if a character invest all
that time into the game and they can,

1054
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,230
they can show something for
it and they could sell that.

1055
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,330
That's something that's just going
to make the game more popular.

1056
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,800
I knew somebody who is a,

1057
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,130
what do you call it,

1058
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,350
I can't remember what they call them now,

1059
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:34,650
that people in the police of the
game that are kind of inside the game

1060
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,670
in the game,

1061
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,780
they have characters and they can,

1062
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:40,540
they go around,

1063
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,940
they can appear and do shit.

1064
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,580
Yeah.

1065
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:42,791
And,

1066
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:42,950
and,

1067
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,040
and they're indestructible but they're
kind of like policing the player,

1068
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,410
like moderators medicine,

1069
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,420
a message board moderators
this the same thing.

1070
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,470
And they,

1071
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,333
I actually,

1072
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,170
before I played world of Warcraft,

1073
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:55,591
God,

1074
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,070
this is,

1075
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,903
I guess it's,

1076
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,873
I'm,

1077
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,670
I'm fucking neck geek.

1078
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,931
I'm a nerd.

1079
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:01,081
I,

1080
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,630
before I got addicted
to world of Warcraft,

1081
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:04,620
I got addicted to a everquest.

1082
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,870
I got busted.

1083
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,650
I got busted in that
game by like a game cop,

1084
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,220
like I cause like at the time it was
still kind of like the wild west and they

1085
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,100
hadn't liked really figured out how to
like regulate it as much as they have

1086
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:17,281
now.

1087
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:17,970
And so,

1088
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,590
I don't know how it is in everquest now,

1089
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,860
but then you could like try
on other people's stuff.

1090
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,080
They could give you stuff
and you could try it on.

1091
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,914
And it was like,

1092
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,271
I,

1093
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,104
um,

1094
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,751
I,

1095
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:28,560
uh,

1096
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,390
there was a guy who had a really,

1097
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,230
everyone knew in this game about
some kind of like very powerful vest.

1098
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,970
And so I went to that guy and I'm like,

1099
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:36,540
Hey,

1100
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,300
let me try that vest on
to see how I look in it.

1101
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,820
And he gives me the vest and
I just run into the woods.

1102
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,893
I go race,

1103
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,500
go racing into the woods.

1104
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,550
I've got this little care,

1105
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,780
a little character,

1106
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,290
uh,

1107
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,880
halfway named hair pie.

1108
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,320
His name was thereby,

1109
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,940
and I'm racing into the woods with this
thing and like the guys like yelling

1110
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,440
into the zone is what it's called,

1111
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,350
like announcing don't trust hair pie.

1112
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,180
He stole my vest of the thunder
guys thief and I'm running,

1113
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,350
I'm wanting to words,

1114
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,481
I've,

1115
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:09,460
I lost him.

1116
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,190
Oh.

1117
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,650
And all of a sudden I hear footsteps
behind me like invisible footsteps and I'm

1118
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:18,430
running and I'm hearing like
this and then I'm frozen.

1119
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,361
It's a game.

1120
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:19,901
Moderator,

1121
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,470
he's like,

1122
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,330
you gotta give him his vest back.

1123
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,980
You can't steal vest.

1124
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,700
I'm like,

1125
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,810
you can't steal like that.

1126
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:26,021
I'm like,

1127
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:26,980
my character is a thief.

1128
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:27,401
Why not?

1129
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,234
And he's like,

1130
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,580
read rule four 98.

1131
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,420
And the tos a thief,

1132
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,283
you should be a fee.

1133
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,790
You should be able to
do whatever you want.

1134
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,620
I know what I mean.

1135
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,660
That's what I can't steal as a thief.

1136
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,330
That's why grand theft auto so good.

1137
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,460
If you want to be a murderer,

1138
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,240
you can be a murderer.

1139
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,550
Yeah,

1140
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,383
yeah,

1141
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,410
yeah.

1142
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,190
I mean you're,

1143
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,023
you like,

1144
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,410
you hear about it from time to time.

1145
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:48,221
I just heard about,

1146
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:48,720
um,

1147
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,450
somebody who claiming that some
of their shit got stolen on that.

1148
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,190
I can't remember the name of the game.

1149
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,083
Second life.

1150
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,960
There's a whole economy in
second life or people don't.

1151
00:30:58,961 --> 00:30:59,650
People pay,

1152
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,500
people pay rent to have
shops there and stuff.

1153
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,943
I know,

1154
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,100
but then fuck.

1155
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,510
But the moment they figured out how to,

1156
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,820
right now it's just such
a primitive version of it.

1157
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:10,240
Like,

1158
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,000
do you remember when
you first got an Atari,

1159
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,020
did you ever get an Atari?

1160
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:14,560
Yeah,

1161
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,720
shittiest gaming system of all time.

1162
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,530
But you felt like you were on like in
Star Trek when you were playing that

1163
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,220
fucking thing,

1164
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,580
like look,

1165
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,161
breakout.

1166
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:27,430
Remember breakout that
venture with the key,

1167
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:28,330
the dragons and the key.

1168
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,890
I've been having so many holy shit
that was only x amount of years ago.

1169
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,180
More.

1170
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,013
Absolutely.

1171
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:34,811
Yeah.

1172
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:35,644
Boom.

1173
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,580
So now just think,

1174
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:37,270
okay,

1175
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,640
what is the next version
of this stuff going to be?

1176
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:43,540
If you look at what a tare has turned
into and it's obviously it's gotta be

1177
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,880
neurological implant,

1178
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,040
it's gotta be plugging in or
transmitting somehow and yeah,

1179
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,420
I think it's going to be holograms,

1180
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:49,691
man.

1181
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:52,570
Because did you see that
Japanese star that they have now?

1182
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,620
The singing star.

1183
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,910
That's actually a hologram.

1184
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,860
What sells out fucking,

1185
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,911
oh my God,

1186
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,050
I tweeted it the other day.

1187
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,071
It's amazing.

1188
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:00,970
You have to check it out.

1189
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,081
We have to find it.

1190
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:02,590
Brian,

1191
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,150
is there a way you could pull it up put,

1192
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:06,550
because this is something you
guys have to see to believe.

1193
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,840
It is a sold out.

1194
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,380
Brian's going to look for it on
the Japanese Hologram rock star.

1195
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,700
Look up that dude.

1196
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,120
It's crazy.

1197
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,070
It's an animated fucking character that
singing in a computer voice and it's a

1198
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,750
Hologram that they have on,

1199
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,890
on stage in front of fucking thousands
of people and the place is sold out and

1200
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:28,060
they're going insane.

1201
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,660
They're screaming and yelling
and cheering for this hologram.

1202
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,561
I mean,

1203
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:33,070
it's like,

1204
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,460
it's a super advanced version of
like the opening at a ride at Disney.

1205
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,683
Wow.

1206
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,450
But dude,

1207
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,610
it's a beautiful

1208
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,300
hologram.

1209
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,541
I mean,

1210
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,390
it's like three dimensional intense.

1211
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,370
The way it looks is incredible.

1212
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,900
It's like really vivid.

1213
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:48,770
The colors of vivid.

1214
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:52,310
It doesn't look that
opaque or that transparent.

1215
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,144
Rather

1216
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,290
look at the fucking crowd.

1217
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,431
Folks.

1218
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:00,360
If you want to go over this,

1219
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:00,661
Brian,

1220
00:33:00,661 --> 00:33:00,870
would you,

1221
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,000
what is the Google Japanese Hologram?

1222
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:03,834
Pop Star,

1223
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,160
Japanese Hologram.

1224
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:06,660
Pop Star motherfucker.

1225
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,830
This is what the new gorillas,

1226
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:08,490
uh,

1227
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,000
concerts are supposedly
going to be in line.

1228
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,853
They're going to do that too.

1229
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,780
Where it's walking through
the audience though.

1230
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,673
Like this,

1231
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,370
that's the new,

1232
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,850
I think next week here in Los Angeles.

1233
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah.

1234
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,301
Holy Shit.

1235
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:19,081
That's incentive.

1236
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:19,980
We can eat some mushrooms.

1237
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:20,521
Good a girl.

1238
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:21,390
Oh my God.

1239
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,224
I'm scared.

1240
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,850
I just got terrified.

1241
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:24,900
Like a little curl.

1242
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,420
That's fucking bad for folks.

1243
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,350
If you haven't seen this,

1244
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,184
if you just seen your car,

1245
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,390
you've got to go home.

1246
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:31,380
You gotta check this out.

1247
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,020
It's one of the weirdest
things I've seen in years.

1248
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,460
Weird man.

1249
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,950
It's an electronic voice too.

1250
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:38,520
I mean,

1251
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,980
people were complaining that
the backstreet boys were fake.

1252
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,570
Who did you meet with the fuck?

1253
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,440
This isn't even a real boy.

1254
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,061
Imagine this.

1255
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:46,230
If this chick was naked,

1256
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,101
yeah.

1257
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:47,191
Oh,

1258
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,530
she's going to be sucking
big giant octopus.

1259
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,150
Dick's starts this clicking through it.

1260
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:54,960
There's going to be for sure some version
of that in Japan where they have just

1261
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,440
Hentai rape and Samurai swords and shit.

1262
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,270
She Shooting Eagles out of her book.

1263
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,650
It's all going to happen.

1264
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,520
No doubt about it.

1265
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,730
The Japanese don't give a fuck walk.

1266
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,421
That is awesome.

1267
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,310
I could look this all so advanced.

1268
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,060
She was hot.

1269
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,271
You know,

1270
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:12,220
they look at our computer like if we
have our cell phones around there and if

1271
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:12,960
you go over to Japan,

1272
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,190
our cell phones are goofy.

1273
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:14,990
Their,

1274
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,231
their,

1275
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:15,841
their cell phones.

1276
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:17,160
They can buy shit with them.

1277
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,610
Right.

1278
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,070
They go to a store and they just
run their cell phone by something.

1279
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,000
I can pick it up.

1280
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,670
They're like scan it and they
just buy it and walk out with it.

1281
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,170
It's incredible.

1282
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,080
They can buy soda with it and Shit
and plane tickets scanned their,

1283
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:29,250
their,

1284
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,900
their phones or school scanners.

1285
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
It's ridiculous.

1286
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,330
It's fuck man.

1287
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,890
I'm pretty amazed at that.

1288
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:35,071
Yeah.

1289
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:36,210
Gorilla supposedly,

1290
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,570
uh,

1291
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,070
they're making their next CD.

1292
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:41,400
They just announced that it's going to
be there making their whole CD on the

1293
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:42,000
IPAD.

1294
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,790
Could you imagine just 30 40 years ago,

1295
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,260
how about when Elvis was on stage?

1296
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,220
How about one of these fucking appears
out of nowhere and is dancing around

1297
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,090
right next to Elvis.

1298
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,160
People would start shooting it,

1299
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,240
you know?

1300
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,831
You know what I'm saying?

1301
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:58,050
I mean just just back then
it would've been like,

1302
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:59,790
what the fuck is that

1303
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,371
man?

1304
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,650
We don't even realize how
quick this is all happening.

1305
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,461
No,

1306
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,000
I mean,

1307
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,510
no,

1308
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,970
I think that nobody's
really prepared for it.

1309
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:10,560
And the quicker it happens,

1310
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,860
the more I used to be like burning it,

1311
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,790
let it happen.

1312
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,070
Let the fucking singularity pop.

1313
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:17,641
Let's go.

1314
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:20,550
Let's do the thing now
it's kind of like shit.

1315
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,384
I don't know.

1316
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,000
Like I'm cool right here.

1317
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,530
Life is so easy.

1318
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,260
I'm a comic,

1319
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:31,200
I'm having fun and we don't
need to accelerate that much.

1320
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,120
Let's not get crazy everybody.

1321
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,110
I'm having a good time.

1322
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,813
We don't have to,

1323
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,040
we don't have to Zap and is to have

1324
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,060
to all be one.

1325
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,450
Yeah,

1326
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,800
we don't have to emerge.

1327
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,813
Come on man.

1328
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,691
But you know,

1329
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,550
I guess there's just no way to stop it.

1330
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:49,551
And so I was flying back from Germany
and I had this crazy epiphany about

1331
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,570
civilizations cause I was,

1332
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:51,780
you know,

1333
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,640
I was leaving Germany.

1334
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:52,951
I was like,

1335
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,600
it's so strange when you
go to another culture,

1336
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,351
you know,

1337
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:55,870
and you're,

1338
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,321
you,

1339
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,870
you don't have any idea
what they're saying.

1340
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:58,260
It's like,

1341
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,561
God,

1342
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,720
this is a different
world is totally alien.

1343
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,250
There's songs that they had on their,

1344
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:02,701
on their,

1345
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:02,881
uh,

1346
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:03,780
their TV shows.

1347
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,260
We're,

1348
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,280
we're all in German.

1349
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,110
They have played a lot
of American music though.

1350
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,390
I got a say like a good percentage of it.

1351
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,930
Like every now and then you'd hear
something with a German voice or a German

1352
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,003
German dialogue,

1353
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,420
but for the most part the lyrics.

1354
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,220
But for the most part it
was all American shit.

1355
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,921
But the,

1356
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:19,080
the people would talk to you,

1357
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,190
they'd look at you and butch notes,

1358
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:21,180
lactic and you're like,

1359
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,133
Whoa,

1360
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,000
like I don't have a fucking clue.

1361
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:24,490
I don't know.

1362
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,323
I just,

1363
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,640
I have no idea.

1364
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,720
And they would look at you like,

1365
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:28,171
come on,

1366
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:28,621
come on.

1367
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,310
Come on.

1368
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,410
Like at the airport when they
were telling you to go over here,

1369
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,910
what they're saying,

1370
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:33,211
whatever.

1371
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:33,720
Crazy.

1372
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,380
Yeah.

1373
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,130
Nick mystic,

1374
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,963
no clean.

1375
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,530
And you're like,

1376
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,240
what,

1377
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,610
where,

1378
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,443
where it's,

1379
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,290
it's a fucking strange thing man.

1380
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,580
And I'm,

1381
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm thinking about how bizarre it is
that there's so many different languages

1382
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:46,770
and I'm thinking about how weird it is
that some of these cultures had been

1383
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,604
around forever.

1384
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,211
And,

1385
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:48,420
um,

1386
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,560
and then I start thinking like,

1387
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,900
what the fuck happens to
all these different cultures
that have existed before?

1388
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,250
It pretty much is the same thing.

1389
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,650
They figure out how to create shelters.

1390
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,940
Then they go from having shelters to
creating a surplus to having a group of

1391
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:03,451
shelters.

1392
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,060
They all protect themselves
from the animals and then
once enough to worry about

1393
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:06,750
getting eaten,

1394
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,190
then they start figuring things out.

1395
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,510
Then they started inventing
things and coming up with things,

1396
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,580
getting curious to the point where they
make a very complicated society that

1397
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:15,414
hums along.

1398
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,500
They have a May immense structures and
all these cool things and then all the

1399
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:24,000
people that did all this crazy hard work
have kids and the kids are born into

1400
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:26,130
this perfect world where
they don't have to try to,

1401
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,610
to,

1402
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,840
to discover anything.

1403
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,110
They don't have to create things
because the things are already existing.

1404
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,140
They don't have to develop a civilization
and a scratch and figure out how to be

1405
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,150
strong in the woods because
there's all these resources.

1406
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,910
They figured out how to write things
down so they don't have to relearn shit.

1407
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:39,841
And I'm like,

1408
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,171
wow,

1409
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,460
it's just people get soft.

1410
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,730
Like that's probably the reason that
every single civilization eventually fell

1411
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,593
apart.

1412
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,433
You know,

1413
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,371
he talked about like,

1414
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:47,790
you know,

1415
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,331
throughout history,

1416
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:51,000
whenever they would talk about
like the fall of the Roman empire.

1417
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,530
Yeah.

1418
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:56,530
Tha Tha tha tha the whole theme to it was
always the decadence and the depravity

1419
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,750
and the crazy sexual shit that they were
doing and how life had just gotten in

1420
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:02,521
sand for them.

1421
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,930
They were all like living in,

1422
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:08,160
in eating insane amounts
of food and fucking little
boys and having people fight

1423
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,150
animals and shit.

1424
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:09,961
Yeah.

1425
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:10,710
You know,

1426
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,550
and it's got to have come from a
place where those people were weak.

1427
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
Those people didn't have
to put it all together.

1428
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:17,761
Well,

1429
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,120
yeah.

1430
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,391
Well,

1431
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:18,661
I mean,

1432
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,640
I think specifically
with the Roman Empire,

1433
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,040
and I'm sure people out there will
correct me on this belt warrant,

1434
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,180
wasn't Rome sacked by the Visigoths
who are these like brutal barbarians.

1435
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:31,250
You just came in and just raped
and killed everybody and Natalie.

1436
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,711
Yeah.

1437
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:35,220
And that brought in the dark
ages and I'm the dark ages.

1438
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,800
What was bringing a civilization
back out of the dark ages was um,

1439
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,471
uh,

1440
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,221
Christianity,

1441
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:42,761
religion,

1442
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:47,020
religion was like creating at least a
little bit of order to a kind of like

1443
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:48,550
bring people out of the dark.

1444
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,670
But all of a sudden the vikings figured
out that all they had to do is go to

1445
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:59,170
like a monastery or a church and they
could just grab all the gold and shit and

1446
00:38:59,171 --> 00:38:59,711
go off.

1447
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:00,221
They basically,

1448
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,890
the vikings discovered
Europe and they started,

1449
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,730
they came in and pushed it back into the
dark ages again cause they were sacking

1450
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:07,210
everything.

1451
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,140
And like vikings are
the most brutal fucking,

1452
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,790
they were the most brutal
humans ever because like that,

1453
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,910
one of the stories they told us there
was a viking who had this funny nickname

1454
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:19,750
and I can't remember nickname,

1455
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:22,720
but the other vikings laughed at him.

1456
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,080
They thought he was funny
because he wouldn't kill kids.

1457
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,110
They thought it was funny and
they had a nickname for him.

1458
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:30,070
Like you pussy,

1459
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,390
you are he killing these kids?

1460
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,800
It's fucking fun.

1461
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,260
And they would just go in and kids and
there were these crazy Rudel fucking

1462
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:39,040
warriors.

1463
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,521
And so,

1464
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,354
like you said,

1465
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,620
you're dealing with this kind of,

1466
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:41,801
well,

1467
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,180
at that time it was starving people,

1468
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,940
but before that it's these lazy fat,

1469
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,020
uh,

1470
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,940
people who've never really fought before,

1471
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,740
at least like fought in that brutal level.

1472
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:51,574
And they just got,

1473
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,200
they just kind of hit at the wrong time.

1474
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,480
Yeah,

1475
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,940
exactly.

1476
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,670
Had gotten hit back when Rome was
strong and before everything fell apart,

1477
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,860
they probably would've been able
to hold those guns off the idea.

1478
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,101
Yeah.

1479
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:00,461
And I think,

1480
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:00,611
yeah,

1481
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:01,180
I think,

1482
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,420
I think that is the idea that,

1483
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,011
I mean,

1484
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:06,520
I don't know anything about the history
other than the what's connected to it in

1485
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:07,211
popular myth.

1486
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:10,480
So always gluttony and
orgies of food and you know,

1487
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:14,050
the talk of feathers in the throat
vomitorium so they would throw up so they

1488
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:14,680
could eat more.

1489
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,400
Yeah.

1490
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,791
Yeah.

1491
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,660
Well that's the,

1492
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,441
I mean that,

1493
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:19,360
that usually is what happens is people,

1494
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,290
I mean really that isn't that a symptom
of people confusing what's important

1495
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,840
with the material universe.

1496
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,540
Cause people start trying
to gratify their centers.

1497
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,250
And,

1498
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,380
and really that's just a distraction
from what's really important.

1499
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:32,890
And the,

1500
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,730
so when that gets to the extreme where
everyone is just focused on buying shit

1501
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:37,950
or floats,

1502
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,660
I think it's a faulty system that we have.

1503
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,480
And once the environment
gets super complicated,

1504
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,560
it's eventually everyone's
gonna want to take time off.

1505
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,650
They're going to want to not have to
hunt and gather and they're going to want

1506
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:53,470
things easier and lighter and they
had to want more for their kids.

1507
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,210
I don't want my kids who struggle like me.

1508
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,460
And so then we want a softer,

1509
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,980
easier world development.

1510
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,990
But the problem with that is
w Schumann's ideas and our,

1511
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,501
our,

1512
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:07,900
our best inventions have come
through hard work and adversity.

1513
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,690
People who like people
who have worked very,

1514
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:14,470
very hard to think things through and
figure things out and invent new things.

1515
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,030
Well,

1516
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,800
when everything's already there
and you don't have to do that,

1517
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,750
like what happens then?

1518
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:22,540
And then you have kids and they see you
and then we'll look at this lazy fat

1519
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,050
motherfucker.

1520
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,040
Why should I do anything hard or try to
be anything special or try to contribute

1521
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,410
or try to figure things out
or even try to be happy.

1522
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,300
Nobody else has happened.

1523
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:31,990
What the fuck makes me think
that I should be happy?

1524
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:32,861
Well,

1525
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:33,190
yeah,

1526
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,910
it's,

1527
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,460
it's,

1528
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,080
you know,

1529
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I really think that it's a
result of people losing track of,

1530
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:42,950
um,

1531
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,230
the greater truth in the universe.

1532
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:48,290
And so I think the moment
you start tuning into that,

1533
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,290
that's when you start getting the ideas
that lead to the inventions and lead to

1534
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:51,831
the hard work.

1535
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,390
Because fucking hard work.

1536
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:53,840
Like,

1537
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,560
you know,

1538
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,290
everyone says if you want to write a book,

1539
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,270
you gotta write six hours a day.

1540
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:00,500
You have to treat it like a job.

1541
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,960
You have to fucking write
all the fucking time.

1542
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,010
And that's true.

1543
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,810
But you know,

1544
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,010
to really do that,

1545
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,120
you've got to be passionate.

1546
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,350
You've got to want to do it.

1547
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,460
You have to be inspired.

1548
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,770
The inspiration drives
you to work that hard.

1549
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,761
And so right now,

1550
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,720
no one's inspired.

1551
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,140
Most people have no inspiration cause
they're not connecting to the thing that

1552
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:20,150
brings those big ideas into your head.

1553
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,570
When maybe that maybe when there isn't
the Internet and technology and all that

1554
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:24,080
stuff,

1555
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,930
it's more likely that those ideas
come to you or something like that.

1556
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I think it's also possibly a situation
where the hardware has evolved so quickly

1557
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,240
that our life has changed so radically
that are our physical bodies just are not

1558
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:41,210
in tuned to the reward systems that
we're getting from this society.

1559
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,580
That's why we're trying to supplement
them with antidepressants and shed.

1560
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,860
Our bodies are designed for some
hunting and gathering and fucking,

1561
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,470
that's what our bodies are designed for
and if you don't exert a certain amount

1562
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:52,160
of energy,

1563
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,270
that's why people get stressed.

1564
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:58,190
You know that people who exercise are way
more stress free than people who never

1565
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,280
exercise because your body
just accumulates all this
crazy shit that you're

1566
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,110
supposed to be getting out of your system.

1567
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,170
You're supposed to be
chasing down elk and shit.

1568
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,660
You're supposed to be moving bails of Hay
and if you're not doing all that stuff

1569
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:08,961
and you're like,

1570
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,420
why do you even have Mussel beds?

1571
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,870
You just sit around
the house and jerk off.

1572
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,011
Why do you even have,

1573
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:15,920
you should have enough muscle to get to
the refrigerator and back to the couch.

1574
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,400
There also,

1575
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,420
you don't need any other muscle.

1576
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,810
It also seems like there's a lot more
calculations and math going on too,

1577
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:22,670
because if you think
about even 15 years ago,

1578
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:24,080
you're not thinking about Twitter numbers.

1579
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:27,470
You're not thinking about Facebook numbers
are thinking about online stuff and

1580
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,370
bills and and news and you have so much
information pump that your brain is

1581
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:33,500
constantly thinking way more than it was.

1582
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:34,340
Then back in the day was like,

1583
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,521
oh,

1584
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:35,540
it's windy outside.

1585
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,500
That was,

1586
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,080
Ooh,

1587
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,720
this eliminate.

1588
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,200
It's good.

1589
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,700
I wonder if someone who could buy us beer,

1590
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,330
right,

1591
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,870
but you know that we are different.

1592
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,910
Is that what you're talking about?

1593
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:44,331
The numbers.

1594
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,830
You're talking about red band,

1595
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,690
these are all illusions.

1596
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,300
People are spending all their
time calculating these filaments.

1597
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,960
Thrill idea,

1598
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,170
my bank account number,

1599
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:59,171
how much I owe or how much data you
says those Zeros are aware what the fuck

1600
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,930
type they're imaginary or the Senate
or the Congress or the president or the

1601
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,350
government,

1602
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,880
all imaginary things that aren't,

1603
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,570
they're just these a theory things out
there when it's like if you go into your

1604
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:12,560
backyard and dig and plant seeds
and grow something that's real,

1605
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,190
you can look out there and see how many
seeds or plants you have growing up and

1606
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:16,401
that.

1607
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,630
That's fucking real.

1608
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,920
What is the economy?

1609
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,940
Just imaginary quantitative easing and
we're going to buy stock shares and stock

1610
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:24,530
trades and send them over to brush men,

1611
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,340
Boston,

1612
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,971
Ben Bernanke,

1613
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:27,530
he said he's going to double the quantity.

1614
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,011
It's like,

1615
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:29,360
what the fuck are you talking about?

1616
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,010
Land was completely free though,

1617
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,280
would be more of the case.

1618
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:32,731
Now you,

1619
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:33,420
if you don't,

1620
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,010
if you know pay bills and
live at someplace you,

1621
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:38,370
you get kicked off land
and there's no free land.

1622
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:39,330
That's how it all started.

1623
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,830
Is the native Indians being like,

1624
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,040
you want it?

1625
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,030
You want to buy this land
with the fuck he talking?

1626
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,120
Yeah,

1627
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,861
seven bucks.

1628
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:47,730
You could have Manhattan,

1629
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:48,451
Indiana,

1630
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:53,130
than any other mother fucker like you
dumb mother fucker will get to the idea to

1631
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:53,881
them was absolutely,

1632
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:54,691
completely ridiculous.

1633
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,150
And now the whole thing is criss crossed.

1634
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,490
All of society is crisscrossed with tiny,

1635
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,480
weird connections.

1636
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,630
The deed to the house and the land
and the house and the certificate of

1637
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:07,530
ownership of the House and the
property tax you pay and all this,

1638
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:09,270
it's all imaginary shit.

1639
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,620
None of it's real.

1640
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,180
We all believe it's real.

1641
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,640
Now only do believe we believe her.

1642
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,041
It's real.

1643
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,970
But we're so focused on it that
we've forgotten about what Israel,

1644
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,260
which is the material universe,

1645
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,580
which is the fucking,

1646
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:20,820
uh,

1647
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,520
water and the ground and the environment.

1648
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:26,640
And we're just pumping shit out into it
because that stuff doesn't seem real.

1649
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,140
It's a leisure thing.

1650
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,630
You go out for a hike in
the woods on a Sunday,

1651
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,340
that's when you go into nature.

1652
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:35,550
You maybe on occasion take
the lady for a picnic,

1653
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,511
you know,

1654
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:37,830
but that's how you go to nature.

1655
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:38,400
And now,

1656
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,731
you know,

1657
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,211
and it's just a,

1658
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:40,560
it's like a novelty.

1659
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,760
Well look a tree,

1660
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,150
that tree dude,

1661
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,660
nobody realized how more than me when I
actually moved to the woods when I was

1662
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:51,280
living in Colorado for those months,

1663
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,160
three,

1664
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,993
almost four months.

1665
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,160
And uh,

1666
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,880
when I was living,

1667
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,370
I was basically living on a
dirt road on the mountain,

1668
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,540
like in the middle of nowhere,

1669
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,310
like literally completely
in the middle of nowhere.

1670
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:03,580
And you see everything that you
see all this shit that's alive.

1671
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,010
It's just running around out
there and man it out here.

1672
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:07,900
I see a deer every now and then out here.

1673
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:08,290
I mean,

1674
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,501
you know,

1675
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:09,550
you see like,

1676
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:10,100
um,

1677
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,450
uh,

1678
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,210
coyotes all the time and every now and
then someone will see a mountain lion in

1679
00:46:13,211 --> 00:46:13,990
this area here,

1680
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,180
but in Colorado was all over the place.

1681
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,420
It was like you were in there,

1682
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,520
their area,

1683
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,690
like they walked through town,

1684
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,080
there was this place called evergreen
and every year the elk would migrate

1685
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:26,950
through town and you're talking about
hundreds of these giant animals.

1686
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,330
They're like deer on steroids.

1687
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:31,810
He's big fucking Brock Lesnar looking
deer and they walk into the middle of

1688
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:32,500
town,

1689
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,460
they don't give a fuck.

1690
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,350
They walk right on the the streets.

1691
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,281
Hundreds of them.

1692
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:36,551
Dude.

1693
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:37,181
It's insane.

1694
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:38,680
Like this giant migration of them.

1695
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,000
It's amazing.

1696
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,320
And you know what goes with them.

1697
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,560
Lions.

1698
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,393
All right.

1699
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,440
Mine's follow them.

1700
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,240
So when they come around,

1701
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:49,720
you've got to worry about mountain lions
being around to the fact that oh yeah,

1702
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,670
noise that used to be life.

1703
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,030
One Dude shot one in his backyard
while I was living there.

1704
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:55,860
It uh,

1705
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,140
it gotten into his chicken coop
and was jacking his chickens.

1706
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,710
Imagine that fucking terrifying moment
where you go outside and there was a

1707
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:07,150
monster eating your chickens in a cage
and it quad its way into this cage and

1708
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,580
it's in there now and you've got
to shoot it before it eats you.

1709
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,180
Right?

1710
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,230
Cause it could eat you.

1711
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,801
It could say,

1712
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:11,981
Whoa,

1713
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:13,510
this is way better than a chicken.

1714
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,400
Let me just eat this old person.

1715
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,731
Yeah,

1716
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:16,570
that's real.

1717
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:16,841
Yeah.

1718
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:18,400
If you don't get good with that finger,

1719
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:19,031
motherfucker,

1720
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:20,500
you got to get good with that finger.

1721
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,000
You better have an aim bitch.

1722
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:22,680
Well,

1723
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,590
like our version of that
is I got a parking ticket.

1724
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,150
It's the same,

1725
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,010
it's like

1726
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,320
a negative force impacting your life,

1727
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,670
but it's a much more humbling and
beautiful forest that makes you appreciate

1728
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,310
your real place in the circle.

1729
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:39,971
You know,

1730
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:41,110
when I was living up there,

1731
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,920
what I really loved about it is that I
would go to New York and shit and I was

1732
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,520
like,

1733
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,750
when I first started moving there,

1734
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,823
when I first moved there,

1735
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,110
I did the open Anthony Show and uh,

1736
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:54,010
I stayed in this hotel in New York that
had this crazy view and I looked out the

1737
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:54,791
window and I'm just like,

1738
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,450
how weird is this that I'm like right
now I'm on the death star and I live with

1739
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,520
fucking grizzly Adams up in the woods.

1740
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,510
That's where I'm living right now.

1741
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:01,930
Like this is a,

1742
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:02,763
this is my,

1743
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,850
my new place.

1744
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,150
So I'm going from like the wilderness to
cities and we'll invest to La a couple

1745
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,320
of times to wilderness to different places
where I did stand up and I was like,

1746
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,620
this is one of the fucking strangest
ways to look at things ever.

1747
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,930
Because now I'm getting at you.

1748
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,241
I'm like,

1749
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,370
I'm looking at the whole
world from the outside.

1750
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:19,360
I live on dirt,

1751
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,490
I live on dirt with trees.

1752
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,480
That's all that's around you.

1753
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,260
And when you like that and you're in
this like really tight little small

1754
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,850
community up there because very,

1755
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:28,750
very few people,

1756
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,330
you get a totally different
view of the whole world.

1757
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,250
It's all going on in Saudi Arabia,

1758
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,091
you know in Iraq.

1759
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:37,990
There's issues right now with bombs and
shit's blowing up and they're starting

1760
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,260
the,

1761
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,741
the uh,

1762
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:39,371
the fucking,

1763
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:39,441
the,

1764
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:39,571
the,

1765
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:39,721
the,

1766
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:40,780
the Mecca there.

1767
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,560
They're all making their pilgrimage
to Mecca and all this is all gone.

1768
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,600
The news and I'll just look out and
I'll still a little chipmunks and shit.

1769
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,970
Shit much were just chilling.

1770
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,040
Chipmunks don't give a fuck
about Iraq and Afghanistan.

1771
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:51,880
It's doing near here.

1772
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,451
Don't like,

1773
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:53,350
what are you tripping on dude?

1774
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,483
Just relax.

1775
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:55,570
Chipmunks.

1776
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,950
People are trying to
eat us and we're cool.

1777
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:57,850
Yeah,

1778
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,230
that's,

1779
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:58,630
we'll see.

1780
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,291
And so that,

1781
00:48:59,291 --> 00:48:59,920
that's what,

1782
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,980
that's an experience with
something called health.

1783
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,760
That's what,

1784
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,760
that's what it feels like to
be healthy if feels like it's,

1785
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,690
it feels like to be,

1786
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,070
we are so connected.

1787
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,020
I think with our physical hardware,

1788
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:13,570
our bodies that are set
up for the caveman days,

1789
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,780
we're so connected with what our bodies
need that if we're like completely

1790
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,710
plugged into the system,

1791
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,040
I think our whole shit is getting rewired
like in this weird like super quick

1792
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:30,700
way because we have to keep up with all
the bullshit you have to be aware of in

1793
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,960
life and you don't have this peaceful
time that people used to have.

1794
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,970
Like even when people were
hunters and gatherers and shit,

1795
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,200
when when they will fucking made houses
and they figured out how to make fire

1796
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:42,870
places and shit at the end of the night
after they killed an animal and the

1797
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:43,600
sitting around eating it,

1798
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,190
they were fucking relaxed.

1799
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,623
You know what I'm saying?

1800
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,080
And let them owe anybody shit unless
they're stressing about things that we

1801
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:50,914
didn't stress about.

1802
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,361
Oh,

1803
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:55,060
there's a blizzard and our house
and it's way better to be alive now.

1804
00:49:55,061 --> 00:49:57,790
I'm not saying that there's
definitely right about that guy.

1805
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,840
There's an anarchist that you can look
up and his name is John Zerzan and he's,

1806
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:03,070
it's a fascinating guy.

1807
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:04,240
He's very intelligent.

1808
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,820
And he talks about his premises.

1809
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,870
Actually,

1810
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:08,500
no,

1811
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,010
uh,

1812
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,390
that was times were terrible.

1813
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:12,610
But before that and the distant past,

1814
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:17,350
before people started using language or
assemble systems to represent reality,

1815
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,640
we were in paradise.

1816
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,770
I don't buy that man.

1817
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:21,890
That's so speculative.

1818
00:50:21,891 --> 00:50:22,190
And,

1819
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,850
and what the problem I have with
that is if we were in paradise,

1820
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,350
why did it all turned to shit?

1821
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,270
I think have this romantic
way of looking at the past.

1822
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:29,991
And I guarantee you,

1823
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,390
if you fucking go to the
zoo and see how do she,

1824
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,440
chimps are to each other,

1825
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:33,801
you know,

1826
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:37,100
watch documentaries about chimps sneaking
across lines and beating the fuck out

1827
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,360
of other chimps and killing them.

1828
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,590
And then coming back to their little,

1829
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,011
look,

1830
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,250
man,

1831
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,090
I'm not buying it.

1832
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,100
We evolved because of competition.

1833
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,150
That's for the most part,

1834
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:45,680
the only reason why things get better.

1835
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:46,850
They get better because I have to,

1836
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,560
because everything else is
getting better around them.

1837
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,360
So if we were in paradise,

1838
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,620
why the fuck are we come up
with language and fucking,

1839
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:53,271
I agree with you.

1840
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,104
I don't agree with Zeros.

1841
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,310
And I was just knocked out.

1842
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:58,940
Their brains get infinitely
more complex as things go along.

1843
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,020
It's just going to happen.

1844
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:00,470
It's the,

1845
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,730
the ethic of the universe.

1846
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,360
But that doesn't mean that at one point
in time when it wasn't as complex,

1847
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:07,940
it was better that
golden age that's there.

1848
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,803
They're crazy.

1849
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,730
They're all kinda talks about
that a little bit though.

1850
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:11,201
He's his,

1851
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,440
his psychedelically induced though,

1852
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:13,910
which is much more plausible theory.

1853
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:14,923
The idea,

1854
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,640
his idea is that Mckenna thought that at
one point in time the monkeys had gone

1855
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,211
and the,

1856
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,330
the climate had changed and the rain
forest had receded to grasslands.

1857
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,200
So the monkeys were climbing out of the
trees and experimenting with different

1858
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:27,891
food sources.

1859
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:32,120
And one of them was they would flip over
cow patties to find bugs down date and

1860
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:32,270
the,

1861
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:32,541
yeah,

1862
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,580
and they ate mushrooms
and they developed and,

1863
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:34,841
and,

1864
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,240
and,

1865
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,690
but that one is based on like
an actual plant that exists.

1866
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,583
You know what I mean?

1867
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,480
And so like an actual time where the,

1868
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:41,920
the,

1869
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,250
the,

1870
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,530
you know,

1871
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,670
rain forest did receive,

1872
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:44,510
this is all fact,

1873
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,344
that's all science.

1874
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,020
And they know that much
monkeys have eaten mushrooms.

1875
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,350
Man,

1876
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,520
they know a bunch of different instances
of all sorts of animals eating all

1877
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:54,230
sorts of things that
affect their consciousness.

1878
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,370
Like elephants will get used to like
fermented fruit and they get drunk off of

1879
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:57,630
that.

1880
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,810
It happens with monkeys if they get,

1881
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,070
they get used to booze.

1882
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,590
Somebody posted on my Facebook,

1883
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,830
a great video of Orangutans,

1884
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:07,820
David Attenborough,

1885
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,380
shelling orangutans,

1886
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,150
washing socks in a river.

1887
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,940
One of them is trying
to saw a piece of wood.

1888
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,310
One of them's got a hammer
and it's hitting a nail,

1889
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,180
kind of looks like in dawn of the dead
when the zombies tried to do shit.

1890
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:20,511
You know,

1891
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:21,860
like they're kind of doing it wrong,

1892
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:23,480
but they're definitely like Zombie.

1893
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,620
They're imitating,

1894
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:24,951
you know,

1895
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:25,591
and it's,

1896
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:26,900
it's like look it up,

1897
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:28,560
David Attenborough orangutan.

1898
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,540
I'm sure it's there,

1899
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,680
but it's like you look at that and
you see how quickly the orangutans are

1900
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:37,910
adopting these sort of behavior patterns
from what they're watching and you can

1901
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:40,040
see how quickly it would
all fucking happen.

1902
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:40,330
I,

1903
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,031
it's just a trick.

1904
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:43,280
And they're all trained
monkeys and that is,

1905
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,911
and they're like,

1906
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:44,151
all right,

1907
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:45,350
now you're going to be hammering here,

1908
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,650
right?

1909
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:45,920
Yeah.

1910
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,510
Actually that's what the
first thing he said is,

1911
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,010
these are not trained monkeys.

1912
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,470
These,

1913
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,690
they're just imitating.

1914
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,783
How do you know Brian?

1915
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,181
And I said,

1916
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:54,140
maybe he's a liar.

1917
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,611
He's not a liar.

1918
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,580
It's the whole thing is fascinating,

1919
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:58,920
man.

1920
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,900
I think the idea of evolution happening
right before our eyes is fascinating.

1921
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,170
Yeah.

1922
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,850
There was a lizard that was fucking,

1923
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:05,900
forget the exact story,

1924
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:08,510
but it's very clear evolution
and the change of its,

1925
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,600
its stomach because it was
on an island for 20 years.

1926
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,790
I mean they came from one environment,

1927
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:14,870
they had to adapt to a new one,

1928
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:17,780
but they adapted like super quick and
they're still there alive with like a very

1929
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,260
clear difference between the lizards.

1930
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:20,240
So to come from,

1931
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:20,421
you know,

1932
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,490
the original origin or original source,

1933
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,690
you know what I mean?

1934
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,620
The Congo is another perfect of that.

1935
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:25,861
You know,

1936
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:26,640
the Congo,

1937
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,780
like 2000 years ago,

1938
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:30,390
the Congo was grasslands and it be,

1939
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:35,010
the climate shifted very quickly in all
these like prairie or plains animals.

1940
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,551
Like,

1941
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:38,880
I'm like gazelles and a even rhinos,

1942
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,970
they're stuck in this rain forest.

1943
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,540
It just kind of grew up around them.

1944
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,370
Weird Dude,

1945
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:45,204
the Congo,

1946
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,330
we've talked about this before on the
documentary and I don't know how to get

1947
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:48,600
this.

1948
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,490
The documentary is from the BBC.

1949
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,160
Um,

1950
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,680
and it's not available on DVD.

1951
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:53,550
I tried to find it.

1952
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,850
I can't fucking find it.

1953
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,380
Might be,

1954
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,061
isn't that illegal?

1955
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:57,820
We would never do that.

1956
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,260
Brian.

1957
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,770
You do that?

1958
00:53:58,770 --> 00:53:59,310
I own it.

1959
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,390
I own it on VHS.

1960
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,820
But VHS is just so God damn clunky.

1961
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:04,110
Not only do I want it on Vhs,

1962
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:05,100
I own it on VHS.

1963
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:07,080
That's an English version of VHS.

1964
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,143
You know what I'm saying?

1965
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,410
Like isn't there an English
version or is that just DVDs?

1966
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,423
No TV.

1967
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,821
No,

1968
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:14,460
there's a VCRs work or,

1969
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:14,670
yeah.

1970
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:14,941
What is it?

1971
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:15,700
All region.

1972
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,533
Yeah,

1973
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:17,780
exactly.

1974
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,050
Yeah.

1975
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:18,530
So I,

1976
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:18,731
it's,

1977
00:54:18,731 --> 00:54:20,010
I only have the English version.

1978
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,220
This,

1979
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,053
I have a fucking,

1980
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,680
I bought a VCR specifically,

1981
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,150
so I could watch this documentary.

1982
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,220
Like I wanted to make sure that
I go watch this documentary.

1983
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,710
So my VCR plays American
shit and it plays.

1984
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,710
But this fucking documentaries insane.

1985
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:32,400
Man.

1986
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,720
You realize like this whole ecosystem
to change in 2000 and right,

1987
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:35,970
right.

1988
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,970
Fish in the Congo climb out of the
fucking water and walk on the ground until

1989
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:45,990
another pond and he jumps in the water
and then he gets eaten by this crazy bird

1990
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,190
called the shoe bill.

1991
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,900
Holy Fuck.

1992
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:49,810
It's,

1993
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,310
you wouldn't even believe this God damn
thing was real if you didn't see it.

1994
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,570
It's six feet tall,

1995
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:55,021
like five,

1996
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:55,711
six feet tall,

1997
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:59,250
giant ass fucking bird with our huge beak.

1998
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,540
These big fucking burdening
bone crushing beak.

1999
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,403
That's what it is.

2000
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,191
And it's just this,

2001
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:09,000
this fish that's trying to walk from one
place to another jumped into the water

2002
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,230
and this Burgess Jack's,

2003
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,730
it just a murderous crushing
fucking jaw and he's evil eyes.

2004
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:15,440
Man.

2005
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,490
Birds have some of the nastiest,

2006
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:19,500
most evil fucking eyes they do.

2007
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,130
Dude,

2008
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:24,240
if they hadn't fucking media
didn't hit 65 million years ago,

2009
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:25,470
we would have been fucked.

2010
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,120
We will never become us,

2011
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,440
would never become us,

2012
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,630
have never figured out how
to kill all those lizards.

2013
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,591
There's lizards,

2014
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:32,071
didn't die,

2015
00:55:32,071 --> 00:55:32,904
brother.

2016
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,340
They went underground.

2017
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,970
Mckenna fucked my dog.

2018
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,880
Reptilian reptilian transformation.

2019
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,970
Have you seen the reptilian
transformation videos on the Internet?

2020
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,980
They were so funny.

2021
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,390
Proof that,

2022
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,110
what's his name?

2023
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,520
Who's that crazy guy does interviews,

2024
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:54,200
lyric dike proof that Larry King is a
rep telling you and it always has this

2025
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:56,390
dramatic music playing
kind of techno music.

2026
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:57,224
This is like,

2027
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,240
hmm.

2028
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,840
And it slowed down on Larry King
and for whatever dumb reason,

2029
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:04,800
Larry King licks his lips like,

2030
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,400
and it kind of looks like a lizard,

2031
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:09,950
but right when he licks his lips
and music changes and it's like,

2032
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,421
dude,

2033
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:10,610
dude,

2034
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,060
dude,

2035
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:11,541
dude,

2036
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:12,150
dude,

2037
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,860
like this is a proof that
fucking Larry King is a lizard.

2038
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,850
Sure isn't a joke.

2039
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:17,720
No.

2040
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,640
Oh,

2041
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,900
people believe in the reptilians table.

2042
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,070
Doesn't that sound like a tiller or

2043
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,370
it's just the ongoing troll on the
Internet that you're falling for?

2044
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,941
No Way.

2045
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:28,661
It'd be Brian.

2046
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,201
That could be,

2047
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,190
there's a lot of trolls.

2048
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,290
There are so many Goddamn trolls.

2049
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,810
So many people that think it's funny to
pretend to be somebody who they're not.

2050
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,141
Oh,

2051
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,280
I know a little bit about that.

2052
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,070
But I think that the,

2053
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:37,840
the,

2054
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,673
the uh,

2055
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,280
the,

2056
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,330
these are serious.

2057
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:40,661
And I,

2058
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:42,460
I told you the time I
talked to Eddie Griffin.

2059
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,860
He explained the whole
reptilian brain at all,

2060
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:46,240
even my credit card number.

2061
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,650
Why do you think he's just making
it up as human beings on the planet?

2062
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,850
How long would the dinosaurs on the planet
look how much we evolve and the time

2063
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:55,300
we were here?

2064
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,040
How much more did the dinosaurs evolved?

2065
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,870
He would hit you with some shit like this.

2066
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,940
Who'd like to take a drink of
his like little champagne bottle?

2067
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,920
He's doubled his little Paul
Mooney champagne bottles.

2068
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,300
I think about this dog.

2069
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,280
If people came from monkeys
and monkeys is still here.

2070
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,170
What the fuck a monkey's doing?

2071
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,790
Why are they still here?

2072
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,350
How come there's still monkeys?

2073
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,790
If we came from monkeys,

2074
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,410
Shit's impossible.

2075
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,641
He's like a black show.

2076
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,930
He did is he's,

2077
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,530
he's his own thing.

2078
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,630
He talks about you follow into the fall.

2079
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:24,464
Joey's stories.

2080
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,890
You will,

2081
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,840
it makes sense too.

2082
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,033
He's funny though.

2083
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,550
When I saw him in the days we've talked
about Eddie Griffin on the podcast too

2084
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:31,001
many times.

2085
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:31,834
Sorry folks.

2086
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,420
But just,

2087
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,120
you got to get to let
shit go where it goes.

2088
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:34,751
When,

2089
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,170
uh,

2090
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,670
when I first met Eddie Griffin,

2091
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:40,330
that was in when he first
just did his HBO special dude.

2092
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,270
He was so fucking good
that each real special.

2093
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:44,140
I don't know if it holds up.

2094
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,983
I said this before,

2095
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,320
I haven't seen it since
I saw it back then,

2096
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,340
but when I saw it back then it was like,

2097
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,710
this is one dynamic fucking entertainer.

2098
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,830
Like this dude is little and skinny and
he was moving around quick and I was

2099
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:53,981
like,

2100
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:54,341
wow.

2101
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:56,140
He was just a fucking star.

2102
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,270
It's like an undeniable star.

2103
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,260
It was like boom.

2104
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,480
But I've never met a dude so crazy.

2105
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,373
I know.

2106
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,420
So much fun.

2107
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:04,901
Yeah,

2108
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:06,160
he is so crazy.

2109
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,900
But he's really cool.

2110
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,030
He had a cigarette in his hand and
we're the backstage of the comedy store.

2111
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,650
Like I did 12 rounds today
with a kickboxing champion.

2112
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,521
Yeah.

2113
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:17,370
For the first six rounds I've met it.

2114
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:18,550
He got the best domain.

2115
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,540
But NIGGA didn't want no mon the last six.

2116
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,374
You know what I'm saying?

2117
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:27,550
He didn't want no mo and he's drinking
and he's got a cigarette and I'm like,

2118
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,780
here's a movie star.

2119
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,320
And he's making up a story about
fighting a kickboxing champion.

2120
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:33,503
Right.

2121
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,760
I just think he would just get drunk
and just see if he could fuck with you.

2122
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,310
I just think he was like
creating stories in his mind.

2123
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:40,540
I don't even think he
was really lying to you.

2124
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,680
I think it was just for him.

2125
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:42,790
I'm a have a good time.

2126
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:44,440
I'm just going to talk some crazy shit.

2127
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,300
You know?

2128
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,133
It was just,

2129
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,900
I mean it wasn't,

2130
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,300
you know,

2131
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:47,770
he was,

2132
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:48,700
he was like,

2133
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,470
it wasn't committed to the theory either.

2134
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,423
You could change him.

2135
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,780
He could change his opinion.

2136
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,231
You know,

2137
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:53,910
like we had,

2138
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,930
we had a conversation
once about the pyramids.

2139
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:56,471
He's like,

2140
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,780
the pyramids were created with sound.

2141
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,190
That's what you don't know.

2142
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,870
The pyramids were creaky.

2143
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,250
You did with sound.

2144
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,460
They use harmonic resonance and Magneto,

2145
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,880
he's making some shit up and they
moved those stones into place.

2146
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:10,960
And I said,

2147
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,160
they don't know how they moved
those stones in the place,

2148
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:16,120
but they think they might've been cement
that was poured to the deal with the

2149
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:17,650
stones is the incredible numbers.

2150
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,830
2,300,000 so I just start fucking
hitting him with all these facts.

2151
00:59:20,831 --> 00:59:22,800
So it's of kind of being
douchey about it yet,

2152
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,320
but it's just one of my pet subjects.

2153
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,270
And I hate when people talk
nonsense about the parents.

2154
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:26,451
Right?

2155
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:27,500
So I go into mining,

2156
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,850
even been poured limestone,

2157
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:29,810
it might not even been cut,

2158
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:30,620
but there is.

2159
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,780
So I tell him all this shit.

2160
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:32,000
He goes,

2161
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,690
but what,

2162
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,523
how many stones?

2163
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,930
So he goes on stage 10 minutes later,

2164
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,140
the pyramids you telling me
2,300,000 stones are cut perfectly.

2165
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,430
He was just absorb.

2166
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,410
It just seems like,

2167
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:45,951
you know,

2168
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:46,550
he just would,

2169
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,540
who changed his opinion?

2170
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:47,991
Like you could,

2171
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:49,460
you could tell him that
he was wrong and we go,

2172
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:49,851
okay,

2173
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:51,350
I'm going to talk about that now.

2174
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,570
And he's got this very
evangelical quality to him.

2175
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,970
We can talk about anything.

2176
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,990
He could happen 10 minutes before and he
would go onstage and he would just fire

2177
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:00,650
off about it.

2178
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:01,190
You know,

2179
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,110
that was one of the fun
things about the comedy store.

2180
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,200
You know,

2181
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,110
it don't get me wrong what I'm saying.

2182
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:09,980
I mean like when I'm telling that he does
this mean he does and it's all most of

2183
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,814
his own shit.

2184
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:11,240
I mean,

2185
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,520
I'm not saying that he's taking
anybody's ideas or anything.

2186
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:16,310
What I'm saying is that he's
just a fascinating character.

2187
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,144
He would like,

2188
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,780
he was like,

2189
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,130
he'd move in and out,

2190
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,113
you know what I mean?

2191
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,130
He would like be brilliant
and then be crazy,

2192
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,391
but when he was brilliant,

2193
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:23,631
you're like,

2194
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:23,991
Whoa,

2195
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:24,620
where's this?

2196
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,910
It's fucking amazing,

2197
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:26,220
dude.

2198
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,500
He would hit some notes,

2199
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:27,950
man.

2200
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:28,461
Oh,

2201
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:29,990
crazy dude.

2202
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,650
I seen that guy destroyed
in a way where I'm like,

2203
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,011
wow,

2204
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:35,210
this guy's like really special.

2205
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:36,260
He's got a special talent.

2206
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,890
Yup.

2207
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,120
He had some killer jokes,

2208
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:42,230
but my favorite one is the one about
about cocaine and cocaine being involved

2209
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:44,860
with the invention of
the telephone that go.

2210
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,070
He goes,

2211
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:46,461
he goes,

2212
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:50,480
because you've got to be high like a
mother fucker to be sitting around going,

2213
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,000
I want to talk to someone
who's not even here.

2214
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,350
That's a great fucking joke.

2215
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,640
I saw him light that fucking comedy
store original room up with that joke.

2216
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:09,650
You've got gotta be high like a mother
fucker with a cigarette in his hand to be

2217
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:10,750
sitting around going,

2218
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,470
I want to talk to somebody who I am.

2219
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,610
And he would just hit them with
this perfect facial expression.

2220
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:16,971
I'd be like,

2221
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:17,250
God,

2222
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,083
it was humbling.

2223
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,461
You know,

2224
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,740
it's like my early days of
news radio in 1994 you know,

2225
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,230
and I was like my act as like
weak kind of work on my act.

2226
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:26,450
I got to tighten it up and
they see a guy like that,

2227
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:26,661
you know,

2228
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:28,820
you'd see a few guys
that you'd see perform.

2229
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,700
So Damon Wayans crack
some out of the park.

2230
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,990
Damon Wayans is one of the most underrated
guys ever do when Damon Wayans did

2231
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,040
his HBO special.

2232
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,020
That is a funny fucking special.

2233
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:40,310
That still holds up.

2234
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,980
It's still pretty fun.

2235
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:42,530
Yeah.

2236
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,750
His stuff is always good to ship.

2237
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:49,730
Talking about meet Tommy Hearns and about
meeting Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson was

2238
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:51,350
mad at him cause he was
making jokes about them.

2239
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:51,471
You know,

2240
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:53,180
it's funny fucking shit man.

2241
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,193
It's good.

2242
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,460
I don't want to fuck it up.

2243
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,294
I don't want to go it.

2244
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,570
But it's like some lab designed him a
punch of Mickey liver be you think you're

2245
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:00,080
funny?

2246
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,570
But he goes,

2247
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:01,550
he started biting me.

2248
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,361
That was what he said.

2249
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:05,630
He biting him and I think it was
before the event or Holyfield in Sudan.

2250
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,530
I think he might've made this special
before Tyson bit Holyfield's ear.

2251
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:11,840
I'm not sure which is
even crazier if he did,

2252
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,360
but it was a funny fucking special mat.

2253
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,040
This had a bunch of good shit in it.

2254
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:19,010
I watched it the other day was
unlike these are your online,

2255
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,280
I can't remember if I saw it online,

2256
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:21,240
if I saw it on the TV,

2257
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,590
but it was,

2258
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:23,920
he's underrated man.

2259
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,000
He was one of those guys that for whatever
reason got famous for movies and got

2260
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:28,080
famous for a lot of stuff.

2261
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,470
But when he was on like as a standup,

2262
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,760
he was fucking great man.

2263
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,020
He was great.

2264
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,730
Like he was really good.

2265
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,180
It's just shocking to me how
few people recognize that.

2266
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:39,900
You know?

2267
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,770
I've never seen it.

2268
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:41,604
I don't think I've ever,

2269
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,980
I don't think I've seen
him do stand reeling dude.

2270
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:44,940
You got to watch his,

2271
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,620
I think it's called last stand.

2272
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,880
I think that's what it's called.

2273
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:48,870
Um,

2274
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,351
like I said,

2275
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,980
I just saw it the other day for the first
time in years and it was really good,

2276
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:53,161
man.

2277
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:53,491
I was like,

2278
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,324
this stuff is,

2279
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,250
he's a sole likable and his whole relaxed
on stage and just he's had just a real

2280
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:00,210
comic man,

2281
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,261
you know?

2282
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,420
It just doesn't really get the
credit that he deserves for that.

2283
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,080
I think,

2284
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,261
I mean,

2285
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:04,420
I,

2286
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,220
I,

2287
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:05,850
I just,

2288
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,300
you know,

2289
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,820
contradict myself because I always say
that people get exactly the credit that

2290
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,560
they deserve because,

2291
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,100
you know,

2292
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:11,933
no one should,

2293
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,601
people who like,

2294
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:13,020
you know,

2295
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:13,860
he doesn't get enough credit,

2296
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:14,071
but yeah,

2297
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:14,521
it does.

2298
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:14,731
You know,

2299
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:15,391
he's fucking,

2300
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:15,871
somehow or another,

2301
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:17,160
he's not connecting to people,

2302
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:17,480
you know,

2303
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:17,881
he's not,

2304
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,950
he's not putting it out or
he's not getting it broadcast.

2305
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:20,850
Like he's got to figure it out.

2306
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:21,481
He just,

2307
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:22,530
he can't just be good.

2308
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:23,010
You have to,

2309
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,120
everybody has to know you're good.

2310
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:24,901
You have to let everybody know.

2311
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,770
There's something out there that again,

2312
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:26,191
hey,

2313
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:27,030
I like this guy here.

2314
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:29,610
You could see what he does on Youtube
and it's gotta be something out there to

2315
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:30,930
connect to people if you're not doing it,

2316
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:31,764
you know?

2317
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,860
Do you see ll cool j last
night on Conan O'brien?

2318
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,140
Something's weird with that guy,

2319
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:38,460
you know one got it.

2320
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,190
Find a clip or watch their habits.

2321
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:45,770
Well he was just acting very crazy
and then like not anything insane,

2322
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:48,340
but like you were just kind
of watching him really.

2323
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:49,920
Something's not right.

2324
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:53,310
Like maybe he went too far in
some kind of drug or something.

2325
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,331
But he was talking about,

2326
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,580
he was at this play recently in La,

2327
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:57,450
like a month ago.

2328
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,680
I did not hear about this.

2329
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,760
And in the play there's this part where
like this wall falls down or something

2330
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:03,240
like that,

2331
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,550
right?

2332
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,383
It's wobbling.

2333
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:09,530
And he saw this wall starting to fall
down and he runs on stage grabs this woman

2334
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,900
tries to get her to
protect her from this wall.

2335
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:13,740
And the woman's like,

2336
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,150
you're ruining my,

2337
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,033
my show,

2338
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:16,590
you know,

2339
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,880
in the middle of a play.

2340
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,220
And he got kicked out
and everything like that.

2341
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,600
But he's telling the story and I'm like,

2342
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,500
this can't be true.

2343
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,830
I googled it and then sure enough there
was like newspaper articles about ll

2344
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:26,151
cool j.

2345
01:04:26,151 --> 01:04:28,830
It goes crazy and jumps on stage of play.

2346
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,200
We must have been so high
unless it was so high.

2347
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:32,851
He was like,

2348
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:33,501
this fucking wall.

2349
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:34,620
It's going to kill the kids.

2350
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,323
He's going to die.

2351
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:37,470
I'm fucking ll cool J.

2352
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:38,610
I'm to jump up there and shit.

2353
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,000
Yeah.

2354
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,220
And he just seemed very
positive on the Coney.

2355
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:41,640
He was just like,

2356
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,690
I just love everything I do.

2357
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:43,080
I like,

2358
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:43,640
he like he,

2359
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,570
he looks like he was anti depressants.

2360
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,231
Yeah.

2361
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,430
That's what it seemed like.

2362
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,160
I got to see it now.

2363
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,140
Pull that shit up on,

2364
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,961
come on.

2365
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:52,620
Find how to find that Conan
O'Brien's episode last night.

2366
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,010
Um,

2367
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:53,843
Google.

2368
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,160
Maybe try to put it together.

2369
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:56,850
Brian,

2370
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,130
come on.

2371
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,200
You're a web genius.

2372
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,850
Do you think it's available online?

2373
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,080
If it's that weird,

2374
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:01,651
see him.

2375
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,670
Somebody probably did it right?

2376
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:03,271
Oh,

2377
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:03,991
probably not.

2378
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:04,390
I mean,

2379
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,280
maybe it was just me.

2380
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:06,630
I don't know.

2381
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,463
I'll find it though.

2382
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:07,861
You think it was?

2383
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:09,210
Maybe it was just you
that thought it was help.

2384
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:09,600
Wait a minute.

2385
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,320
Stop.

2386
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,610
How high were you when this was happening?

2387
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:11,921
No,

2388
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:12,360
I was,

2389
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,110
I was not sure.

2390
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,921
I was not,

2391
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:14,671
I was not high.

2392
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:17,310
It just like he was being weird and then,

2393
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,910
then he told that story
and then it was like,

2394
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:19,301
wow,

2395
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,190
there's something really
weird is going on.

2396
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:24,570
We pay full attention or will you semi
masturbating while you're watching this?

2397
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:25,900
I was laying in,

2398
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:26,863
laying in bed.

2399
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,670
If you leave a man by himself
alone in a room with a TV on,

2400
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,280
80% of his time will be
spent semi masturbating.

2401
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,933
You know,

2402
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,700
I'm just saying,

2403
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,130
Hey,

2404
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,610
I'm just going to run mumbles.

2405
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,540
It feels good and no one's here.

2406
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,180
So will you tell the truth bro?

2407
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:44,860
I was just laying in bed actually,

2408
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:46,380
so it'd be weird as fuck on.

2409
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,820
He got nervous watching an ll cool j,

2410
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,313
uh,

2411
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,960
past videos.

2412
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:56,050
You just created this fucking dilemma
laying in bed with your tramp dog.

2413
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,100
So was it actually an effect
that he didn't recognize it?

2414
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,040
Was that what was going on
or did he actually write?

2415
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,040
It was an effect that he
thought was really happening.

2416
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:06,820
Like a wall was falling down
and he grabbed in the actress,

2417
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:07,840
oh boy.

2418
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:09,490
Maybe just wanting to try
to fuck her real quick.

2419
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,690
He apologized and he said,

2420
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:10,921
you know,

2421
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:11,150
I,

2422
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,580
so he's like,

2423
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:14,770
I'm really embarrassed
about the whole situation,

2424
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:15,460
but I'm thinking,

2425
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,210
really,

2426
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,080
you're at a play.

2427
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:18,640
Why would you ever think that?

2428
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,350
Still in the middle of the plate.

2429
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,460
Ll Cool j such a bad motherfucker and
has so much confidence that you might've

2430
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:25,990
just wanted to fuck that check and said,

2431
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:26,141
mom,

2432
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:28,420
I just rescue a real quick or
pretend to and then a fucker.

2433
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,530
And then can you imagine being at
your play and ll cool j jumps out.

2434
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,301
Fuck you.

2435
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:35,260
Imagine doing a play.

2436
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:35,531
Okay,

2437
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:38,060
it's 2010 we don't need that shit anymore.

2438
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,913
Stupid.

2439
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,030
Very realistic.

2440
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:41,290
Collapsing walls.

2441
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,463
Yeah,

2442
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,720
that Shit's ridiculous.

2443
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:44,951
Yeah.

2444
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:45,431
I don't know.

2445
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:46,211
It's like Morse code.

2446
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,200
We don't need it anymore.

2447
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,233
I don't need that shit.

2448
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,340
We've got way better shit than place.

2449
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:52,990
That's like cave painting.

2450
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:53,824
Stupid.

2451
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:54,963
Stop it.

2452
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:55,361
You know,

2453
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:55,601
man,

2454
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:56,080
that's it.

2455
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,390
That's one of the bad
things about living in la.

2456
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,713
No gay place,

2457
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:05,260
you will inevitably get invited to
one of your actor friends death.

2458
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,770
And it is deck I went to,

2459
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,200
I went to one with my brother and it
was so bad and it was just very serious,

2460
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,150
very serious part.

2461
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,500
That's super serious part.

2462
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,300
And my brother is tr,

2463
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,880
you know when you're with someone and
they're trying not to laugh and you look

2464
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:22,510
over and you see and then you're
trying not to laugh at the same time.

2465
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,100
So in the middle of this play,

2466
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:27,550
which is about the witch burnings and
this woman's doing this very dramatic

2467
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:29,890
monologue about the witch burnings.

2468
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,630
I look over and my brother's like,

2469
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:31,811
God,

2470
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:34,150
his fist balled up and it
looks like he's crying.

2471
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:40,590
Like he was being a fag.

2472
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,520
Worse ma'am.

2473
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,080
Cause he was trying not to laugh so hard.

2474
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:44,531
He was actually,

2475
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:45,311
we both work.

2476
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,121
Cause if you laughed,

2477
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:49,090
it would be that it's a tiny little black
box and you would just look like the

2478
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:51,880
biggest asshole Brian Callen took me to,

2479
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:56,910
he had this acting teacher and this
acting teacher was a fan of musicals.

2480
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,050
And though he claimed to
be married to a woman,

2481
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,820
I had questions.

2482
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,990
So anyway,

2483
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,220
that's neither here nor there.

2484
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,390
So we go to this,

2485
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,150
this show that this guy
puts on and Brian says,

2486
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,220
I got to stop by my
acting coach real quick.

2487
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:10,060
He's got this thing going on.

2488
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:10,421
Come with me.

2489
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:10,751
It'll be fun.

2490
01:08:10,751 --> 01:08:11,560
It'll be fun.

2491
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:11,771
Okay.

2492
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:12,430
What is it?

2493
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:12,551
Well,

2494
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:12,691
it's,

2495
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:13,720
it's just this thing he said,

2496
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:14,201
but I'd like,

2497
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:14,801
he sings,

2498
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:15,440
he's them.

2499
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,400
He likes musicals.

2500
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,740
It's kind of,

2501
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,181
it's gonna be cool.

2502
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:17,541
It's going to go,

2503
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,291
I'll go in there real quick.

2504
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,940
I'll say hi and then we'll
go and then we'll go.

2505
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:20,810
Okay.

2506
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:21,643
So I go,

2507
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,000
I have no idea what I'm getting into.

2508
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:23,211
Okay.

2509
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:28,130
We're high as fucking Paula Abdul on the
ride home from the pharmacy having sex

2510
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:29,330
with Jesus and space.

2511
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:29,961
Okay,

2512
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:33,170
we're fucking ballistically smashed.

2513
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:34,004
You know,

2514
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,110
this was the early days
in my pot smoking too,

2515
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:39,950
where I just wouldn't go deep to way
too many times I would go like in public

2516
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,070
are just way too high.

2517
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,390
Right?

2518
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,930
We should be a home at home under
the covers with the lights out.

2519
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:45,351
Okay.

2520
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:50,060
I should be in my jammies and here I am
just wondering around with seeing random

2521
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:50,510
things.

2522
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,930
So this guy goes on stage and
he's wearing those slip on shoes.

2523
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:58,850
I hate like when I see men with those
slip on dress shoes with the hardwood and

2524
01:08:58,851 --> 01:08:59,500
he'll,

2525
01:08:59,500 --> 01:08:59,701
you know,

2526
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:00,560
those little s wouldn't,

2527
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,420
you know those are things.

2528
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:01,580
Yeah,

2529
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,290
they're almost as bad as the frog shoes.

2530
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:03,861
The sandals.

2531
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:04,694
I know what you're talking about.

2532
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,500
A penny loafers pending offers yet.

2533
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:09,380
And then wearing them with little
skinny black socks like that is not

2534
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:10,214
comfortable.

2535
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,600
That's an uncomfortable shit.

2536
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:12,500
What the fuck are you doing?

2537
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,570
Why do you have to wear that
stupid thing for business?

2538
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:15,590
Like what are you doing now?

2539
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:17,780
You're out singing anywhere
and he's stupid fucking shoes.

2540
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:18,600
And this is just me though.

2541
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,660
That's weird thing about
people dressing like,

2542
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:20,930
you know,

2543
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:21,521
business.

2544
01:09:21,521 --> 01:09:21,681
He,

2545
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:21,891
you know,

2546
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:22,191
I'm like,

2547
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:22,650
this is a,

2548
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,550
you're trying to like appear
to be something to me.

2549
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,241
So he's singing,

2550
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:27,860
he gets on stage and he starts saying,

2551
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:28,970
and this is what he sings,

2552
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,980
songs that are in musicals.

2553
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,403
That's what I mean.

2554
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,440
One,

2555
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,020
one of them walk,

2556
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:36,620
fuck.

2557
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:41,620
One of the lyrics was he was like
singing a song like to a little girl,

2558
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,130
like as dumb.

2559
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:44,810
It might've been a daughter
or something like that.

2560
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,943
And it was like,

2561
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,890
breathe when you need to breathe.

2562
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,180
Like that was one of the lines.

2563
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,030
What was Brian Cowen doing?

2564
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:58,060
We were biting our hands by their
hands and my toes were curling under

2565
01:09:58,671 --> 01:09:59,510
themselves.

2566
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:05,140
It was that one of the most bizarre forms
of entertainment I've ever seen in my

2567
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:05,751
life.

2568
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:10,751
One man singing a bunch of show tunes
to his friends and then his students and

2569
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,620
his students friends all in the little,

2570
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,920
it was in a theater?

2571
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,311
No,

2572
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:17,144
it was in the,

2573
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,373
the um,

2574
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,670
the Roosevelt hotel.

2575
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,020
You know the place in the Roosevelt hotel.

2576
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:21,710
Roosevelt.

2577
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,670
I know what you're talking about.

2578
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:23,361
What we were doing.

2579
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:23,980
Comedy.

2580
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,340
I remember we were doing
comedy there for a while.

2581
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,571
Yeah,

2582
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:26,811
it was,

2583
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:27,260
um,

2584
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:27,831
Jay Davis,

2585
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:28,664
his place.

2586
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:30,530
Remember that he had that room.

2587
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:31,490
It was really cool room.

2588
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,383
Interesting.

2589
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:32,720
Well,

2590
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,530
this is where the guy,

2591
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,670
it was like a cabaret act.

2592
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,330
Yes,

2593
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,080
yes.

2594
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,440
And it was the one of the fucking
girls things I've ever seen in my life.

2595
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:40,970
And of course Brian didn't want to leave.

2596
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:41,481
I can't leave.

2597
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:41,691
I've got to,

2598
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:42,291
which is to stay,

2599
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:42,531
stay,

2600
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:42,950
stay.

2601
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,221
Really.

2602
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:44,054
He was too high.

2603
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:44,983
He didn't want to,

2604
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,900
we were just panicking about going
out and facing the outside world.

2605
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,900
So we sat and watched this
thing go down for like an hour.

2606
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,600
How did the guy get the ll cool j audio,

2607
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:53,990
by the way?

2608
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,081
Oh,

2609
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:54,914
you do?

2610
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:56,030
It's really this interesting.

2611
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:56,450
Okay.

2612
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,283
Well I mean it's,

2613
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,880
you can just listen to it a little
bit of how positive and drug.

2614
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,080
Oh,

2615
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,200
another thing is is he's not
sponsored by this Cologne,

2616
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:05,840
but he brings his favorite
Cologne that he's like,

2617
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:09,110
I've been wearing this all my life
to give it Conan as a precedent.

2618
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:12,170
I am so curious as to whether I'm going
agree with you on how he's behaving.

2619
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,040
Um,

2620
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,120
it'd be better if you,

2621
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,760
uh,

2622
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,541
looked at the video.

2623
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:15,771
I go,

2624
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:16,080
okay,

2625
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,060
let me come over on
Dunkin seat for a second.

2626
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,330
He just seems very happy drug,

2627
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,600
like super happy.

2628
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,700
Like it's almost creepy.

2629
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,470
We're playing musical chairs here.

2630
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:25,861
People,

2631
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:29,640
well Dunkin has to go
on pay fucking child.

2632
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:34,800
Doug has got a weak bladder and we're
going to have to get you one of them.

2633
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:35,560
New Bladders.

2634
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,560
[inaudible]

2635
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:48,830
can everybody else hear this term?

2636
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:50,020
I'm really hearing it
through the microphone.

2637
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:52,240
It's my favorite Cologne.

2638
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,663
Ah,

2639
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,640
buffering.

2640
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,473
Really?

2641
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,163
No,

2642
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,830
I just wear old spice

2643
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,470
is for faggots.

2644
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:09,880
Carry on.

2645
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,653
I'm just kidding.

2646
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,600
Will flock to me now.

2647
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:22,413
Oh cool.

2648
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,140
Thanks so much for being here.

2649
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,700
Congratulations on all your success.

2650
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:34,510
Share your shows.

2651
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,240
A massive hit saying we're
all very happy for you.

2652
01:12:37,241 --> 01:12:37,601
I'm grateful.

2653
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:38,740
Congratulations to you.

2654
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,131
Thank you.

2655
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:40,860
We're having a blast here and I wanted to,

2656
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:41,703
I wanted to say

2657
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:46,510
[inaudible]

2658
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:49,890
in a

2659
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,380
Brian I did.

2660
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,223
I read about

2661
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,170
what's the story?

2662
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,330
Give me the story.

2663
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:05,890
I want to see also the nonsense and he
just had to read about was it going to

2664
01:13:05,891 --> 01:13:06,820
lead right into it right there?

2665
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,573
Who wants to try it?

2666
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,820
You bought the portrait and then you
loaned it out to the Smithsonian.

2667
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:15,901
This is amazing.

2668
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:16,734
It looks very,

2669
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,833
is that him?

2670
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,440
He looks like he had
sex with biggie smalls

2671
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,563
magazine.

2672
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,123
Your kitchen.

2673
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,533
That's it.

2674
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,180
This is whack editing son.

2675
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,240
I'm going to get back to my seat
and he looks pretty normal to me.

2676
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,270
I must have been masturbating.

2677
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:43,104
I forgot.

2678
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,990
It's not as cool as I
remembered it last night.

2679
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,820
I just remembered thinking,

2680
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:55,530
I just remember thinking ll cool j is
cracked out and then he tells us this man.

2681
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,490
He sounds totally normal.

2682
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:57,390
You were high as fuck.

2683
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:58,441
This is evidence.

2684
01:13:58,441 --> 01:13:59,790
You need to get your shit together.

2685
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,230
You got chem trails over your house,

2686
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:03,150
boy Trey and I'm fucking with your head.

2687
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,010
It's a government man to government.

2688
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:06,090
Brian Kelly,

2689
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:06,943
Brian,

2690
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:07,841
ll cool J.

2691
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:10,860
I have met him once when I was on news
radio and seem like a fine young man.

2692
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,660
You're making them out to
be a God damn crackhead.

2693
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,471
What do you think of it?

2694
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:17,980
Totally normal except for the story about
him jumping on in the middle of a play

2695
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,420
or maybe it was a little high then,

2696
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:19,960
bro.

2697
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,760
Well maybe he's just a super nice guy.

2698
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:23,080
Looks do cool shit.

2699
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,420
Or maybe just thought,

2700
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:26,380
let me just fuck this chick quick,

2701
01:14:26,381 --> 01:14:26,870
quick.

2702
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:27,400
She'll pull down,

2703
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,940
grab her belief on,

2704
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:29,853
come on the era.

2705
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:31,330
Come with me.

2706
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,430
He's a handsome man.

2707
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:33,400
He's all yoked and shit.

2708
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:34,480
Maybe you just takes chances.

2709
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,690
I always liked listening to ll cool J's
old songs cause he used to always rap

2710
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,580
about ice cream and puppy dogs.

2711
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:40,201
Do you remember that?

2712
01:14:40,201 --> 01:14:42,880
He'll just throw him like puppy dogs
and ice cream in the middle of a song.

2713
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:43,151
You're just,

2714
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:44,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

2715
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,370
Oh there's old stuff.

2716
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,380
He always talks about ice
cream and licking lips.

2717
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,360
Don't call where's Mama
said knock you out.

2718
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,770
That's a great fucking song.

2719
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:51,604
I don't care.

2720
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,230
As long as I don't hear it too often.

2721
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,030
You know here like once
every couple of years,

2722
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,680
that song is the shit man.

2723
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,650
You know what someone don't
call it a comeback now.

2724
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,180
He had like some angry,

2725
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:02,320
confident wraps,

2726
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:02,681
you know,

2727
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:03,790
he had some fun shit.

2728
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,441
He was good man.

2729
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:06,430
He's a really good rapper.

2730
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,540
You know,

2731
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,261
I enjoy it.

2732
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:09,490
A bunch of his fucking songs,

2733
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,430
so I don't appreciate you
talking shit about him Brian.

2734
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:13,960
Especially when it's so poorly researched.

2735
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,990
You need to study that shit
whilst sober young man.

2736
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,240
You're just terrified of anything black.

2737
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:23,020
It's all my talking about black dicks on
his podcast while staring in your eyes.

2738
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:23,860
It's like there's this,

2739
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,310
it's like nom to me.

2740
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:30,670
I see a black person on the TV and I
just think of you and black dicks chasing

2741
01:15:30,671 --> 01:15:34,630
me down a hallway with some guy in prison
and I'm ripping it and pause off and I

2742
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:36,260
can't stop your,

2743
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,120
you're fucking,

2744
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,391
yeah,

2745
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:40,680
you're an anti rape tech type prison rape.

2746
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:41,680
A ball grabbing.

2747
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:44,110
I've got an email from somebody
asked me to not say rape,

2748
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:44,741
rape,

2749
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:44,921
rape,

2750
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:45,101
rape,

2751
01:15:45,101 --> 01:15:45,480
rape.

2752
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,390
Why use rape?

2753
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,220
It's an unpleasant thought.

2754
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,900
It's an unpleasant,

2755
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,380
you know,

2756
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:50,640
I mean,

2757
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,700
what if somebody Murphy,

2758
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,990
one of your loved ones had been raped?

2759
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:53,860
Would you still use rape?

2760
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,080
Who the fun sends that email?

2761
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:56,681
Well,

2762
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:56,951
you know,

2763
01:15:56,951 --> 01:15:58,330
maybe he had somebody that was raped.

2764
01:15:58,331 --> 01:15:58,481
I mean,

2765
01:15:58,481 --> 01:15:59,314
it's a good point.

2766
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,440
I guess what he's raping your
eyeballs with that email.

2767
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:03,700
Is it,

2768
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,100
does he send emails to
everyone who uses that word?

2769
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:06,941
Maybe.

2770
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:07,181
I mean,

2771
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:07,681
I didn't ask.

2772
01:16:07,681 --> 01:16:08,770
Was he trying to eliminate,

2773
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:10,420
they get too many emails to ask questions,

2774
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:10,521
man.

2775
01:16:10,521 --> 01:16:10,960
That I didn't,

2776
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,000
didn't Cicada I don't know.

2777
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:12,570
I don't know.

2778
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:13,403
Don't mean,

2779
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,890
is that a valid idea?

2780
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,611
The idea that,

2781
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:15,851
you know,

2782
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:17,860
saying something that could hurt
someone's feelings when you could have an

2783
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:20,920
alternative word that maybe wouldn't be
ideal for the expression that you try

2784
01:16:20,921 --> 01:16:21,220
to,

2785
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,790
if we were to going to show four
king king rapey no man for me.

2786
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,320
Come on.

2787
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,580
What percentage of the
guidance sent that email?

2788
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,400
Can you repeat the worst case?

2789
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,100
You know what you're getting?

2790
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:33,933
At least

2791
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:38,800
you know his name is king hugs and
cuddles as a fucking barbarian.

2792
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:41,260
He likes to fuck kids in the ass and
chop their heads off when he comes.

2793
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,570
Moreau word.

2794
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:44,300
Yeah,

2795
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,150
I mean better to be called that.

2796
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,750
Right.

2797
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,040
So you know exactly what you're getting.

2798
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,301
And you know what,

2799
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:51,400
let me come back and we were talking
about before when you're talking about

2800
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,211
this,

2801
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:53,590
all this pillaging talk,

2802
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,780
you know when we're talking
about the vikings and shit,

2803
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,160
so you think that's what,

2804
01:16:57,161 --> 01:16:58,780
that's what killed the Roman Empire,

2805
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,614
right?

2806
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,530
Well it seems like there's a bunch of
different empires did the exact same

2807
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:02,801
thing,

2808
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:03,070
right?

2809
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:03,970
Like the Greeks,

2810
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:04,601
same thing.

2811
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:06,160
They had fantastic structures.

2812
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:07,060
They never repaired them.

2813
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:07,930
Everything went to shit.

2814
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:10,160
And then civilization
of stayed in the same

2815
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,410
area but became completely
vastly different.

2816
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:12,900
Right?

2817
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,470
Yeah.

2818
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:14,360
Isn't that amazing?

2819
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,980
They got these incredible structures,

2820
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,130
like some of the most amazing things
that people have ever built ever.

2821
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:18,351
Right.

2822
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:19,184
The Acropolis,

2823
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,380
Acropolis and the
Parthenon Mirror amazing,

2824
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:22,850
beautiful artwork there.

2825
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:23,780
Sculptures and shit.

2826
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,590
And then they just kind of stopped
doing that and let it all fall to shit.

2827
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,690
Like they forgot how to
repair those buildings.

2828
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:30,890
The same p.

2829
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:31,491
And you know what I'm saying?

2830
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:35,660
People are still living there who's never
unpopulated where it was like a barren

2831
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:38,900
wasteland and nuclear bomb blew off and
people couldn't live there for a fucking

2832
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:39,734
100,000 years.

2833
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,080
No people stayed in that same area,

2834
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,120
but they never figured out
how to fix all that shit.

2835
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:47,270
They just kind of let it fall
apart and nobody owns it.

2836
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,400
I mean somebody owns it obviously.

2837
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:49,701
I mean they,

2838
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:50,660
they have tourism and shit,

2839
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:51,230
but you know what I'm saying?

2840
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,820
Like nobody owned it to fix it,

2841
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:53,541
you know,

2842
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:53,751
hey,

2843
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:54,441
this is my shit.

2844
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,610
I got to fix this fucking thing.

2845
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:56,031
What?

2846
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:57,080
The building's falling apart,

2847
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:57,291
you know?

2848
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:57,591
Okay,

2849
01:17:57,591 --> 01:17:59,330
let's get some workers
to work on the coliseum.

2850
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,691
No,

2851
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,730
they built the coliseum
and then just fucked off.

2852
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,460
You know,

2853
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:02,720
you know,

2854
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,810
I can remember right when
this is it we're in right now.

2855
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,500
He started to kind of go into this
collapsed and it was like three,

2856
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,240
I don't remember how
many years ago it was,

2857
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:15,620
but I remember like sitting in a movie
theater and looking down and there's this

2858
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:18,650
rip in the seat and I looked over and
there to rip and then another seat and I

2859
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:18,861
was like,

2860
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:19,610
you know,

2861
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:20,361
that's different.

2862
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:21,890
Like that would normally be repaired.

2863
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:21,991
It's,

2864
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:24,680
it was like things are kind of
fraying at the edges a little bit.

2865
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:29,360
A while ago and now what you're talking
about is happening here much more like

2866
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:29,601
if you,

2867
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:30,680
if you look around when you're,

2868
01:18:30,681 --> 01:18:31,131
when you're,

2869
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,840
when you're out looking at dirty,

2870
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:33,621
the cars are,

2871
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:34,820
I know that sounds stupid,

2872
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,800
but people aren't washing their cars.

2873
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,410
Like cars are really cost
money to wash your car.

2874
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,400
People have a lot of money now and
things are really getting dilapidated.

2875
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:45,020
You can kind of see
this kind of added this.

2876
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:48,200
Paul is sending over things that
I've never seen in my whole life.

2877
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,430
I've never seen that shit before.

2878
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:51,140
We've never been a part
of a recession before.

2879
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:51,371
Right.

2880
01:18:51,371 --> 01:18:51,590
You know,

2881
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,680
we never been a part of when the fake
system falls apart and then they have to

2882
01:18:54,681 --> 01:18:55,514
kind of rebuild,

2883
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:59,420
but they don't really rebuild the rebuild
on the same structure of what I call

2884
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:00,770
unfixable bullshit.

2885
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:01,281
You know,

2886
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:02,150
the stock market,

2887
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:02,781
the economy,

2888
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:03,920
the political system that we have.

2889
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:04,420
It's all like,

2890
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:08,120
you're going to rebuild the society
on this fucking house of lies.

2891
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:08,410
You know,

2892
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,130
we've got to figure out
a new way to do things.

2893
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:12,050
And when I'm looking at
these other civilizations,

2894
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:13,220
like the Greeks and the Romans,

2895
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:16,200
the ones that risen and fell
like look at the Egyptian.

2896
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,791
Same thing.

2897
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:17,091
You know,

2898
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:19,640
when they discovered those ruins,

2899
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:20,451
those ruins the parent.

2900
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:21,590
There's no one living in them.

2901
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:22,221
They're just,

2902
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,790
they're just giant monuments that
had been taking open and they'd been,

2903
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,330
you know,

2904
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:29,570
people would read them and stolen all
the artifacts and stuff and sold them,

2905
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:30,410
but there was,

2906
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:31,790
there's no one living in there.

2907
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:34,340
Those are the most amazing structures
human beings have ever created.

2908
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,910
And their civilization devolved to
the point where people moved out.

2909
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:38,910
That's a,

2910
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,130
that's a pretty incredible,

2911
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,480
it's pretty incredible.

2912
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,760
Most amazing civilization ever.

2913
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:44,750
And it fell apart so much.

2914
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:46,160
So there was no one living there.

2915
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,000
All right.

2916
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,420
What the Mayans too right now,

2917
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,960
the is to doing very,

2918
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:53,180
very interesting and similar story.

2919
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,250
They don't know exactly what
happened with the Mayans.

2920
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:55,971
They,

2921
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:56,361
you know,

2922
01:19:56,361 --> 01:19:57,380
the Mayans weren't like,

2923
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:57,920
like someone said,

2924
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,341
oh they were,

2925
01:19:58,341 --> 01:19:58,971
they were killed.

2926
01:19:58,971 --> 01:19:59,301
But no,

2927
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:00,080
that's not true.

2928
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,913
They don't know.

2929
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,510
They don't know what
happened to the mines.

2930
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,010
It appears like the man's just left.

2931
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:07,070
That's why all these nutty fucking
lizard reptilian believe in.

2932
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:08,690
So they were in a space ship.

2933
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,880
They came and [inaudible] took them on
a fiery serpent serpent with feathers,

2934
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:15,121
right?

2935
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:15,954
The feathered serpent.

2936
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,973
A chordal.

2937
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,040
Yeah.

2938
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,140
That's quick sit quite,

2939
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:19,420
yeah.

2940
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,253
Quite so Quadel.

2941
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:20,911
Yeah.

2942
01:20:20,911 --> 01:20:22,220
There was a movie called model.

2943
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,800
There was a movie called cue
and I liked when I was a kid,

2944
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:27,720
which is about a Kwikset Quadel attacking.

2945
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:28,051
I said,

2946
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:28,161
hey,

2947
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:29,160
it's really great.

2948
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:29,430
Yeah,

2949
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,400
it's called Q.

2950
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,303
Oh yeah.

2951
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,730
He's telling me it's on iTunes.

2952
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:33,421
I don't know.

2953
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:34,740
It's like an old school movie.

2954
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:35,101
And it's like,

2955
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:35,650
oh,

2956
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,230
I must Google that right now.

2957
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,680
Needs to make a Queso
quatro fucking movie,

2958
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:41,430
man.

2959
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,080
I already gave you your bitches.

2960
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,850
A Wolf Werewolf on a plane.

2961
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,180
Although I heard that that
chuck power on the hook and the,

2962
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,360
what's his name,

2963
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,650
the guy who wrote fight club,

2964
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:50,484
the guy who wrote,

2965
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,201
he wrote,

2966
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:53,034
um,

2967
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:53,461
oh,

2968
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:56,250
I know you're telling me you famous
authors to bring a bunch of great books.

2969
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:57,830
He made a scene and,

2970
01:20:57,831 --> 01:20:59,280
and then someone actually
sent me the scene.

2971
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,080
I thought it was inventing
a beautiful moment.

2972
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,670
A guy,

2973
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,503
a girl.

2974
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,610
I was a in a on a flight once and a
girl had a seizure and I was like,

2975
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,680
what does she turn into a Werewolf fuck?

2976
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,970
Could you imagine being on a plane?

2977
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,530
And so apparently chuck Pyle and a Hook
knuck everybody's name is a fantastic

2978
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:13,741
writer,

2979
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:14,574
already thought of it.

2980
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,570
Damn the fucker.

2981
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:16,990
He had it.

2982
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,870
He made it even creepier
cause it was a little girl.

2983
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:19,890
That motherfucker,

2984
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,150
it's really up to me,

2985
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,700
up to me and he's genius.

2986
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,980
Well,

2987
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,340
it's pretty the coolest scripture,

2988
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,340
the way you described it to,

2989
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,511
he's got a really,

2990
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:28,680
a harsh way of,

2991
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:29,070
uh,

2992
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,590
of depicting things where it's like,

2993
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,260
it just,

2994
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:31,650
it just,

2995
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,270
there's like no judgment to it.

2996
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:33,601
It's just,

2997
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:34,650
this is what's happening.

2998
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:35,371
You know,

2999
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:35,701
it's like,

3000
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:36,271
here it is.

3001
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:36,601
It's like,

3002
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:36,920
whoa.

3003
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,070
You know,

3004
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,040
like you read his shit.

3005
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:41,400
I love writers like that because
he's like that fucking love that.

3006
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,200
I just started watching a
documentary on B calcium.

3007
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,123
Which one?

3008
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:44,641
I'll tell you,

3009
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:48,570
it's on my iTunes because I was watching
it on the plane and I was enjoying it

3010
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:49,920
up into a point that I was like,

3011
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:50,611
God damn,

3012
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,670
this motherfucker was
negative at certain points.

3013
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:54,211
I was like,

3014
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:54,960
dude,

3015
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,830
bring it on yourself,

3016
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:56,490
bitch.

3017
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:58,590
Born into this

3018
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,480
barn and tireless,

3019
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:06,900
I had a recording of him reading his
poetry and somebody who was heckling him

3020
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:08,610
for whatever reason and
all of a sudden he's,

3021
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,140
he just stops and he's like,

3022
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:15,000
I've got a blade in my
pocket and I will cut you.

3023
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:15,834
Man.

3024
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:20,500
He was serious.

3025
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,260
Shrunk.

3026
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,320
It was totally serious.

3027
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:23,880
Like he was,

3028
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:28,710
he was like ready to fight cause he was
a bar brawl brawl with people and he did

3029
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:29,461
it on purpose.

3030
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:32,430
Like his whole idea was
that it got to live.

3031
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,190
You got fuck,

3032
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,713
uh,

3033
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,140
get drunk.

3034
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,033
Yeah.

3035
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:41,550
Can't just fucking shit this out.

3036
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,880
And this really crazy way of
looking at life that you had,

3037
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:48,240
he was willing to like believe
a wild life or his writing.

3038
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,520
Well he reminds me of like a zen master.

3039
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:55,521
Like if you read zen poetry and like
this pure crisp description of reality

3040
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:56,620
that's theirs.

3041
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,570
It's the same kind of thing,

3042
01:22:57,571 --> 01:23:02,571
but he's just talking about filthy
whore tenements and people were like,

3043
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:03,750
well that's not good.

3044
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:04,070
It's like,

3045
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,681
yes it is.

3046
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:06,360
It's just not good for him.

3047
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,383
First of all,

3048
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,750
I ate a pot cookie on the plane so it
was not the best time to be watching

3049
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,310
something like this.

3050
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,190
Just guys on negative,

3051
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,720
God damn so crazy,

3052
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,471
but he's negative.

3053
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:15,550
Ever get scared of that though,

3054
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:18,460
that you're going to eat the
wrong strongest cookie ever.

3055
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,960
One time it happened many times I've
learned some of the greatest lessons about

3056
01:23:21,961 --> 01:23:22,280
life,

3057
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,340
little prizes,

3058
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,120
like I get scared by those trips,

3059
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:26,620
but those trips teach me everything.

3060
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:27,793
That's where I learn.

3061
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,241
Totally.

3062
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,350
Cause you don't listen.

3063
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,990
You wouldn't normally
invite that onto yourself,

3064
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,910
etc. Or whatever reason.

3065
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:37,550
You eat too much and then you're
like going into the fucking grader.

3066
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:42,220
There's layers upon layers of denial and
a good pot cookie will wipe out nearly

3067
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:46,600
all them bitches nearly all and
fucking shine some lights on,

3068
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:47,890
some shit you forgot about.

3069
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,930
And it's healing too.

3070
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:50,201
It's like,

3071
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:50,441
you know,

3072
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:54,610
everyone talks about how marijuana has
medicinal and I never understood that

3073
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,720
until I ate a lot of pot and was a,

3074
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,270
was like laying down and
I really felt as though,

3075
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:05,020
or like going through my psyche
and doing a defrag or something,

3076
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:05,591
I was like put,

3077
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:05,821
you know,

3078
01:24:05,821 --> 01:24:06,430
it's like,

3079
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:07,263
um,

3080
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:11,020
it was like cleaning up stuff and like
getting rid of the bullshit and it really

3081
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:14,790
like for weeks after that I
felt a million times happier.

3082
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:15,010
It,

3083
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:17,050
it really is like medicine for the ego.

3084
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,500
Yeah.

3085
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,820
It's like ego tablets.

3086
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,040
Ego's been lying to you here,

3087
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:22,570
take this and you could
see what's going on.

3088
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:23,404
Oh look,

3089
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:24,880
you've got all this happening here.

3090
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:26,440
I know this is why you won't do that.

3091
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:26,771
And you know,

3092
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,870
you don't clean your office because you
don't want to come to the consequences

3093
01:24:28,871 --> 01:24:29,630
of being a success.

3094
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:30,070
And you know,

3095
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,903
if

3096
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,970
you let go what your fucking parents did,

3097
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:34,511
they were stupid.

3098
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:35,111
They were young too.

3099
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:35,561
Okay.

3100
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:36,110
Fuck yeah.

3101
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,410
It's almost like an grudge.

3102
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:41,740
It's almost like a coach standing
right next to you tie that in a tank.

3103
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:43,571
That's where it's at.

3104
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:43,871
Dude.

3105
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,930
That's where it's how we can have a
way better world if people would just,

3106
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,990
I need to make a duck and
it's not a documentary thing.

3107
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:55,170
I need to make something happen where
more people get access to these tanks and

3108
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:56,410
like document it,

3109
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:58,930
set these tanks up all over the place,

3110
01:24:59,140 --> 01:24:59,501
get,

3111
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:03,490
get people involved in them and get them
to get high as fuck and go in there and

3112
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:05,230
get them to reevaluate their life.

3113
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,910
You should do it as AI.

3114
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,600
It would be awesome is if you can figure
out a way to do that with prisons.

3115
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:15,130
C three you get prisoners
make the water dirty.

3116
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:15,411
No,

3117
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:16,390
you gotta you gotta,

3118
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:16,870
you know?

3119
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:17,320
No,

3120
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,160
that's too much work.

3121
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,421
It's work,

3122
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:19,871
but it's like,

3123
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:20,710
to me that's the,

3124
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,570
I've always thought that if they,

3125
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:25,170
if they need a bunch of steps
before they get the isolation tanks,

3126
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:28,540
you can't just let dude's fucking climate
a tank of water dudes with jumping in

3127
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,021
there with them and,

3128
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:29,854
but fucking him.

3129
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,470
She'd have to control all that.

3130
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,890
Would have way too much salt in it.

3131
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:34,710
Yeah.

3132
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,051
I'm not,

3133
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:37,470
I'm not in favor of rewarding
prisoners would shit that.

3134
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,400
I don't think it to figure out a way to,

3135
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:39,920
uh,

3136
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,240
you know,

3137
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,140
counsel them to,

3138
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:41,890
you know,

3139
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,120
integrate them back in society.

3140
01:25:43,121 --> 01:25:45,550
And I don't think the system that they
have right now is the right way to do it.

3141
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:49,360
But if I was a fucking victim or the
family of a victim and there's some dude

3142
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,340
who's getting an isolation
tank and I can't afford it,

3143
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:51,671
I'd be like,

3144
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:52,540
fuck you.

3145
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,201
You know,

3146
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:54,610
I don't think they deserve that shit.

3147
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:55,470
It's just you,

3148
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:59,200
you have to punish people and you have
to set an example for doing shitty things

3149
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:01,960
as long as it's not like drug
related nonviolent crimes,

3150
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:02,411
you know,

3151
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:02,591
like,

3152
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:02,731
oh,

3153
01:26:02,731 --> 01:26:03,770
he had a of pot on him,

3154
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:04,040
now he's

3155
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,581
in jail.

3156
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:04,731
You know,

3157
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:08,780
that kind of nonsense when you watch
locked up raw and you see the way these

3158
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:09,531
guys are being treated,

3159
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,360
they're freaking out.

3160
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:10,640
Yeah,

3161
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,280
it's horrible.

3162
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,020
It's like,

3163
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:12,440
okay,

3164
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,273
I get it.

3165
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,120
Vengeance.

3166
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,570
And I understand that desire
for vengeance from the family,

3167
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,760
but isn't there like
a bigger picture here?

3168
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:20,570
Which is that,

3169
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:20,841
yeah,

3170
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:21,800
you want vengeance,

3171
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,220
but that's just part of the same problem
is that this part of the same problem,

3172
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:28,100
but the problem is this person is not
going to get any better if you let them

3173
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:29,510
out and they don't learn
anything from this,

3174
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:30,290
they don't suffer.

3175
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,011
And guess what?

3176
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,030
Nothing changed it and
you leave them in what?

3177
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:33,890
Nothing changes either.

3178
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:34,850
They didn't beat up.

3179
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,990
I don't think they learn anything from
the current way they they're treated,

3180
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:42,230
but at least the victims
have the satisfaction of
knowing that this person has

3181
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:43,160
to pay for their suffering,

3182
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:45,830
which is great until that
fucking person gets let out.

3183
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,360
It would have been don't ever four months,

3184
01:26:47,361 --> 01:26:48,350
but a lot of them do.

3185
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,863
Yes.

3186
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,331
Suddenly.

3187
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:51,320
So now you got your,

3188
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,090
your your fucking pound of flesh.

3189
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,860
This guy got raped for 10 years.

3190
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,120
He got addicted to foot,

3191
01:26:56,121 --> 01:27:00,140
some weird drug and now he's out in the
streets and he's going to do it again.

3192
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:00,890
Yeah.

3193
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:02,090
And then that spreads more.

3194
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,700
That spreads more of taking like very,

3195
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:06,740
very like very specific examples.

3196
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:10,430
But it's more important than anything to
protect people from people that want to

3197
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:11,240
harm them.

3198
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,350
That's the most important thing.

3199
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:13,910
So if anybody's is violent,

3200
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:14,960
if anybody's dangerous,

3201
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:15,920
they need to be locked up.

3202
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:18,810
And if they don't learn or if you
don't think that they're there,

3203
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:21,140
they have a real objective assessment.

3204
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:22,970
And I think that this guy is
going to go back and get revenge,

3205
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:23,960
should never be let out.

3206
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,111
Well,

3207
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:26,070
I was reading Mckenna talking about you.

3208
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,830
How do you diagnose that?

3209
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:31,640
I was correctly make that call and not
imprison someone for life because you

3210
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:32,240
don't like them.

3211
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,160
But leary and uh,

3212
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,060
back in the 60s,

3213
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:36,740
they were doing experiments with,

3214
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:40,160
I don't know if it was LSD
or psilocybin with prisoners,

3215
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,170
and the effect was tremendous.

3216
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,390
It was changing them
and transforming them.

3217
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:44,810
I'm sure.

3218
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,490
And so that's what I'm saying.

3219
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:48,290
It's like that's a better option.

3220
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:48,750
Yeah.

3221
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:49,940
Hank is too complicated.

3222
01:27:49,941 --> 01:27:50,391
The tank.

3223
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,920
You need too much control of yourself.

3224
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:54,080
You need to be able to
be calm and relaxed.

3225
01:27:54,081 --> 01:27:55,130
You need to be able to let go,

3226
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:55,671
to use it.

3227
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,410
You need to not piss
and jerk off in there.

3228
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:58,244
You fuckhead

3229
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,380
you know what I'm saying?

3230
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,070
Right.

3231
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:04,280
You don't want to leave that to the
prisoners and I flotation thing.

3232
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:05,360
I think we all agree on that.

3233
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:06,890
Giving the mushrooms will be a way,

3234
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:07,341
Chet,

3235
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:09,200
and way better solution
and a really good one.

3236
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,760
I mean if you wanted to reintegrate them,

3237
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,380
you can just create an alternate society.

3238
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:12,731
We're looking,

3239
01:28:12,731 --> 01:28:13,880
you can't ever go free,

3240
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:18,050
but how about we only have the mushroom
taking population segmented off from the

3241
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:20,990
rest of everybody else and we'll give
you guys a chance to reestablish a

3242
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:21,590
community.

3243
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,000
We have a giant track of land.

3244
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:24,200
You have gps trips on.

3245
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:25,070
Don't try to escape.

3246
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,250
We're going to put the GPS trip
into muscular and your body,

3247
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:29,061
if you cut it out,

3248
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:30,080
it will register in the computer.

3249
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:32,810
You go back to jail for the
rest of your term plus parole.

3250
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:33,680
No questions asked.

3251
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,890
So take the mushrooms and you live in
this little place in the village like a

3252
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:38,990
fucking m night Shama
Lama Ding Dong movie.

3253
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:40,820
And everybody goes out
there by themselves,

3254
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:42,350
completely disconnected from society.

3255
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:43,430
And let's do it as an experiment.

3256
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:46,970
Let's take all these fucked up
prisoners and make them eat mushrooms,

3257
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,170
take the most violent,

3258
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:48,981
the most fucked up,

3259
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:51,410
the craziest and let them
talk to the spirit world.

3260
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:52,910
Five grams all the time,

3261
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,260
all day sun,

3262
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,490
all day sun.

3263
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,090
We're going to watch them evolve right
before [inaudible] gain trips every

3264
01:28:59,090 --> 01:28:59,091
month,

3265
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:00,920
every month they have
scheduled people game trips.

3266
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,070
These motherfuckers are going to do

3267
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,940
IOWASCA.

3268
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,270
We're going to give them a
full psychedelic reevaluation,

3269
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:09,930
but how amazing would it be if instead
of having to send them to their plot of

3270
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:10,590
land,

3271
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,720
what if when people came out of prison,

3272
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:16,290
because we were so advanced and we
understood the psychology so well,

3273
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,820
people came out of prison.

3274
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:19,890
They were like professors.

3275
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:23,220
There were a million times better
and then there are helping society.

3276
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:24,510
Problem is there's too many.

3277
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,500
There's not enough money.

3278
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:26,191
There's too many,

3279
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:27,450
there's too many fucking people.

3280
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:29,430
There's too many people
that are so far gone.

3281
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:32,340
You're going to have to do something
special to make them change.

3282
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,890
That's where my mushroom
plantation comes in.

3283
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,490
I like,

3284
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,470
I like the Rogan mushroom plantation,

3285
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,400
but I think that Duncan
Trussell LSD egg is much better,

3286
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:45,690
which is an egg shaped thing
that prisoners go in for many,

3287
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:49,990
many years until their egos completely
erased there reprogrammed with only

3288
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:51,660
positive teachings.

3289
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,830
They learn about Buddhism,

3290
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:54,460
all the world religions and they,

3291
01:29:54,461 --> 01:29:55,890
you pop them back out into society.

3292
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:56,880
Maybe you start with six,

3293
01:29:56,881 --> 01:30:00,450
seven but you pop them back out into
society and now instead of putting the

3294
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:01,920
poison back into society,

3295
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:02,880
you're putting a,

3296
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,713
an antidote.

3297
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,880
Well that's a beautiful idea in theory,

3298
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:08,670
but that's so far away
from being able to be done.

3299
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,181
You know,

3300
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:10,620
we're talking science fiction there.

3301
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,041
It's not,

3302
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:12,180
I mean it's not science fiction.

3303
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,290
I mean that's not yet.

3304
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,820
We're not yet capable of it,

3305
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,380
but mushrooms are here right now.

3306
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,243
That's what I'm saying.

3307
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:17,941
That's what I'm saying.

3308
01:30:17,941 --> 01:30:19,560
This site within inducing,

3309
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:19,981
so you're,

3310
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:21,360
you're saying this is a much,

3311
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,740
I lost you.

3312
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:23,280
What I'm saying.

3313
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,570
What I'm saying is you put prisoners
in some sort of like chamber,

3314
01:30:27,571 --> 01:30:28,560
I don't know what you're saying.

3315
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:31,200
Like you inject them with it or
something and you just like have them.

3316
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,270
It's exactly the same thing you said.

3317
01:30:33,271 --> 01:30:33,840
I was just still,

3318
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,620
I was being a little too uh weird about
it because then you would created some

3319
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:40,040
alternate reality where you
can waste their memories.

3320
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,280
No,

3321
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,980
I think if you gave someone enough
LSD you would raise their memory.

3322
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:44,820
But in my,

3323
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:49,260
in my mind it's like an like an egg like
thing where you pretty attached to this

3324
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:50,070
is where he lost weight.

3325
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,210
I know it was like what did he die?

3326
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:52,460
I don't know why I see like the spicy,

3327
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:55,410
it's like this egg like thing
and you project on the walls,

3328
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:57,780
just beautiful images.

3329
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,020
It's like a more gag he came out.

3330
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,120
Yeah,

3331
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,220
so it's a mortgage.

3332
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,300
Nailed it son.

3333
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,110
That's it.

3334
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:07,380
Pulled out the greatest all
time references a mark egg.

3335
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,670
I didn't remember that.

3336
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,800
A more egg was a real thing
until you brought that up.

3337
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,350
Well the morgue equity and I've
always wanted one of those.

3338
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,680
No because we do give some
knuckles on the mortgage reference.

3339
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,830
But you guys both need to try and read
Ben Prison idea because it was way better

3340
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:24,640
than the Duncan Trussell prison idea.

3341
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,810
What does it just make them
bomb sniffer dogs and taking,

3342
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:28,010
you know,

3343
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,700
use prisoners for things like that.

3344
01:31:29,701 --> 01:31:29,851
Like,

3345
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,150
okay,

3346
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,300
we might have a bomb in here.

3347
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:32,383
By the way,

3348
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:33,630
we were talking about,

3349
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:33,960
um,

3350
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,291
the,

3351
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:34,501
uh,

3352
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:36,930
the LSD experiments.

3353
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,270
We were talking about the MK Ultra.

3354
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:39,550
Yeah.

3355
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,710
We were talking about
the shit that they did,

3356
01:31:40,711 --> 01:31:44,820
the CIA that turned Ted Kaczynski into
the Unabomber supposedly allegedly.

3357
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:45,810
Um,

3358
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,210
the documentary and we talked
about in the podcast before,

3359
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,740
I think the documentary is called the net.

3360
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,851
Very,

3361
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:51,720
very fascinating.

3362
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:52,980
Really interesting shit.

3363
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:54,870
So that's what my problem with Lsd,

3364
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:58,920
my palm with LSD is I keep hearing
crazy stories about people losing their

3365
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,763
marbles,

3366
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,010
you know,

3367
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,330
and Howard Stern's talked about it,

3368
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,230
how he took it once and he took too much
of it and he had this horrifying scary

3369
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:06,064
fucking trip.

3370
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:06,581
I,

3371
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:07,990
and where he was like losing his mind.

3372
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:09,820
And then the drummer from pink Floyd,

3373
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:11,080
the Joey Diaz always talks about,

3374
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,660
did some fucking LSD lost his mind?

3375
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:14,590
I don't remember the dude's name.

3376
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:15,430
Sid Barrett.

3377
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:16,263
Is that his name?

3378
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:16,841
Yeah.

3379
01:32:16,841 --> 01:32:17,631
Do you know the whole story?

3380
01:32:17,631 --> 01:32:18,520
I don't think it was a drummer,

3381
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:18,831
but yeah,

3382
01:32:18,831 --> 01:32:19,121
I know,

3383
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:19,590
I know.

3384
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:19,960
What did he,

3385
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,890
was the guitar player,

3386
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:21,370
was he?

3387
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:21,671
No,

3388
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:22,240
he,

3389
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,080
he was like a singer and I think he
was like one of the founders of it or

3390
01:32:26,081 --> 01:32:26,591
something.

3391
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:27,130
Yeah,

3392
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:27,461
he,

3393
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:27,701
uh,

3394
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:29,230
the story goes that he just,

3395
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,910
they were all tripping out so much,

3396
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:31,744
but he,

3397
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,650
I think he became a schizophrenia or
a shut in and London or something.

3398
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:36,190
And then he's,

3399
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,023
he died,

3400
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,170
he's deputy release him.

3401
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:38,830
Great.

3402
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:39,101
The,

3403
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:39,580
um,

3404
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,100
Syd Barrett,

3405
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:45,100
or at least some snows do or the allegedly
believed it was due to an LSD trip.

3406
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:46,590
Like it was.

3407
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:46,840
It was,

3408
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,280
can they say it was,

3409
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:49,480
he went crazy from it.

3410
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:51,150
He did like Lsd and just lost his mother.

3411
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:51,550
See,

3412
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:51,791
you know,

3413
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:52,420
you hear about them,

3414
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:53,890
you don't hear about that with mushrooms.

3415
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:54,760
Right.

3416
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,370
Although that's not totally
true because Dennis Mckenna,

3417
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:01,090
Terence Mckenna's brother
apparently lost it for a long time.

3418
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:05,350
They had some big crazy mushroom trip
down in central America or South America,

3419
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:10,680
and he was gone for like two weeks where
he was like in this complete like fit

3420
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:11,930
of madness.

3421
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:12,763
It was just a,

3422
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:14,770
shit happens a lot with mushrooms.

3423
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:15,070
Yeah.

3424
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,521
Growing up,

3425
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:16,380
and when I used to do mushrooms,

3426
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,770
a lie,

3427
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,430
a lot of my friends had the
same shit where you're like,

3428
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:19,730
what happened to so and so?

3429
01:33:19,731 --> 01:33:20,020
And like,

3430
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:20,141
oh,

3431
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:21,250
I haven't seen him for like a week.

3432
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:21,821
And they knew it came.

3433
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,631
He comes back and say,

3434
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:22,841
dude,

3435
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:23,051
I had,

3436
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:24,070
it's a really bad trip.

3437
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:26,500
I just sat in my house for a
week and thought about things.

3438
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:26,990
Oh,

3439
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:29,140
I've had that a few times at the top.

3440
01:33:29,141 --> 01:33:29,880
That is,

3441
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,580
um,

3442
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,470
do you think that Dennis,

3443
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:35,020
just an overwhelming amount of silicide
Ben and they just couldn't process it,

3444
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:39,610
or do you think that it was a very bad
time in their life when they took it?

3445
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,270
And then there's some sort of an internal
struggle between the experience of

3446
01:33:43,271 --> 01:33:44,260
psychedelic experience,

3447
01:33:44,261 --> 01:33:49,261
which requires absolute truth and honesty
and all the issues that you might have

3448
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:51,730
not resolved in your own mind?

3449
01:33:51,731 --> 01:33:53,410
They're constantly
fucking with your psyche.

3450
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:58,180
So then a battle takes place between the
psychedelic truth and all the shit that

3451
01:33:58,181 --> 01:34:01,990
you're trying to keep him in the closet
in the dark and all the douchey behavior

3452
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:06,991
and all life and stress and death and
it's sucking dicks and airplanes getting

3453
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:12,031
hit by missiles and it all just falls
apart and your mind literally cannot grab

3454
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:12,890
anything.

3455
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:17,800
It's just madness where
this like defragging before
your eyes and information is

3456
01:34:17,801 --> 01:34:18,521
crumbling.

3457
01:34:18,521 --> 01:34:20,560
Your ability to decode the language,

3458
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:24,520
it's all desolving like you
fuck your whole brain sideways.

3459
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,070
And apparently for like
two weeks he was gone.

3460
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,330
But that's when you need
a Sharman or somebody,

3461
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,630
somebody could talk you down,

3462
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:33,220
lead you through that because that
means you're at the right place.

3463
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:36,150
That's when the healing starts is
they've pulled all the fuck there.

3464
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,370
There's scrubbing the terms of your ego
away and all of a sudden you're in this

3465
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:42,460
open place and if you're with
someone who knows what they're doing,

3466
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,320
who really knows what they're doing,

3467
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:48,610
then you can like evolve at that moment
and become something like so much

3468
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:50,410
happier and more real than you are.

3469
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:50,951
It's just,

3470
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:54,100
that's the sad thing about it
is no one knows how to do that.

3471
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:54,740
And that's,

3472
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:58,040
the kids are like fucking
tripping on psychedelics and

3473
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,120
having rotten trips.

3474
01:34:59,250 --> 01:34:59,940
Yeah.

3475
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,750
No one knows how to.

3476
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:01,410
They don't know.

3477
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:02,250
They don't know how to do it.

3478
01:35:02,251 --> 01:35:04,170
And also they're coming
from a who you know,

3479
01:35:04,171 --> 01:35:08,220
who knows what their view of the world
is and how far it is off from reality.

3480
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:11,520
And that's one thing about all
psychedelic trips is they force you.

3481
01:35:11,521 --> 01:35:12,600
Before we go any further,

3482
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,800
I'd like to see your ticket and I'd like
to see your ticket is here is your real

3483
01:35:16,801 --> 01:35:17,820
life for real.

3484
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,271
Okay.

3485
01:35:18,271 --> 01:35:23,271
So before we go and talk to any fucking
flying blue dragons and a take you into

3486
01:35:23,431 --> 01:35:24,760
the center of the universe and,

3487
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:25,950
and show you the,

3488
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,150
the fabric of life.

3489
01:35:27,151 --> 01:35:30,150
It's under the hood of
the car of the universe.

3490
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,380
Before we do that,

3491
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,490
here's you.

3492
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,430
I think sometimes the drugs affect
different people in different ways.

3493
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,353
Other than that though,

3494
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:37,920
I think I've said this before,

3495
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:38,763
this girl I knew,

3496
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:39,720
she hit one,

3497
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,080
you know,

3498
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,830
bong once and she just took off running
as fast as she could into my bathroom

3499
01:35:43,831 --> 01:35:45,810
and hit the tub and fell
against the wall and stuff.

3500
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,130
But when she came back to it,

3501
01:35:47,131 --> 01:35:47,521
she was like,

3502
01:35:47,521 --> 01:35:48,570
I don't remember doing it.

3503
01:35:48,571 --> 01:35:49,560
I have no idea why I did that.

3504
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:50,100
And I'm like,

3505
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,080
what one hit from we made you do this.

3506
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,310
Don't ever touch we'd ever again.

3507
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:54,331
Yeah,

3508
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:54,841
you're right,

3509
01:35:54,841 --> 01:35:55,141
man.

3510
01:35:55,141 --> 01:35:55,380
Look,

3511
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,520
Stan hope doesn't like weed.

3512
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,001
You know,

3513
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,350
he'll tell you I don't
like what it does to me.

3514
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:58,480
Yeah.

3515
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,260
And Santo Bikes,

3516
01:35:59,260 --> 01:35:59,940
everything.

3517
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:00,181
I mean,

3518
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:01,440
he's a mushroom efficient.

3519
01:36:01,441 --> 01:36:02,610
Mando you know,

3520
01:36:02,611 --> 01:36:02,831
he's,

3521
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:06,870
he's probably taken 30
times more drugs and I have,

3522
01:36:06,871 --> 01:36:08,310
he'll hope to fucking take anything.

3523
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,080
I heard this story,

3524
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:14,080
I was reading the biography of Timothy
leary and I can't remember the name of it

3525
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:14,720
now.

3526
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,471
There's a bunch of them,

3527
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:15,831
I'm sure.

3528
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:16,910
But the one I was reading,

3529
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:20,630
there was a reporter who was at the house
where they were all tripping out and

3530
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,410
um,

3531
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:22,430
he was like watching them.

3532
01:36:22,431 --> 01:36:23,220
He's kind of like a net.

3533
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,360
He was like apparently going to do a
negative story on them or something.

3534
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,120
Um,

3535
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:27,441
cause you know,

3536
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:27,621
as a,

3537
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:27,980
you know,

3538
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,350
leary was up in this house
with a bunch of hippies like,

3539
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:30,860
uh,

3540
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:33,810
Alan Ginsburg and Richard
Alpert and like a lot of the,

3541
01:36:33,811 --> 01:36:38,420
the beat to people from the 60s and
they were all experimenting with acid.

3542
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:43,421
But this reporter apparently snuck into
Timothy Leary's office where under his

3543
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:45,990
office in a drawer and the cantor,

3544
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,570
he had a liquid acid,

3545
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:48,440
no,

3546
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,890
it thinking it was vodka or some kind
of alcohol poured himself a drink.

3547
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:53,210
Yeah.

3548
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:53,820
Wow.

3549
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,280
Oh my God,

3550
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:55,520
yes.

3551
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,940
Did this massive amount of
acid not even knowing it.

3552
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,960
And so we started having this incredibly
terrible trip and they say he took his

3553
01:37:02,961 --> 01:37:03,531
clothes off.

3554
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:05,450
He was running around the grounds naked,

3555
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,440
but they got him to sit down and uh,

3556
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:10,400
fucking,

3557
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:10,730
uh,

3558
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,830
Alan Ginsburg and I can't
remember who the other people,

3559
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:15,620
where they all started singing
Hari Krishna to this guy,

3560
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,030
the Hari Krishna Maha Mantra,

3561
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:18,370
which is how do Christianity,

3562
01:37:18,371 --> 01:37:19,250
Christian and Christian Christian,

3563
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,421
Yada,

3564
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:19,611
Yada,

3565
01:37:19,611 --> 01:37:20,444
Yada,

3566
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,730
seeing that shit come on.

3567
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:23,840
You know how to say,

3568
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,340
I haven't terrible how
to do all this shit.

3569
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:26,200
Got The Beatles,

3570
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:27,211
dude,

3571
01:37:27,211 --> 01:37:27,880
you need to do it.

3572
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:28,790
You know how to do it well,

3573
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:29,260
no,

3574
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:29,921
you do it all the time.

3575
01:37:29,921 --> 01:37:30,430
You don't know.

3576
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,260
The thing about Hari
Krishna is you can sing it,

3577
01:37:32,261 --> 01:37:33,380
which is called a curtain,

3578
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,440
but you don't have to sing.

3579
01:37:35,441 --> 01:37:36,274
It sounds cool.

3580
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,030
You know how to do it.

3581
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,863
It's cool.

3582
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:39,320
It's cooler to channel.

3583
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:39,551
Okay,

3584
01:37:39,551 --> 01:37:40,300
go ahead.

3585
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,290
But you all have to change it with them.

3586
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,700
So it goes Hari Krishna haunted,

3587
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:44,050
complete.

3588
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:44,501
Don't weigh that.

3589
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:45,390
Don't play that for a second.

3590
01:37:45,391 --> 01:37:46,930
Cause it really is a serious bro.

3591
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,180
Fucking serious.

3592
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,691
Not Serious,

3593
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:51,880
but it's kind of psychedelic
Internet is serious business.

3594
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,210
Trying to get you guys
see cats everywhere.

3595
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,183
I say that.

3596
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,070
Um,

3597
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:57,903
hit me with it.

3598
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:59,220
So it goes hardy,

3599
01:37:59,221 --> 01:37:59,850
Krishna,

3600
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:00,541
Hari Krishna,

3601
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:01,230
Hari Krishna,

3602
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:01,950
Hari Krishna,

3603
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:02,281
Krishna,

3604
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:03,030
Krishna,

3605
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:03,440
Krishna.

3606
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:03,681
Howdy.

3607
01:38:03,681 --> 01:38:03,980
Howdy.

3608
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:04,280
Howdy.

3609
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:04,590
Howdy.

3610
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,423
Howdy.

3611
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:06,420
Howdy Dharma.

3612
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:07,253
Hari Rama,

3613
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:07,951
Rama,

3614
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:08,341
Rama,

3615
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:08,850
Rama,

3616
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:09,151
Rama,

3617
01:38:09,151 --> 01:38:09,541
Rama.

3618
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:09,841
Howdy.

3619
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:10,230
Howdy.

3620
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:10,501
Howdy.

3621
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,310
Howdy.

3622
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:11,521
Howdy.

3623
01:38:11,521 --> 01:38:11,801
Christian.

3624
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:13,380
Aniko sneakers Nickerson and got it wrong.

3625
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:13,970
And I don't remember.

3626
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,560
I remember that.

3627
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:19,660
Oh,

3628
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,431
here's an easier,

3629
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:21,241
when he was another mantra,

3630
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:21,520
which is,

3631
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:21,930
okay,

3632
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:25,200
is it good when it's just
rom our aim to go wrong,

3633
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,320
wrong,

3634
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,153
wrong,

3635
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,100
wrong,

3636
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:28,720
wrong,

3637
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,170
wrong,

3638
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:29,831
wrong,

3639
01:38:29,831 --> 01:38:30,290
wrong,

3640
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:31,123
fast.

3641
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:31,640
Well,

3642
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,480
however you want to do it.

3643
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,331
Rum,

3644
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:33,841
rum,

3645
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:34,321
rum,

3646
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:34,801
rum,

3647
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:35,634
rum,

3648
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:36,690
rum,

3649
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,141
rum,

3650
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:37,860
rum,

3651
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,300
rum,

3652
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:38,990
wrong,

3653
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:39,550
wrong,

3654
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:40,180
wrong,

3655
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:40,630
wrong,

3656
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,463
wrong.

3657
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:43,860
I think we're too high.

3658
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,270
I'd be doing a podcast.

3659
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,430
The fact that we were
even considering that,

3660
01:38:47,431 --> 01:38:48,840
that might be entertaining
for other people.

3661
01:38:48,841 --> 01:38:49,671
Listening shows you what?

3662
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:53,370
State of consciousness where you right
now and mantras there really is weird.

3663
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:53,670
It doesn't,

3664
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,840
it gives you a weird feeling.

3665
01:38:54,841 --> 01:38:56,240
Does in Mantras,

3666
01:38:56,241 --> 01:38:57,120
they're great because,

3667
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:57,721
uh,

3668
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,490
whatever the one is you decided to do,

3669
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:00,080
uh,

3670
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,230
it gives you a chance to focus your
mind on something outside your thoughts.

3671
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,190
Because do that.

3672
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:05,791
After Yoga,

3673
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,020
sometimes I do ohms.

3674
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:07,461
Oh,

3675
01:39:07,461 --> 01:39:11,190
I'm to look along own session
in like the Lotus position.

3676
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,553
I'll do that.

3677
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:14,520
It seems so silly and pretentious
while you're doing it.

3678
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,001
You're like,

3679
01:39:15,001 --> 01:39:15,071
oh,

3680
01:39:15,071 --> 01:39:15,930
got a fucking faggot.

3681
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:16,764
I am right now.

3682
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:16,980
Well,

3683
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,870
my friends walked in
on me from high school.

3684
01:39:18,871 --> 01:39:18,991
Like,

3685
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:19,410
what are you doing?

3686
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,790
Stupid fucking,

3687
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,270
what are you doing?

3688
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,910
You would suck up a couple of Dick's
after this and eat some berries.

3689
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:25,450
It's not presents.

3690
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:26,690
It just seems like I,

3691
01:39:26,691 --> 01:39:26,880
I,

3692
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,930
it's of course it's not pretentious,

3693
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:28,764
but there's a,

3694
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:33,980
there's a certain amount of silliness
that's attached to any yoga spirituality.

3695
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:37,260
Even if you say you're
a Vegan or something,

3696
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:37,501
you know,

3697
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:38,700
you're an environmentalist.

3698
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:40,600
Anytime there's anything caring in,

3699
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,240
in any sort of consideration,

3700
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,430
there's like a bunch of
weakness attached to it.

3701
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:47,910
So if somebody catches you sitting
there in the Lotus position with your,

3702
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:48,361
you know,

3703
01:39:48,361 --> 01:39:50,070
your fuck you finger
touching your thumb going,

3704
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,740
oh,

3705
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,700
like you silly bitch.

3706
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,290
Do you go,

3707
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:55,590
what do you,

3708
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,220
did you go,

3709
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:57,080
Oh mom,

3710
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,200
Amari do long.

3711
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:59,303
Exactly.

3712
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:10,390
Oh,

3713
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,633
that's what I do.

3714
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,600
That's awesome.

3715
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,530
I do long ones.

3716
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:19,560
I do that sometimes in the tank to
a tank gets even weirder because it

3717
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:20,790
reverberates to the water.

3718
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,260
And I do that when I need to
slow my mind down and need to,

3719
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:28,080
like when I get into the tank sometimes
it's like as there's an adjustment

3720
01:40:28,081 --> 01:40:29,160
period of like a few minutes,

3721
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,220
I'm just trying to relax
and settle in and get loose.

3722
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:32,421
And,

3723
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:32,631
and,

3724
01:40:32,631 --> 01:40:32,841
and,

3725
01:40:32,841 --> 01:40:34,470
and just settle into the experience.

3726
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:35,760
And then sometimes I just can't,

3727
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:36,810
it's just too much on my mind.

3728
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:38,190
I got too much fucking going on,

3729
01:40:38,191 --> 01:40:40,200
too much real life TM bullshit,

3730
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:40,651
you know,

3731
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:41,850
invading my consciousness.

3732
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:42,571
So then I go,

3733
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:43,404
oh,

3734
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:46,410
and I just only think about my breathing,

3735
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:48,060
my breathing and making that noise.

3736
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,610
And then it,

3737
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:52,830
eventually I stopped thinking about my
breathing and the breathing you just

3738
01:40:52,831 --> 01:40:53,980
comes automatically deep

3739
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,401
and long.

3740
01:40:54,401 --> 01:40:57,070
And I just think about hitting
the right note and then I'm like,

3741
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:58,810
oh,

3742
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:01,650
oh.

3743
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,770
Cause there's like a certain relaxation
to it when you really hit it,

3744
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,730
when you're faking it,

3745
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,780
when you're nervous about it,

3746
01:41:06,781 --> 01:41:07,440
then you're like,

3747
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,590
uh,

3748
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:09,300
you know,

3749
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,550
there's like a break in
the way you're talking.

3750
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:14,460
You're not relaxed enough
to let that sound come out.

3751
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,370
What about the Buddhist?

3752
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:16,583
Oh,

3753
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,240
it has the graying of the issue,

3754
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:19,970
the gray,

3755
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:20,441
the shit.

3756
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:21,370
That shit's insane.

3757
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:25,130
Yeah.

3758
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,320
You sound like one of those instruments.

3759
01:41:27,321 --> 01:41:28,410
What's it called in Australia?

3760
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,211
The jury.

3761
01:41:29,211 --> 01:41:30,140
Dude,

3762
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,440
you're fucking freaking me out.

3763
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:38,880
You know what I have been
chatting lately is ah,

3764
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:39,830
um,

3765
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:41,050
or fraught for a while now.

3766
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:41,661
And I love it.

3767
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:46,661
Is that [inaudible] you
get rid of that one?

3768
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:47,660
No.

3769
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:48,230
What is that?

3770
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:53,230
[inaudible] it's like this whole prayer.

3771
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:57,470
Whoa.

3772
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:59,570
But it's from the Tompkins and alien.

3773
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:01,071
Ladies and gentlemen.

3774
01:42:01,071 --> 01:42:01,641
You were right.

3775
01:42:01,641 --> 01:42:02,331
I was wrong.

3776
01:42:02,331 --> 01:42:03,800
Aliens are real.

3777
01:42:03,801 --> 01:42:05,150
We have one here with us.

3778
01:42:05,151 --> 01:42:06,620
He just spoke to us in the code.

3779
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,210
He just sent the fucking
signal to the mother ships.

3780
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:09,561
I know.

3781
01:42:09,561 --> 01:42:11,990
An embarrassing amount of
prayers and other languages.

3782
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:12,590
Um,

3783
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,010
here's another,

3784
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,320
it's not,

3785
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,690
there's nothing embarrassing
about that at all.

3786
01:42:14,691 --> 01:42:15,330
It's fascinating.

3787
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:20,330
[inaudible] Tanya [inaudible]
did that days have everything,

3788
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:27,320
the gum that's in Sanskrit.

3789
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,200
Goddamn you might be the
weirdest motherfucker that's
ever lived with a face.

3790
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,413
I love you man.

3791
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:32,781
I love you.

3792
01:42:32,781 --> 01:42:33,830
That was amazing.

3793
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,250
I'm obviously fascinating.

3794
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,760
If you look at this
fucking Shiva over here,

3795
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:41,840
I have the shit like
this all over my house.

3796
01:42:41,841 --> 01:42:44,360
I'm fascinated by like Hindu art work.

3797
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:46,340
There's just something about it to me.

3798
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:47,660
You know,

3799
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,410
when I look at,

3800
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:51,290
there's something about like India
and India's ancient art work.

3801
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:53,570
All these women with like
extra hands and shit.

3802
01:42:53,571 --> 01:42:56,720
It's so obviously psychedelic dude.

3803
01:42:56,721 --> 01:42:57,730
I ended Hensley.

3804
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,090
I incredible dream.

3805
01:42:59,091 --> 01:42:59,980
Once where,

3806
01:42:59,981 --> 01:43:00,814
um,

3807
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:02,570
it was like those things,

3808
01:43:02,571 --> 01:43:04,160
whatever those things were in this dream.

3809
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:05,480
I was like at a restaurant though.

3810
01:43:05,481 --> 01:43:08,000
But these things that look like Shiva,

3811
01:43:08,001 --> 01:43:08,241
that,

3812
01:43:08,241 --> 01:43:08,731
that the,

3813
01:43:08,731 --> 01:43:09,540
the uh,

3814
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:10,130
uh,

3815
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:11,450
Angelic Hindu thing,

3816
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:11,810
right?

3817
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:12,200
They were,

3818
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:16,460
they came up to me and they were so
beautiful and so perfect and always like

3819
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,830
looking at them and for
some reason I was like,

3820
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:19,670
I said,

3821
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,210
you,

3822
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:22,040
you look like me.

3823
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,210
And they were like,

3824
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:24,043
no,

3825
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:29,140
you look like us is though to say like
humans were a reflection of what they are

3826
01:43:29,811 --> 01:43:30,231
or like,

3827
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:30,620
uh,

3828
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,091
just a,

3829
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:34,190
an expansion of like
whatever that thing is,

3830
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:34,830
you know,

3831
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:35,470
another,

3832
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:35,900
uh,

3833
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,733
um,

3834
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:37,820
this awesome,

3835
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:38,261
you know.

3836
01:43:38,261 --> 01:43:40,850
And of course in Hinduism
the is called Maya,

3837
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:45,920
which means illusion and the way
they described this universe is a,

3838
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:50,360
it's like the reflection
of a forest on a lake.

3839
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,310
Our is the reflection of this,

3840
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:54,830
of the true universe.

3841
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:58,670
Like the true universe is so powerful
that we're this kind of shimmering,

3842
01:43:58,671 --> 01:44:00,740
weird reflection of it.

3843
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:03,920
And we all think that we're
real and permanent and constant.

3844
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:06,680
And it lasts forever when it's
just nothing more than just like a,

3845
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:07,791
I don't know,

3846
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:08,624
just some kind of,

3847
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:09,380
I dunno.

3848
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,520
An illusion Maya.

3849
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:12,110
That's not what they call a reality.

3850
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:15,590
Illusion not real at all.

3851
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,410
Whack is Christianity
in comparison to that,

3852
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,393
right?

3853
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:20,000
Yeah.

3854
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,910
How fascinating.

3855
01:44:20,911 --> 01:44:22,730
That's like such high level shit.

3856
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:23,511
Yeah.

3857
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:25,460
And that's like Dj high tech,

3858
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,650
Dj eye level shit.

3859
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,390
That's what Ninja would say.

3860
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:30,230
High Level Shit.

3861
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:31,243
Next level.

3862
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:31,851
Next level.

3863
01:44:31,851 --> 01:44:32,540
Shit.

3864
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:33,231
You know what man?

3865
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,280
It is next level shit,

3866
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:35,090
right?

3867
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:35,421
Well yeah.

3868
01:44:35,421 --> 01:44:36,080
I mean it's not,

3869
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:36,381
I don't,

3870
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:38,030
I don't know that I'd
call it next level shit.

3871
01:44:38,031 --> 01:44:38,390
I would,

3872
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:39,620
it's like high level.

3873
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,230
It's the next level.

3874
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:42,590
It's the level.

3875
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:46,010
It's people zooming into the
level and know what it is.

3876
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,640
And the interesting
thing about the Hindus,

3877
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:51,110
they ate a lot of Hash and
mushrooms and mushrooms.

3878
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:51,780
Selma.

3879
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:52,613
Yes.

3880
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:52,970
Soma,

3881
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:54,900
they don't even know exactly
what it is is there's,

3882
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,680
Soma is referenced in
many of the ancient texts,

3883
01:44:57,681 --> 01:44:57,921
right.

3884
01:44:57,921 --> 01:45:01,940
And they think it might have been emoney
to miscarry and psilocybe cubensis and

3885
01:45:01,941 --> 01:45:03,580
a bunch of other shit
with mixing together.

3886
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,000
There's a lot of debate on what it is,

3887
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:08,120
but it's very clear that this something
that they ate that made them have

3888
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:08,751
experienced,

3889
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:08,931
I mean,

3890
01:45:08,931 --> 01:45:09,764
they're singing,

3891
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,850
we did psychedelics,

3892
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:11,011
the,

3893
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:11,890
we called it Soma.

3894
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,100
We don't know what Soma is,

3895
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:16,370
but it's very obvious from them what
they wrote that it's a psychedelic plant.

3896
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:17,560
There's solid,

3897
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,690
isn't it?

3898
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:19,030
Mccain.

3899
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:23,080
And talks about their rig Veda and the
rig Veda is hymns to Selma to that.

3900
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:25,340
And they have all these
ways of describing it.

3901
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:25,620
And,

3902
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:29,650
and that's the oldest known was have
the oldest stone Leviton let know

3903
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:29,941
something,

3904
01:45:29,941 --> 01:45:32,000
a little stone written work that,

3905
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:32,450
no.

3906
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:32,661
Well,

3907
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:33,110
no.

3908
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:33,710
Uh,

3909
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:34,300
I don't,

3910
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:36,080
I'm one of the oldest.

3911
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:38,420
So there's the Upanishads right there.

3912
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:40,760
There's the Mahabharat,

3913
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:42,890
which is what the Bhagavad
Gita comes out of.

3914
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:44,480
That's the one that has all the,

3915
01:45:44,481 --> 01:45:44,781
what are the,

3916
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:45,380
is it called?

3917
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:45,890
Uh,

3918
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:46,760
Vimeo has,

3919
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:48,620
what is it called when
something flies to this guy?

3920
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,130
Oh yeah.

3921
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:49,521
I don't,

3922
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:50,230
I don't remember.

3923
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:51,051
I remember the name of it.

3924
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:53,240
But that's a fascinating take on,

3925
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:53,610
you know,

3926
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:53,750
the,

3927
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,870
all the Ufo believers
believe that in that book.

3928
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:00,890
Mahabharata Mahabharata
Mahabharata means great India.

3929
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:01,850
But Rot.

3930
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:02,870
It's spelled burrata,

3931
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:05,930
but Barat means India
and Maha means great.

3932
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:09,410
Isn't that weird how we have names for
countries other than the names they use?

3933
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,540
Like Germany is not Germany.

3934
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,100
It's it's Douche land,

3935
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:14,000
right?

3936
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:14,330
Yeah.

3937
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:15,163
It's not Germany.

3938
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:16,640
And same with um,

3939
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,090
uh,

3940
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:18,020
like Greece.

3941
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,030
Greece is like Hollis
or something like that.

3942
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:22,430
Japan is not Japan.

3943
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,143
Nepal,

3944
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:25,340
it's totally different word.

3945
01:46:25,341 --> 01:46:25,931
And I P p.

3946
01:46:25,931 --> 01:46:26,500
O.

3947
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:26,500
N.

3948
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,830
Walt's obviously in different characters,

3949
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:29,170
but phonetically it's Nippon.

3950
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:29,990
Nippon Wow.

3951
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:30,823
Yeah.

3952
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,000
I feel dumb now.

3953
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,470
I wonder if Russia is a different name.

3954
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,450
What is it now?

3955
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:35,840
Yeah.

3956
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,190
What was it before?

3957
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,200
Naming something so weird naming like
a name for any geography noise you make

3958
01:46:42,201 --> 01:46:43,760
with your mouth that describes a spot.

3959
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:44,623
Yeah.

3960
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,071
So fucking,

3961
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:48,860
it's such an odd thing in numbers
thing we're just to keeping track of,

3962
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:50,461
I mean,

3963
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:51,780
I guess it helps traveling.

3964
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:52,410
Yeah.

3965
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:56,820
Helps Gps Kinda need
it going to all agree.

3966
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:59,970
It's crazy that we all agree on
red being stopped in green and go,

3967
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:01,050
that's everywhere in the world.

3968
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:01,800
Nowhere.

3969
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,030
Nowhere that someone's stubborn.

3970
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:03,271
It's like,

3971
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:04,290
fuck you bitch.

3972
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,630
I don't even like red dude though.

3973
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,190
To get back to the India stuff.

3974
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,740
I felt like I wanted
to tell you this story,

3975
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,120
but stop me if I already told you.

3976
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:16,770
Did I ever tell you that story of like
when Richard Alper gave Lsd to his guru

3977
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:17,461
in India?

3978
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:18,294
That story?

3979
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,860
I think we did talk about that,

3980
01:47:19,861 --> 01:47:20,910
but I don't remember.

3981
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:22,800
So this guy was like,

3982
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:24,360
well I don't know if we talked
about it on the podcast,

3983
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:25,350
but I know we talked about it.

3984
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:28,290
We could just kind of
whatever shit overlaps this.

3985
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:29,010
Um,

3986
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,770
so Richard Alpert was this guy who,

3987
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:32,131
uh,

3988
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:32,760
was uh,

3989
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,430
um,

3990
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:35,430
I psychologist and he was hanging out.

3991
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:40,230
Timothy leary blew his mind on acid or
I think it was mushrooms and basically

3992
01:47:40,231 --> 01:47:42,450
the thing you were talking about
happened and where he like,

3993
01:47:42,451 --> 01:47:45,780
cause he was really like rich at the
time and he had a nice car and I think I

3994
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:47,550
like things were really like,

3995
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,010
he was like a career.

3996
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:50,940
Like he was on the up so to speak.

3997
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,300
And so he took this a psychedelic and
saw us life kind of just vanish in front

3998
01:47:56,881 --> 01:47:57,151
of him.

3999
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:59,070
And he realized that Western society,

4000
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:04,071
he was obviously a bit of a sham and
he ended up going to India because he'd

4001
01:48:04,141 --> 01:48:05,610
heard these stories of over there,

4002
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:05,861
which should,

4003
01:48:05,861 --> 01:48:06,810
Albert is Rom dos,

4004
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:07,560
right?

4005
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,090
That's right.

4006
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:08,871
Exactly.

4007
01:48:08,871 --> 01:48:09,020
Yeah.

4008
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,820
He calls himself during
Raam das is his name.

4009
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:12,330
You can get around that star commies.

4010
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:12,660
It's,

4011
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,680
he wrote be here now.

4012
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,540
But so he has this guru,

4013
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:19,320
he goes to India and basically finds
his guru is this little man and a,

4014
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,220
and a blanket.

4015
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:23,820
And Alpert has LSD with them.

4016
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,770
And according to his story,

4017
01:48:25,771 --> 01:48:27,630
this little guys like
you have medicine here,

4018
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:28,590
you have medicine here.

4019
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:29,783
And um,

4020
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,680
Alpert gave him,

4021
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:32,221
you know,

4022
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:32,671
at the time,

4023
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:35,850
this is acid in the 60s being carried
around by like someone who was friends

4024
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:36,571
with Timothy leary.

4025
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:38,490
So this is high powered shit.

4026
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:40,050
Albert gives him some,

4027
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,130
he eats it,

4028
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,600
eats one of them,

4029
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:46,140
and then he liked motions for him to
give him more and basically eats all of,

4030
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,130
all of his acid,

4031
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:49,050
all of it just gobbles it down.

4032
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:51,510
And so a Alper,

4033
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:52,050
uh,

4034
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:52,470
thinks,

4035
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:53,190
oh fuck,

4036
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,023
I have a,

4037
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:54,871
you know,

4038
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:55,170
I've,

4039
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:59,610
I've killed a little old Indian man and
he's going to go insane according to

4040
01:48:59,611 --> 01:49:00,270
this story,

4041
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:01,110
no effect.

4042
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:03,210
Nothing happened,

4043
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:05,880
no of Whoa,

4044
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,743
no effect.

4045
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:07,530
Oh my God.

4046
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:07,681
And,

4047
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:07,861
and,

4048
01:49:07,861 --> 01:49:07,971
and,

4049
01:49:07,971 --> 01:49:08,190
and,

4050
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:08,911
and he said,

4051
01:49:08,911 --> 01:49:10,050
one thing he said to him was,

4052
01:49:10,051 --> 01:49:12,240
this reminds me of a,

4053
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:13,074
uh,

4054
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,900
this reminds me of something
they had in the something valley.

4055
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:17,360
Like some,

4056
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:17,791
it was just,

4057
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,080
it reminded them of
something and he's like,

4058
01:49:19,081 --> 01:49:19,171
oh,

4059
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:19,381
it's a,

4060
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:19,551
it's,

4061
01:49:19,551 --> 01:49:20,384
it's okay.

4062
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,530
But so Alper left,

4063
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:25,890
went back to the United States mind
blown by this little man because,

4064
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:26,341
and he's like,

4065
01:49:26,341 --> 01:49:27,174
he tricked me.

4066
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,650
He palmed the shit.

4067
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,341
He didn't really eat.

4068
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:30,510
It came back,

4069
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:34,800
the guy who Albert's swears
was telepathic with like,

4070
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,910
you don't believe I ate that stuff
because Albert had brought more,

4071
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:39,990
he took it,

4072
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,460
chewed it up in front of them,

4073
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:42,810
shoot it up in his mouth,

4074
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,540
open his mouth so we could see that
it was in his mouth or whatever,

4075
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:46,374
pill form.

4076
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,333
And then,

4077
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:48,080
uh,

4078
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:53,080
after some time went under his blanket
and started making moaning noises and

4079
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:54,160
Alvarez like off,

4080
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:55,600
fuck he does,

4081
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:58,480
he aided this time when he went insane
and then he came out of his blanket

4082
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,480
laughing cause he's fucking with
them and it didn't affect them again,

4083
01:50:01,481 --> 01:50:02,314
no effect.

4084
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:05,560
He was just playing into what Albert
thought it would have done now,

4085
01:50:05,561 --> 01:50:08,740
which was driven by somebody
so enlightened and he still
plays practical jokes.

4086
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:09,191
Yeah.

4087
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:09,401
No,

4088
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:10,220
he's a funny,

4089
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:11,590
I don't think humor goes away.

4090
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:11,900
That's,

4091
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:12,610
that's the thing.

4092
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:15,780
Comedians get afraid of like spirituality
or meditating or whatever cause

4093
01:50:15,781 --> 01:50:16,061
they're like,

4094
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:17,770
I don't want to not be funny anymore,

4095
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,101
dude.

4096
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:19,750
I used to think exactly that thing.

4097
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:20,831
I don't think that,

4098
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:22,330
I don't think it funny goes away.

4099
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:23,400
I think it just gets better.

4100
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:23,990
It gets better.

4101
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,620
It gets better.

4102
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,451
The more at peace you are,

4103
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:26,410
the more funny you are.

4104
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:28,070
If I'm the worst I'm ever

4105
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:28,461
is what?

4106
01:50:28,461 --> 01:50:32,480
I'm in stressful situations or upset at
someone or set up myself or whatever,

4107
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:33,041
you know,

4108
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:33,280
when,

4109
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,900
when you're in a good place in
your happy place and no stress,

4110
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:37,573
always better.

4111
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:37,970
Yeah,

4112
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:38,803
for sure.

4113
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:41,421
I don't know,

4114
01:50:41,421 --> 01:50:42,254
ma'am.

4115
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:43,363
It's um,

4116
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:44,091
oh,

4117
01:50:44,091 --> 01:50:44,901
speaking of acid,

4118
01:50:44,901 --> 01:50:45,890
this is what I want to talk about.

4119
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:48,290
The wild and wonderful
whites of West Virginia.

4120
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:49,581
Dude,

4121
01:50:49,581 --> 01:50:50,960
how awesome was that?

4122
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,030
The craziest fucking documentary?

4123
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:53,631
You know,

4124
01:50:53,631 --> 01:50:53,921
I,

4125
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:54,590
I wasn't,

4126
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:55,161
I watched it.

4127
01:50:55,161 --> 01:50:58,160
I had to watch it twice the first time
I was too tired when I watched it and I

4128
01:50:58,161 --> 01:50:59,180
didn't appreciate it that much.

4129
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:03,320
And then the second time I watched it
and I was like way more awake and I was

4130
01:51:03,321 --> 01:51:05,060
under the influence of
the devil's cabbage.

4131
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,830
I tried watching it the first time.

4132
01:51:06,831 --> 01:51:09,460
Sober was terrible mistake
or watching it barbecue.

4133
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:09,801
It was like,

4134
01:51:09,801 --> 01:51:10,101
Whoa,

4135
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:11,960
this is a fucking fascinating family,

4136
01:51:11,961 --> 01:51:12,201
man.

4137
01:51:12,201 --> 01:51:13,760
This is the nut shit I've
ever seen in my life.

4138
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:14,990
These fucking people,

4139
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:18,560
they live in West Virginia and
their whole family are criminals.

4140
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,880
Like everyone's a criminal.

4141
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,260
They're all pills.

4142
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,770
Norton,

4143
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:22,730
they crushed pills up.

4144
01:51:22,731 --> 01:51:23,870
They get pills from somewhere.

4145
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:26,300
They all get prescriptions
for crazy pills too.

4146
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:29,570
They all got money that they get
from the government and they said,

4147
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:29,910
okay.

4148
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:30,690
Plus,

4149
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:35,690
none of them have jobs and calling West
Virginia and he shakes his picks is,

4150
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:37,290
hey a girl,

4151
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,011
dude,

4152
01:51:38,011 --> 01:51:39,060
that's no joke either.

4153
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:39,953
That's real.

4154
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,250
It's apparently with family.

4155
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:43,770
West Virginia is another one of those
places where it's not so hard to get

4156
01:51:43,771 --> 01:51:44,670
prescription medicine.

4157
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:45,401
You know,

4158
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:47,130
like Florida apparently is the easiest,

4159
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:47,990
you know,

4160
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:50,730
that's Florida's like they have
those pain management centers,

4161
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:51,331
but these,

4162
01:51:51,331 --> 01:51:51,780
uh,

4163
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:53,300
West Virginia folks there,

4164
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:53,660
you know,

4165
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:56,580
don't fucking drive down in Florida
too and big get bags and bags of pills.

4166
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:56,881
I mean,

4167
01:51:56,881 --> 01:52:00,240
these are all the whole family are
smoking weed and snorting pills.

4168
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,380
They're snorting pills.

4169
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:03,090
This chick chick to shit out a kid.

4170
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:03,630
Okay.

4171
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:04,530
The kid is in the hospital,

4172
01:52:04,531 --> 01:52:05,131
she's in the hospital,

4173
01:52:05,131 --> 01:52:05,701
better pussies,

4174
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:09,270
all sewn up with stitches
and she's snorting pills on
the side with her fucking

4175
01:52:09,271 --> 01:52:11,010
friend called,

4176
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:12,750
I need to turn my life around.

4177
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:15,720
And so the child protective
services take the baby.

4178
01:52:15,721 --> 01:52:18,210
She's smoking cigarettes outside
right after having a kid,

4179
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:18,661
you know,

4180
01:52:18,661 --> 01:52:20,060
she smoked during the entire pregnancy.

4181
01:52:20,061 --> 01:52:21,030
She taking her pills,

4182
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:24,450
she did everything is okay.

4183
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,381
So you know,

4184
01:52:25,381 --> 01:52:26,820
she has to turn her life around.

4185
01:52:26,821 --> 01:52:27,780
She goes into Rehab.

4186
01:52:27,781 --> 01:52:28,800
It's gripping shit,

4187
01:52:28,801 --> 01:52:29,101
man.

4188
01:52:29,101 --> 01:52:31,290
Really getting is so crazy.

4189
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:31,950
It,

4190
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:32,191
yeah,

4191
01:52:32,191 --> 01:52:32,791
it's amazing.

4192
01:52:32,791 --> 01:52:36,590
All of them are on disability to remember
that the father got 'em all into each

4193
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,670
abilities that they don't have to work.

4194
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:39,691
It's amazing,

4195
01:52:39,691 --> 01:52:40,000
man.

4196
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,690
I remember when she's
got pills and she's like,

4197
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:44,970
I just bought these pills for eight.

4198
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,040
I'm taking them

4199
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,290
up the road on what's
selling for $10 each.

4200
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:50,360
That's called hustle bustle.

4201
01:52:50,361 --> 01:52:51,720
And Russell like,

4202
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,160
what the fuck are we doing?

4203
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:53,601
The country?

4204
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:54,650
That's how we do it.

4205
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:59,480
We make $16 fucking crazy shit,

4206
01:52:59,481 --> 01:52:59,781
man.

4207
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:00,650
And then Hank Williams,

4208
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:03,040
a third would just appear out
of nowhere and start playing and

4209
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:05,220
oh,

4210
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:05,721
it was great.

4211
01:53:05,721 --> 01:53:06,554
He's friends with them.

4212
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:07,280
Wow.

4213
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:07,491
Yeah,

4214
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:07,851
dude,

4215
01:53:07,851 --> 01:53:08,550
it's amazing.

4216
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:09,470
They asked the mom,

4217
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:09,761
they're like,

4218
01:53:09,761 --> 01:53:09,911
what?

4219
01:53:09,911 --> 01:53:10,051
What?

4220
01:53:10,051 --> 01:53:10,281
What do,

4221
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:12,020
what do you want to happen when you die?

4222
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:12,591
Oh,

4223
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:14,180
when you come to my funeral,

4224
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:15,381
blow pot,

4225
01:53:15,381 --> 01:53:16,730
smoke in the face,

4226
01:53:16,731 --> 01:53:19,730
and Snopes snort pills off my head.

4227
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,260
But first on that comment on Youtube,

4228
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:25,243
but first,

4229
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:27,170
I forget what her exact quote is.

4230
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,273
Imagine,

4231
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:32,420
can you imagine snorting fucking
oxycontin off of a corpse head?

4232
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:35,810
She had this incredible
quote to something like,

4233
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:37,000
I don't,

4234
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:37,520
you know,

4235
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,630
at the end of it she was like,

4236
01:53:38,631 --> 01:53:38,811
oh,

4237
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:39,860
it all my people bullshit.

4238
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:41,600
But at least they know
who the fuck we are.

4239
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,830
Like this bitch is crazy.

4240
01:53:45,831 --> 01:53:46,880
She has committed,

4241
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:49,070
they do tattoos in the middle
of their fucking kitchen.

4242
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:52,350
They were in a trailer and they're
tattooing each other tattoo.

4243
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:54,620
Not exactly sure how to spell shit.

4244
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:55,703
Yeah,

4245
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:56,810
it's amazing.

4246
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:59,710
Prison Tattoo Gun and then Jessica.

4247
01:53:59,711 --> 01:53:59,841
Oh,

4248
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:01,640
the fucking the dancing outlaw.

4249
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,180
Yeah.

4250
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:03,080
Holy Shit.

4251
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:06,710
Presley Manson is on his back.

4252
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:11,890
That was Presley in Charles Manson
tattooed on his back and he dances any

4253
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:14,504
dances.

4254
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,790
What a fucking awesome documentary.

4255
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:18,020
So good.

4256
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:18,830
You haven't seen yet,

4257
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:19,190
Brian?

4258
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:19,760
No.

4259
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,330
Oh my God.

4260
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:21,870
You've got to get on Netflix.

4261
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:22,310
Yeah,

4262
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:22,541
yeah,

4263
01:54:22,541 --> 01:54:22,890
yeah,

4264
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:23,090
yeah.

4265
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,810
It's Netflix.

4266
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:24,660
It's Johnny Knoxville.

4267
01:54:24,661 --> 01:54:25,520
His company made it.

4268
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:26,030
Oh really?

4269
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:26,211
Yeah,

4270
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:26,720
he's companies.

4271
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,580
I guess it's a,

4272
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,270
I remember seeing that
at the beginning of a,

4273
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:30,590
cause it all sounded familiar.

4274
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,550
It was the beginning of Jack.

4275
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:32,720
I said a preview for that now.

4276
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:33,650
Fuck Dude.

4277
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,450
How did I know it was amazing.

4278
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:36,530
It was amazing.

4279
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:37,730
Credible.

4280
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:38,720
Completely believable.

4281
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:40,071
Fuck yeah.

4282
01:54:40,071 --> 01:54:40,641
It's real,

4283
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:41,001
man.

4284
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:42,680
They're crying and shit and there's,

4285
01:54:42,681 --> 01:54:43,514
everything's fine.

4286
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:44,151
Yeah,

4287
01:54:44,151 --> 01:54:44,691
I don't think so,

4288
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:44,931
man.

4289
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:47,840
They followed these people around for a
year and this is all the shit that got.

4290
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,610
Can I please show you something?

4291
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,151
A video.

4292
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:51,290
Can I show you an Internet video?

4293
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,153
Totally.

4294
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,030
Maybe I will.

4295
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:54,711
I have a video.

4296
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:56,000
I don't need to show you guys a video,

4297
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:57,890
but I'm gonna talk about it
while I'm ducking looks for this.

4298
01:54:58,730 --> 01:54:59,720
When I was in Germany,

4299
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:04,750
there was a station that had a 24 hour
camera that was on the pilgrimage at

4300
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:06,674
Mecca.

4301
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,833
Cool.

4302
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:10,160
And for 24 hours a day,

4303
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:15,050
it just showed these people putting on
these white robes and moving around this

4304
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:15,531
square.

4305
01:55:15,531 --> 01:55:16,580
What does that square man,

4306
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:17,361
what is the deal with that?

4307
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:17,810
It's called,

4308
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:21,560
isn't it called the now that hodge now,

4309
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:25,250
that's the whole thing I think is called
the Hodgetts caught the Hodges like a

4310
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:26,084
pilgrimage.

4311
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,523
Pilgrimage.

4312
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,631
Well,

4313
01:55:29,631 --> 01:55:29,931
anyway,

4314
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:31,310
this thing is,

4315
01:55:31,311 --> 01:55:35,960
this does big box that's in the
center of the square and there's like,

4316
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,980
it's really beautiful,

4317
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:38,420
like incredible architecture.

4318
01:55:38,421 --> 01:55:38,571
I mean,

4319
01:55:38,571 --> 01:55:41,840
it's fucking amazing and
everyone's super well behaved,

4320
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:42,321
you know?

4321
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:44,130
There's no one getting
arguments or anything

4322
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,490
and they're all like in close proximity
to each other and they're touching each

4323
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:51,690
other and they're walking around in a
circle around this box 24 hours a day.

4324
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:56,220
I watched it for an hour and a half to
sit in there with my jaw open like wow,

4325
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,473
fuck.

4326
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:01,050
And it Dunkin had sent me
this video once of 'em,

4327
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:06,270
I sent him a video of a ants or we both
had seen it rather of ants in a death

4328
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:07,164
spiral,

4329
01:56:07,310 --> 01:56:07,890
maybe weed.

4330
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:08,780
What was the reason for it?

4331
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:11,910
Like the one of the Queen had died
and he tweeted it and it's this.

4332
01:56:11,911 --> 01:56:12,181
Yeah,

4333
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:12,361
no.

4334
01:56:12,361 --> 01:56:16,380
The reason is is because like ants follow
each other's trail and so basically

4335
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:20,130
they end up following a
trail and they're wrong.

4336
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:22,890
They're basically just end up going
in a circle following the same trail.

4337
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:23,933
How does that happen?

4338
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:26,200
Because I want to add fucks.

4339
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,980
It fucks up or the queen
fucks up or something.

4340
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,450
And so they followed it.

4341
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:34,020
So you get the entire nest of ants all
going in this circle that looks like this

4342
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:35,130
beautiful spiral.

4343
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,023
It's amazing.

4344
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:36,660
Yeah.

4345
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,920
And it's available online.

4346
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:41,560
It's called the the ant death
spiral spiral is what it's is.

4347
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:45,900
Cause they all just sent me this
video of them doing that at Mecca.

4348
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:47,550
It was like almost the exact same thing.

4349
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,091
Yeah,

4350
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:50,100
it looks exactly the same
except they don't die.

4351
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,691
But this,

4352
01:56:51,691 --> 01:56:52,230
this,

4353
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:53,940
this desire to go run in a circle.

4354
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:55,770
They're not just walking up
that thing and touching it.

4355
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,080
They're walking around it
and they're walking around.

4356
01:56:58,081 --> 01:56:59,340
It just covered in robes.

4357
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:01,800
I mean they're basically dressed like
they were dressed thousands of years ago.

4358
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:02,521
Well they're actually,

4359
01:57:02,521 --> 01:57:06,870
there was just a video on CNN if this
guy went there with like those with that,

4360
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,131
what is it called?

4361
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:11,910
The things edits had those
weird silver like disks.

4362
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:14,430
They used to record stuff
or like cone things.

4363
01:57:14,431 --> 01:57:15,264
I can't remember.

4364
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,631
Anyway,

4365
01:57:15,631 --> 01:57:20,550
it's like this thing from like a very
long time ago of Mecca with the recording

4366
01:57:20,551 --> 01:57:24,390
from back then showing like the city
around it and stuff and it was just much

4367
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:27,750
more dilapidated and less built
up at the same fucking thing.

4368
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:28,021
Man.

4369
01:57:28,021 --> 01:57:30,720
All of them Muslims going around that.

4370
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:33,990
It's an an amazing that they've
committed to that for so long.

4371
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:34,651
I mean,

4372
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:36,060
that's a fascinating thing.

4373
01:57:36,061 --> 01:57:36,781
When I was watching that,

4374
01:57:36,781 --> 01:57:37,111
I was like,

4375
01:57:37,111 --> 01:57:37,680
if this,

4376
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,150
this is thousands of years old,

4377
01:57:39,151 --> 01:57:39,570
right?

4378
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:41,010
Islam is over a thousand years old,

4379
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:41,520
right?

4380
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,020
So 1500 1500 years old,

4381
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:43,610
something like that.

4382
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:44,131
I,

4383
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:44,371
you know,

4384
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:44,651
I don't,

4385
01:57:44,651 --> 01:57:45,060
I don't know,

4386
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,230
do it.

4387
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:45,720
Whatever it is,

4388
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:46,500
it's very old.

4389
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:47,333
Okay.

4390
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,720
If this had happened now,

4391
01:57:48,721 --> 01:57:49,800
if this was a new thing,

4392
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,440
if we were watching a new thing and there
was a channel on television that was

4393
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:56,010
dedicated 24 hours to these new people
that wear robes and walk around in a

4394
01:57:56,011 --> 01:57:59,970
circle where there's a sacred box cause
they have to come to from all over the

4395
01:57:59,971 --> 01:58:03,450
fucking world and they just spend hours
and hours walk around the circle to this

4396
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:03,870
box,

4397
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:06,390
we would shut that fucking
thing down so quick.

4398
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:10,500
There would be armed fucking men outside
with tanks and jet's ready to drop

4399
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:10,861
bombs.

4400
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:11,280
It'd be like,

4401
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,780
what the fuck is in the box?

4402
01:58:12,781 --> 01:58:13,614
You freaks.

4403
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:15,840
What do you got a time
machine in their stupid,

4404
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:16,650
what the fuck you,

4405
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:19,430
you're dressing like you dressed a
thousand years ago and you're touching the

4406
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,010
box.

4407
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,320
Is this fucking thing going to take
you back to a thousand years ago?

4408
01:58:22,321 --> 01:58:24,120
Tell me why you dressed like a prey to it.

4409
01:58:24,121 --> 01:58:28,110
Don't forget that they bow
to it constantly and they
always know where it is.

4410
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:28,321
Yup.

4411
01:58:28,321 --> 01:58:29,154
And they touch it,

4412
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:29,731
they move around,

4413
01:58:29,731 --> 01:58:32,250
they want to touch it and people like
pile through and eventually get to the

4414
01:58:32,251 --> 01:58:33,120
center and touch it.

4415
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,210
They're all touching it,

4416
01:58:34,211 --> 01:58:36,150
a whole around it and around
the people touching it.

4417
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:39,750
It's just layer upon layer upon
layer upon layer of people.

4418
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:40,890
Thousands and thousands.

4419
01:58:40,891 --> 01:58:43,870
I don't know how many thousands just
moving around in a circle milling around

4420
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:44,470
this thing.

4421
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,303
It's um,

4422
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,181
it's really,

4423
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:46,450
it's,

4424
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,070
it's really easy to go to it,

4425
01:58:48,071 --> 01:58:48,191
man.

4426
01:58:48,191 --> 01:58:50,440
I'd like to see which
is fascinating that how,

4427
01:58:50,441 --> 01:58:51,580
this is what I wanted to bring up.

4428
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:52,810
Like how does that happen?

4429
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:53,890
How does a meme,

4430
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:57,640
how does an idea become so
powerful that all of these people,

4431
01:58:57,641 --> 01:58:59,680
like a billion of them all over the world?

4432
01:58:59,681 --> 01:58:59,861
I mean,

4433
01:58:59,861 --> 01:59:00,850
what is the numbers of Islam?

4434
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:01,331
Is it a billion?

4435
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:01,840
Something like that?

4436
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,321
I have no idea.

4437
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:02,921
Probably at least,

4438
01:59:02,921 --> 01:59:03,240
right?

4439
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:03,580
Yeah,

4440
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,140
I dunno.

4441
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:04,820
But I mean,

4442
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:05,531
let's say it's not,

4443
01:59:05,531 --> 01:59:06,100
whatever it is,

4444
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:11,020
giant numbers of humans all around the
world all follow this one pattern and

4445
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:14,410
they really do all want to make this
pilgrimage to Mecca and they really do say

4446
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:18,850
it's an incredible spiritual awakening
like the symbolizes so much to them that

4447
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:22,360
even if it's a placebo effect going
there and being in the presence of this

4448
01:59:22,361 --> 01:59:24,520
thing and touching it and being
around all these people that are like,

4449
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:25,031
oh my God,

4450
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:25,864
I'm at Mecca,

4451
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,680
we're at Meca today.

4452
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:30,400
And it forces everyone to be wholly
forces everyone to try to like follow the

4453
01:59:30,401 --> 01:59:33,090
tenants of this religion and really
believe in the love that this,

4454
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:34,690
this group brings everybody together.

4455
01:59:34,691 --> 01:59:35,524
This is,

4456
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:37,900
their religion is so much more power
than it full than anybody else's.

4457
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:39,910
Nobody else is willing to
make that sort of commitment.

4458
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:41,570
So because of this intense bond,

4459
01:59:41,571 --> 01:59:42,940
this intense commitment they have,

4460
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:44,900
this is one of the things that
makes them the most dangerous job.

4461
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:46,420
They pray three times a day.

4462
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:47,171
I don't know.

4463
01:59:47,171 --> 01:59:49,660
I don't know how many times
I pray whatever happened
to that kid that everyone

4464
01:59:49,661 --> 01:59:50,860
thought was like this born again.

4465
01:59:50,861 --> 01:59:51,251
God,

4466
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:53,020
they just like lived next to a tree,

4467
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:53,501
remember?

4468
01:59:53,501 --> 01:59:54,250
And they were like,

4469
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:59,250
he would just sit there quiet quietly
for days and night eat and everyone was

4470
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:01,130
living in a tree that was in India.

4471
02:00:01,131 --> 02:00:01,421
I wasn't,

4472
02:00:01,421 --> 02:00:01,661
yeah,

4473
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:03,230
I remember having a kid
is in the United Indian,

4474
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:04,270
I don't know where,

4475
02:00:04,271 --> 02:00:05,050
I think it was India.

4476
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:05,441
Yeah,

4477
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:06,400
I don't know for sure,

4478
02:00:06,401 --> 02:00:07,780
but I remember that I was crazy.

4479
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:08,920
And then he went up into the woods,

4480
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:12,340
he's getting all this attention and he
said he needed to go where it's quieter

4481
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:15,670
because he was trying to like do
some intense thing and he was even,

4482
02:00:15,671 --> 02:00:16,090
see,

4483
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:17,560
I don't remember the exact words he said,

4484
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:18,394
but he's like,

4485
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,420
I am not Buddha,

4486
02:00:19,421 --> 02:00:20,610
but I am the uh,

4487
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:23,050
some sort of incarnation of the something,

4488
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:23,501
something.

4489
02:00:23,501 --> 02:00:24,560
It was really weird,

4490
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:25,330
creepy.

4491
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:26,560
And then he just kind of disappeared.

4492
02:00:26,561 --> 02:00:29,020
Maybe it was just crazy kid in India.

4493
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,970
Maybe he's just over
there eating mushrooms,

4494
02:00:30,971 --> 02:00:31,810
talking shit,

4495
02:00:31,811 --> 02:00:32,770
living in the woods.

4496
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:34,990
And then when people come around
to interview and he just touched,

4497
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:36,191
he's so high,

4498
02:00:36,191 --> 02:00:37,024
he doesn't even know what he's saying.

4499
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,533
He's talking about.

4500
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,030
He's the incarnation of the Buddha.

4501
02:00:40,031 --> 02:00:42,580
And the [inaudible] sent me some shit.

4502
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:46,990
Awesome fucking professor
in college and he got me,

4503
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:49,180
he basically talked me
into going to India.

4504
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:51,190
I went to India for several
weeks because of him.

4505
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,060
Wow.

4506
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:54,640
Cause I took a course called
introduction to Southeast Asia of it.

4507
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:55,691
He said in India,

4508
02:00:55,691 --> 02:00:57,460
what happens is hundred,

4509
02:00:57,461 --> 02:00:58,211
200 years ago,

4510
02:00:58,211 --> 02:00:59,140
a holy man,

4511
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:00,520
someone,

4512
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:01,660
someone considers a guru,

4513
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:06,100
drops the glove or does some little
thing or eats and Mellon next to some

4514
02:01:06,101 --> 02:01:07,360
certain place and throws it down.

4515
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:07,801
And then it's followed.

4516
02:01:07,801 --> 02:01:08,230
Followers were like,

4517
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:08,411
oh,

4518
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:09,244
let's uh,

4519
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:10,203
let's uh,

4520
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:12,850
enshrine this place where
the seed from the Mellon,

4521
02:01:12,851 --> 02:01:13,720
our master rate is.

4522
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:16,210
And then at temple eventually
springs up around that.

4523
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:21,340
And so they've got NDAs just scattered
with like shrines and temples and all

4524
02:01:21,341 --> 02:01:24,520
these bizarre like
constructs that come from,

4525
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,881
you know,

4526
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:29,881
very specific events in the Zyl because
Hinduism isn't just like one religion,

4527
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,113
one religion.

4528
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:34,300
It's a fragmentation of
all these different ideas.

4529
02:01:34,301 --> 02:01:37,180
People who worship Braum and
people who worship Vishnu,

4530
02:01:37,181 --> 02:01:38,440
people who worship Shiva,

4531
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:40,400
people who worship Demigodz David,

4532
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:41,780
it's all kinds of shit.

4533
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:42,950
It's not one thing.

4534
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,900
It's like a fragmentation of a,

4535
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:45,590
of something.

4536
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,060
They make the coolest art dude.

4537
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,451
Yeah,

4538
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:47,990
you do.

4539
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:49,100
They're fucking Shiva.

4540
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:50,150
Like the Shiva that is,

4541
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:50,540
you know,

4542
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:54,290
someone explained to me that this is
supposed to be the god of cannabis,

4543
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:57,110
that this is supposed to be the got to
cannabis and see that little thing that

4544
02:01:57,111 --> 02:01:58,370
he's standing on the bottom.

4545
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:58,670
Yeah.

4546
02:01:58,670 --> 02:01:59,990
That's supposed to be ignorance.

4547
02:02:01,150 --> 02:02:01,510
Alright.

4548
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:02,080
Right.

4549
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,770
That's why he's got a
sack that he carries.

4550
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:04,600
That's his wheat.

4551
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:08,570
It's wheat and this is all represents
fire and he's standing over ignorance.

4552
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:10,370
You would think the backer dollar bill,

4553
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:11,990
you would think ignorance
would be way bigger.

4554
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:13,730
That's a little baby ignorance,

4555
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:14,470
I should say.

4556
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:15,590
Very optimistic.

4557
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:17,391
Speaking ignorance.

4558
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:18,051
Can I show you this?

4559
02:02:18,051 --> 02:02:18,191
Yeah.

4560
02:02:18,191 --> 02:02:18,561
Yeah.

4561
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:19,394
What is it?

4562
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:19,851
What is this?

4563
02:02:19,851 --> 02:02:20,001
What?

4564
02:02:20,001 --> 02:02:20,161
What?

4565
02:02:20,161 --> 02:02:20,360
What?

4566
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,193
Explain what we're watching.

4567
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,190
I'm not really sure.

4568
02:02:22,191 --> 02:02:24,290
It's some sort of patriotic musical.

4569
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:24,981
It's called,

4570
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:26,210
that's America to me.

4571
02:02:26,211 --> 02:02:27,350
Look it up on Youtube.

4572
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:27,890
Okay,

4573
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:28,723
so

4574
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,861
can you see it?

4575
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:31,130
Okay?

4576
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:31,963
Yeah.

4577
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,203
What

4578
02:02:47,670 --> 02:02:48,590
was going on,

4579
02:02:48,591 --> 02:02:49,424
dude.

4580
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,020
Mom and dad and Apple Pie.

4581
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:54,960
Baseball Games at pig Nixon.

4582
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:56,960
July is a real,

4583
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:58,791
oh my God.

4584
02:02:58,791 --> 02:03:02,840
You go see this guy by
the man sing the song.

4585
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:05,870
Looks like Don Frye fucked
the kid with down syndrome.

4586
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,490
Eh?

4587
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,500
Oh my goodness.

4588
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:17,120
That's America too.

4589
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:20,110
I want to talk to that
dude about the universe.

4590
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:22,640
Wow.

4591
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,473
Oh Man.

4592
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:24,773
Willie,

4593
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:25,773
Danny.

4594
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,440
Just to help her fellow man

4595
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:34,523
again,

4596
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:35,140
defensive,

4597
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:38,660
right not of gray to
give her all the time.

4598
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:41,061
Oh my God.

4599
02:03:41,061 --> 02:03:43,290
That through karate kicks this.

4600
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:45,980
This is the most insane thing
I've ever seen in my life.

4601
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:48,200
These people for the iTunes folks,

4602
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:48,801
I'm very sorry.

4603
02:03:48,801 --> 02:03:53,340
These people wearing stars and stripes
shirts and they're standing in front of a

4604
02:03:53,341 --> 02:03:54,081
big stars.

4605
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:55,760
He's tribes thing that says America

4606
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,180
saying,

4607
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:03,590
this is straight and sanity.

4608
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:04,281
It's insane.

4609
02:04:04,281 --> 02:04:05,270
I've never seen anything like it.

4610
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,640
These people probably can't
wait for this song to answer.

4611
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:09,050
They can just go fuck each other.

4612
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:13,250
I bet they just snort math and fuck the
shit out of each other and then they get

4613
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:14,084
mad.

4614
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:15,500
They're so repressed.

4615
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:16,581
Oh Jesus.

4616
02:04:16,581 --> 02:04:17,540
I can't believe I did that.

4617
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:18,290
Jesus.

4618
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:18,940
Why?

4619
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,850
We'll have the devil tell me,

4620
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:19,931
well,

4621
02:04:19,931 --> 02:04:22,310
this is the last time
he was the last time,

4622
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:25,100
and then they just meet
with the same thing bad.

4623
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,660
Did he just get brain surgery?

4624
02:04:26,661 --> 02:04:27,860
It's like get each other pregnant.

4625
02:04:27,861 --> 02:04:28,520
Shit,

4626
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:29,353
loads of each other.

4627
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,600
Make new retards.

4628
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:37,410
This is all what we're talking about,

4629
02:04:37,411 --> 02:04:37,651
man.

4630
02:04:37,651 --> 02:04:38,910
This should happen to the Greeks,

4631
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:40,440
to the Romans.

4632
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,490
It happened to everybody.

4633
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:47,040
Eventually the fucking tribe gets watered
down to the point where there's so

4634
02:04:47,041 --> 02:04:50,130
many of these fuckheads that people want
to pay attention to them and even want

4635
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:51,930
to elect one of their own
to be the king of the world.

4636
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,080
You know people like that.

4637
02:04:54,081 --> 02:04:54,441
Look at that.

4638
02:04:54,441 --> 02:04:55,310
Look at the size of that audience,

4639
02:04:55,311 --> 02:04:55,431
man.

4640
02:04:55,431 --> 02:04:56,750
There were thousands of
people this last time.

4641
02:04:56,751 --> 02:04:58,400
You had a thousand people
for your fucking show.

4642
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,510
It's been a long time.

4643
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:02,370
This is ridiculous.

4644
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,640
Man,

4645
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,250
you need to work that church angle shit,

4646
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:05,900
a lot of money in that search son.

4647
02:05:05,901 --> 02:05:07,170
You don't even have to write good comedy.

4648
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:09,620
Just throws him Jesus in
there and hall and say,

4649
02:05:09,621 --> 02:05:09,951
Gosh,

4650
02:05:09,951 --> 02:05:10,371
and Golly,

4651
02:05:10,371 --> 02:05:11,570
and don't ever swear Baldwin.

4652
02:05:11,571 --> 02:05:12,404
That shit.

4653
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:14,780
Even like Terence
Mckenna and his lectures,

4654
02:05:14,781 --> 02:05:15,750
he could throw a lob,

4655
02:05:15,751 --> 02:05:16,790
some softballs

4656
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:21,350
or Deepak Chopra or anytime you
listen to any of those guys,

4657
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:26,930
you have to be a dummy
not to see the game.

4658
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,130
And if you're all crazy,

4659
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:28,881
that's America.

4660
02:05:28,881 --> 02:05:29,601
That's America,

4661
02:05:29,601 --> 02:05:30,770
raw rock gods,

4662
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:31,730
gun government.

4663
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:33,080
There's nothing wrong with God.

4664
02:05:33,081 --> 02:05:34,970
There's nothing wrong with government
and there's nothing wrong with having

4665
02:05:34,971 --> 02:05:35,301
guns,

4666
02:05:35,301 --> 02:05:38,120
but you get all three of them together
and they creates this weird fucking

4667
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:39,380
hybrid mentality.

4668
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:41,150
That's America.

4669
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:42,380
We don't have to think too much.

4670
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:45,710
You don't have to think about the fact
you're getting fucked by gangsters.

4671
02:05:46,970 --> 02:05:47,331
Yeah,

4672
02:05:47,331 --> 02:05:47,630
it's,

4673
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:48,290
it's,

4674
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:48,621
it's,

4675
02:05:48,621 --> 02:05:50,730
but it's that sets the sappiness.

4676
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:51,420
Yeah,

4677
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:51,850
it's not,

4678
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:55,640
it's not recognizing what the fuck is
really going on when everybody's all God,

4679
02:05:55,641 --> 02:05:56,451
guns and government.

4680
02:05:56,451 --> 02:05:57,920
Like that's all well and good.

4681
02:05:57,921 --> 02:06:01,940
If there was a real bad guy and if it
was a real situation where we didn't do

4682
02:06:01,941 --> 02:06:02,774
anything wrong,

4683
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:04,010
but when you're one,

4684
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:06,560
the countries run by fucking gangsters,

4685
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,750
when you just assume some
gangster shit is going down.

4686
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:13,220
Dick Cheney was the fucking CEO of
Halliburton before he gets into office,

4687
02:06:13,370 --> 02:06:15,590
gets into office is
basically one and Shit,

4688
02:06:15,591 --> 02:06:16,220
right?

4689
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:21,220
And all of a sudden how Britain gets
billion dollars of no bid contracts to fix

4690
02:06:21,621 --> 02:06:26,621
up Iraq because we just decided to drop
fucking bombs on them and he profits off

4691
02:06:26,721 --> 02:06:27,170
of it.

4692
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:30,140
He has Halliburton stock and
if that's black gangster,

4693
02:06:30,141 --> 02:06:32,120
what the fuck is nobody does anything.

4694
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:32,681
All right?

4695
02:06:32,681 --> 02:06:36,230
We say in my act he shot his friend
and his face and his friend apologize.

4696
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,050
That's as gangster as you get.

4697
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:39,290
That's gangster shit.

4698
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:40,550
That's an Al Capone Shit.

4699
02:06:40,730 --> 02:06:43,790
These fucking people started a war and
made money off it and everyone's like,

4700
02:06:45,310 --> 02:06:46,143
well,

4701
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:47,690
think about the idea of it.

4702
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,070
We got a problem.

4703
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:49,701
We're going to just,

4704
02:06:49,701 --> 02:06:49,851
it would,

4705
02:06:49,851 --> 02:06:51,530
if you know if Halliburton,

4706
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:52,100
first of all,

4707
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,530
there's something like $90
billion that's missing.

4708
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:56,870
You know there's like some insane
amount of money that's missing.

4709
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:58,820
I think about of Halliburton
was a one person.

4710
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:01,640
It was one person and
they stole $90 billion.

4711
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:05,690
You can't just do that to be
like where's the fucking money?

4712
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,760
But because it's a gigantic
corporation it's like,

4713
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:08,660
Oh what happened?

4714
02:07:08,661 --> 02:07:09,920
There's paperwork and who knows?

4715
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:11,270
We're going to see if we can find it.

4716
02:07:11,271 --> 02:07:12,290
It's probably around here somewhere.

4717
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,450
I mean that's,

4718
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:16,670
that's some fucking
straight gangster show.

4719
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:18,440
Like what I like is like,

4720
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:21,740
cause we can talk about it like this and
nothing's probably gonna happen to us.

4721
02:07:21,741 --> 02:07:23,990
Like no one's going to
get ICO will be okay.

4722
02:07:23,991 --> 02:07:27,560
But I like watching when someone
in Russia who she's no here,

4723
02:07:27,561 --> 02:07:31,370
when someone pokes the dragon and not
wearing tries to snap like that Wiki leaks

4724
02:07:31,371 --> 02:07:32,204
guy,

4725
02:07:32,450 --> 02:07:32,991
you know what I mean?

4726
02:07:32,991 --> 02:07:34,790
We're going to try to put
that rape charge on him.

4727
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,833
Rape charge

4728
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,910
and you watch him.

4729
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,870
He went,

4730
02:07:37,871 --> 02:07:41,230
cause I saw this awesome lecture with
him as he was just starting to to do it.

4731
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:44,470
And you got all this life and I'm and
this energy and he's like seemed like a

4732
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:44,741
hero.

4733
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:46,540
And then you cut to
like four months later.

4734
02:07:46,541 --> 02:07:47,650
He looks like a ghost.

4735
02:07:47,651 --> 02:07:48,580
He's tired.

4736
02:07:48,581 --> 02:07:52,810
He's like beat down because they're
just applying the CIA pressure.

4737
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:56,710
He can't be with a girl if he meets
a girl in the back of his head.

4738
02:07:56,711 --> 02:08:01,420
He's got to think it's this girl really
liked me or is this an operative who got

4739
02:08:01,421 --> 02:08:03,440
sent in to shit too?

4740
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,300
That's really cool.

4741
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:04,840
They did it.

4742
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:08,470
A rape charge on that guy that happened
to coincide with him releasing the

4743
02:08:08,471 --> 02:08:10,840
biggest military leak and
the United States history.

4744
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,120
They're so transparent.

4745
02:08:13,330 --> 02:08:14,650
That's like the most
transparent should ever,

4746
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:15,550
unless he's really raped.

4747
02:08:15,551 --> 02:08:16,300
Somebody was like,

4748
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,133
nobody believed me.

4749
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,430
They didn't have such a good guy.

4750
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:19,780
No,

4751
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:20,071
he,

4752
02:08:20,071 --> 02:08:20,531
I caught,

4753
02:08:20,531 --> 02:08:20,771
I mean,

4754
02:08:20,771 --> 02:08:21,190
come on,

4755
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:22,750
really fuck knows.

4756
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:23,800
I don't know the guy,

4757
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:26,800
but also they'd be weird if he was
like a really good guy in some ways.

4758
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:27,940
What a Douche bag in other ways.

4759
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:28,990
Well I,

4760
02:08:28,991 --> 02:08:30,340
I'm sure it's a possibility.

4761
02:08:30,341 --> 02:08:30,911
I don't know him.

4762
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:31,744
That's a problem.

4763
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:33,340
I think that the,

4764
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:37,240
there's a better chance that they're
trying to frame it much better to send a

4765
02:08:37,241 --> 02:08:39,580
pdf out that was encrypted or something,

4766
02:08:39,581 --> 02:08:40,300
something like that.

4767
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:43,630
And if he vanishes or something weird
atmosphere and then he's sending the

4768
02:08:43,631 --> 02:08:45,970
password out that I don't
think it would change much.

4769
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:46,841
I think people would go,

4770
02:08:46,841 --> 02:08:47,081
wow,

4771
02:08:47,081 --> 02:08:47,914
somebody killed him.

4772
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:50,480
Oh well what's Paula Abdul
doing that crazy bitch.

4773
02:08:50,481 --> 02:08:51,580
She's driving drunk again.

4774
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:52,330
Huh?

4775
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:53,960
People would find some abstraction.

4776
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:55,660
We don't do anything.

4777
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:57,010
We don't do anything.

4778
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,060
That's what's so fucking
weird about our [inaudible].

4779
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:03,790
We are going to do everything or anything
is if we change and the only way we

4780
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:07,000
are going to change as if the introduction
of new ideas gets to the people at

4781
02:09:07,001 --> 02:09:07,720
the top.

4782
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:10,540
If the people at the very top of the
food chain that are doing the most fucked

4783
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:13,450
up things in the world and we got
to get them to have a look at this,

4784
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:15,250
we've got to get them to
realize you're fucking,

4785
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:19,600
you're creating this gigantic volcano
of shit energy and it's not necessarily,

4786
02:09:19,601 --> 02:09:20,680
you don't have to do it this way.

4787
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,290
Everybody could figure out some way
to make this thing work a lot better.

4788
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:26,080
Just take this shit down.

4789
02:09:26,081 --> 02:09:27,010
We're going to turn the lights out.

4790
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:27,820
That's right.

4791
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:29,050
Can you about an hour and 20 minutes.

4792
02:09:29,051 --> 02:09:30,850
I'm gonna come back in and we're
going to have a conversation.

4793
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:31,991
He sound like,

4794
02:09:31,991 --> 02:09:33,400
what's his name from I dream of Jeannie.

4795
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:34,373
Duh Duh,

4796
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:35,130
Duh.

4797
02:09:35,130 --> 02:09:35,963
What's his name?

4798
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:37,103
Face captain.

4799
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:39,310
I have no idea what you're talking about.

4800
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:40,720
The lead and I dream of Jeannie.

4801
02:09:40,721 --> 02:09:41,710
What's that actor's name?

4802
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:44,140
Someone's got to know that he took,

4803
02:09:44,141 --> 02:09:47,560
but there's poorly thought
out theory theory of giving.

4804
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:48,473
Um,

4805
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:50,433
that's what he says.

4806
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:54,130
There's a joy bay hard interview with
him where she spray said that they should

4807
02:09:54,131 --> 02:09:55,190
give drugs to posters.

4808
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:56,963
He's the,

4809
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:57,971
I don't know,

4810
02:09:57,971 --> 02:09:59,140
I can't remember the name of it now.

4811
02:09:59,141 --> 02:09:59,411
He's like,

4812
02:09:59,411 --> 02:10:00,430
he was Jr.

4813
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:02,943
Who is that?

4814
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:04,930
There's a whole layer jr from Dallas,

4815
02:10:04,931 --> 02:10:05,620
right?

4816
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:06,550
The fuck is his name.

4817
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:08,080
I can't fucking remember now.

4818
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:08,861
He's an interesting dude.

4819
02:10:08,861 --> 02:10:10,090
He's got one of those greenhouses.

4820
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:11,073
He's off the grid.

4821
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:14,470
He's off the grid and then so joy bay
is interviewing him and it's a nice

4822
02:10:14,471 --> 02:10:16,180
interview and everything's going fine.

4823
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,230
Then she ambushes and like,

4824
02:10:17,231 --> 02:10:18,064
so I,

4825
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:19,930
I hear that you took LSD.

4826
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:22,360
What was that like for the quick flash?

4827
02:10:22,361 --> 02:10:23,081
He looks at her like,

4828
02:10:23,081 --> 02:10:23,980
you fucking bitch.

4829
02:10:23,981 --> 02:10:26,350
We are doing at normal interview
now you're trying to corner me.

4830
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,131
And he's like,

4831
02:10:27,131 --> 02:10:27,610
uh.

4832
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:27,971
He's like,

4833
02:10:27,971 --> 02:10:28,804
well,

4834
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,090
it took away my fear of death.

4835
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:31,840
Whoa.

4836
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,351
Yeah,

4837
02:10:32,351 --> 02:10:33,184
it was really cool.

4838
02:10:33,540 --> 02:10:34,010
He talked

4839
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,940
about politicians should have to take LSD.

4840
02:10:36,990 --> 02:10:40,180
What do you think that he definitely
knew that she was going to do that and he

4841
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:42,420
seemed so authentically surprise,

4842
02:10:42,421 --> 02:10:44,960
like you know the micro gesture
where for a second I was like,

4843
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:45,740
Oh,

4844
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:46,251
oh really?

4845
02:10:46,251 --> 02:10:46,880
You think so?

4846
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,391
Look it up.

4847
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:47,601
I mean,

4848
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:48,411
you can look it up right now.

4849
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:49,221
It's on youtube.

4850
02:10:49,221 --> 02:10:50,054
It's,

4851
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:53,250
what does the name Larry Hagman Ebay.

4852
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,811
Our interviews.

4853
02:10:53,811 --> 02:10:56,910
Larry Hagman LSD is like taking over man.

4854
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:58,130
She's doing all this crazy items.

4855
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:58,851
Did you see her?

4856
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:02,300
She walked off the set because
they had bill O'Reilly on the bill.

4857
02:11:02,301 --> 02:11:03,620
O'Reilly was talking nonsense.

4858
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:04,820
So she walked off the set.

4859
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:05,930
Okay.

4860
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:06,830
I heard about that.

4861
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,551
I didn't see it,

4862
02:11:07,551 --> 02:11:08,900
but I heard about that.

4863
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:09,793
It was pretty interesting.

4864
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:11,330
Was that with Whoopi Goldberg?

4865
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:11,541
Yeah.

4866
02:11:11,541 --> 02:11:12,380
They both walked off.

4867
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:14,060
They staged a protest.

4868
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:14,841
I said,

4869
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:15,381
enough.

4870
02:11:15,381 --> 02:11:16,490
We've had enough.

4871
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:18,050
Like they didn't know
what he was going to say.

4872
02:11:18,051 --> 02:11:19,970
They'd been planning that thing for days.

4873
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:20,870
Do you think they didn't know?

4874
02:11:20,871 --> 02:11:21,170
I mean,

4875
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:22,700
maybe they're just too
busy to pay attention.

4876
02:11:22,701 --> 02:11:24,280
Maybe it's so much shit going on.

4877
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:25,070
They don't have the time.

4878
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:26,350
We'll probably both on an arrow.

4879
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:28,930
Riley's going to get on there
and say it sounds in concern.

4880
02:11:28,931 --> 02:11:29,210
Yeah.

4881
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:29,361
Yeah.

4882
02:11:29,361 --> 02:11:32,720
He was lobbing some softballs at George
Bush was watching them interview George

4883
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:33,800
Bush and one of the things that he said,

4884
02:11:33,801 --> 02:11:33,921
you know,

4885
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:35,720
I had Barney frank on
and I called them all,

4886
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:37,190
I'll a liar and a coward

4887
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:41,630
like he's bragging to George
Bush that he called Barney Frank.

4888
02:11:41,631 --> 02:11:42,830
A Liar and a coward.

4889
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:43,880
Yeah.

4890
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:44,211
Bushes.

4891
02:11:44,211 --> 02:11:44,391
Like,

4892
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:44,661
wow,

4893
02:11:44,661 --> 02:11:47,510
you really showed them I
killed a million Iraqis.

4894
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:48,890
Yeah,

4895
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:49,820
million bitch.

4896
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:53,610
I publicly admitted to a war
crime and no one's going to do

4897
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:56,530
when they're in the uncommercial.

4898
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:57,520
He just leans over

4899
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:57,701
bill.

4900
02:11:57,701 --> 02:11:58,051
Bill Buck.

4901
02:11:58,051 --> 02:11:58,884
Marsha,

4902
02:11:59,290 --> 02:12:01,060
I killed a million motherfuckers.

4903
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:02,530
I don't want to hear your Faggot,

4904
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,031
faggot.

4905
02:12:04,031 --> 02:12:07,600
Talk about you told about gay
congressmen that he's a coward.

4906
02:12:07,601 --> 02:12:08,411
Shut the fuck up.

4907
02:12:08,411 --> 02:12:11,830
You big giant bitch at
big seven foot tall bitch.

4908
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:13,130
I made reverse around with

4909
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,121
you.

4910
02:12:16,121 --> 02:12:16,810
Really think okay.

4911
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:17,111
Okay.

4912
02:12:17,111 --> 02:12:17,710
You're a good guy.

4913
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:18,011
You're good.

4914
02:12:18,011 --> 02:12:18,844
Yeah you're a good guy.

4915
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:23,960
Cause imma grab above the knee grab that
are very sexual almost as long as they

4916
02:12:23,961 --> 02:12:25,780
ought to go too high they
can get away with it.

4917
02:12:25,870 --> 02:12:28,720
But basically this is sexual
triggers above your knee.

4918
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:30,640
You know a men will
grab your fucking knee.

4919
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:31,750
That's like you're,

4920
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:31,991
you're,

4921
02:12:31,991 --> 02:12:33,730
you're close to pulling
my dick out right there.

4922
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:37,440
What are you doing up at George Bush
is a knee grabbing motherfucker.

4923
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:39,790
Nobody knows how to intimidate the
shit out of him that he grabs me.

4924
02:12:39,791 --> 02:12:41,640
He's like we'll have you up at the groves.

4925
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:43,091
Bohemian Grove.

4926
02:12:43,091 --> 02:12:44,470
You think holy Shit.

4927
02:12:44,471 --> 02:12:45,490
You think it's real man.

4928
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,260
You'll see modeling

4929
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:49,921
crop circles,

4930
02:12:49,921 --> 02:12:50,754
Bro.

4931
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,170
Crop circles.

4932
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:56,430
That was so disappointing when they like
came out and showed how easy it was to

4933
02:12:56,431 --> 02:12:57,460
make those things what

4934
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:00,400
they did and really they
did in a lot of the designs,

4935
02:13:00,401 --> 02:13:02,560
but there's a lot of zines
that are very questionable.

4936
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:06,220
I would like to see how
they did it because some of
them are incredibly complex

4937
02:13:06,221 --> 02:13:06,371
there.

4938
02:13:06,371 --> 02:13:07,660
Fractals there,

4939
02:13:07,690 --> 02:13:10,870
they're amazingly precise and they're
huge and they appear so quickly.

4940
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,170
I'm not inclined to believe that all of
them they're done by the same people.

4941
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:17,320
I think it's very possible that some
of them had done is by some new crazy

4942
02:13:17,321 --> 02:13:20,010
technology that we have
maybe in satellite form.

4943
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:21,580
I mean think about a lot of them,

4944
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:24,070
you know appeared in the past
but they weren't not intricate.

4945
02:13:24,071 --> 02:13:24,491
Like there's a,

4946
02:13:24,491 --> 02:13:28,930
this is a thing about them from like the
16 hundreds I believe it might've even

4947
02:13:28,931 --> 02:13:30,640
been slightly earlier than that,

4948
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:34,140
but a drawing of a devil
do it with a sickle,

4949
02:13:34,141 --> 02:13:36,480
making a crop circle and a
lot of the crop circle people,

4950
02:13:36,481 --> 02:13:38,130
they look at that as evidence,

4951
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:40,770
but there was never anything
like they see today.

4952
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:45,360
Like there are far more complex like
the Mandelbaum Nemanda brought set the

4953
02:13:45,361 --> 02:13:46,110
fractal,

4954
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:46,321
you know,

4955
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:48,060
there's like this infinite
beautiful fractal.

4956
02:13:48,061 --> 02:13:51,600
When they figured it out mathematically
on a computer within like weeks,

4957
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:53,820
someone had drawn it in a crop circle.

4958
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:54,690
So it's like,

4959
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:55,501
to me it's like,

4960
02:13:55,501 --> 02:13:55,710
you know,

4961
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:56,010
there's an,

4962
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:56,230
oh,

4963
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:57,600
it's either alien saying,

4964
02:13:57,630 --> 02:13:58,291
oh you get it,

4965
02:13:58,291 --> 02:14:00,900
or it's some fucking really funny,

4966
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:01,291
you know,

4967
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:06,291
government scientists with this crazy
ability to transform matter or plants on

4968
02:14:07,081 --> 02:14:08,460
the ground with this laser beam,

4969
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:10,320
they can make a design in the wheat.

4970
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:13,470
I mean that's much more likely that
it's some sort of a weapon or not even a

4971
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:13,741
weapon.

4972
02:14:13,741 --> 02:14:17,070
Or maybe it was something
that was developed as they
were developing weapons and

4973
02:14:17,071 --> 02:14:17,460
then you,

4974
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:18,570
they realize that you could make,

4975
02:14:18,571 --> 02:14:20,550
it was such a powerful pulsating move.

4976
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:20,851
You know,

4977
02:14:20,851 --> 02:14:23,850
there's this beam that you can
make designs in the grass with it.

4978
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:24,001
I mean,

4979
02:14:24,001 --> 02:14:26,340
it's very possible you think about all
the shit that they have that we didn't

4980
02:14:26,341 --> 02:14:27,590
know about for the longest time.

4981
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,830
Stealth bombers and shit.

4982
02:14:28,831 --> 02:14:32,010
And who knows what the fuck they're
working on an area 51 they could have

4983
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:35,700
somebody at the top of the heap or it's
a local college and then all the art

4984
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:38,850
students at every year have to
do like three of them per class.

4985
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:40,530
And it's like this big school secret.

4986
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,150
Well those mother fuckers
deserve some money.

4987
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:43,890
They should be coming out
and bragging about it.

4988
02:14:43,891 --> 02:14:44,101
I mean,

4989
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:45,300
just the circle makers.

4990
02:14:45,301 --> 02:14:45,860
There's a guy,

4991
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:47,190
a bunch of guys called the circle maker,

4992
02:14:47,191 --> 02:14:48,300
[inaudible] dot org and they,

4993
02:14:48,301 --> 02:14:49,650
they've made a bunch of them
and they've shown they're,

4994
02:14:49,651 --> 02:14:50,191
they're pretty good.

4995
02:14:50,191 --> 02:14:50,670
I mean,

4996
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:51,000
no,

4997
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,960
no doubt about it.

4998
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:53,400
But the ones that are there,

4999
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:55,110
the other ones that people have now,

5000
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,760
this is all shit that I've read on
the Internet and watching documentary,

5001
02:14:57,770 --> 02:15:00,240
so I'm not exactly sure
if it's the same over.

5002
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,080
It's true rather,

5003
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:04,440
but what the way they describe
these stocks being bent,

5004
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:08,580
it's like they have these growth nodes
where it explodes like almost like it's

5005
02:15:08,581 --> 02:15:09,420
been microwaved,

5006
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:13,500
like it expands out from heat and then
blows up where it bends over and at these

5007
02:15:13,501 --> 02:15:15,690
exist all throughout these
patterns and those patterns,

5008
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:19,740
they don't really exist like that during
a just stomping them down with boards.

5009
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,341
So it may,

5010
02:15:20,341 --> 02:15:22,890
it may very well be that there's a bunch
of different ways that people have done

5011
02:15:22,891 --> 02:15:23,724
these things.

5012
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:27,150
The one thing I thought when I was trying
to believe in crop circles as well,

5013
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:31,530
if there was a super intelligent
thing sending signals through space,

5014
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:35,220
then maybe they'd figured out that
part of evolution is that whatever the

5015
02:15:35,221 --> 02:15:38,790
species was would learn to
plant crops or something.

5016
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:42,420
And so they're trying to
communicate through the food stamp,

5017
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:43,260
the food source.

5018
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,580
So that totally makes sense.

5019
02:15:44,581 --> 02:15:44,910
I mean that's,

5020
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:46,230
you're guaranteeing that
people are gonna see it,

5021
02:15:46,231 --> 02:15:48,930
especially if they can't really see us.

5022
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:53,130
What if their vision and their need for
vision is so entirely different than us,

5023
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:55,320
that they literally can't see us,

5024
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:57,510
but they know where
plants are and they're,

5025
02:15:57,511 --> 02:15:59,460
they're like not even in this dimension.

5026
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:01,740
And they're communicating
through some sort of a portal.

5027
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:05,220
And the way they can communicate through
this portal is by implanting these

5028
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:08,910
designs onto what they know is going
to be food because they know that,

5029
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:09,270
oh,

5030
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:12,660
we've received a certain signal from
this area that indicates that it's plant

5031
02:16:12,661 --> 02:16:13,940
life and uh,

5032
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:17,310
it's grown in large areas
that seem to be uniform,

5033
02:16:17,311 --> 02:16:19,650
which indicate that someone
is growing it on purpose.

5034
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:20,970
So it must be their food.

5035
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:23,160
So let's just leave designs in this food.

5036
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,510
That's it.

5037
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,310
That's it.

5038
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:25,951
It could be,

5039
02:16:25,951 --> 02:16:27,480
but it also could be some fucking dude.

5040
02:16:27,481 --> 02:16:28,314
Your boards,

5041
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,010
some of them are amazing

5042
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,490
though.

5043
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:32,500
I believe that some of them could be,

5044
02:16:32,610 --> 02:16:33,520
but some of them are for sure.

5045
02:16:33,521 --> 02:16:34,390
It's things like that though.

5046
02:16:34,391 --> 02:16:38,470
Like if you look at any artists doing
something and he didn't know an artist did

5047
02:16:38,471 --> 02:16:38,651
that,

5048
02:16:38,651 --> 02:16:42,100
like if you go out in the middle of a
pyramid and some artists worked on it,

5049
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:43,600
you know overnight with you know,

5050
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:45,050
making this masterpiece and you,

5051
02:16:45,051 --> 02:16:48,490
you just didn't think it would be like
anyone had access to this pyramid and you

5052
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:49,324
just saw it,

5053
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:50,081
you would probably think,

5054
02:16:50,081 --> 02:16:50,321
wow,

5055
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:51,310
how the fuck was this made,

5056
02:16:51,311 --> 02:16:51,880
you know?

5057
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:54,130
To me I look at a lot of these
things and to me it looks like,

5058
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:58,150
okay this is something like a bunch of
people plan the shit out and they just

5059
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:58,780
fucking,

5060
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:02,690
it's like graffiti almost and there's
towns that they're always found in there

5061
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:06,040
like poor towns that their only income
is people going to see these things.

5062
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:06,911
Stuff like that.

5063
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:07,091
Yeah.

5064
02:17:07,091 --> 02:17:07,811
Like in England,

5065
02:17:07,811 --> 02:17:08,311
the crop circle,

5066
02:17:08,311 --> 02:17:09,071
but it is a good point,

5067
02:17:09,071 --> 02:17:09,460
right?

5068
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:09,710
Yeah.

5069
02:17:09,710 --> 02:17:11,920
If you set up like roadside
signs and sell lemonade,

5070
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:12,970
you get a fucking minute,

5071
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,440
you'll clean it up.

5072
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:14,651
Yeah.

5073
02:17:14,651 --> 02:17:15,371
There's what that will mean.

5074
02:17:15,371 --> 02:17:17,980
That was an issue that I had about
the whole Ufo experience too.

5075
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:18,510
I'm like,

5076
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:18,621
the,

5077
02:17:18,621 --> 02:17:22,000
the problem I have with believing you
fos is that people are selling books and

5078
02:17:22,001 --> 02:17:25,210
people are making money and when you
start making money and you're an author,

5079
02:17:25,211 --> 02:17:26,440
like I was making fun of,

5080
02:17:26,441 --> 02:17:26,680
um,

5081
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:28,840
what's the guy's name
that wrote communion?

5082
02:17:28,841 --> 02:17:29,610
Whitley Strieber.

5083
02:17:29,610 --> 02:17:29,770
Yeah.

5084
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:30,840
He's like the premier guys.

5085
02:17:30,841 --> 02:17:31,720
He's been abducted by aliens.

5086
02:17:31,721 --> 02:17:34,510
Also happens to be a fucking
brilliant fiction writer.

5087
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,580
Wrote Wolfen you wrote that?

5088
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:40,180
The Werewolf Movie Wolfen which has
got one of the fucking coolest werewolf

5089
02:17:40,181 --> 02:17:41,014
movies ever.

5090
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,250
They weren't really werewolf.

5091
02:17:42,251 --> 02:17:46,360
They were just super intelligent wolves
and it was the fucking main star in that

5092
02:17:46,361 --> 02:17:47,110
movie.

5093
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:47,930
I haven't seen that.

5094
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:49,370
Goddamn that movies are good.

5095
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:51,850
I'm buying that shit on iTunes today.

5096
02:17:51,910 --> 02:17:52,320
Bitch.

5097
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,153
Too thin.

5098
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,280
They better have that.

5099
02:17:54,510 --> 02:17:55,241
I bet they don't,

5100
02:17:55,241 --> 02:17:55,570
man.

5101
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:55,781
You know,

5102
02:17:55,781 --> 02:17:57,770
iTunes is just getting the Beatles now,

5103
02:17:58,330 --> 02:17:59,163
finally.

5104
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:01,330
So all I remember that thing.

5105
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:02,320
What is the guy's name?

5106
02:18:02,321 --> 02:18:05,800
Who's the main star right around
when the howling came out,

5107
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:09,040
didn't it think it was even
a little bit Werewolf too?

5108
02:18:09,310 --> 02:18:10,143
That's my shit.

5109
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:13,400
That's another fucking subject
we'd beat to death on this podcast.

5110
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:16,240
Werewolves,

5111
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:16,751
Bro.

5112
02:18:16,751 --> 02:18:17,180
Where?

5113
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,013
Whoops.

5114
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:18,761
No,

5115
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:19,331
they don't have it.

5116
02:18:19,331 --> 02:18:19,691
Of course.

5117
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:22,120
Not fucking clowns go.

5118
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:23,470
Have you been checking Amazon lately?

5119
02:18:23,471 --> 02:18:26,860
I've noticed every time I buy a CD
now I just go to Amazon first because,

5120
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:27,280
uh,

5121
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:28,120
it's like iTunes.

5122
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:29,230
There was something that the other day,

5123
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:29,981
White Buffalo,

5124
02:18:29,981 --> 02:18:31,990
which is a local la
guy that's really good.

5125
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,410
I went on a iTunes,

5126
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:35,920
it was like 1299 then went on Amazon.

5127
02:18:35,921 --> 02:18:39,280
It was eight 99 and it was
Albert Finney thing to,

5128
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:39,790
Oh,

5129
02:18:39,790 --> 02:18:41,230
this is DVD 2002.

5130
02:18:41,231 --> 02:18:42,850
That's not when the movie came out pitch.

5131
02:18:42,910 --> 02:18:46,720
That's when the DVD was released to
Wolfen Whitley Strieber paperback.

5132
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:47,320
Wow.

5133
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:50,530
They can you still buy a VHS and credible.

5134
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:52,240
I wonder when the movie came out though.

5135
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:55,390
I know the DVD came out
in [inaudible] 81 bro.

5136
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,070
I was a freshman in high school.

5137
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:59,950
This movie was the shit to day one click.

5138
02:18:59,951 --> 02:19:00,784
Please

5139
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:03,213
give me that shit.

5140
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:06,110
He seen the,

5141
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:06,990
uh,

5142
02:19:06,990 --> 02:19:08,050
Amandil Bulb.

5143
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:13,200
If you seen the three d projections
I have of the Mandelbrot set fractal.

5144
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:14,681
Yeah.

5145
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:15,760
Fractals are insane.

5146
02:19:15,761 --> 02:19:17,230
The idea behind fractals is,

5147
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:17,921
I mean that's,

5148
02:19:17,921 --> 02:19:20,170
that's really probably
the fact of the universe.

5149
02:19:20,171 --> 02:19:23,380
The fabric of everything is that it is
infinitely small and infinitely large and

5150
02:19:23,381 --> 02:19:24,310
it goes to no end.

5151
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:27,380
That just keep going and going
and going and it never stops.

5152
02:19:27,381 --> 02:19:27,560
It's,

5153
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,010
there's never

5154
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,450
a smallest point ever.

5155
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:29,840
Right.

5156
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,550
I don't think we could
wrap our heads around that.

5157
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:32,031
You know,

5158
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:32,601
we think that,

5159
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:32,801
well,

5160
02:19:32,801 --> 02:19:33,800
there's should be,

5161
02:19:34,010 --> 02:19:34,371
you know,

5162
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:34,790
and you know,

5163
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:36,170
everything gets smaller and smaller.

5164
02:19:36,171 --> 02:19:36,291
Well,

5165
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:38,120
there has to be some infinite small point.

5166
02:19:38,121 --> 02:19:38,450
No,

5167
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:38,661
no,

5168
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:39,020
no.

5169
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:39,530
It just,

5170
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:41,510
it's almost like a line of code,

5171
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:44,620
like just goes into
another line like it is it,

5172
02:19:44,621 --> 02:19:45,890
that's how we are connected,

5173
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,300
like dimension to dimension.

5174
02:19:47,330 --> 02:19:49,940
It just gets infinitely small
and then expands out again.

5175
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:52,250
That's intense.

5176
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:53,511
You want to intense,

5177
02:19:53,511 --> 02:19:56,450
there's a big controversy right
now because a Obama's book,

5178
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:59,010
Obama has a kid's book and a,

5179
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:03,800
in this kid's book he fucking talks
about how great sitting bull is.

5180
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,020
Sitting bowl is.

5181
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:10,190
He says a medicine man who healed
broken hearts and broken promises.

5182
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:11,060
It's a fine,

5183
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:13,580
it is fine that we are different.

5184
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:14,871
The book,

5185
02:20:14,871 --> 02:20:17,810
who's royalties go to helping the children
falling or disabled service members

5186
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:22,460
also says that the Lakota chief spoke
out and led his people against many

5187
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:24,440
policies of the United States government.

5188
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:28,970
He is most famous for his stunning
victory in 1876 over lieutenant colonel

5189
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:32,600
George Armstrong cuts Custer in
the battle of little big horn.

5190
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:34,310
So basically he's got a fucking,

5191
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:39,400
he's the president of a nation and
he's praising a guy taking a side on,

5192
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:39,830
uh,

5193
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:40,131
you know,

5194
02:20:40,131 --> 02:20:40,341
the,

5195
02:20:40,341 --> 02:20:40,430
uh,

5196
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:43,640
native American that killed
a bunch of American citizens.

5197
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,050
Like what is that all about?

5198
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:46,250
That's a weird choice.

5199
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:49,010
Cause I understand that
you think that war is bad.

5200
02:20:49,011 --> 02:20:51,650
And I understand that you
think that imperialism and
everything that got us here

5201
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:53,180
and created earth are created,

5202
02:20:53,181 --> 02:20:53,410
uh,

5203
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:55,320
the America rather earth
it's been fulfilled,

5204
02:20:55,321 --> 02:20:56,580
was referring to this was raw.

5205
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:58,130
I understand that you
would think that that's,

5206
02:20:58,131 --> 02:20:58,964
you know,

5207
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:00,890
that it's a wrong thing that happened.

5208
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:01,850
It's terrible that happened.

5209
02:21:01,851 --> 02:21:04,700
But you know what a weird choice to to,

5210
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:05,150
you know,

5211
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:08,000
obviously that we won
and that's what happened.

5212
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,960
And that's why people are here.

5213
02:21:08,961 --> 02:21:09,860
And that's where the cities,

5214
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:11,000
so you're a part of this,

5215
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:11,570
that one.

5216
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:12,220
So you're,

5217
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:15,110
I guess what you're saying
is we want in a terrible way,

5218
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:16,430
and we took over the,

5219
02:21:16,431 --> 02:21:20,690
the Indians in a terrible way and thank
goodness that they got some licks in and

5220
02:21:20,691 --> 02:21:20,961
let's,

5221
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:22,610
let's give him props and you know,

5222
02:21:22,611 --> 02:21:25,880
you gig does kicked our ass a little bit
more and like bring them back into the

5223
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:26,631
fold and say like,

5224
02:21:26,631 --> 02:21:27,140
okay,

5225
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:31,160
well this is a man that had a lot of
value to his people and our people weren't

5226
02:21:31,161 --> 02:21:31,931
exactly fucked up,

5227
02:21:31,931 --> 02:21:35,450
but let's put bygones be bygones and
let's talk about what a bad ass this dude

5228
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:35,631
was.

5229
02:21:35,631 --> 02:21:35,781
I mean,

5230
02:21:35,781 --> 02:21:38,660
they had like bows and arrows
and they were fresh new divorces.

5231
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:39,320
You know what I mean?

5232
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:41,940
Like they only had horses flagging
a hundred years or so and they,

5233
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:44,000
they kicked ass on custard with his guns.

5234
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:44,271
You know,

5235
02:21:44,271 --> 02:21:45,590
I mean they had some guns back then too,

5236
02:21:45,591 --> 02:21:46,221
but you know,

5237
02:21:46,221 --> 02:21:46,421
they,

5238
02:21:46,421 --> 02:21:48,680
they fucking trapped
the American citizens.

5239
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:50,810
They fucking sucked him into a trap.

5240
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:51,790
Well,

5241
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:54,890
I could see out like a black
president would be dirty coal,

5242
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:56,900
but it's an interesting choice.

5243
02:21:56,901 --> 02:21:57,734
Right.

5244
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,910
Well I get it though,

5245
02:21:58,911 --> 02:21:59,361
cause it's like,

5246
02:21:59,361 --> 02:21:59,630
I mean,

5247
02:21:59,630 --> 02:22:03,130
it wasn't that long ago that the
United States government was like with

5248
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:05,390
enslaving his ancestors.

5249
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:08,630
So it totally makes sense
that you'd idolize it,

5250
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:09,650
but they don't ever say that.

5251
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:10,250
You know what I'm saying?

5252
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:13,430
Like he never comes out
and fully expresses himself
and he never comes out and

5253
02:22:13,431 --> 02:22:13,641
says,

5254
02:22:13,641 --> 02:22:15,470
this is what's important to me about this.

5255
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,320
I understand that this man
killed American citizens.

5256
02:22:18,321 --> 02:22:19,160
And I understand that,

5257
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:19,431
you know,

5258
02:22:19,431 --> 02:22:21,260
if it wasn't for battles like this,

5259
02:22:21,261 --> 02:22:24,140
we would still have problems with Indians
attacking us and we could never have

5260
02:22:24,141 --> 02:22:25,230
the same life that we have now.

5261
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:25,591
I mean,

5262
02:22:25,591 --> 02:22:28,080
somebody had to pave the
way supposedly to do this.

5263
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,700
I understand that he would say that,

5264
02:22:29,701 --> 02:22:30,840
but you've got to,

5265
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:31,351
you've got to,

5266
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:32,131
in my opinion,

5267
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:32,640
at least,

5268
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,810
you got to kind of explain where your
head's at with all this just right.

5269
02:22:35,890 --> 02:22:37,620
You can't just show tweet
and he's following you.

5270
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:38,521
Yeah.

5271
02:22:38,521 --> 02:22:39,510
But you can't just say,

5272
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:40,590
you know that he,

5273
02:22:40,591 --> 02:22:40,921
you know,

5274
02:22:40,921 --> 02:22:41,490
was a,

5275
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:45,900
he's most famous for his stunning victory
in 1876 which you got to say is we

5276
02:22:45,901 --> 02:22:49,470
have to get past all of this stuff
and recognize that even though,

5277
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:50,080
uh,

5278
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:54,690
America was evil or we did something
that we shouldn't have done or you know,

5279
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:55,010
we,

5280
02:22:55,010 --> 02:22:57,020
we took over their land and
fuck them over and written.

5281
02:22:57,021 --> 02:22:58,170
Let's all let that shit go.

5282
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:58,830
Okay.

5283
02:22:58,830 --> 02:22:59,640
What's not me?

5284
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:00,473
And it's not you.

5285
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:01,650
It's our ancestors.

5286
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:03,990
We have learned from this and
we are stronger because of this.

5287
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:06,810
But what people don't like
to hear is the Lakota,

5288
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:08,040
you know that name Lakota.

5289
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:09,930
That's what they call themselves.

5290
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:10,141
Well,

5291
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:11,820
you know what the Indians called them sue,

5292
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:13,620
because sue means enemy.

5293
02:23:14,130 --> 02:23:16,740
Cause the LAKOTAS would just
run around Jack and folks.

5294
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:17,341
Okay.

5295
02:23:17,341 --> 02:23:18,174
That's what they did.

5296
02:23:18,210 --> 02:23:19,710
Indians did the same thing that we did.

5297
02:23:19,711 --> 02:23:21,360
They just did it on shitty smaller scale.

5298
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:22,320
The Sun ritual,

5299
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:23,270
you know the sandwich,

5300
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:23,821
what's it called?

5301
02:23:23,821 --> 02:23:24,361
What's that car?

5302
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:25,031
There's not the Senate.

5303
02:23:25,031 --> 02:23:25,561
It's hard.

5304
02:23:25,561 --> 02:23:28,770
I'm like the fuck is that card
they put hooks in your chest from,

5305
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:29,640
was that movie?

5306
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:31,043
Um,

5307
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,370
the fucking,

5308
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:33,600
what's his name?

5309
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:33,991
God.

5310
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:34,680
Sundance.

5311
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,370
It's called the center.

5312
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:37,080
Like the Sundance festival is named after.

5313
02:23:37,081 --> 02:23:37,640
It was cause it really?

5314
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:37,891
Yeah,

5315
02:23:37,891 --> 02:23:39,300
the Sundance and what it is is,

5316
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:40,820
oh it was when you go,

5317
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:42,090
oh man called horse.

5318
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,391
Yeah,

5319
02:23:42,391 --> 02:23:43,230
man called horse.

5320
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,460
And it was an initiative,

5321
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:49,490
initiatory phase where they were to hang
themselves from trees or from something

5322
02:23:49,501 --> 02:23:52,650
with hooks through their chest and just
hang there where their skin kind of

5323
02:23:52,651 --> 02:23:53,484
being pulled out.

5324
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:54,660
What was the reason for that?

5325
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:57,180
I think it was a initiation thing,

5326
02:23:57,181 --> 02:23:57,510
I guess.

5327
02:23:57,510 --> 02:23:58,261
I have no idea.

5328
02:23:58,261 --> 02:23:59,440
I assume it's like something,

5329
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,450
there's something to that.

5330
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:02,160
I think there's something to initiations.

5331
02:24:02,161 --> 02:24:04,680
I think there's something to
grand events like this hodge,

5332
02:24:04,681 --> 02:24:06,210
like the pilgrimage to Mecca.

5333
02:24:06,211 --> 02:24:07,560
I think there is something to that man.

5334
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,170
And I think that might be one of the
reasons why people are fucked up cause we

5335
02:24:10,171 --> 02:24:12,090
don't have very clearly defined moments.

5336
02:24:12,091 --> 02:24:13,170
We have to get your shit together.

5337
02:24:13,171 --> 02:24:14,040
You are a man now.

5338
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:14,760
This is it.

5339
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,331
Move on.

5340
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:15,751
Bam.

5341
02:24:15,751 --> 02:24:15,931
You,

5342
02:24:15,931 --> 02:24:17,040
you know you hit the next stage.

5343
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,360
Let's acknowledge the fact all
together that we are evolving together.

5344
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:21,720
We have reached this new plateau.

5345
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:23,190
Father have gone to the mountain,

5346
02:24:23,191 --> 02:24:24,690
you know you're going to do some shit.

5347
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,010
Put your hands in the gloves,

5348
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:28,350
the hands and the gloves with the
bullet ants and get fucked up.

5349
02:24:28,590 --> 02:24:29,040
You know,

5350
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,450
get past your pain figures.

5351
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:32,580
I think that's what I said earlier man,

5352
02:24:32,581 --> 02:24:33,720
about the Greeks and the Romans.

5353
02:24:33,721 --> 02:24:35,370
I think people get soft as fuck.

5354
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:36,663
That's what's happening.

5355
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:38,280
You dirty,

5356
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:39,390
dirty bitches.

5357
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:40,291
Richard Harris,

5358
02:24:40,291 --> 02:24:41,160
a man called horse.

5359
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:46,310
Let me see while I one click that shit
son Love Amazon one click for movies.

5360
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:49,470
It's the most addictive thing of all time.

5361
02:24:49,770 --> 02:24:53,370
I had a professor who is really into
the Lakota and I asked fascinating,

5362
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:57,810
asked him if he'd have you ever done
a Sundance and he was like that is an

5363
02:24:57,811 --> 02:24:59,040
inappropriate question.

5364
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:00,600
What a bitch.

5365
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:01,433
Fuck you.

5366
02:25:01,590 --> 02:25:02,910
Informations inappropriate.

5367
02:25:02,911 --> 02:25:04,820
Maybe shouldn't be a fucking professor.

5368
02:25:05,590 --> 02:25:07,830
Kind of shocking to me that
you can't tell me if you,

5369
02:25:07,890 --> 02:25:12,240
if you'd done that or like I'm supposed
to know the etiquette of Villa Cota.

5370
02:25:12,450 --> 02:25:12,691
What a,

5371
02:25:12,691 --> 02:25:13,471
we gave me that.

5372
02:25:13,471 --> 02:25:14,490
I never learned that.

5373
02:25:14,491 --> 02:25:16,920
You're not supposed to ask
someone if they did a Sundance.

5374
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:17,761
What is that?

5375
02:25:17,761 --> 02:25:19,050
You're not supposed to ask?

5376
02:25:19,490 --> 02:25:20,930
He said that's an inappropriate,

5377
02:25:20,931 --> 02:25:22,800
that's educational dramas that,

5378
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:23,350
what's that?

5379
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,190
That's educational

5380
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:24,610
drama.

5381
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:25,241
That's drama.

5382
02:25:25,241 --> 02:25:26,020
You know what it was?

5383
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:28,360
He didn't have the stones for it
and he didn't want to admit it.

5384
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:29,313
That's what it is.

5385
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:32,890
He knows what he think
he was loke stir shit.

5386
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:33,490
Yeah.

5387
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:35,050
Well maybe he wants you
to think that he did it.

5388
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:37,220
Maybe he's like one of those dudes who
pretends as a black belt and really is

5389
02:25:37,221 --> 02:25:38,740
only taking karate a couple of times.

5390
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,990
My hands are be registered lethal weapons.

5391
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,220
You know?

5392
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:45,370
It might've been one of those things you
just didn't want to let you know that.

5393
02:25:45,371 --> 02:25:45,611
No,

5394
02:25:45,611 --> 02:25:46,540
of course I didn't do that.

5395
02:25:46,541 --> 02:25:47,440
That's for psychos.

5396
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:48,341
He wanted to let you think.

5397
02:25:48,341 --> 02:25:51,700
Maybe this Indian kinds of psycho made
me feel like a fucking asshole though,

5398
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:51,911
man.

5399
02:25:51,911 --> 02:25:52,301
I was like,

5400
02:25:52,301 --> 02:25:52,541
Oh,

5401
02:25:52,541 --> 02:25:53,740
why did I ask him about it?

5402
02:25:53,741 --> 02:25:55,450
Cause he's a douchebag
and he's a douchebag.

5403
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:55,871
Period.

5404
02:25:55,871 --> 02:25:56,890
If he didn't recognize that,

5405
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:59,860
if he honestly got offended
about something that you
were completely and utterly

5406
02:25:59,861 --> 02:26:00,694
ignorant about,

5407
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,800
that means that obviously he's a dummy.

5408
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:05,410
He's a either a dummy or a douchebag.

5409
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:06,340
You're take your pick.

5410
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,761
You know,

5411
02:26:06,761 --> 02:26:07,750
you can't recognize it.

5412
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:10,210
People don't recognize that this is a,

5413
02:26:10,211 --> 02:26:11,470
a nutty thing to talk about.

5414
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:12,580
You know,

5415
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:15,580
we don't recognize that it's
something sacred to you.

5416
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:18,610
W D fucking hooks through your
nipples and get suspended for the air.

5417
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:20,260
I can't ask you that
cause it's kind of silly.

5418
02:26:21,490 --> 02:26:22,210
All right.

5419
02:26:22,210 --> 02:26:23,043
Inappropriate.

5420
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,700
Inappropriate question.

5421
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,950
Why did you ask why?

5422
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:28,840
And I didn't feel like
she didn't walk away.

5423
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:30,940
That guy should be fired.

5424
02:26:31,410 --> 02:26:33,160
You put your clothes
back on and left in it.

5425
02:26:33,161 --> 02:26:34,770
You don't condition be
someone next to him going,

5426
02:26:34,790 --> 02:26:35,623
all right dude,

5427
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:36,670
chill the fuck out.

5428
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:37,630
Don't talk like that.

5429
02:26:37,631 --> 02:26:38,200
That's dump.

5430
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,340
You can go back to teaching in class,

5431
02:26:39,341 --> 02:26:40,180
but we have to let you know.

5432
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:41,620
This is real life rules.

5433
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:44,050
The ideal to ask a professor or anything?

5434
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:44,380
Sure.

5435
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:46,480
Especially I smoked weed
with him of my professors.

5436
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:47,200
Awesome.

5437
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,070
Right before class.

5438
02:26:48,071 --> 02:26:50,590
And he even had like
the fucking spray stuff.

5439
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:51,190
Uh,

5440
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:52,480
so you won't smell like weed.

5441
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:53,401
That's smart.

5442
02:26:53,401 --> 02:26:54,320
Smart professor.

5443
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:55,630
He took a chance with use on,

5444
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:59,920
there was that professor at my
college who is an anthropologist that,

5445
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:00,310
uh,

5446
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:01,810
study tech it out like mushrooms.

5447
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:02,290
Whoa.

5448
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:05,770
And he was a Fulbright scholar and
he said that missionaries came to,

5449
02:27:05,771 --> 02:27:06,820
I can't remember where it was,

5450
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:07,950
maybe it was South America,

5451
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:08,680
Mexico.

5452
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:12,940
They came to this place in Mexico with
all these new bibles that were translated

5453
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:13,810
into,

5454
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:14,853
um,

5455
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:19,750
that were translated into their language
and no one would touch the Bible's.

5456
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:22,600
Everyone's avoiding the bibles and
they wouldn't touch the bibles.

5457
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:23,530
And uh,

5458
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:23,780
they are,

5459
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:24,700
the missionaries were like,

5460
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:26,200
why aren't they touching these bible?

5461
02:27:26,201 --> 02:27:26,261
It's,

5462
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:26,801
the reason is,

5463
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:28,870
is because they had the,

5464
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:31,750
translated the Bible into the word of God,

5465
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:32,950
which translated,

5466
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:33,851
which was the,

5467
02:27:33,851 --> 02:27:34,031
uh,

5468
02:27:34,031 --> 02:27:34,960
these people's,

5469
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:35,650
uh,

5470
02:27:35,650 --> 02:27:36,850
name for mushrooms.

5471
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:40,150
The word of God was what they
called mushrooms in their language.

5472
02:27:40,151 --> 02:27:41,350
It translated into a word of God.

5473
02:27:41,351 --> 02:27:45,730
And so the reason they didn't want to
touch the bibles is because if they ate

5474
02:27:45,731 --> 02:27:46,211
mushrooms,

5475
02:27:46,211 --> 02:27:49,150
they couldn't have sex for like five days
before and you weren't supposed to eat

5476
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:52,660
meat and there was a purification process
and they were looking at the Bible's

5477
02:27:52,661 --> 02:27:52,840
thing.

5478
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:53,171
Oh No,

5479
02:27:53,171 --> 02:27:56,650
we can't do that because it means we have
to it like we haven't gone through the

5480
02:27:56,651 --> 02:27:58,600
steps that we do when we eat my shrimp.

5481
02:27:58,601 --> 02:28:00,490
So no sex for five days.

5482
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,960
I don't remember the specifics.

5483
02:28:02,010 --> 02:28:06,220
I think there was a purification they had
to go undergo before they tripped out.

5484
02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:06,611
Dude,

5485
02:28:06,611 --> 02:28:07,300
I think there's,

5486
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:09,220
there's place in this world for ritual.

5487
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:12,880
There's something that we get
some sort of comfort from ritual,

5488
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:13,420
you know,

5489
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,700
even if it's just a ritual of
going to Disneyland every year,

5490
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:17,020
there's something comforting about it.

5491
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:17,681
When I was a kid,

5492
02:28:17,681 --> 02:28:18,390
I used to think that,

5493
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:19,030
uh,

5494
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:19,391
you know,

5495
02:28:19,391 --> 02:28:20,201
holidays and shit,

5496
02:28:20,201 --> 02:28:20,830
we're fucked.

5497
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:21,231
The holidays,

5498
02:28:21,231 --> 02:28:22,190
he gives a fuck about Christmas.

5499
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,211
But it was a really,

5500
02:28:23,211 --> 02:28:25,220
mostly because my childhood
was kind of disappointing,

5501
02:28:25,580 --> 02:28:25,881
you know,

5502
02:28:25,881 --> 02:28:28,190
it wasn't because there's
something wrong with rituals.

5503
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:30,470
I was rebelling against
something that wasn't fun for me,

5504
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:30,930
you know,

5505
02:28:30,930 --> 02:28:31,281
not a,

5506
02:28:31,281 --> 02:28:33,560
not non fun environment growing up.

5507
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:34,700
But I think for,

5508
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:38,570
for most people like significations
like that where this is,

5509
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:40,220
you are a man now and you are,

5510
02:28:40,221 --> 02:28:40,491
you know,

5511
02:28:40,491 --> 02:28:41,450
you have reached a,

5512
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,560
a point of wisdom,

5513
02:28:42,561 --> 02:28:42,910
you know,

5514
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:43,210
where,

5515
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:45,710
especially when they would
actually have to work for it.

5516
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:47,000
Like say what you want about,

5517
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,210
you know,

5518
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:48,043
someone reaching,

5519
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:48,561
you know,

5520
02:28:48,561 --> 02:28:48,890
uh,

5521
02:28:48,890 --> 02:28:51,260
go into confirmation classes
to get confirmed as a,

5522
02:28:51,261 --> 02:28:51,561
you know,

5523
02:28:51,561 --> 02:28:54,040
a Christian or a Catholic
rather or you know,

5524
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:55,130
what you have to do to,

5525
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:55,550
you know,

5526
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:56,351
be a,

5527
02:28:56,351 --> 02:28:59,690
a man in the Jewish religion and read
the towel mud and all the shit that

5528
02:28:59,691 --> 02:29:00,680
already had to go through.

5529
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:02,450
That stuff makes them work.

5530
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:07,570
It makes them work towards something and
it makes them at least believed that at

5531
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:10,130
the end of the goal they
have created something.

5532
02:29:10,131 --> 02:29:12,080
There's something different now
they've accomplished something.

5533
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:13,400
They've passed into the next thing.

5534
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:14,450
There's probably room for that.

5535
02:29:14,451 --> 02:29:16,100
That might be why we're all fucking lost.

5536
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:16,731
You know,

5537
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:18,500
we don't have these like moments of,

5538
02:29:18,501 --> 02:29:19,311
of things happening.

5539
02:29:19,311 --> 02:29:22,160
So unless you do something
difficult and then learn from it.

5540
02:29:22,250 --> 02:29:22,551
I get,

5541
02:29:22,551 --> 02:29:23,480
I'll get any growth.

5542
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:23,901
You know,

5543
02:29:23,901 --> 02:29:26,420
you just get stagnant like
we're were designed shitty.

5544
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:26,901
Well,

5545
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:27,890
and now what about that?

5546
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:31,220
There's like an odd thing where you're
not allowed to design new rituals.

5547
02:29:31,221 --> 02:29:32,570
If you're going to go buy a ritual,

5548
02:29:32,571 --> 02:29:35,290
you have to go by the
Catholic ritual or wet,

5549
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:37,280
but why can't you come
up with a new ritual?

5550
02:29:37,281 --> 02:29:37,581
I can't.

5551
02:29:37,581 --> 02:29:40,280
You come up with some news
too dangerous because the,

5552
02:29:40,281 --> 02:29:44,330
the reason why people want to lead people
always is because they want money and

5553
02:29:44,331 --> 02:29:44,890
pussy.

5554
02:29:44,890 --> 02:29:45,200
All right?

5555
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,033
That's what it is.

5556
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:47,870
That's the copters ethic.

5557
02:29:47,871 --> 02:29:49,010
That's really what they're looking for.

5558
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,100
Conquer Atha.

5559
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:50,960
So you see like,

5560
02:29:50,961 --> 02:29:51,230
you know,

5561
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:51,681
Waco,

5562
02:29:51,681 --> 02:29:52,520
what happens in Waco,

5563
02:29:52,521 --> 02:29:53,540
dudes playing guitar,

5564
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:56,270
fucking everyone's wife and
he's got guns everywhere.

5565
02:29:56,390 --> 02:29:57,141
That's what happens.

5566
02:29:57,141 --> 02:29:58,250
That's the reality of,

5567
02:29:58,251 --> 02:29:59,300
of beginning religion.

5568
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:02,900
It's most of the time the people that
want true enlightenment don't want to

5569
02:30:02,901 --> 02:30:03,560
lead.

5570
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:05,210
They just want to find it all.

5571
02:30:05,270 --> 02:30:07,160
They want to be comfortable and happy.

5572
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,970
They went everywhere,

5573
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:09,140
but they don't want to be the man.

5574
02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:09,671
You know,

5575
02:30:09,671 --> 02:30:13,250
once you want to be the man and you're
fucking singing songs and you sit around

5576
02:30:13,251 --> 02:30:16,520
the campfire talking about how
we can create our own world shit,

5577
02:30:16,521 --> 02:30:17,354
man,

5578
02:30:17,430 --> 02:30:17,740
you're,

5579
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:19,160
you're thinking about pussy and money.

5580
02:30:19,161 --> 02:30:19,761
That's what you're doing,

5581
02:30:19,761 --> 02:30:20,270
dude.

5582
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:22,460
And it just confuses the fucking message.

5583
02:30:22,970 --> 02:30:23,540
Right?

5584
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:24,490
That's the fucking thing.

5585
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:25,400
That's a confusing thing.

5586
02:30:25,401 --> 02:30:27,800
I read this essay by um,

5587
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:28,611
fuck,

5588
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:29,300
what's his name?

5589
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:29,481
Uh,

5590
02:30:29,481 --> 02:30:30,800
Alistair Crowley.

5591
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:33,830
And he was talking about the
grail and he's like the thing,

5592
02:30:34,010 --> 02:30:35,660
that paradox of the grail,

5593
02:30:35,661 --> 02:30:37,820
which is like the thing that
gives you a terminal life,

5594
02:30:37,821 --> 02:30:42,821
but what he was talking
about enlightenment is
that the moment you get it,

5595
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:44,690
you can never enjoy it.

5596
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,130
You can't want it.

5597
02:30:46,131 --> 02:30:47,360
You can't write it.

5598
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:49,910
The wanting of the thing pushes it away.

5599
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:50,840
It only,

5600
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:55,490
and by the time you do receive all the
material benefits that it gives you,

5601
02:30:55,491 --> 02:30:57,380
it doesn't matter to you anymore anyway.

5602
02:30:57,410 --> 02:30:59,180
Don't you feel like that's
the same thing with comedy?

5603
02:30:59,370 --> 02:30:59,610
Yeah.

5604
02:30:59,610 --> 02:31:00,381
You think that is?

5605
02:31:00,381 --> 02:31:01,480
If you're looking for comedy,

5606
02:31:01,481 --> 02:31:02,680
if you're trying to make,

5607
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:03,523
get someone to laugh.

5608
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:06,080
It's a weird paradox where
it's not about the trying,

5609
02:31:06,081 --> 02:31:08,840
it's about just a tuning in
and letting it all happen.

5610
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:11,450
It's the same with
everything like that is,

5611
02:31:11,451 --> 02:31:12,800
that's the way to do life,

5612
02:31:12,801 --> 02:31:13,634
right?

5613
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:15,740
That's a way to do life outside the ego.

5614
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:16,880
That's the thing that I,

5615
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,800
everything as far as comedy goes,

5616
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:23,670
everything for me fucks up when I
start caring about it in the wrong way.

5617
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:23,951
Yeah.

5618
02:31:23,951 --> 02:31:25,890
And I thinking about it
under the wrong eyes,

5619
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:28,020
like trying to impress
people or trying to,

5620
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:28,321
you know,

5621
02:31:28,321 --> 02:31:29,011
make something.

5622
02:31:29,011 --> 02:31:29,340
It's,

5623
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:29,880
you know,

5624
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:34,560
it's not just an just it dishonest,

5625
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:34,771
you know,

5626
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:35,970
just launched is the best word.

5627
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:38,050
Not In tune.

5628
02:31:38,050 --> 02:31:38,910
It's not real.

5629
02:31:39,230 --> 02:31:39,590
You're just,

5630
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:39,841
you know,

5631
02:31:39,841 --> 02:31:40,651
and there's comics,

5632
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:42,960
there's like certain comic that a
friend of mine just work with recently.

5633
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:44,190
I don't want to mention any names,

5634
02:31:44,430 --> 02:31:45,390
but a buddy of mine,

5635
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:49,530
he middled for this guy and the
guy just ate shit every night.

5636
02:31:49,531 --> 02:31:52,560
And he was saying how embarrassing
it was that this guy is just,

5637
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:52,920
he's,

5638
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:55,290
his act just wasn't connecting.

5639
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:55,591
It was like,

5640
02:31:55,591 --> 02:31:56,670
it felt artificial,

5641
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:57,271
you know,

5642
02:31:57,271 --> 02:31:58,710
and that's what happens to some guys.

5643
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:01,950
They lose their connection with
whatever it is that allows you to create

5644
02:32:01,951 --> 02:32:05,220
creative things in the first place and
then all of sudden it becomes something,

5645
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:07,500
something fake and
something that you don't,

5646
02:32:07,501 --> 02:32:10,350
you don't know what it is and you're
using it because it's worked before,

5647
02:32:10,590 --> 02:32:11,610
but it's just like,

5648
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:12,300
you know,

5649
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:12,870
it's,

5650
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:15,780
it doesn't mean anything to you anymore
because you lost the fucking trail.

5651
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:18,280
There's the ants and the spot.

5652
02:32:18,370 --> 02:32:18,930
Yeah.

5653
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:20,380
You're in that fucking spiraling.

5654
02:32:20,381 --> 02:32:21,214
He can't get out.

5655
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:21,900
And you can,

5656
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:22,290
I mean,

5657
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:23,520
you can do that your whole life.

5658
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:25,250
If you don't get slapped back end.

5659
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:27,870
How do you slap someone
back and you can't write,

5660
02:32:27,871 --> 02:32:29,130
they have to slap themselves in.

5661
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:29,641
No,

5662
02:32:29,641 --> 02:32:31,200
I think you can slap somebody back in,

5663
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:32,034
but you've got to be,

5664
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:35,660
they have to really respect to you
and you have to want us change too.

5665
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:37,620
But it definitely can be done.

5666
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:38,970
And there's different versions of it,

5667
02:32:38,971 --> 02:32:39,804
but it's like,

5668
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:40,561
I mean,

5669
02:32:40,561 --> 02:32:41,394
that's what a free,

5670
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,080
ideally what a friend does.

5671
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:46,020
It seems to me that it's
all a mathematical pattern.

5672
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:49,380
It seems to me that from the time the
Greeks were around to the Romans and it

5673
02:32:49,381 --> 02:32:49,980
goes through,

5674
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:50,140
you know,

5675
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:53,070
the Egyptians and the Mayans and
every civilization does this.

5676
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:56,370
Every civilization gets to a point where
people are just soft and fucking stupid

5677
02:32:56,371 --> 02:32:57,690
and then shit hits the fan.

5678
02:32:57,691 --> 02:32:58,051
Yeah,

5679
02:32:58,051 --> 02:32:58,501
that's it.

5680
02:32:58,501 --> 02:32:59,070
You know,

5681
02:32:59,070 --> 02:32:59,970
and it starts again.

5682
02:32:59,971 --> 02:33:00,960
And then we leave the,

5683
02:33:00,961 --> 02:33:01,301
the,

5684
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:05,670
the rotting husks of the society left
behind us as we a new one somewhere else.

5685
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:08,760
What a great way to end the podcast.

5686
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:10,180
This is,

5687
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:10,770
by the way,

5688
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,161
folks,

5689
02:33:11,161 --> 02:33:15,210
this is all nonsense and
we are in no way scholars,

5690
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:17,130
but Dunkin's more educated than I.

5691
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:18,623
Uh,

5692
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:19,441
I,

5693
02:33:19,441 --> 02:33:19,621
uh,

5694
02:33:19,621 --> 02:33:20,011
yeah.

5695
02:33:20,011 --> 02:33:23,830
I only spent three years at Umass Boston
and only because I didn't want people

5696
02:33:23,831 --> 02:33:28,530
to think of when I was a loser and barely
paid attention and was getting D's in

5697
02:33:28,531 --> 02:33:30,210
my last year when I decided to stop going,

5698
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:32,280
I was literally completely board,

5699
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:33,900
had no idea what I was doing with my life.

5700
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:34,661
I was doing.

5701
02:33:34,661 --> 02:33:37,530
It was like doing martial arts tournaments
and I was doing this so that I could

5702
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:39,090
answer it to people and tell them,

5703
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:39,331
oh,

5704
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:40,290
I'm going to Umass.

5705
02:33:40,710 --> 02:33:41,640
But you read a lot.

5706
02:33:41,641 --> 02:33:41,911
I mean,

5707
02:33:41,911 --> 02:33:43,290
the whole thing,

5708
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:44,010
I mean,

5709
02:33:44,010 --> 02:33:44,821
if you're reading a lot,

5710
02:33:44,821 --> 02:33:48,660
that's all the shit that I was reading
when I was in college is nothing like the

5711
02:33:48,661 --> 02:33:49,650
shit that I'm reading now.

5712
02:33:49,651 --> 02:33:50,250
Much smaller.

5713
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:51,960
It's much more complex
and interesting now,

5714
02:33:51,990 --> 02:33:53,490
but that Shit's more available,

5715
02:33:53,550 --> 02:33:54,383

I'm in Ann Arbor,

5736
02:34:22,901 --> 02:34:23,710
Michigan.

5737
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:24,071
This,

5738
02:34:24,071 --> 02:34:24,580
um,

5739
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:25,413
Friday night,

5740
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:26,470
two shows,

5741
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:28,060
the 10 30 show is already sold out.

5742
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,560
Eight 30 shows almost sold out.

5743
02:34:29,561 --> 02:34:31,270
So if you want to know
those people right now,

5744
02:34:31,271 --> 02:34:32,104
there's thinking about going,

5745
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:33,170
you've got to dive on that shit.

5746
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:34,270
Yeah,

5747
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:34,740
absolutely.

5748
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:35,740
I'm in Denver,

5749
02:34:35,741 --> 02:34:38,020
I this weekend at the Denver comedy works.

5750
02:34:38,021 --> 02:34:39,370
Check it at Denver comedy works,

5751
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,710
one of the best fucking
clubs in the country.

5752
02:34:41,711 --> 02:34:44,410
And one of the reasons why I moved to
Colorado because I knew that called was

5753
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:44,950
there.

5754
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:46,430
They have a real comedy community there.

5755
02:34:46,431 --> 02:34:48,010
It's one of the reasons why
I decided to move there.

5756
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:52,090
But then some mountain lions
and baby's gotten my way.

5757
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:53,170
Oh No.

5758
02:34:53,171 --> 02:34:53,741
All good things,

5759
02:34:53,741 --> 02:34:54,230

5760
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:54,490
You know,

5761
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:55,323

5762
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:55,631
oh,

5763
02:34:55,631 --> 02:34:56,200
I'm sorry.

5764
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:56,960
I don't mean to keep doing,

5765
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:57,490
sorry.

5766
02:34:57,490 --> 02:35:00,250
I have a show at the Hollywood
forever cemetery tomorrow.

5767
02:35:00,251 --> 02:35:01,510

5770
02:35:04,990 --> 02:35:05,340

5771
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:06,520
because these are amazing.

5772
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,790
Do these comedy shows in a
cemetery shows in a cemetery.

5773
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,140
Explained to me what the fuck that is.

5774
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:13,000
It's in a masonic lodge in a cemetery.

5775
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:15,200
It cleaves the Pentagram
hanging from the ceiling.

5776
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:16,140
There's a huge,

5777
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:17,621
how have I not done?

5778
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:20,080
The shots were always on the road
when you're doing it again tomorrow.

5779
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:20,590
Can I do it?

5780
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:21,040
Yeah.

It's at the Hollywood forever cemetery.

5785
02:35:27,990 --> 02:35:28,823

favorite people on the planet.

5794
02:35:38,121 --> 02:35:38,300

5795
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:40,960
It's one of my all time
favorite podcast guests.

5796
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,410
Holla at your boy Brian

Red Ba.

5798
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:47,980
Check out my new ice tea video.

5799
02:35:47,981 --> 02:35:49,960
That ice tea actually retweeted.

5800
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:50,441
Really?

5801
02:35:50,441 --> 02:35:52,220
And it makes fun of his wife and uh,

5802
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:53,870
I can't believe we actually retweeted.

5803
02:35:54,210 --> 02:35:55,030
Really?

5804
02:35:55,030 --> 02:35:56,050
He must have a good sense of,

5805
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:56,471
he does.

5806
02:35:56,471 --> 02:35:56,920
He's like,

5807
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:57,860
he's like alcoholic.

5808
02:35:58,070 --> 02:35:58,903
Interesting

5809
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:02,800
Dude.

5810
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:03,880
I hope he doesn't smack you.

5811
02:36:03,881 --> 02:36:05,260
It doesn't pimp slap you when he sees you.

5812
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:06,160
She might,

5813
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:06,771
she might pimps,

5814
02:36:06,771 --> 02:36:08,020
loud baby bowl.

5815
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:08,943
Youtube it.

5816
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,000
She's got a big Ole ass,

5817
02:36:10,001 --> 02:36:10,600
Huh?

5818
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:11,190
Yes.

5819
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:13,900
What so was this model we
did for all the commercial?

5820
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:14,351
Oh yeah.

5821
02:36:14,351 --> 02:36:16,990
I saw the Freddy Lockhart and
girl and he was within the model.

5822
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:17,200
Yeah.

5823
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:17,890
My uh,

5824
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,430
um,

5825
02:36:18,430 --> 02:36:22,390
so that's it folks at Arbor comedy
showcase with Thompson Gora just Friday

5826
02:36:22,391 --> 02:36:22,960
nights.

5827
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:23,320
Um,

5828
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:26,110
and then of course there's
a UFC and Detroit hollow.

5829
02:36:26,130 --> 02:36:27,430
I'm looking forward to seeing Detroit.

5830
02:36:27,431 --> 02:36:28,660
I feel like I'm going to Rome.

5831
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:31,690
I feel like I'm going to
the fucking apocalypse.

5832
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:35,260
I feel like I'm going to go into
the land of 33% unemployment rate.

5833
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:36,510
Fucking houses there.

5834
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:38,500
Bear problems right now in Detroit.

5835
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:39,251
Yeah,

5836
02:36:39,251 --> 02:36:39,911
I heard of that.

5837
02:36:39,911 --> 02:36:42,160
The errors are moving
back into the city row.

5838
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:42,690
That's,

5839
02:36:42,690 --> 02:36:47,690
that's how abandoned shit is getting
fascinating as our society moves towards

5840
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:48,664
2012.

5841
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:49,690
Thank you very much for tuning in.

5842
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:50,710
Love you bitches.

5843
02:36:50,710 --> 02:36:51,190
And uh,

5844
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:52,690
we'll probably going to
do another one this week.

5845
02:36:52,691 --> 02:36:54,010
We go away on Thursday,

5846
02:36:54,011 --> 02:36:54,221
but I'm,

5847
02:36:54,221 --> 02:36:55,054
I might do one tomorrow.

5848
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:55,860
How legible.

5849
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:56,693
See you later.

5850
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:28,423
I'm

5851
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:30,343

5852
02:37:37,590 --> 02:37:38,423

5853
02:37:46,490 --> 02:37:46,761
